Bremen start the match in what must be one of the worst strips ever seen on at a Premiership ground.<br><strong>2</strong> Arsenal start brightly through Bergkamp on the left. The move breaks down and possession is lost. Bremen are physically a large side, and score many goals from headers and corners.<br><strong>4</strong> Grimandi and Adams place themselves poorly for a long throw from Herzog. A corner results and Seaman is able to gather and clear.<br><strong>6</strong> Great link-up play between Vieira and Parlour through the middle on the break, but the Englishman's final ball to release Henry on the right side of the area is overhit. Goal kick.<br><strong>8</strong> Great determination from Vieira in midfield as he digs the ball out in the challenge with Dabrowski. His pace carries him away from two defenders and the ball is played through to Henry on the right. The angle is acute but his shot beats the keeper Rost and slips agonisingly wide of the far post.<br><strong>12</strong> Arsenal are winning the lion's share of the midfield tussles, but the Bremen defence looks to be holding steady as Bergkamp and Henry press for an opening. They look like a tough team to break down.<br><strong>15</strong> Henry does well to keep the ball in play on the right touchline after Vieira had intercepted Barten's pass and released his countryman down the flank with a floated through-ball. The cross deflects off Tjikuzu for a throw. Possession is wasted and Bremen clear again.<br><strong>18</strong> In possession on the right, Grimandi sees the Bremen defence pushing back but fails to see Adams peeling away at the far post. His shot is always curling away from the far post. Goal kick.<br><strong>20</strong> Arsenal sustain the pressure through a cross from Grimandi that is just too high for Adams hovering over the penalty spot. The visitors clear deep into the Arsenal half.<br><strong>21 GOAL Arsenal 1 - 0 Werder Bremen</strong> After winning the ball by the left touchline deep in his own half, Vieira looks up once and plays a 70-yard ball for Henry to run on to. The French international needs two touches to control it before rolling it past Rost's outstretched left foot and into the net. A cool finish cements a great start for the home side.<br><strong>24</strong> Arsenal continue to press their advantage through pressuring the man on the ball. Vieira is playing like a man possessed and the Bremen defenders look uneasy when confronted with Henry's pace.<br><strong>28</strong> Parlour and Henry scrap for the ball on the right side of the visitors' area. Parlour almost manages to squeeze the ball through to Bergkamp, but Baumann manages to hoof the ball clear.<br><strong>30</strong> Vieira (who else?) swings the play out wide to Henry, who traps the ball on his chest by the left touchline and then simply kicks it past the right-back Eilts into the area. His pace is more than enough to win the race to the ball, but the low cross is poor a one and easily intercepted.<br><strong>36</strong> Henry wins a corner from the left. Bergkamp hits the cross deep to the back post as Adams peels away from the penalty spot to meet the centre. The Arsenal skipper chests the ball down and strikes a volley at goal from an acute angle. His rising drive is powerfully struck and Rost does well to parry the ball out. A relieved Bremen clear.<br><strong>39</strong> Bremen have a corner on the left. Vieira heads away at the near post but the header lacks distance. Parlour slices his clearance away for another corner. This time Seaman comes and claims with confidence.<br><strong>40</strong> From the clearance Henry and Bergkamp link up on the left of the Bremen area. Bergkamp eventually threads a through-ball for Parlour. The midfielder gets to the ball before Rost but the keeper has done enough to prevent Parlour from hitting the target.<br><strong>44</strong> Henry gets past Tjikuzu on the left touchline. A sterner tackle from Eilts wins the corner from the left. Bergkamp takes and Rost punches away well.<br><strong>45</strong> Dixon has pushed up now from right-back to deliver a cross by the corner flag. The centre is blocked but Arsenal are looking to attack at every opportunity.<br><strong>46</strong> Half time.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Bremen restart and surrender possession immediately. The visitors were very disappointing in the first half and will be looking to impose themselves more in the remaining 45 minutes.<br><strong>48</strong> Henry uses his strength to force his way to the by-line on the right. His pull-back evades everyone and the German side can clear.<br><strong>49</strong> Bremen have a free kick from 35 yards out centre-left. Herzog starts his run-up in his own half and then manages to hit the two-man Arsenal wall.<br><strong>50</strong> Herzog again from the right touchline. His centre is plucked out of the air by Seaman and the clearance is seized on by Henry, this time force right by the double team of Baumann and Wiedener. Parlour assists but can only force the ball out of play.<br><strong>54</strong> The German side are looking ore lively as Weidener and Bode combine well to produce two good crosses. Seaman is finally able to gather and Arsenal can regroup.<br><strong>57</strong> Lee Dixon is fed by Grimandi as he storms through the middle. The Bremen defence backs off and he accepts in invitation to strike. The ball is deflected for a corner. Bergkamp takes from the right and Rost gathers well at his far post.<br><strong>60</strong> Dixon the provider from the right this time, and Baumann intercepts the centre well. Another corner from the right is taken by Grimandi. Rost palms the ball away.<br><strong>65</strong> Henry again, this time on the left. After forcing his way to the by-line the cross is over-hit and clears Bergkamp's head by three metres.<br><strong>66 Arsenal substitution:</strong> Kanu for Bergkamp; Overmars for Parlour. Arsenal will be looking to make the most of their advantage here to take a handsome lead to the return leg next week.<br><strong>69</strong> Adams intercepts Bode's pass and releases Henry down the right. His cross is too low and cut out before Kanu can pull the trigger.<br><strong>72</strong> Arsenal double the pressure on the visitors through Kanu, Overmars and Henry. The Nigerian international feeds Henry on the left edge of the Bremen area. Henry drives a low, powerful shot which Rost does well to block with his legs.<br><strong>75</strong> Bremen are really pushing for the away goal, leaving them looking under-represented at the back. If Arsenal can gain possession, the pace of Overmars and Henry could punish the German side for their adventurous spirit.<br><strong>77 GOAL Arsenal 2 - 0 Werder Bremen</strong> A serendipitous goal for the home side. Kanu tries a netbuster from 30 yards and scuffs his shot so badly that it mutates into a through ball for Ljundberg. Withstanding the challenge of Baumann and Wiedener, the Swede slips the ball past the right hand of Rost and into the bottom corner. Arsenal deserve this margin on the balance of play.<br><strong>78 Arsenal substitution:</strong> Suker for Henry.<br><strong>81</strong> Arsenal turn the screw.

Pakistan maintained their 33-Test unbeaten record at the venue, while off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was the pick of the visiting bowlers, taking four for 107 to finish with a Sri Lankan record of 26 wickets in the series.

Mr Aznar's Popular party took 183 seats in the 350-seat parliament while the main Socialist opposition dropped to 125, their worst showing since the early 1980s. The Socialist leader, Joaquin Almunia, resigned before the count had finished to take responsibility for the defeat. \"We have not been able to convince Spaniards with our project for the future; we have not been able to connect with their hopes and aspirations,\" he said. The results were a resounding endorsement for Mr Aznar's softly-softly approach to economic reform that has led to high growth and a job creation rate three times that of any other European country. The prime minister has also dispelled doubts that his party was a reincarnation of the old, autocratic right rather than a modernising centralist force. It is the first time that the conservative party has obtained a majority since Spain became a democracy following the death of the fascist dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975. Mr Almunia's attempts to rally the left through an electoral alliance with the Communist-led United Left appeared to have failed miserably. \"We have not been able to motivate leftwing voters, even though they are the majority in society,\" he said. \"That project remains for the future.\" Mr Almunia's claim that the government had practised \"crony capitalism\", enriching a few personal friends of the prime minister at the expense of the population as a whole, fell on deaf ears. Instead, voters heeded Mr Aznar's warning that the Socialist-Communist pact, modelled on France's government led by Lionel Jospin, would jeopardise Spain's economic success and reduce the country's chances of becoming a top European power. The polls had given Mr Aznar a slim lead of 4-5 percentage points. His supporters gathered outside the Popular party's headquarters in Madrid overjoyed that he would not have to rely on regional nationalists to form a government. \"Torero!

Souness doesn't score well on diplomacy either, whether towards players or the media. The latter doesn't necessarily make you a good manager, but it does at least buy you time before the pack turns on you. And turn they surely will, no matter how much of Jack Walker's crockery Souness destroys between now and his acrimonious departure.",

There will be a reduced workforce, but that workforce will be in rewarding jobs with security. \" Jon Moulton, Alchemy's managing partner \"Alchemy is a company with no track record. I find it difficult to believe that they have the finance in the medium and long term to keep this car plant open. Certainly, it would be impossible in my view for them to fund the design, development and introduction of new models. Therefore if these proposals are not changed, Longbridge has no future.\" TGWU representative Tony Woodley \"There is an air of uncertainty hanging over the workforce. We are back to square one again. Everybody in there is worried.\" Ali Khan, Longbridge worker \"There is a sense of inevitability about what has happened and there is a sense of being betrayed. A lot of people thought this would happen in the long run. We are here to support the workers if they want to come to us with their worries. There is anger among the workers at the way they are being told. They wanted to know what was happening before the press did.\" The Rev Peter Thomas, one of three chaplains at the plant \"Alchemy will have to demonstrate their commitment to the loyal workforce.

We see this abrogation of that agreement as a betrayal of the people's good faith and trust in the company. We are not about to stand around idly and let that happen.\" AEEU representative Duncan Simpson \"There was a clear understanding between the government, the workforce at Rover and BMW that the business strategy which was entered into accepted that break-even would not occur before 2002.

      "body": "<p>'If you've got a minute, read on,\" reads the myhome website, the new laundry and domestic cleaning service launched by Unilever on the internet this week. And while its purpose is to attract people who are short of time, myhome thinks the minutes you spend finding out what it can do for you will be worth it. Its big selling point is that more than ever before, time is more precious than money. </p> <p>The economy may be booming and wage levels rising but Britons still work the longest hours in Europe. The \"cash-rich, time-poor\" generation brings home bumper bonuses but never quite finds the time to spend them. Unilever, the soap and soup manufacturing group behind myhome, is gambling on today's solvent but stressed execs wanting to spend its surplus cash on freeing up a few more hours in the day. Via myhome, it finds someone else to do those nasty little time-consuming jobs everyone hates. </p> <p>Four million people work in domestic service, which is the UK's biggest growth industry, expanding faster even than new media companies. There are more cleaners, gardeners and nannies in the workforce than accountants. According to the office for national statistics, more people are employed in household help and childcare than in 1900, reversing the trend of slow decline over the first threequarters of the past century. Servants, it would appear, are back. </p> <p>\"Domestic staff are now seen as an essential rather than a luxury,\" says Katherine Shields, manager of Staff of Distinction, a London domestic help agency. \"There's a definite rise in people needing staff, but the type of people looking for staff is changing. It's not just the upper classes now.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, she says, clients are middle-class couples both of whom work. \"They need someone to do the chores they don't have time to do, like housekeeping, preparing the meals, running for the dry cleaning, and picking up the kids from school.\" </p> <p>The agency also supplies butlers, nannies and \"housekeeping couples\", where the wife is housekeeper/cook and the husband gardener-cum-chauffeur. However, if your time is money, so is theirs. A live-in housekeeper can expect \u00a3250 a week net, plus full board, including, perhaps, use of a car. A nanny in London is paid about \u00a3300 a week. </p> <p>For significant numbers of people, that sort of money is no longer an obstacle. Last year the Inland Revenue launched a helpline for people who employ household staff, such was the demand for advice on tax and national insurance from the new time-strapped employer class. </p> <p>Jonathan Wallace is one of those who claims to be able to \"buy people back time\". As client service director of Entrust, a concierge company in London which promises to organise away any problem thrown at it, he compares himself to a freelance PA. \"Because people are having to work very hard to earn their good money, it's important that they have assistance at hand,\" he says. \"Who wants to work silly hours all week and have to traipse all round 15 estate agents at the weekend? Why not get a home search agent to do it for you? People these days are earning good salaries and are prepared to pay a little extra to save time.\" </p> <p>A payment of \u00a3125 a month buys the personal attention of Wallace or one of his colleagues, and subscribers may phone him as many times a day as they like; no request is too much trouble. He has been asked to ship an entire wine cellar to Singapore, to organise a marquee for a wedding in Sri Lanka, and to lay his hands on a Winnie the Pooh bear in 20 minutes. </p> <p>\"People will ask us to find a dog-walker or a tailor-made travel agent, or perhaps they need tax and wealth advice. Obviously it's for a fee, but it cuts out the whole degree of hassle.\" </p> <p>The company's clients, he says, are \"reasonably wealthy, but very busy\" lawyers, accountants and people working in media or in the City. \"The trend is for people to put a monetary value against their free time,\" says Mike Godliman, director of Verdict, a retail analyst. \"We have an ageing population in this country. The number of people between 40 and 60 is increasing and their time is precious. The last thing you want when you have limited time is to spend it doing chores.\" </p> <p>He sees Unilever's diversification into the service industry as instructive at a time when we spend half our household income on services, compared to less than 30% in the 60s. \"The old distinctions between company roles are disappearing; supermarkets are becoming banks, fast food companies are going into hotels.\" </p> <p>The fuss over the spectacular ascent of internet companies, several of which have just unceremoniously kicked established companies such as Whitbread and Imperial Tobacco out of the FTSE 100 index, conceals the fact that most of the newcomers offer services rather than products. No wonder Unilever, Sainsbury's and the others want to invest too. </p> <p>\"Manufacturing companies are not the growth area,\" says Godliman. \"They are being overtaken by other companies that are usually service companies. More and more, people are diversifying into new areas.\" </p> <p>Having someone else do the dirty work means never having to face a big pile of ironing after a 10-hour day at the office. \"We are all interested in having a clean home and clothes without the hassle of either doing the task or worrying about how it is going to turn out,\" says Esra Erkal-Paler, of Lever Brothers, a Unilever subsidiary. \"We all just want to come in from work and relax in a brilliantly clean home, or open the wardrobe to a beautifully ironed shirt first thing in the morning. </p> <p>\"People want to achieve the end result without having to go through the hassle themselves, especially when they could be doing something more enjoyable.\" </p> <p>A multinational like Unilever clearly thinks it can make money by going into domestic service supply, rather than just making the soaps and chemicals used in the cleaning process. A \"Jif Homeclean\" of a three-bedroom flat costs \u00a361, while a quick rustle through my laundry bin, calculator in hand, turned up the slightly alarming estimate of \u00a360.55 for a \"Persil Service\" next-day wash and iron. So far, myhome only only operates in south west London but will be available in 88 areas all over the UK within 18 months. </p> <p>Britain's new employer class may be time-poor, but myhome will be banking on a significant enough number of them being cash-rich enough to use it. But for those whose wage slip bottom line isn't quite there yet, a bottle of Jif and a pair of Marigold rubber gloves cost about \u00a32.34 at the local supermarket.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'If you've got a minute, read on,\" reads the myhome website, the new laundry and domestic cleaning service launched by Unilever on the internet this week. And while its purpose is to attract people who are short of time, myhome thinks the minutes you spend finding out what it can do for you will be worth it. Its big selling point is that more than ever before, time is more precious than money. The economy may be booming and wage levels rising but Britons still work the longest hours in Europe. The \"cash-rich, time-poor\" generation brings home bumper bonuses but never quite finds the time to spend them. Unilever, the soap and soup manufacturing group behind myhome, is gambling on today's solvent but stressed execs wanting to spend its surplus cash on freeing up a few more hours in the day. Via myhome, it finds someone else to do those nasty little time-consuming jobs everyone hates. Four million people work in domestic service, which is the UK's biggest growth industry, expanding faster even than new media companies. There are more cleaners, gardeners and nannies in the workforce than accountants. According to the office for national statistics, more people are employed in household help and childcare than in 1900, reversing the trend of slow decline over the first threequarters of the past century. Servants, it would appear, are back. \"Domestic staff are now seen as an essential rather than a luxury,\" says Katherine Shields, manager of Staff of Distinction, a London domestic help agency. \"There's a definite rise in people needing staff, but the type of people looking for staff is changing. It's not just the upper classes now.\" Increasingly, she says, clients are middle-class couples both of whom work. \"They need someone to do the chores they don't have time to do, like housekeeping, preparing the meals, running for the dry cleaning, and picking up the kids from school.\" The agency also supplies butlers, nannies and \"housekeeping couples\", where the wife is housekeeper/cook and the husband gardener-cum-chauffeur. However, if your time is money, so is theirs. A live-in housekeeper can expect \u00a3250 a week net, plus full board, including, perhaps, use of a car. A nanny in London is paid about \u00a3300 a week. For significant numbers of people, that sort of money is no longer an obstacle. Last year the Inland Revenue launched a helpline for people who employ household staff, such was the demand for advice on tax and national insurance from the new time-strapped employer class. Jonathan Wallace is one of those who claims to be able to \"buy people back time\". As client service director of Entrust, a concierge company in London which promises to organise away any problem thrown at it, he compares himself to a freelance PA. \"Because people are having to work very hard to earn their good money, it's important that they have assistance at hand,\" he says. \"Who wants to work silly hours all week and have to traipse all round 15 estate agents at the weekend? Why not get a home search agent to do it for you? People these days are earning good salaries and are prepared to pay a little extra to save time.\" A payment of \u00a3125 a month buys the personal attention of Wallace or one of his colleagues, and subscribers may phone him as many times a day as they like; no request is too much trouble. He has been asked to ship an entire wine cellar to Singapore, to organise a marquee for a wedding in Sri Lanka, and to lay his hands on a Winnie the Pooh bear in 20 minutes. \"People will ask us to find a dog-walker or a tailor-made travel agent, or perhaps they need tax and wealth advice. Obviously it's for a fee, but it cuts out the whole degree of hassle.\" The company's clients, he says, are \"reasonably wealthy, but very busy\" lawyers, accountants and people working in media or in the City. \"The trend is for people to put a monetary value against their free time,\" says Mike Godliman, director of Verdict, a retail analyst. \"We have an ageing population in this country. The number of people between 40 and 60 is increasing and their time is precious. The last thing you want when you have limited time is to spend it doing chores.\" He sees Unilever's diversification into the service industry as instructive at a time when we spend half our household income on services, compared to less than 30% in the 60s. \"The old distinctions between company roles are disappearing; supermarkets are becoming banks, fast food companies are going into hotels.\" The fuss over the spectacular ascent of internet companies, several of which have just unceremoniously kicked established companies such as Whitbread and Imperial Tobacco out of the FTSE 100 index, conceals the fact that most of the newcomers offer services rather than products. No wonder Unilever, Sainsbury's and the others want to invest too. \"Manufacturing companies are not the growth area,\" says Godliman. \"They are being overtaken by other companies that are usually service companies. More and more, people are diversifying into new areas.\" Having someone else do the dirty work means never having to face a big pile of ironing after a 10-hour day at the office. \"We are all interested in having a clean home and clothes without the hassle of either doing the task or worrying about how it is going to turn out,\" says Esra Erkal-Paler, of Lever Brothers, a Unilever subsidiary. \"We all just want to come in from work and relax in a brilliantly clean home, or open the wardrobe to a beautifully ironed shirt first thing in the morning. \"People want to achieve the end result without having to go through the hassle themselves, especially when they could be doing something more enjoyable.\" A multinational like Unilever clearly thinks it can make money by going into domestic service supply, rather than just making the soaps and chemicals used in the cleaning process. A \"Jif Homeclean\" of a three-bedroom flat costs \u00a361, while a quick rustle through my laundry bin, calculator in hand, turned up the slightly alarming estimate of \u00a360.55 for a \"Persil Service\" next-day wash and iron. So far, myhome only only operates in south west London but will be available in 88 areas all over the UK within 18 months. Britain's new employer class may be time-poor, but myhome will be banking on a significant enough number of them being cash-rich enough to use it. But for those whose wage slip bottom line isn't quite there yet, a bottle of Jif and a pair of Marigold rubber gloves cost about \u00a32.34 at the local supermarket.",

      "byline": "Mark Atkinson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The 70s have returned to haunt us with a vengeance. First it was flares and disco, now the soaring price of oil is threatening a re-run of that decade's energy crisis. Then the spike in oil prices heralded the onset of a global recession. Some economists think the seeds of the next one have already been sown. Yet there are good reasons for believing the impact of dearer oil will not be anything like as damaging this time around. </p> <p>The first is that the real level of oil prices is not that high, after taking inflation into account. Now at around $30 a barrel, oil prices have tripled from the near record lows they were at a year ago and are higher than at any time since the Gulf war. But they are not that far off their long term average. Moreover, the price is likely to fall. </p> <p>Until now prices have been propped up by two things, First there is rising world demand as the global economy recovers from the slowdown associated with the financial crisis which swept markets in 1997 and 1998. Then there are cutbacks in production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). A one-year Opec supply cut agreed last March slashed about 4m barrels per day from its production. </p> <p>Although the global economy is likely to strengthen, oil production will almost certainly begin to rise soon. Opec is due to meet on March 27 to decide on output from then onwards. Under heavy pressure from the United States, where cheap petrol for vehicles is almost a constitutional right, Opec is widely expected to ease supply restrictions. Whether its increase in production will be enough to close the 2m-barrels-per-day gap between demand and supply remains uncertain. </p> <p>But even if it is not, there are grounds for optimism that the strength of the oil price will not end in economic disaster. </p> <p>Since the 70s, the industrialised economies have become much less dependent on oil. Energy conservation and industrial restructuring, which has shifted the emphasis away from heavy manufacturing towards services, means that oil is a less significant factor of production. America, for example, now burns only half as much oil per dollar of real GDP as it did back on the early 70s, according to the American economist Paul Krugman. \"So the odds are against a full-dress replay of the energy crisis.\" </p> <p>Even in those parts of the economy where high oil prices still have the potential to cause harm, there is less of a threat then before. Take manufacturing, for example. Figures published on Monday showed that the energy component of the UK's producer prices index is increasing at its fastest rate since 1974. In the past, firms would have simply raised their output prices to compensate, triggering the sort of wage/price spiral that did so much damage in the 70s. </p> <p>But increased global competition and the waning power of trade unions means that sort of knee-jerk response is no longer possible. Instead, manufacturers are having to take the hit on their profit margins and devise ways of becoming more efficient. As a vivid illustration of this point, UK output prices rose by just 0.1% in February.

      "bodyText": "The 70s have returned to haunt us with a vengeance. First it was flares and disco, now the soaring price of oil is threatening a re-run of that decade's energy crisis. Then the spike in oil prices heralded the onset of a global recession. Some economists think the seeds of the next one have already been sown. Yet there are good reasons for believing the impact of dearer oil will not be anything like as damaging this time around. The first is that the real level of oil prices is not that high, after taking inflation into account. Now at around $30 a barrel, oil prices have tripled from the near record lows they were at a year ago and are higher than at any time since the Gulf war. But they are not that far off their long term average. Moreover, the price is likely to fall. Until now prices have been propped up by two things, First there is rising world demand as the global economy recovers from the slowdown associated with the financial crisis which swept markets in 1997 and 1998. Then there are cutbacks in production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). A one-year Opec supply cut agreed last March slashed about 4m barrels per day from its production. Although the global economy is likely to strengthen, oil production will almost certainly begin to rise soon. Opec is due to meet on March 27 to decide on output from then onwards. Under heavy pressure from the United States, where cheap petrol for vehicles is almost a constitutional right, Opec is widely expected to ease supply restrictions. Whether its increase in production will be enough to close the 2m-barrels-per-day gap between demand and supply remains uncertain. But even if it is not, there are grounds for optimism that the strength of the oil price will not end in economic disaster. Since the 70s, the industrialised economies have become much less dependent on oil. Energy conservation and industrial restructuring, which has shifted the emphasis away from heavy manufacturing towards services, means that oil is a less significant factor of production. America, for example, now burns only half as much oil per dollar of real GDP as it did back on the early 70s, according to the American economist Paul Krugman. \"So the odds are against a full-dress replay of the energy crisis.\" Even in those parts of the economy where high oil prices still have the potential to cause harm, there is less of a threat then before. Take manufacturing, for example. Figures published on Monday showed that the energy component of the UK's producer prices index is increasing at its fastest rate since 1974. In the past, firms would have simply raised their output prices to compensate, triggering the sort of wage/price spiral that did so much damage in the 70s. But increased global competition and the waning power of trade unions means that sort of knee-jerk response is no longer possible. Instead, manufacturers are having to take the hit on their profit margins and devise ways of becoming more efficient. As a vivid illustration of this point, UK output prices rose by just 0.1% in February. Eventually, strengthening domestic and global demand might mean that manufacturers and retailers are able to pass on some of the cost increases they are experiencing as a result of the oil price surge. Such a development would not, however, go unnoticed by central banks, which are now much more vigilant than they were about inflation. At a meeting in Basle this week, the Group of 10 (G10) central banking committee, representing the most powerful central banks, signalled that the oil price was one of the main inflation danger signals that they were watching closely. \"There was a recognition that an excessive rise in oil prices is not in the interest of any part of the world economy,\" said Bank of England governor Eddie George, speaking as chairman of the committee. \"It is obviously not in the interests of oil-consuming countries because of the factor linked to inflation, and that would be a factor in a tightening of monetary policy at some point.\" His remarks made clear that the first hint of dearer oil passing along the price chain will almost certainly be met with a barrage of increments in interest rates, which are already on their way up.

      "trailText": "<p>Bill Woodrow's sculpture, the second of three projects for the empty \"fourth plinth\" in Trafalgar Square, was unveiled yesterday at noon. </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Bill Woodrow's sculpture, the second of three projects for the empty \"fourth plinth\" in Trafalgar Square, was unveiled yesterday at noon. </p> <p>A head rests on its side on the top of the plinth, as though sleeping. A big, closed book lies on top of the head. A tree grows atop the lot, its roots writhing over the head and book, growing down over the lip of the plinth, finding purchase on the vertical granite sides below. The tree is bare, its branches jagged and stormswept. The roots are gnarly and intestinal, grabbing the plinth like an octopus grasping its prey. Woodrow's Regardless of History is cast from bronze, just like all the other statues in the square. Unlike Mark Wallinger's Christ, which recently vacated the plinth, and which was disconcertingly life-sized, it shares the self-important scale of its surroundings. </p> <p>Wallinger's sculpture was both exceptionally simple and metaphorically rich - both a meditation on the real and the symbolic, and a mediation between the everyday and the allegorical. Woodrow also asks us to look at his sculpture in terms of its possible meanings and symbolism. Both Woodrow's bronze head and Wallinger's Christ have their eyes closed. There the similarities end. </p> <p>Woodrow, like Richard Deacon, Tony Cragg, Richard Wentworth and Antony Gormley, was one of the generation of new British sculptors who provided a bridge between the redoubtably modernist sculptors who preceded them (and taught them) and the YBAs. But lineage is deceptive, and Woodrow's career has appeared to run in reverse. </p> <p>He first came to public attention with witty manipulations of real objects - car doors, old sofas, filing cabinets and washing machines - which he tin-snipped, cut and folded into other objects. A washing machine transmogrified into a guitar; an old car door, an ironing board and a washing machine were cut and folded into a native American head-dress. Woodrow abandoned these witty recyclings in the late 80s. His recent work adopts the monumentality of the 19th-century heavy metal public bronze. </p> <p>However much it strains for potency and a shared symbolic language, Woodrow's work (like Anthony Caro's) has become irredeemably crass. Little remains of the genuine pleasure, lightness and inventiveness of what went before. I have tried not to write about Woodrow's work for 10 years, hoping that things would get better. </p> <p>But the sculpture for the plinth is a woefully inept kind of schoolboy symbolism. Woodrow's failure could not be more nakedly apparent than it is here in Trafalgar Square. He may want to speak in the plainest common language, but that doesn't mean he has to lose all his formal ingenuity. Yet he has. The modelling of the sleeping bronze head is unconvincingly generic and inarticulate. The book, with its dull red cover, seems to say \"weighty tome\". The tree (let's not forget that Giacometti made the most deliciously articulate, simple tree for the first production of Beckett's Godot) is a sort of cartoon - cue lightning flashes and sound- effects wolf howl. </p> <p>The whole effect is similar to a kids' movie. More than this, the sculpture is orientated so that the most essential part of it, the head, remains in shadow for most of the day. Surely sculpture is articulated by light, as well as mass and form. It's all wrong. The best thing about the sculpture is to imagine birds alighting on the branches, like the crows on the climbing frame in Hitchcock's The Birds. </p> <p>\"Regardless of History,\" says the caption fixed to the plinth, \"makes reference to the never-ending relationship between civilisation, knowledge and the forces of nature.\" History is a nightmare, in other words, and Woodrow's sculpture is trying to get a good night's sleep. </p> <p>Earlier this week Antony Gormley called for a debate about contemporary public sculpture in our cities. Regardless of History won't help; nor does it do anything but offer an awful warning. We should see this sculpture as not so much profound as profoundly mistaken - a saddening folly.</p>",

The tree is bare, its branches jagged and stormswept. The roots are gnarly and intestinal, grabbing the plinth like an octopus grasping its prey. Woodrow's Regardless of History is cast from bronze, just like all the other statues in the square. Unlike Mark Wallinger's Christ, which recently vacated the plinth, and which was disconcertingly life-sized, it shares the self-important scale of its surroundings. Wallinger's sculpture was both exceptionally simple and metaphorically rich - both a meditation on the real and the symbolic, and a mediation between the everyday and the allegorical. Woodrow also asks us to look at his sculpture in terms of its possible meanings and symbolism. Both Woodrow's bronze head and Wallinger's Christ have their eyes closed. There the similarities end. Woodrow, like Richard Deacon, Tony Cragg, Richard Wentworth and Antony Gormley, was one of the generation of new British sculptors who provided a bridge between the redoubtably modernist sculptors who preceded them (and taught them) and the YBAs. But lineage is deceptive, and Woodrow's career has appeared to run in reverse. He first came to public attention with witty manipulations of real objects - car doors, old sofas, filing cabinets and washing machines - which he tin-snipped, cut and folded into other objects. A washing machine transmogrified into a guitar; an old car door, an ironing board and a washing machine were cut and folded into a native American head-dress. Woodrow abandoned these witty recyclings in the late 80s. His recent work adopts the monumentality of the 19th-century heavy metal public bronze. However much it strains for potency and a shared symbolic language, Woodrow's work (like Anthony Caro's) has become irredeemably crass. Little remains of the genuine pleasure, lightness and inventiveness of what went before. I have tried not to write about Woodrow's work for 10 years, hoping that things would get better. But the sculpture for the plinth is a woefully inept kind of schoolboy symbolism. Woodrow's failure could not be more nakedly apparent than it is here in Trafalgar Square. He may want to speak in the plainest common language, but that doesn't mean he has to lose all his formal ingenuity. Yet he has. The modelling of the sleeping bronze head is unconvincingly generic and inarticulate. The book, with its dull red cover, seems to say \"weighty tome\". The tree (let's not forget that Giacometti made the most deliciously articulate, simple tree for the first production of Beckett's Godot) is a sort of cartoon - cue lightning flashes and sound- effects wolf howl. The whole effect is similar to a kids' movie. More than this, the sculpture is orientated so that the most essential part of it, the head, remains in shadow for most of the day. Surely sculpture is articulated by light, as well as mass and form. It's all wrong. The best thing about the sculpture is to imagine birds alighting on the branches, like the crows on the climbing frame in Hitchcock's The Birds. \"Regardless of History,\" says the caption fixed to the plinth, \"makes reference to the never-ending relationship between civilisation, knowledge and the forces of nature.\" History is a nightmare, in other words, and Woodrow's sculpture is trying to get a good night's sleep. Earlier this week Antony Gormley called for a debate about contemporary public sculpture in our cities. Regardless of History won't help; nor does it do anything but offer an awful warning. We should see this sculpture as not so much profound as profoundly mistaken - a saddening folly.",

      "bodyText": "Thursday March 16 2000 Why is \"Red Ken\" Livingstone red-faced? He is in trouble with the House of Commons, for failing to declare \u00a3158,000 of income on the register of MPs' interests. He is now required to apologise to the House for breaching its code of conduct - a public admission which could gravely damage his Mr Clean image, and his campaign to become the London mayor. If his income is undeclared, how did the Commons come to hear about it? It was the subject of a complaint to the parliamentary standards commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, who passed it on to the house select committee on standards and privileges. All very straightforward, except that the complainant, a Leicestershire postgraduate student, says he had nothing to do with it. Dirty tricks? Livingstone thinks so. But the provenance of the complaint has no bearing on the committee's finding that he did indeed fail to declare the small fortune he made from writing columns and through celebrity speaking engagements. And that means in turn that he breached the Commons code of conduct. What is the code of conduct? It was adopted by the Commons in July 1996, in the last year of a Conservative administration plagued by accusations of sleaze. It was intended to tighten the rules on registration of MPs' interests, which first came into effect in May 1974. What must be included on the register? Paid directorships, paid employment, membership of Lloyd's, consultancy work, sponsorship, gifts, hospitality and other benefits, overseas visits not paid for entirely by the MP or public funds, land and property other than the member's own home, substantial shareholdings. So Ken Livingstone didn't have to register his income from speaking engagements? Oh yes he did. In a catch-all clause, the register requires that: \"Any relevant interest, not falling within one of the above categories, which nevertheless falls within the definition of the main purpose of the register which is 'to provide information of any pecuniary interest or other material benefit which a member receives which might reasonably be thought by others to influence his or her actions, speeches, or votes in parliament, or actions taken in his or her capacity as a member of parliament,' or which the member considers might be thought by others to influence his or her actions in a similar manner, even though the member receives no financial benefit.\" Come again? In plainer English: \"it is a cardinal principle that members are responsible for making a full disclosure of their own interests in the register; and if they have relevant interests which do not fall clearly into one or other of the specified categories, they will nonetheless be expected to register them.\" How up to date is the register? The register of members' interests is published soon after the beginning of a new parliament, and regularly updated. It now includes a breakdown of the income pulled in by the industrious MP for Brent East. The latest internet version, curiously, is rather behind the times, being dated December 2, 1998.

The film translates this into several notorious scenes, including one where the gang <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/3111/aco_picaco6.jpg\" target=\"_new\">beat a tramp</a> for fun.

This giant culture deposit was thick with association. Here were bands that were the pop cultural equivalent of the pencil marks parents put inside the closet door to show how much Junior has grown since last year. Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Neil Young, and the early '70s folk rockers, many of them on the Asylum label started by the young David Geffen, oozing that peaceful, easy feeling that was my first pop love, and that I listened to in my bedroom, a sullen and mopey twelve-year-old with the lights out.</p> <p> Punk rock rescued me from the Dan Fogelbergian miasma of folk rock: Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, the Sex Pistols, then the Talking Heads, who made punk mainstream. Although I did not understand it at the time, the shift from California folk rock to British punk rock - from the \"fake\" mainstream California sound to the \"real\" British underground punk sound - was the decisive antithesis that would in one way or another determine all my subsequent pop musical experience. After Talking Heads came the bands like Duran Duran, the Cure, and the Cars, who marketed the \"authentic\" sound of punk into the \"fake\" New Wave and turned me off pop music in my early twenties. Then the big-hair bands of the '80s like Van Halen, Guns n' Roses, and the second coming of Aerosmith, which had kept me away from pop. And then Nirvana, the band that changed everything.</p> <p>Before Nirvana my cultural experience had followed a more-or-less stately progress up-hierarchy from commercial culture to elite culture. But after I heard Nirvana, at the age of thirty-one, the stream of culture as it flowed through me slowed, stopped, and started moving in the other direction. After Nirvana, I began to pursue pop music with an energy I had never devoted to it as a teenager, when I was too worried about how my adult life was going to turn out to pay that much attention to pop. Pop became a way of hanging on to my teenage self, which had become a kind of touchstone for me as an adult. I got into hip-hop, and then the subgenres of hip-hop, like gangsta, and then techno, and now I was into the rich ground between techno and hip-hop - acid, trance, jungle, big beat, ambient - which seemed to be where the future of pop music lay.</p> <p>As a kid I thought that becoming an adult would mean putting away pop music and moving on to classical, or at least intelligent jazz. Cultural hierarchy was the ladder climbed toward a grown-up identity. The day you found yourself putting on black tie and going to enjoy the opening night of Aida as a subscriber to the Metropolitan Opera was the day you crossed an invisible threshold into adulthood. But for the last five years, pop music had provided me with peaks of lyrical and musical transcendence that I long ago stopped feeling at the opera and the symphony, those moments when the music, the meaning, and the moment all flowed together and filled you with the \"oceanic feeling\" that Freud said characterizes powerful aesthetic experience.</p> <p>A month earlier I had had an oceanic experience at a Chemical Brothers' show that my friend had taken me to hear at the Roxy. The Chemical Brothers were two young musician/programmers from the dance/Ecstasy subculture of Manchester, England, who had begun by deejaying in the clubs that flourished in the dark satanic mills left over from the nineteenth-century industrial revolution, and that were now dark satanic malls of late-twentieth-century street style.</p> <p>We waited in a long line outside the Roxy for an hour, freezing, while scalpers in big down parkas cruised by murmuring \"whosellingticketswhosellingticketswhosellingtickets.\" As usual when we went gigging, we were just about the oldest people there. Going out to hear hot new pop acts was one of the greatest cultural pleasures of our grown-up lives. These intense moments of ectastic communion with youth stood out from our otherwise predictable diet of respectable culture - interesting plays, the Rothko show, the opera, and, sometimes, downtown happenings at the Kitchen or the Knitting Factory. Afterward, we would go home to our wives and kids and our tasteful diet of highbrow and middlebrow culture, but here in the oceanic present of pop music, we felt alive in a way we never felt when experiencing elite culture.</p> <p>Finally we got inside and worked our way down into the crush of kids on the dance floor. Most were trying to figure out the optimum time to drop the drugs they had brought along, so that they peaked when the music peaked. After a long time somebody walked out onto the darkened stage and a buzz rippled through the crowd. An evil-sounding pulse started to beat, pumping a black squishy liquid out of a computer and swirling it around the room. Then came a sampled sentence from a Blake Baxter song, repeated four times: dabrothersgonnaworkitout. </p> <p>With each set of four beats a new computer-modulated drum sound entered the mix, and on the last set a distorted-sounding guitar made an appearance.

      "bodyText": "Right inside the door of the Virgin Megastore was a vast section of popular music labelled Rock/Soul, which ran the gamut from the Eagles to Al Green to Pere Ubu, with vast stretches of irony, allusiveness, camp, and boring stuff in between. This giant culture deposit was thick with association. Here were bands that were the pop cultural equivalent of the pencil marks parents put inside the closet door to show how much Junior has grown since last year. Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Neil Young, and the early '70s folk rockers, many of them on the Asylum label started by the young David Geffen, oozing that peaceful, easy feeling that was my first pop love, and that I listened to in my bedroom, a sullen and mopey twelve-year-old with the lights out. Punk rock rescued me from the Dan Fogelbergian miasma of folk rock: Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, the Sex Pistols, then the Talking Heads, who made punk mainstream. Although I did not understand it at the time, the shift from California folk rock to British punk rock - from the \"fake\" mainstream California sound to the \"real\" British underground punk sound - was the decisive antithesis that would in one way or another determine all my subsequent pop musical experience. After Talking Heads came the bands like Duran Duran, the Cure, and the Cars, who marketed the \"authentic\" sound of punk into the \"fake\" New Wave and turned me off pop music in my early twenties. Then the big-hair bands of the '80s like Van Halen, Guns n' Roses, and the second coming of Aerosmith, which had kept me away from pop. And then Nirvana, the band that changed everything. Before Nirvana my cultural experience had followed a more-or-less stately progress up-hierarchy from commercial culture to elite culture. But after I heard Nirvana, at the age of thirty-one, the stream of culture as it flowed through me slowed, stopped, and started moving in the other direction. After Nirvana, I began to pursue pop music with an energy I had never devoted to it as a teenager, when I was too worried about how my adult life was going to turn out to pay that much attention to pop. Pop became a way of hanging on to my teenage self, which had become a kind of touchstone for me as an adult. I got into hip-hop, and then the subgenres of hip-hop, like gangsta, and then techno, and now I was into the rich ground between techno and hip-hop - acid, trance, jungle, big beat, ambient - which seemed to be where the future of pop music lay. As a kid I thought that becoming an adult would mean putting away pop music and moving on to classical, or at least intelligent jazz. Cultural hierarchy was the ladder climbed toward a grown-up identity. The day you found yourself putting on black tie and going to enjoy the opening night of Aida as a subscriber to the Metropolitan Opera was the day you crossed an invisible threshold into adulthood. But for the last five years, pop music had provided me with peaks of lyrical and musical transcendence that I long ago stopped feeling at the opera and the symphony, those moments when the music, the meaning, and the moment all flowed together and filled you with the \"oceanic feeling\" that Freud said characterizes powerful aesthetic experience. A month earlier I had had an oceanic experience at a Chemical Brothers' show that my friend had taken me to hear at the Roxy. The Chemical Brothers were two young musician/programmers from the dance/Ecstasy subculture of Manchester, England, who had begun by deejaying in the clubs that flourished in the dark satanic mills left over from the nineteenth-century industrial revolution, and that were now dark satanic malls of late-twentieth-century street style. We waited in a long line outside the Roxy for an hour, freezing, while scalpers in big down parkas cruised by murmuring \"whosellingticketswhosellingticketswhosellingtickets.\" As usual when we went gigging, we were just about the oldest people there. Going out to hear hot new pop acts was one of the greatest cultural pleasures of our grown-up lives. These intense moments of ectastic communion with youth stood out from our otherwise predictable diet of respectable culture - interesting plays, the Rothko show, the opera, and, sometimes, downtown happenings at the Kitchen or the Knitting Factory. Afterward, we would go home to our wives and kids and our tasteful diet of highbrow and middlebrow culture, but here in the oceanic present of pop music, we felt alive in a way we never felt when experiencing elite culture. Finally we got inside and worked our way down into the crush of kids on the dance floor. Most were trying to figure out the optimum time to drop the drugs they had brought along, so that they peaked when the music peaked. After a long time somebody walked out onto the darkened stage and a buzz rippled through the crowd. An evil-sounding pulse started to beat, pumping a black squishy liquid out of a computer and swirling it around the room. Then came a sampled sentence from a Blake Baxter song, repeated four times: dabrothersgonnaworkitout. With each set of four beats a new computer-modulated drum sound entered the mix, and on the last set a distorted-sounding guitar made an appearance. Because the music was made on synthesizers it had the geometric regularity of code, and this made it possible to feel intuitively where the lines of sound were headed and when they would converge. It was like reading a sonnet: you anticipated the shape of the form before the content arrived. Such a sonic convergence was coming up.

You got a bonus of two if you hit it into the net. Presumably Mr Hill-Wood hit the ball to some remote part of Lord's - or maybe the fielders got tangled up in the nets. \"Wisden\" called the idea \"clumsy\", and it was abandoned after a few matches, although the net stayed around the Lord's boundary all that season.

That starts on July 6 (West Indies v Zimbabwe at Bristol), and the final is at Lord's on July 22. I recently saw the Antiques Roadshow programme which was filmed at Lord's. On a bat I spotted the name \"Cranford\", which was my wife's maiden name, and we wondered whether we had a Test cricketer in the family? asks Alan Gottschald from America Sorry to disappoint you but there has never been an English first-class cricketer called Cranford. I think the name was probably \"Crawford\": John Neville Crawford, a Surrey allrounder, played 12 Tests for England between 1905-06 and 1907-08. He later fell out with Surrey and played in Australia and New Zealand, before resolving his differences and returning to The Oval after the First World War. Who did Garry Sobers score his six sixes against? asks James Rodgers The unfortunate bowler was Malcolm Nash of Glamorgan. He was usually a left-arm fast bowler, but was experimenting with slower spinners and cutters at the time when Sobers collected his six sixes in an over, playing for Nottinghamshire at Swansea in 1968. Nash, who was also hit for 34 in an over by Lancashire's Frank Hayes in 1977, played on for Glamorgan until 1983, and captained them in 1980-81. His spinners never caught on, though. How can you turn a bunch of hard drinkers, with respect and a flair for the game, into winners? asks Andy Bird, newly elected captain of the Sow &amp; Pigs Cricket Club I think you'll have to play teams who are harder drinkers, with less flair and respect for the game.

      "body": "<p>Dylan Schlosberg might be only 26 years old, but he has plans to revolutionise online shopping. He wants to make the consumer king.</p> <p>Convenience is supposed to be one of the great attractions of net shopping. You can buy when you want, at a good price, with the minimum of hassle, or so we are told. In practice, you often waste time struggling with slow net connections and badly designed sites. Consumers have yet to be freed from high prices and tedious procedures.</p> <p>Schlosberg thinks his site, <a href=\"http://www.Ybag\" target=\"_new\">Ybag</a>, might change all that. Launched only last week, it aims to let you sit back while retailers come to you. Finally, he claims, the customer is king: power has finally shifted from sellers to buyers.</p> <p>Inspiration for the site came last summer, when Schlosberg found himself perplexed by the frustrating nature of much net shopping.</p> <p>His concept is simple. Users register and describe a particular item they want - like a TV, a computer or even a car. The requests are passed on to suppliers, and they send details of the deal they can offer to the user, who can check in at their leisure to see what has turned up. If something appeals, they get in touch with the seller. They don't need to buy via the net.</p> <p>Schlosberg expects many of the sales Ybag enables to take place on the telephone. \"The idea is to offer a quicker, more user friendly, more personal shopping experience on the net,\" he says. \"It's very much what's happening in America at the moment.\" Indeed, shortly after Schlosberg came up with the idea, several similar sites launched in the US the best-known being <a href=\"http://www.respond.com\" target=\"_new\">Respond.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.buyersedge.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Buyers Edge</a>.</p> <p>In fact, sites like Ybag and Respond.com are just one example of the new kinds of retail ideas being tried online. So far net shopping has focused mainly on giving users access to databases of products, all at fixed prices. At its most basic, it is catalogue shopping with a few multimedia knobs on. Though it can be very convenient, online the consumer still does a lot of the work, such as searching databases and keying in payment information, previously done by the seller.</p> <p>But these new net retailers plan to take advantage of the net's great strength: its ability to allow users to swap information. The retailers hope not simply to shift product but to shift power as well: to build new kinds of relationships between buyers and sellers, relationships in which the buyer sets the pace and could even affect prices in real time.</p> <p>New sites have sprung up, like Priceline - where buyers name the price they want to pay for travel tickets, hotel rooms, cars and even groceries and sellers then compete to pick up the proposed deal. There is also the aggregate buying site Let's Buy It, where buyers can link up to force down prices.</p> <p>According to co-founder John Palmer, the net has the ability to put the consumer in the driver's seat. \"We are consumer-to-business as distinct to business-to-consumer. That means that the consumer tries to direct proceedings. That's not going to happen in the real world of bricks and mortar - there you are told what products you can have and how much it's going to cost.\"</p> <p>The pitch of Let's Buy It is very seductive: buyers can either join in with ongoing sales of products, or suggest a thing they want to buy; the site will then try to source something suitable. The more people who sign up to a particular sale, the more the price goes down, so there is an incentive for buyers to tell friends about the site and so build its traffic.</p> <p>\"Compare it to an auction site where the price is always being bid up and there's only one winner,\" says Palmer. \"At our site, the more people come together, the more the price goes down and everyone's a winner. If you like the idea you want to tell everybody about it because it's going to help you achieve a better price.\"</p> <p>Then again, do you want all your friends to have the same TV set as you? Palmer says this doesn't seem to be an issue at all. He also rejects the idea that the site is a fad. People enjoy the buying process, he says. They like coming back to see if the price has gone down.</p> <p>But some of the sites that promise consumer empowerment do involve an element of risk. Though the US site Priceline.com does let consumers name their price, well over 80% of the deals are never done because the company cannot find a willing supplier.</p> <p>If a supplier comes up with a deal at the right price, the consumer has to take it. But the deal may not be quite what the customer wanted - Priceline may have to make a couple of changes on route. So Priceline customers get power but they have to be flexible.</p> <p>That said, when it moves into a product sector, Priceline often subsidises deals, so that customers do get what they want and have a good experience. It's good for building traffic, but it's one reason why the site has yet to make a profit. It seems likely that Priceline will move here shortly, perhaps in conjunction with <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute.com</a> (the Lastminute network has registered the priceline.co.uk name).</p> <p>Now that it has floated, Lastminute.com will at least have the deep pockets needed to get this kind of reverse auction model off the ground. In the meantime, Ybag's Schlosberg suggests that his site is one of the UK's first reverse auction sites, though he doesn't want to trumpet the fact too loudly, for fear of confusing consumers.</p> <p>\"They're only just getting to grips with online auctions. But the basic idea is that rather than having one item and a number of buyers, you have one buyer and a number of sellers.\"</p> <p>But US e-commerce pundit and author Evan T Schwartz says Ybag \"sounds more like a lead-generation service,\" referring to services which drum up interest in products before tipping off vendors.</p> <p>\"Autobytel pioneered this tactic in the US for car buying,\" he says. \"This approach has caught on so much that the market is now moving into more sophisticated online car buying choices. One example is Carsdirect.com, which promises to let you build the car and name your own price. The big car makers all have projects underway to do something similar.\"</p> <p>Ybag plans to make most of its money from the suppliers - it claims to have signed up around 900 so far. After an initial free trial, they will pay to sign up to the service, and each time a consumer gets in touch following one of their emails they will pay a referral fee.</p> <p>The attraction for buyers is obvious. They don't have to put much effort in and they are not tied to picking up the offers that are sent to them. And, though Ybag does not sell itself on price, Schlosberg says that the site does turn up some surprisingly good deals. It's certainly less trouble to use than many of the existing shopping bots (see panel), which still promise more than they actually deliver.

So you can name all the prices that you want, but chances are you're not going to get it. Priceline also funnels all the demand data to the airlines, so they get a better sense of the so-called 'demand curves' on every major route in the world.

      "bodyText": "Dylan Schlosberg might be only 26 years old, but he has plans to revolutionise online shopping. He wants to make the consumer king. Convenience is supposed to be one of the great attractions of net shopping. You can buy when you want, at a good price, with the minimum of hassle, or so we are told. In practice, you often waste time struggling with slow net connections and badly designed sites. Consumers have yet to be freed from high prices and tedious procedures. Schlosberg thinks his site, Ybag, might change all that. Launched only last week, it aims to let you sit back while retailers come to you. Finally, he claims, the customer is king: power has finally shifted from sellers to buyers. Inspiration for the site came last summer, when Schlosberg found himself perplexed by the frustrating nature of much net shopping. His concept is simple. Users register and describe a particular item they want - like a TV, a computer or even a car. The requests are passed on to suppliers, and they send details of the deal they can offer to the user, who can check in at their leisure to see what has turned up. If something appeals, they get in touch with the seller. They don't need to buy via the net. Schlosberg expects many of the sales Ybag enables to take place on the telephone. \"The idea is to offer a quicker, more user friendly, more personal shopping experience on the net,\" he says. \"It's very much what's happening in America at the moment.\" Indeed, shortly after Schlosberg came up with the idea, several similar sites launched in the US the best-known being Respond.com and Buyers Edge. In fact, sites like Ybag and Respond.com are just one example of the new kinds of retail ideas being tried online. So far net shopping has focused mainly on giving users access to databases of products, all at fixed prices. At its most basic, it is catalogue shopping with a few multimedia knobs on. Though it can be very convenient, online the consumer still does a lot of the work, such as searching databases and keying in payment information, previously done by the seller. But these new net retailers plan to take advantage of the net's great strength: its ability to allow users to swap information.

Edmond's daughter Rachel died in 1975; she and her husband parted in the mid-1980s, and in the 1990s, post-autobiography, tensions arose between Edmond and some of the children over her exposure of their family life.

Her poetry, essentially a meditation on her experience, also conveys these qualities; a strength in facing the dark side of life with which she became so familiar, a perception of the everyday as humorous or incongruous. Always accessible, Edmond wrote often about family life: the responsibilities of motherhood, the connectedness with children. The sequence of poems in Wellington Letter (1980), written out of grief after the death of Rachel, are among the most moving. </p> <p>Other poems celebrate the dignity of the individual, and display understanding of people and relationships.

In particular, her preoccupation with the momentariness of life, in poems which weigh up gain against loss in a transient world, has relevance to all readers of poetry. In later works her search at the borders of empirical certainties, defining herself in relation to the unknown dimensions of the life beyond, while simultaneously remaining anchored in the present, became a serious act of self-repositioning. </p> <p>Edmond's inspiration was rooted in her New Zealand identity, and it was this which gave her work a wider appeal. She was friend to several generations of women, especially writers, who admired her as a pioneer for breaking with social convention and carving out a successful literary life at a time when this seemed risky. </p> <p>For years before she was published, she scribbled - poems, diaries, letters - in the hours left over from raising six children and moving round rural New Zealand with her schoolteacher husband. She had trained as a teacher at Wellington teachers' college, and then worked as a teacher before the children arrived. Only later did she take a degree and an MA in English literature. </p> <p>She edited Selected Letters of ARD Fairburn (1981) under the auspices of the poet Dennis Glover, and co-founded the periodical New Zealand Books in 1990. She was president of PEN 1980-81, a frequent speaker at writers' festivals, and her writer in residence posts included Deakin university in Melbourne. </p> <p>She enjoyed her role in New Zealand's literary life, as much as she was engaged in family life.

Lucretia Nimocks, the former wife of Jeffrey Wigand, the tobacco-industry whistleblower who is the subject of the film, has announced that she is going to sue the Walt Disney Studio for using her life story without permission and portraying her \"disparagingly\". Smoke And Mirrors is set to star parents-to-be Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and tells the true story of nineteenth-century illusionist Jean Robert Houdin and his sidekick Colette, who were sent to Algeria by the French government to expose a religious sorcerer inciting revolution. \"I don't think there will be too many family members around to take this particular film to court\", says Ed Nicholson, Ladbrokes' entertainment odds compiler, alluding to a US law whereby film companies cannot use a person's life story without the subject's permission. The documentary on wrestling, Beyond The Mat, has already had it's ad campaign mysteriously pulled from one wrestling show. The distributor, Lion's Gate, is apparently pondering legal action against the World Wrestling Federation for it's negative influence on the project. \"Cash is all about Johnny Cash, the grand old man of Nashville.

If Coward had played it, we would never have had the most famous lines in the film, written by Welles himself: \"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed.

To its credit, this government has not ducked difficult education issues. Sensibly, it made primary education its first priority. It is the foundation for all other levels of education and the sector with the most intractable problems. Four years ago, more than half of all 11-year-olds were failing to reach expected standards. Now, thanks to the focus which ministers applied and new schemes like numeracy and literacy hours, standards have risen dramatically. Seven out of 10 pupils are reaching required standards and the schools are in line to reach the ambitious targets set for 2002 - 75% achieving the standard for numeracy and 80% that for literacy. </p> <p>Now ministers have turned their attention to secondary schools where there are equally difficult challenges. Last year, 424 schools were recording no more than 15% of pupils passing five GCSE subjects at grades A* to C. That was almost 100 fewer failing schools than in July 1998, but still far too many. So the education secretary introduced a tough new target: schools which fail for three years in a row to get at least 15% of pupils through five good passes at C or above would be subject to closure and put into a \"fresh start\" programme involving a new name, a new \"superhead\", and with all existing teachers required to reapply for their jobs. </p> <p>With some justification, teachers complain that they are being made the scapegoats for society's failings. Worse still, they note that if teachers in the most deprived areas facing the most difficult educational challenges are to be given the most insecure jobs, even the heroic may turn away and opt for an easier life in a school in the leafy suburbs. But David Blunkett has not been deflected. This is tough on teachers, but the right course for an education secretary to pursue. He has to put children's interests first. Ten schools have so far been placed in the fresh start programme. All were given ample warnings through inspections, the introduction of \"special measures\", or protracted negotiations with department of education officials. </p> <p>With the third \"superhead\" resigning this week, Blunkett's critics are having a field day. His response yesterday was the right one: an honest admission that \"fresh start\" is a risky option, but still better than doing nothing. Heads do make a difference, as Michael Rutter's research of 20 years ago demonstrated. But there are limits to what even the best heads can do on their own. They need support teams and extra resources. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett unveiled a second option yesterday: new city academies which would be beyond local education authority (LEA) control and rely on local businesses, voluntary bodies, and religious foundations, plus central government subsidies. They would have the right to operate their own curriculum outside \"core requirements\", and the freedom to \"reinvent\" the school day as well as to pay teachers more. LEAs are outraged. But they need to keep a sense of perspective. Initially, we are only talking about six institutes. True, they look like a reinvention of Tory city technology colleges, much derided by Labour. But they should be given a chance. We need new ways of making education more relevant for the seriously disaffected. That must include work-based training routes and work-based qualifications. Local business links make sense. We need more experiments, not fewer. We need institutes which will embrace change, not reject it.</p>",

They will not confront the brutal reality which is that these 'fresh start' schools need brilliant leadership backed up by the ability to deal with disruptive youngsters.\" </p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"The net consequence of his blizzard of contradictory initiatives is high staff turnover, headteacher resignation and general dismay and demoralisation.\" </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"The proposal for city academics is the sticking plaster over the government's failure to provide adequate support for schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.\" </p> <p>Theresa May, the shadow education and employment secretary, said: \"He has had to adopt Conservative policies to provide freedom for all these schools. We want to see the same freedom of self-management and self-determination given to all schools.\" </p> <p>Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, supported Mr Blunkett, but said tough action was necessary to remove pupils who were making it impossible for others to learn.</p>",

The government wants more successful LEA-run comprehensives to specialise in technology, languages, sport or the arts. There are 480 committed to doing this already and the target for 2003 is 800. Other initiatives include beacon schools, education action zones and additional programmes in the six biggest conurbations. There is no single model of secondary education in England on which the government will hang its reputation. It will be hard to tell the direction ministers are taking because they will wait to see which bits are working. Mr de Gruchy said: \"This whole business smacks of a touch of panic ... They will not confront the brutal reality which is that these 'fresh start' schools need brilliant leadership backed up by the ability to deal with disruptive youngsters.\" Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"The net consequence of his blizzard of contradictory initiatives is high staff turnover, headteacher resignation and general dismay and demoralisation.\" John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"The proposal for city academics is the sticking plaster over the government's failure to provide adequate support for schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.\" Theresa May, the shadow education and employment secretary, said: \"He has had to adopt Conservative policies to provide freedom for all these schools. We want to see the same freedom of self-management and self-determination given to all schools.\" Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, supported Mr Blunkett, but said tough action was necessary to remove pupils who were making it impossible for others to learn.",

The German firm appears to have lost faith in Rover and signalled that the strong pound, with sterling jumping 35 pfennigs to 3.15 marks since a \u00a33bn investment plan to rescue Longbridge was agreed early last year, was also a factor. \"Each pfennig means \u00a38m of increased losses,\" a spokesman was reported as saying. Mr Blair said that the government placed \"enormous strategic importance\" on Rover and declared: \"We will do everything we can.\" Union leaders fear thousands of jobs will go if Rover is broken up and sold off - and believe Longbridge and Cowley could not survive alone. \"Who's going to buy Long bridge in its current state? Toys 'R' Us?\" asked one senior union official while another added: \"The maths just don't work.\" Tony Woodley, T&amp;G transport union chief motor negotiator, accused the German company of treating its British workforce as \"cannon fodder\" by keeping them in the dark. Sir Ken Jackson said: \"It will be a catastrophe... the equivalent of dropping a nuclear bomb on the West Midlands.\" The damaging uncertainty is likely to cost the company even more customers, adding to its troubles. BMW pinned many hopes on the award-winning Rover 75 executive model, dubbed the \"last chance saloon\", yet despite picking up awards around the world it has failed in the showrooms. Half the 50,000 Rover 75s built are still in the company's car parks awaiting buyers. Three BMW directors - Henrich Heitmann, Wolfgang Ziebart and Carl-Peter Forster - were reported yesterday to have quit the BMW board over moves to sell parts of Rover.",

The problem is visible in Britain's schools. The increase in the number of candidates taking GCSE in a modern foreign language, at 16 years, is not being matched by a corresponding increase in the number taking a language at A level. So what is putting them off? Perhaps the lack of congruence between GCSE and A level in terms of syllabus and methodology has made the transition from GCSE to A level too daunting for many students. Perhaps the national curriculum has left less space for students to study two foreign languages than was previously the case, and has thereby undermined early specialisation in languages - a 1997 Teacher Training Agency report identified the dwindling number of dual linguists at GCSE and A level as one of the causes of the shortage in teacher supply. Perhaps young people are now finding their role models and preferred lifestyles elsewhere in the English-speaking world, and are not aspiring to live in countries where English is not the mother tongue. Or perhaps the view that the rest of the world speaks English is now being consolidated by the belief that emerging language technologies will soon be able to sort out translation problems in the odd corners of the globe where it is not spoken. Whatever the causes, the introduction, from next year, of cash incentives to entice languages graduates into teaching is a very public admission of just how bad things have become. The fact that around one-third of modern foreign language teacher trainees in Britain are from overseas further illustrates the depth of the problem. The Higher Education Funding Council for England has recognised that languages are expensive to teach, and has made more money available (though not yet for French). Yet the council's recent suggestion that universities should consider \"rationalising\" language departments collaboratively and on a regional basis has not been thought through, and may lead to further decline. Language associations believe that the funding council has failed to recognise the enormous growth in \"non-specialist\" language learning over the past decade, and therefore badly underestimates the total volume of language learning in universities. These students are not \"visible\" in the statistical returns made by universities to the council. It has already been suggested that Britain needs a collective, long-term perspective that recognises the need to stimulate demand rather than cut supply if a bad situation is not to become much worse. Closing down, selectively pruning or otherwise \"rationalising\" languages departments will not help \"Cool Britannia\" one iota, and existing funding arrangements may need further modification to support modern foreign languages through this difficult period. There needs to be the kind of serious thinking that can only be provided by a national policy on modern languages encompassing the various branches of compulsory and post-compulsory education. Perhaps the forthcoming final report of the Nuffield inquiry into British higher education will help bring the country one step closer to realising that objective. Meanwhile the UK needs to take every opportunity to challenge the myth that monolingualism is somehow \"cool\". \"Cool, mon cul,\" as the French pop star Zazie might have said. \u0095 Derrik Ferney is head of languages and intercultural studies at Anglia Polytechnic University, England",

Since colonial times Rwandans have spoken French as a second language to their native Kinyarwanda. But the return of large numbers of English-speaking refugees from Anglophone countries, some of whom fled as long ago as 1959, has opened up the prospect of French being supplanted by English as the language of education and international trade. </p> <p>In recent years Rwanda's coalition government has implemented an unofficial policy to introduce English into education, motivated more by necessity than by choice. In order to rebuild the education system and meet the needs of returned anglophone refugees, the government has had to rely on both francophone and anglophone manpower from neighbouring countries.

      "bodyText": "One consequence Rwanda's social upheaval in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide has been the reshaping of the country's linguistic identity. Since colonial times Rwandans have spoken French as a second language to their native Kinyarwanda. But the return of large numbers of English-speaking refugees from Anglophone countries, some of whom fled as long ago as 1959, has opened up the prospect of French being supplanted by English as the language of education and international trade. In recent years Rwanda's coalition government has implemented an unofficial policy to introduce English into education, motivated more by necessity than by choice. In order to rebuild the education system and meet the needs of returned anglophone refugees, the government has had to rely on both francophone and anglophone manpower from neighbouring countries. Foreign donors, especially anglophone countries, have also pledged aid and books to help the struggling system assimilate this third language. There is strategic economic reasoning behind this policy. Geographically Rwanda is well placed between francophone Central Africa and anglophone East Africa, so adopting a bilingual policy, it is hoped, will open the doors to both regions, and encourage greater trade, commerce and cultural exchanges with its neighbours. Rwanda has already developed increased trading ties with South Africa, has joined Comesa, and hopes to join the East African Community by the end of the year. Rwanda is unusual in that all the ethnic groups in the country share a common mother tongue in Kinyarwanda. Even those born in exile kept the language alive. This reduces the opportunities for French or English usage which, in turn, makes it harder for learners of second languages to practise outside the classroom. In the country's three main tertiary-level educational institutes lectures are conducted in French or English, depending on the lecturer available for the subject. Therefore, all students are required to be proficient in both languages, and a range of pre-sessional training and on-going language support is provided. Yet one of the main hurdles facing these institutes and their lecturers is the lack of commitment from some anglophone students to learn French. The strong anglophone contingent within Rwanda's political, administrative and military hierarchy merely reinforces the perception that English is the preferred language of political influence and power. Last June anglophone students from the three main higher-education institutions marched to the parliament to protest that they were being forced to study in a language that they had no interest in learning. The response by the ministry of education (Mineduc) was to expel the ringleaders from their colleges. Fractious students, however, are in the minority. Most francophone students are keen to adopt English as a third language, understanding that it will increase employment and further educational opportunities for them, as well as strengthen Rwanda's human resource base. But Mineduc faces an even greater challenge in persuading young people to take up teaching as a profession. A teacher's salary in Rwanda is low - $100-$160 a month - and most schools are poorly equipped. Mineduc hopes to encourage newly trained teachers to stay in Rwanda by offering free training in return for a commitment to work in the education system for at least four years after graduating. Rwanda's current climate is one of optimism for the future, and most people are dedicated to the vision of an integrated, trilingual society. The general feeling is that although this is a highly ambitious undertaking, it is the right strategy for the country's social and economic reconstruction. \u0095 John and Emma Whelan are VSO volunteers working in Rwanda as EFL teachers",

      "body": "<p>This week Oxford University Press launches a new version of its flagship Oxford English Dictionary - the OED Online. But it's not the first dictionary on the Web, it's not cheap ($550 for a single subscriber - compared with $400 for the CD-rom version), and it wasn't designed with English language learners in mind. However, as an inveterate dictionary user, I was still interested to find out what it had to offer, and if teachers who aren't able to get online are missing out. </p> <p>When I am teaching or teacher training, I usually work with the main learners' dictionaries, all of which are excellent in their different ways. They focus on the needs of language students, and give information about pronunciation, grammar and usage that you don't find in a dictionary written for experts. But will new online dictionaries such as this edition of the OED take over from paper or CD-Rom, and do they give us yet another reason for getting connected to the internet?</p> <p>Oxford University Press claims that with the OED Online users will be able to see at least 1,000 new and revised entries each quarter, search through the whole dictionary with speed and ease, display entries according to users' needs. This edition lets you turn pronunciation, etymologies, variant spellings and quotations on and off, and compare revised entries with entries from the Second Edition to see how the language has changed. But is this useful? </p> <p>I decided to look up the word \"bother\" (as in \"Why bother?\", or \"What a bother!\") and logged on to the site. After I'd given my name and password I was sent to a query page where I typed in my word, and waited. The first problem was that it was slow to process my query - it took around a minute-and-a-half for the answer to come up. This may be a problem local to Sri Lanka, where I live, but it shows one of the disadvantages of online reference sources for those of us who don't have really fast Web access, and is a major disincentive to using online dictionaries in the classroom. </p> <p>Once the result came up I was presented with a basic choice between \"bother v\" and \"bother n\" - not exactly user-friendly for English language students. I chose bother v and after another couple of minutes I got a page giving me the following information: \"1 trans. To bewilder with noise; to confuse, muddle; to put into a fluster or flutter. Obs.\"</p> <p>Fine. But what if I don't know what muddle, fluster and flutter mean? And what about \"Obs.\"? Does it stand for \"obsolete\"? The quotations that followed, left me feeling that it did: \"1718 T SHERIDAN To Swift in Swift's Wks (1824) XV. 107 'With the din of which tube my head you so bother. 1832-53 Whistle-Binkie (Sc Songs) Ser I 22 The hearts of the maids, and the gentlemen's heads, were bother'd, I'm sure, by this Irishman'.\"</p> <p>When you strip the entry down to a bare definition, it's still difficult to understand, and if you have the full OED account of the word, you spend ages getting to the more recent (and more relevant) entry. An historical approach to dictionary making, the fundamental principle behind OED, does not work well for people who are mainly concerned with here-and-now problems of understanding what words mean, and how to use them. Even the carrot of the \"1,000 new entries a quarter\" is not much consolation for someone who is trying to get to grips with the 1,000 most common words in the language. </p> <p>Which takes us to alternatives, and there are several. Staying on the Web, there are two sites that have an immediate appeal. The first is the Collins Cobuild Students' Dictionary. This is a free service available from Cobuild and hosted by Bochum-Ruhr university in Germany. If you look up \"bother\" in this dictionary the first entry you get is determined by its frequency of occurrence in the \"Bank of English\" at Birmingham university, a huge corpus of contemporary written and spoken English. </p> <p>This means that what you see on screen is: \"1 If you do not bother to do something, you do not do it, because you think it is unnecessary or would involve too much effort. [VB] 'I never bother to iron my shirts.' 'Don't bother with the washing-up'.\"</p> <p>You are immediately taken to useful information, and it is presented in a form that is easy to understand. In addition, if you click on the pair of lips next to the head-word, you get a natural \"live-audio\" example of how the word is pronounced. </p> <p>A competitor to the Cobuild is the Cambridge International Dictionary from Cambridge University Press. This is also a free service, but carries a lot more advertising content - and doesn't have live audio. However, the interface is simple and easy to use, response times are reasonable and the information is useful. </p> <p>Looking at \"bother\" again, the first entry from CUP is: \"bother (MAKE AN EFFORT) verb to make the effort to do something, or to take the trouble to do something\".

Longman is introducing a new paid service, which looks as if it will be good, but which isn't free. Meanwhile Oxford University Press is developing an online version of its Advanced Learners' dictionary.</p> <p>Putting the needs of learners aside, the OED remains a wonderful Rolls Royce of a dictionary, and I have always enjoyed using it in its different incarnations. For my personal use, apart from the learners' dictionaries, I use the Shorter Oxford because I like the etymologies and the more concise historical approach. However, I have also to admit a preference for the Microsoft Encarta World English Dictionary on CD-Rom. I like the definitions it gives and enjoy the ease of working with it.

Freeman, 34, of Brooklyn, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit insider trading and other charges. Also pleading guilty was insurance agent James Cooper, who had traded on Freeman's information. Sentencing has been deferred until September 15, when both men could face 10 years in prison each plus fines of about \u00a3700,000. Freeman himself took a cut of the profits made by his \"virtual\" circle of investors, said the securities and exchange commission (SEC), the American financial regulator. He staked none of his own money, believing the stock market to be too risky. SEC enforcement chief Richard Walker said the case was \"one of the most elaborate insider trading schemes in history\". He said he found it alarming to see a resumption of widespread insider dealing similar to the economic boom days of the 1980s. The SEC said this is the first insider dealing case in which it is alleged that sensitive information was passed over the internet. Among others accused of participating in the fraud are a dentist, a retired schoolteacher, a car salesman and a waiter. Associated Press",

Yesterday's London Evening Standard carried no fewer than four pictures of her. Lane Fox, 27, has hit the two zeitgeist buttons: youth and internet. A picture of her hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. She has become the face of the youthful dot.com companies transforming the City. </p> <p>It's refreshing that the giant strides of cyberspace appear to have put a Prada trainer through the glass ceilings still cramping old-fashioned companies. Not only is Lane Fox a woman, she's also a young woman. In a traditional company, she might have made assistant brand manager at 35; the dot.com industry has made her joint boss of her own company and a virtual millionaire in her 20s. But does MarthaLane.com really represent a victory for women or is the new female face of the internet as big a confidence trick as sceptics claim the whole dot.com boom to be? </p> <p>The truth is that Lane Fox is something of an anomaly in the internet world, which is still overwhelmingly male-led. Lastminute.com was in fact the brainchild of her partner, Brent Hoberman. The decision to make Lane Fox the public face of Lastminute.com is yet another of the smart moves of this extremely smart pair. He is frank about it: \"She's prettier than me and a good ambassador for the internet. It makes people realise it's not just run by geeks eating cold pizza.\" </p> <p>Their company is innovative, dynamic, exciting. So are hundreds of other dot.com companies, yet theirs boasts the second highest recognition factor of all internet sites after Amazon.com. The promotion of Lane Fox as brand icon has given Lastminute.com a huge competitive advantage. Her image is glamorous, sexy, spontaneous, successful, fun-loving: everything Lastminute wants to convey about what it has to sell. And, crucially, she is female. </p> <p>Lane Fox is netty totty, her role not a million miles from that of the models draped over car bonnets. But the big difference is that she owns the product she is promoting: she is in control. In this way, the Lane Fox phenomenon is indeed a victory for women. She has, in a cool, calculated way, observed the sexist ways of the world and made them work for her. And she has done it on her own terms. She has not compromised her femininity - the pink cardies, the flirtatiousness, the expressed desire to have several babies - yet she can be as tough and aggressive as any man. She is evidence that women no longer have to pretend to be blokes to get on. And that women, too, can conquer cyberspace. </p> <p>But none of this would have worked if the media had not colluded. MarthaLane.com was devoured by newspapers and TV stations anxious to show they are keeping up with a more feminised world. In the British Journalism Review, the Guardian's Katharine Viner cites a Women in Journalism survey showing women featured in only 30% of pictures. Viner points out that over a million women have entered the workplace in the past decade but newspapers have yet to reflect the vast change this has made to their lives. </p> <p> She writes: \"At a time when newspapers are under threat ... the only commercially and culturally viable way forward is to be in tune with readers, who must include women. It's about reflecting who women are, what they've become, how their role in society has changed.\" </p> <p>The very modern Martha Lane Fox succeeds because she fits the old sexist criteria for visibility: young, blonde, beautiful, posh (Westminster, Oxford, descended from the Marquis of Anglesey). If she had been black, working-class, middle-aged - or, worst of all, plain - she probably would have been consigned to the same invisibility as most women.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown is to introduce a four-tier system of road tax for new cars which will penalise gas guzzlers and reward owners of more environmentally-friendly vehicles. The chancellor is also thought to be planning to increase fuel duty in the budget by no more than the inflation rate to cushion the impact on the retail prices index of soaring oil prices. In a move aimed at bolstering his green credentials, Mr Brown is expected to announce that, from the autumn, the vehicle excise duty payable on new cars will be based on their emissions of harmful greenhouse gases, which are directly linked to fuel efficiency. New cars will be divided into four bands, with the owners of those emitting the most carbon dioxide paying around \u00a3180 a year for their tax disc and those at the bottom of the scale paying around \u00a3100. It is thought the two middle bands, into which most vehicles will fall, will be priced at around \u00a3120 and \u00a3150. Cars registered before the system is introduced will continue to be taxed under the existing regime which is based on engine size. There are currently two categories of vehicles for excise duty purposes, with the owners of those with engines of less than 1100cc qualifying for a \u00a355 discount on the standard fee of \u00a3155. The treasury estimates that 1.8m motorists receive the small car discount, introduced in last year's budget. The shake-up of the road tax system, which was introduced in 1909 as a charge for road building and maintenance, forms part of the government's effort to encourage cleaner cars. To appease motorists who believe that the government is anti-car, Mr Brown is expected to announce that petrol duty will be indexed to inflation for the first time since 1992. In the pre-budget report, the chancellor said he was abandoning the so-called fuel duty escalator, which automatically puts duty up by 6% more than inflation each year, and in the future would decide policy annually. Motoring organisations had expected Mr Brown to opt for a 2% rise over and above inflation. But soaring oil prices at a time when Britain is well on its way to achieving its internationally-agreed target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions convinced him of the need to be lenient towards car owners. It will also minimise the impact on the retail prices index, which in recent years has risen sharply as a result of budget measures, threatening to start a wage/price spiral. High carbon dioxide emissions tend to come from bigger engines, but experts say that is not always the case. Motorists can check emission rates and fuel efficiency of car models in a booklet published by the vehicle certification agency.

      "bodyText": "Satellite photographs said to reveal a Pakistani plutonium reactor and missile base within range of targets inside India were released yesterday by US scientists, just days before President Bill Clinton begins a ground-breaking trip to south Asia. The Federation of American Scientists (Fas) said Pakistan had nearly completed work on a plutonium reactor at Khushab, near the Punjabi city of Lahore, and had built a dozen garages for missile launchers at a nearby airbase in Sargodha. The publication of the photographs will raise tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi, which earlier this year warned of possible conflict in their bitter dispute over the Himalayan state of Kashmir. \"Pakistan has laid the groundwork for a force of dozens of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking Indian cities and military bases,\" said John Pike of the FAS, a non-profit-making group funded by members of the Manhattan Project, America's programme to develop the atomic bomb. It said the plutonium from the reactor would probably be used in lightweight nuclear warheads on M-11 missiles bought from China in the early 1990s. \"But Pakistan is in danger of having most of its nuclear eggs in one basket, which would be a tempting target for a pre-emptive Indian attack in a time of crisis,\" Mr Pike said. Photographs of Sargodha, the group said, showed an ammunition depot in the hills where the missiles were stored and missile garrison, support and deployment facilities on the base itself. The group said that Pakistan may have up to 84 M-11 missiles at the site and up to 20 launchers. Images of the circular Khushab site showed a heavy water research reactor with the ability to produce enough plutonium for up to five bombs a year. President Clinton, who has described Kashmir as one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints, will press both countries to restrict their nuclear ambitions during his five-day trip to India and his five-hour stopover in Pakistan. He has offered to help resolve the Kashmir row, a move welcomed by Pakistan but opposed by India. Despite 10 rounds of special talks on nuclear security between India's foreign minister and the US deputy secretary of state, concrete results have proved elusive. On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, warned New Delhi it must curb its development of nuclear weapons and exports of nuclear technology before ties with the US could be strengthened. \"Significant progress in this area is necessary before India and the United States can realise fully the vast potential of our relationship,\" she said. New Delhi hopes to balance America's traditional support for Pakistan and to win lucrative business deals. But analysts there admit that huge differences remain with the United States over nuclear proliferation. \"It is a lump in the throat. The two sides can neither swallow it or spit it out,\" said a retired Indian army general. Since independence in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars. In May 1998, both countries tested nuclear weapons and last summer clashed in the Kargil mountains of Kashmir. Since seizing power in a coup in October, Pakistan's army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, has insisted that his country will keep its nuclear arsenal, and last month set up a nuclear command and control centre. Last night the military regime announced an immediate ban on political meetings, strikes and processions ahead of President Clinton's visit. \"There are reports that elements working against the interest of the state are preparing and planning hostile acts to create chaos and portray Pakistan as an irresponsible state,\" the interior ministry said. Although there have been few protests against the military government, some supporters of the deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, had arranged a rally for next week. Although President Clinton's stopover in Islamabad will be brief, Pakistan's military regime is relieved that he is willing to come at all. Yet Gen Musharraf will come under uncomfortable pressure from Mr Clinton to promise a return to democracy, prove his willingness to ease tensions with India and curb the threat of terrorism.",

So if you're at Longbridge, prepare to work in a call centre.</p> <p>Mr Hague raised Alastair Campbell's admission on Tuesday that taxes had, indeed, risen under Labour. \"The prime minister said he had no plans to increase taxes.

Some people fall into a stunned silence; MPs lapse into a stunned hubbub. You can accuse someone of systematic dishonesty, or allowing the collapse of the entire British motor industry, and that's fine. But to call them a liar is a crime.</p> <p>\"Where did that come from?\" barked Madam Speaker. The Tories shuffled nervously, like schoolboys terrified of sneaking on a classmate.</p> <p>\"I see no one is going to own up to it, but I distinctly heard it!\" she went on. Surely she wasn't going to keep them all in? Or cancel the school fact-finding trip to Barbados?</p> <p>Mr Hague returned to the theme. Unlike the prime minister, his own press secretary had finally admitted the increased taxes. \"He'd better get used to it. 'Less honest than Alastair Campbell' is not something anyone wants on their tombstone.\"</p> <p>(Or less slim than Ann Widdecombe, less fluent than John Prescott, less sane than ... I'd better stop there.)</p> <p>And so it went on. Harry Barnes, who is bald, then complained that \"the trouble with the leader of the opposition is that he gives slapheads a bad name\".</p> <p>The Mongolians looked slightly more puzzled than before, if that were possible. What on earth is \"slaphead\" in Mongolian? (Thanks to email and the erudition of Guardian readers, I shall probably know by tomorrow.)</p> <p>The Mongolians would have been more baffled when Mr Barnes went on to sug gest a tax on international currency speculation, \"which would raise money for causes such as Mozambique\".</p> <p>The place collapsed. The very idea! Taxing rich people to help destitute people! Whatever next? Tories rolled around and smirked, and even Mr Blair laughed merrily at such naivety.</p> <p>Moments later David Blunkett had to answer a question about the no-selection-under-Labour \"joke\", which has brought him so much trouble. Here is that answer in full:</p> <p>\"Yes, in 1995, for those whose memories stretch back that far, for journalists who have come out of school since then, for aged beloved politicians who have campaigned from that October day to this against what I said on the day, of course 'watch my lips' was a parody.</p> <p>\"The difference is, since level 2, 3 and 4 achievements in primary schools, even an 11-year-old will know the difference between a parody and a joke about a speech. A parody is a parody on someone else's words, at which that conference laughed.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett resembled a landed pike, flopping and thrashing round in the net before the kindly fisherman ends the agony with a mallet.</p> <p>What the Mongolian MPs might have made of this I do not know, since they had left in search of further enlightenment, possibly in the home supporters' end at Millwall.</p> <p>My message is: go back to your yurts and prepare for government!</p>",

Surely she wasn't going to keep them all in? Or cancel the school fact-finding trip to Barbados? Mr Hague returned to the theme. Unlike the prime minister, his own press secretary had finally admitted the increased taxes. \"He'd better get used to it. 'Less honest than Alastair Campbell' is not something anyone wants on their tombstone.\" (Or less slim than Ann Widdecombe, less fluent than John Prescott, less sane than ... I'd better stop there.) And so it went on. Harry Barnes, who is bald, then complained that \"the trouble with the leader of the opposition is that he gives slapheads a bad name\". The Mongolians looked slightly more puzzled than before, if that were possible. What on earth is \"slaphead\" in Mongolian? (Thanks to email and the erudition of Guardian readers, I shall probably know by tomorrow.) The Mongolians would have been more baffled when Mr Barnes went on to sug gest a tax on international currency speculation, \"which would raise money for causes such as Mozambique\". The place collapsed. The very idea! Taxing rich people to help destitute people! Whatever next? Tories rolled around and smirked, and even Mr Blair laughed merrily at such naivety. Moments later David Blunkett had to answer a question about the no-selection-under-Labour \"joke\", which has brought him so much trouble. Here is that answer in full: \"Yes, in 1995, for those whose memories stretch back that far, for journalists who have come out of school since then, for aged beloved politicians who have campaigned from that October day to this against what I said on the day, of course 'watch my lips' was a parody. \"The difference is, since level 2, 3 and 4 achievements in primary schools, even an 11-year-old will know the difference between a parody and a joke about a speech. A parody is a parody on someone else's words, at which that conference laughed.\" Mr Blunkett resembled a landed pike, flopping and thrashing round in the net before the kindly fisherman ends the agony with a mallet. What the Mongolian MPs might have made of this I do not know, since they had left in search of further enlightenment, possibly in the home supporters' end at Millwall. My message is: go back to your yurts and prepare for government!",

Kfor, the international peace force, is failing to protect Serbs enough to give them freedom of movement beyond their prison enclaves, let alone create conditions for those who left Kosovo to want to come home. In the northern city of Mitrovice which has been effectively partitioned, pro-Milosevic Serbs boast that their success in keeping Albanians out shows a tough line is the only solution. Father Sava senses Slobodan Milosevic's support in Kosovo is growing and that the hard-liners who denounce Kfor as nothing more than an occupation force are gaining strength. The trouble in Mitrovice is not just a battle between Serbs and Albanians but a struggle for the allegiance of Kosovo's Serbs.</p> <p>Amid his many disappointments Father Sava's regrets the lack of support which he and his boss, Bishop Artemije, Kosovo's senior Orthodox clergyman, have had from opposition politicians in Belgrade. At a recent meeting, the two clerics asked the anti-Milosevic politicians to sign a joint declaration which would stress two points. First, that it was not an act of treason for Kosovo's Serbs to work with the United Nations. Second, that \"injustices\" had been inflicted on Albanians. Although this was deliberately softer than the clergymen's usual formulation \"crimes\", even this was too much for Belgrade's opposition.</p> <p>Had it been signed, the statement would have had far-ranging political benefits. Father Sava and Bishop Artemije are convinced that unless more Serbs acknowledge that the atrocities done in their name are the prime cause of the hatred which bedevils Kosovo today, tolerance will take a long time to grow.</p> <p>It is easy to see that Serbs cannot readily accept that their side bears the greater guilt. What is more depressing is the way this escape from the facts is beginning to creep into western public discourse on Kosovo's shaky peace. Allan Little's recent BBC2 programme, Moral Combat, was only the latest example of the tendency to say a plague on both houses - with the danger that the international community will wash its hands and withdraw from Kosovo, as Milosevic is no doubt calculating. Little produced an excellent discussion of the conflict among western politicians and military strategists over the conduct of the war, but he put it into a surprisingly one-dimensional framework which gave no political context beyond the tendentious claim that from the very beginning the Kosovo Liberation Army aimed at provoking a Nato intervention. If that was so, how come the KLA's man at Rambouillet did most to anger the Americans and endanger the talks? And what happened to the consensus among all who reported on Kosovo in 1998, including Allan Little, that the KLA was one of the least centralised and disparate guerrilla movements of recent times, with minimal overall leadership and no clear strategy?</p> <p>The notion of \"balance\", in which a suffering Albanian family is juxtaposed with a suffering Serb family, culminated in the programme's final line that \"the oppressed, now liberated, have become the oppressors\", which created a false moral and historical equivalence. Is there really no difference between a state-machine whose security forces use arson, artillery, and cold-blooded murder on a mass scale against people still in their homes, and the hot-blooded revenge-seeking of bereaved people returning to destroyed villages and burning the houses of their Serb neighbours, usually after the Serbs had already left?</p> <p>Now we have moved to a second post-war stage, where crime in Kosovo is random, opportunistic, urban and largely done by professional criminals who want to make money out of Serb flats rather than by former refugees in the countryside. It is the inevitable consequence of a law and order vacuum, for which the international community is mainly to blame for failing to provide the police it promised. Take away the police from London or Berlin, and see how quickly the crime rate would soar.</p> <p>This is not to deny that the current violence against Serbs in Kosovo takes place in a vindictive atmosphere where most Albanians, regrettably, think ethnically. Moderate Albanian opinion keeps quiet and witnesses to repression do not come forward. Far from restraining them, parents encourage their children to stone Serb buses when they pass through Albanian areas under Kfor escort. The Albanian press does not feel able or willing to report fairly, let alone critically, on what is being done to Serbs.</p> <p>This is where Father Sava comes back in. Albanians would start to differentiate and not lump all Serbs together as evil-doers if they felt more Serbs were able to accept the truth about what happened in 1998 and 1999, and even show some sense of collective responsibility. Albanians would also relax if more Serbs did not go on behaving, as those in Mitrovice do, as though the Serbs can still win the war and get Kfor to withdraw.</p> <p>For western governments the message is clear. The ambiguity of UN resolution 1244 which left Kosovo's final status obscure has become a liability. It gives false encouragement to Serbs and real anxiety to Albanians. What is needed is a forthright statement by the western powers, and preferably the security council as a whole, that Kosovo will never return to Serb rule. This would help the cowardly opposition in Belgrade to break free of the nationalist cancer. They could correctly argue that it was Milosevic who lost Kosovo, and then go on to develop a modern political and economic agenda no longer distorted by territorial self-delusion.</p> <p>For Albanians such a declaration would provide a reason to stop seeing every Serb in Kosovo as a potential fifth columnist. In exchange for an international commitment that Kosovo's return to Serb rule is off the table for ever, the leaders of the various Kosovo Albanian parties should be urged to agree to a formal statement that the territory will remain legally part of Yugoslavia, though under international protection, for three or five more years. In that period Milosevic might finally leave power or Yugoslavia, with the help of Montenegro, might dissolve - leaving Kosovo independent by default.</p> <p>There are hard choices ahead for Serbs, Albanians, and the international community, but to trivialise Kosovo's current troubles as an endless Balkan cycle of violence does no service to anyone.</p>",

Kosovo also showed up the European allies' almost total reliance on the US for large transport aircraft, a key requirement of Britain's new emphasis on expeditionary forces. \"Too many [EU] armed forces remain structured to deal with the threat from the Soviet Union,\" Geoffrey Hoon, the defence secretary, said yesterday. \"Europe is in danger of being ready for the last war rather than the next.\" The European allies have promised to assemble a corps of up to 60,000 troops trained to reach crisis spots quickly, and prepared to stay on for a year.Meanwhile, senior US commanders say the Kosovo experience shows that a deployable EU police force is also urgently needed. The Europeans are beginning to realise that \"smart\" bombs are all very well, but that future crises will involve more commitment of both troops and equipment, and that next time they may not have the US to bail them out.",

      "bodyText": "Chocoholics all over Europe can now sample the delights of Milky Ways, Mars Bars and Kit Kats after Euro-MPs agreed yesterday that British chocolate was good enough to cross the channel. Ending a long-fought battle, MEPs endorsed a compromise deal under which all EU member states will have to accept Britain's finest as long as it is clearly labelled \"family milk chocolate\" and contains no more than 5% vegetable fat. Near universal acclaim greeted the final act in an often bitter 27-year saga, in the course of which Belgium and France repeatedly questioned whether the milky UK product could be accurately described as chocolate at all. One earlier proposal was that it be named vegelate. Keith Vaz, the famously sweet-toothed foreign office minister for Europe, wel comed the vote in the European parliament in Strasbourg. \"Today is a great day for the single market, the UK, the European Union and for chocoholics everywhere,\" he said. But straw polling on the streets of Brussels brought mixed reactions. One specialist retailer said he would not dream of selling British chocolate, although a gaggle of children queueing for mussels and chips sampled Cadbury's Fruit and Nut with gusto. The European commission has been struggling for years to end discrimination against British chocolate as purists and protectionists insisted only products made from cocoa butter were worthy of the name. Britain's most famous brands contain vegetable fat rather than pure cocoa butter while British chocolate in general uses more milk than continental rivals. \"It has taken nearly 30 years to be able to buy a Cadbury's Flake as easily in Madrid or Munich as in Manchester,\" said the Labour MEP and consumer affairs spokesman Philip Whitehead. \"Consumers will now be able to buy the chocolate they want, where they want it.\" Tony Bilsborough of Cadbury said: \"It is a breakthrough that will encourage free trade and allow different chocolate making traditions to co-exist in a market where people can choose.\" When the UK, Ireland and Denmark joined the EEC in 1973 all three governments refused to accept community standards requiring chocolate to contain only cocoa ingredients.

He formally confirmed he was the father of Lucas in a telephone link from the London offices of his solicitors to a US family court in Manhattan. A spokesman for the Rolling Stone said that the model's lawyers had asked for initial payments \"to tide her over during the hearings\" of $35,000 dollars a month, but he had agreed to $10,000. Jagger spoke to the court only to confirm his name and paternity, handing the phone to his solicitor for the remainder of proceedings. The next hearing will be in May. Morad, who is reported to be seeking a \u00a36m lump sum, flew to New York from Rio de Janeiro for yesterday's hearing. An associate told the New York Post: \"She wants it all wrapped up quickly and neatly. She has so many exciting projects in the works, but can't proceed until the child support matter is settled.\" Morad gave birth last May, at 29. Jagger agreed a divorce with model Jerry Hall for a \u00a310m settlement last August.",

He used the statement to protest his innocence and said that the boys he had met in Prague had \"thrust themselves\" upon him. Ivana Vancurova, prosecuting, told the court how Denning and his co-defendants formed bonds of trust with the boys. \"They gave them financial aid and gifts and invited them to restaurants so the victims came to trust them ... the accused exploited this trust to have sexual relations with the victims,\" she said. Denning, who has already spent two and a half years in custody in Prague's Pankrac prison, is likely to serve another two years.

      "bodyText": "The fiance of the TV presenter Jill Dando reflected yesterday on the way his life had been destroyed by her murder as he launched an appeal to raise \u00a35m for a crime prevention project that will bear her name. Alan Farthing said the shooting 11 months ago had left him \"disgusted by the injustice of it all\" but determined to find a way of ensuring that some good came from the evil that had killed her. Ms Dando's relatives and friends will honour her by establishing a crime research centre at University College London, which they hope will become a world focus for crime prevention projects. Their plans were outlined in Claridges Hotel in London at a press conference chaired by Nick Ross, Ms Dando's co-presenter on the BBC's Crimewatch. Among those on the platform were Sir John Stevens, Metropolitan police commissioner, the singer Sir Cliff Richard, the Countess of Wessex (above in front of a picture of Ms Dando), Nigel Dando, Ms Dando's brother, and the psycholo gist Ken Pease. Between them they described how, with enough funds, a Jill Dando chair in crime science would be set up at the university. A professor could be appointed in the summer, and undergraduate courses could begin in the autumn. Professor Pease defined crime science as the study of criminal events to identify trends and develop prevention techniques. The courses would draw from many d isciplines including criminology, psychology, geography, design and engineering to develop the best ways of fighting crime in the 21st century. Sir John said the murder squad would \"never give up\" the hunt for Ms Dando's killer while there were still leads to be followed. Donations can be made to the fund via the website jilldandofund.com, by phone on 0800 0150125, at branches of Lloyds TSB, or by cheque to The Jill Dando Fund, Lloyds TSB, 50 Notting Hill Gate, London, W11 3JD.",

No details of the offence have been released, but a spokesman for the FSB - the successor to the Soviet-era KGB - said the man was being interrogated in the high-security Lefortovo prison in Moscow. A criminal case has been opened against him. The arrest came only days after Mr Blair met Mr Putin - a former KGB agent and more recently the head of the FSB - for informal talks and a friendly evening at the opera in St Petersburg. The incident also cast a shadow on already strained relations between Russia and its former Soviet neighbour Estonia. An FSB spokesman, Alexander Zdanovich, claimed the Estonian secret services had worked with the alleged spy to aid British intelligence. British agents are said to have travelled to the Estonian capital, Tallinn, to work with the Russian citizen, who was also a regular visitor to the city. If no direct meetings with his British handlers had been set up, he would send information via the Estonian security police to Britain, another FSB source said. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has repeatedly accused the secret police in former Soviet countries - particularly the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - of cooperating with Nato in its drive to recruit Russian agents. A spokesman for Russia's foreign reconnaissance service said yesterday: \"It is no secret that western intelligence services have used the Baltic states as a base for current work and for expanding their activities in Russia.\" The British embassy made no comment on the incident. Estonia's security police also declined to comment, saying the issue was not yet being taken very seriously \"since the information available is not adequate\". Another Russian citizen, Platon Obukhov, was arrested in 1996 for allegedly passing secrets of a \"political and strategic defence character\" to British agents while working as a diplomat for the Russian foreign ministry. His trial, due to begin in Moscow this week, was again postponed on Tuesday. Mr Obukhov's arrest prompted the worst spy row between London and Moscow since the end of the cold war, with Britain and Russia each expelling four diplomats. Last November Russia expelled the US diplomat Cheri Leberknight for spying, claiming the FSB had caught her red-handed in a Moscow park in the act of receiving secret Russian military papers. Despite the end of the cold war, Russia is still considered a priority target by Britain's MI6, which is keen, in particular, to gather information on Moscow's nuclear and conventional weapons programme and arms exports.",

And I agreed with some reluctance to take on Pluto, partly because I felt I was laying my head on the block.\" </p> <p>The Planets in its familiar form ends with Neptune and a wordless women's chorus (sung off stage) fading away ad lib into ethereal nothingness. Pluto will emerge from the moment just before silence. </p> <p>\"The initial thought was that if you were going to do Pluto, it had to be even more remote than Neptune, which was clearly not possible unless the whole orchestra joined the chorus off stage. So I went off in a completely different direction. Pluto is very quiet, apart from a couple of outbursts, but it scurries and is very fast indeed. At the end, the music disappears, almost as if Neptune had been quietly continuing in the background.\" </p> <p>Holst was fascinated by astrology but Mr Matthews is a sceptic. \"I didn't feel that I should rely on the astrological significance of Pluto, which is more than a little ambiguous, and, apart from choosing the title Pluto the Renewer, left that aspect to one side.\"</p>",

Now, thanks to a commission from Manchester's Hall\u00e9 orchestra, Pluto will come out of the far distant cold. Composer Colin Matthews finished the score of the six-minute addition this week, and it will be given its first performance at the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, in May. \"Kent Nagano [the Hall\u00e9's music director] also asked if I would compose an opening movement, which he sug gested could be Earth,\" said Mr Matthews. \"I was rather reluctant. And I agreed with some reluctance to take on Pluto, partly because I felt I was laying my head on the block.\" The Planets in its familiar form ends with Neptune and a wordless women's chorus (sung off stage) fading away ad lib into ethereal nothingness. Pluto will emerge from the moment just before silence. \"The initial thought was that if you were going to do Pluto, it had to be even more remote than Neptune, which was clearly not possible unless the whole orchestra joined the chorus off stage. So I went off in a completely different direction. Pluto is very quiet, apart from a couple of outbursts, but it scurries and is very fast indeed. At the end, the music disappears, almost as if Neptune had been quietly continuing in the background.\" Holst was fascinated by astrology but Mr Matthews is a sceptic. \"I didn't feel that I should rely on the astrological significance of Pluto, which is more than a little ambiguous, and, apart from choosing the title Pluto the Renewer, left that aspect to one side.\"",

There would be no last-minute twist: no air-sea rescue; no Bunsen-burner explosion; no siege; no Casablanca goodbye on a cold Chicago platform; no Doug. They played a few dummies: the Nashville choirbus in need of abdominal surgery; the psychotic knife man (\"tell me where she is or I'll let you bleed to death\") in order to make us believe something, anything might happen, but no. There were more thrills in a John Cassavetes movie. </p> <p>This was Carol's Big Birthing Day. Pottering round her flat to folky music, we knew that the imminent contractions would at least put pay to the Suzanne Vega. </p> <p>The problem with giving birth on TV is that you need to beat the commercial break. The ER team sensed the urgency and performed a Caesarian. Consequently, Carol's twins were the first in history born either side of the watershed. </p> <p>A tall, swarthy figure hovered at the door as #2 slopped out onto the mat. \"My God, it's Doug!\", 40 nations shouted at their TV (no, it's Mark). I've long imagined that Carol would end up with Mark, who's half-hourly being told by Carol to \"take a raincheck\"on his pathetic requests to \"do coffee\".

      "bodyText": "Like Man United, ER (Channel 4) keeps its fans hanging on till the bitter end. In this week's double dose, however, the writers had a cunning plan. There would be no last-minute twist: no air-sea rescue; no Bunsen-burner explosion; no siege; no Casablanca goodbye on a cold Chicago platform; no Doug. They played a few dummies: the Nashville choirbus in need of abdominal surgery; the psychotic knife man (\"tell me where she is or I'll let you bleed to death\") in order to make us believe something, anything might happen, but no. There were more thrills in a John Cassavetes movie. This was Carol's Big Birthing Day. Pottering round her flat to folky music, we knew that the imminent contractions would at least put pay to the Suzanne Vega. The problem with giving birth on TV is that you need to beat the commercial break. The ER team sensed the urgency and performed a Caesarian. Consequently, Carol's twins were the first in history born either side of the watershed. A tall, swarthy figure hovered at the door as #2 slopped out onto the mat. \"My God, it's Doug!\", 40 nations shouted at their TV (no, it's Mark). I've long imagined that Carol would end up with Mark, who's half-hourly being told by Carol to \"take a raincheck\"on his pathetic requests to \"do coffee\". Mark grabbed baby #2 before Carol had a chance to hold her, a proprietorial act totally in keeping with his creepiness.

      "body": "<p>Under the relentless desert sun hundreds of Egyptian labourers are swinging picks and shovels in vast trenches while an archaeologist scrutinises their efforts, in the hope that all this labour will reveal some tiny shard of pottery from many millennia ago. </p> <p>That's the archaeological stereotype we know. But today's archaeologists have adopted an approach that allows them to delve into the past and learn about ancient civilisations without turning a spadeful of soil. This old discipline is recruiting remote sensing, a technique used by companies looking for oil or by the military for locating submarines. </p> <p>While many archaeological finds of the past required the painstaking pursuit of clues at ground level, others were stumbled upon by random digging. </p> <p>But remote sensing provides a guiding eye for archaeologists, directing them to the most sensible spot to start while avoiding damage to valuable artefacts. It is particularly useful for uncovering information at sites where excavation is prohibited, for example in national parks or at ancient burial sites. </p> <p>In this modern marriage of methods, archaeology teams up with soil science and geology and enlists equipment from medical research and even space exploration. </p> <p>German archaeologists have recently discovered an immense metropolis under Qantir, a simple farming village nestling in the Nile delta, about 60 miles north east of Cairo. They think that this vast subterranean site, which extends for up to 12 square miles, could be the ancient capital of Egypt that was established more than 3,000 years ago by Ramses II, one of the most powerful pharaohs. </p> <p>Ancient texts pointed to this region as the likely location of the lost city but excavations since the twenties, yielded little. </p> <p>Edgar Pusch, leading the team of investigators from the Pelizaeus museum in Hildesheim, Germany, has been working with Egyptian and German geophysicists to map this intriguing zone. They use an ultra-sensitive, portable caesium magnetometer which measures changes in the physical properties of the soil, a little like taking a sophisticated X-ray through the earth. When the data are fed into a computer, a series of lines and shapes emerge which reveal meandering streets, buildings and even the shoreline of an ancient lake. </p> <p>The archaeologists can then decide where to open up \"excavation windows\" in areas that seem particularly enticing. For example, one of the wonders of the city is a chariot factory and a colossal complex of stables, covering almost 17,000 square metres, which could hold up to 460 horses. There are holes in the floor of the sloping stable floor which they suggest allowed horse urine to be collected for fertilising crops and softening leather. </p> <p>The main drawback of magnetic imaging is that it cannot pinpoint the depth at which the physical changes in the soil occur. </p> <p>The team estimates that another 10 years will be required to complete the imaging of the city. Eventually Pusch hopes to make 3D computer images of it. </p> <p>This is not the first time that hi-tech equipment has been used by archaeologists. Forensic anthropologist Prof Norm Sauer of Michigan State university has taken CAT scans of 3,000 year old Egyptian mummies.

      "bodyText": "Under the relentless desert sun hundreds of Egyptian labourers are swinging picks and shovels in vast trenches while an archaeologist scrutinises their efforts, in the hope that all this labour will reveal some tiny shard of pottery from many millennia ago. That's the archaeological stereotype we know. But today's archaeologists have adopted an approach that allows them to delve into the past and learn about ancient civilisations without turning a spadeful of soil. This old discipline is recruiting remote sensing, a technique used by companies looking for oil or by the military for locating submarines. While many archaeological finds of the past required the painstaking pursuit of clues at ground level, others were stumbled upon by random digging. But remote sensing provides a guiding eye for archaeologists, directing them to the most sensible spot to start while avoiding damage to valuable artefacts. It is particularly useful for uncovering information at sites where excavation is prohibited, for example in national parks or at ancient burial sites. In this modern marriage of methods, archaeology teams up with soil science and geology and enlists equipment from medical research and even space exploration. German archaeologists have recently discovered an immense metropolis under Qantir, a simple farming village nestling in the Nile delta, about 60 miles north east of Cairo. They think that this vast subterranean site, which extends for up to 12 square miles, could be the ancient capital of Egypt that was established more than 3,000 years ago by Ramses II, one of the most powerful pharaohs. Ancient texts pointed to this region as the likely location of the lost city but excavations since the twenties, yielded little. Edgar Pusch, leading the team of investigators from the Pelizaeus museum in Hildesheim, Germany, has been working with Egyptian and German geophysicists to map this intriguing zone. They use an ultra-sensitive, portable caesium magnetometer which measures changes in the physical properties of the soil, a little like taking a sophisticated X-ray through the earth. When the data are fed into a computer, a series of lines and shapes emerge which reveal meandering streets, buildings and even the shoreline of an ancient lake. The archaeologists can then decide where to open up \"excavation windows\" in areas that seem particularly enticing. For example, one of the wonders of the city is a chariot factory and a colossal complex of stables, covering almost 17,000 square metres, which could hold up to 460 horses. There are holes in the floor of the sloping stable floor which they suggest allowed horse urine to be collected for fertilising crops and softening leather. The main drawback of magnetic imaging is that it cannot pinpoint the depth at which the physical changes in the soil occur. The team estimates that another 10 years will be required to complete the imaging of the city. Eventually Pusch hopes to make 3D computer images of it. This is not the first time that hi-tech equipment has been used by archaeologists. Forensic anthropologist Prof Norm Sauer of Michigan State university has taken CAT scans of 3,000 year old Egyptian mummies. A technique called stereo lithogra phy is then used to duplicate the 3D images in epoxy resin. Clay is skilfully applied to the plastic skulls, gradually building up an image of the facial features. Nasa has also been helping archaeologists with ground penetrating radar (GPR) devices to locate artefacts at historically significant sites in the USA. A series of radio waves are sent into the ground and the equipment records any discontinuities below the surface. The depth at which these subtle changes occur can be extrapolated from the travel-time of the radar waves, which are measured in billionths of a second, and data-processing programmes generate 3D images of the site.

In a prescient poem, Robert Frost wrote: \"Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice,/ From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favour fire.\" Whether the earth ends in fire or ice depends how, when and how fast the sun sheds mass, says Willson. </p> <p>If, as the sun burns up its own internal fuel source, it loses mass and collapses in on itself, the earth will end in ice. If mass loss occurs late on in the sun's life, it will expand outwards and earth will be \"engulfed in the bloated sun\". </p> <p>The sun will become a red giant, and then an AGB - an asymptotic giant branch. Willson calculates that seven thousand million years into the future the sun is likely to enter into the AGB phase with a similar mass to now.

Shortly after this, the moon will crash into us, the earth will then spiral into the sun. </p> <p>\"There is a way out!\" claims Willson's ex-student, Dr Fred Adams, from the university of Michigan. A passing star could perturb the solar system and scatter the sun, the moon and the earth in separate directions. The earth wouldn't be consumed by flames, and although the oceans will freeze, life could continue in bacterial form around geothermal vents for 30 billion years. The odds of this happening are one in 100,000. </p> <p>\"It's not great odds,\" says Adams, \"but it's better than winning the lottery.\" </p> <p>However, most stellar evolution will continue after our demise. Stars will be born until the universe runs out of gas. This results in a sharp transition because even the longest lived stars can survive only 16 trillion years, therefore, once the universe has given birth to the last star, \"The Stelliferous Era\" must come to an end - in 100 trillion years at the very longest. There will still be stars left, but they will now be brown and white dwarfs (collapsed, defunct stars).

The Daycare Trust says in a report today that for parents in poor communities, access to quality childcare is as much a \"pipe dream\" as private education. The report, published just days before the budget, is a blow to government claims to be pulling out all stops to abolish child poverty within 20 years. The charity says that a wide \"childcare gap\" exists for children under three. Though government policy was expanding care for older children, the \"vast majority\" of the youngest were missing out. There were 600,000 children under three living in poverty but only 42,740 free or subsidised places. As a result, 13 in every 14 children from low income backgrounds were deprived of such help. The trust director, Colette Kelleher, said: \"In wealthier areas children have access to the whole range of services and in the poorer ones, where there are greater numbers of children, you have huge gaps in provision.

The department for education said the government had asked early years development and childcare partnerships to look specifically at childcare for younger children in their 2000-2001 plans.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday won Liberal Democrat support for using buoyant tax revenues to fund higher public spending on health and education - in the face of William Hague's ferocious attack on Labour's \"systematically and deliberately\" broken tax pledges. Amid renewed controversy over tax-and-spending in the week before Gordon Brown's fourth budget, the Conservative leader won some support from independent tax experts when he claimed that \"stealth\" taxes will have pushed Labour's total tax take up by 2.5% before the next election. \"Your government has increased taxes on mortgages and marriages, petrol and pensions, savers and the self-employed, large businesses and small businesses, air travel and insurance, homebuying and charities. \"The result is not only that taxes have gone up, but that they are continuing to rise,\" Mr Hague told Mr Blair. During heated exchanges at question time he also told the prime minister he was dishonest to say \"we have no plans to increase tax at all\" before the last election - a pledge the prime minister says he honoured because he was referring to income tax rates. But the Tory argument that lower taxes are a moral duty on politicians won short shrift from the cross-party coalition of MPs which sees redistributive taxes as a crucial component of a fair society, not least in the provision of good public services like schools and hospitals. Mr Blair himself stuck to his guns. He countered by saying: \"When we came into office we were paying more under Tory plans on interest payments on debt than we were spending on the whole of the schools system of the UK.\" He won significant support from Charles Kennedy who warned against joining a Conservative-led \"Dutch auction\" on lower taxes and suggested a string of improvments to the NHS - including more cardiac operations - on which public money could be spent. That may be a hint that the Liberal Democrat leader is about to transfer the famous 1p extra on income tax - Paddy Ashdown's formula to help public services - from 1p for education to 1p for health spending. Behind the scenes senior Lib Dems have been embroiled in an internal row over such a switch. Proponents of the change argue that the NHS is clearly perceived by voters to be in a needier state than schools, which have been quicker than hospitals to feel the effects of some extra investment. Opponents point to internal polling showing that the 1p on tax for education remains the Lib Dem's only memorable policy. Dropping the pledge will make the party look untrustworthy, they argue. The Lib Dems will publish their \"alternative budget\" today. This week, Downing Street confirmed that taxes have risen since 1997 - partly to help pay off the \u00a328bn borrowing requirement inherited from John Major - though they are currently dropping as a share of GDP before rising again in 2001-2. Ministers say that the burden peaked at 37.4% in 1998-99, having been 35.3% in the last Tory year of office, and will be 37.2% in election year 2001-2. The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, backed by many independent analysts, say the true figure by then will be 37.7% because they reject Mr Brown's insistence that the working families tax credit is not a spending item. Downing Street says it has not changed its \"prudent\" fiscal strategy.

He will have to apologise to the Commons in the next few days.</p> <p>Last night he also admitted he had twice failed to pay his taxes on time. Two county court judgments against his company ordered him to pay a total of nearly \u00a313,500 - including \u00a36,909 in 1996 and \u00a34,514 in 1997. The company is also breaking the law by failing to declare its accounts on time - it is a year behind in making a declaration to Companies House.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone said last night: \"I believe that the demands were from the Inland Revenue. I am afraid one of the last things I do is pay my taxes and sort out my accounts.\"</p> <p>The potentially damning disclosures were muddied last night by a mystery surrounding the man who lodged a complaint against Mr Livingstone with Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone's campaign to become mayor of London was last night dealt a severe blow after a committee of MPs found him guilty of failing to declare \u00a3158,599 of income from regular commitments - speech-making and newspaper articles - paid to his company. He will have to apologise to the Commons in the next few days. Last night he also admitted he had twice failed to pay his taxes on time. Two county court judgments against his company ordered him to pay a total of nearly \u00a313,500 - including \u00a36,909 in 1996 and \u00a34,514 in 1997. The company is also breaking the law by failing to declare its accounts on time - it is a year behind in making a declaration to Companies House. Mr Livingstone said last night: \"I believe that the demands were from the Inland Revenue. I am afraid one of the last things I do is pay my taxes and sort out my accounts.\" The potentially damning disclosures were muddied last night by a mystery surrounding the man who lodged a complaint against Mr Livingstone with Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner. Ms Filkin received a typed and signed letter from John Jones, of Shepshed, Leicestershire, who last night insisted to the Guardian that he knew nothing about the complaint and had never written to the commissioner. This immediately prompted speculation in the Livingstone camp that Mr Jones had been \"set up\" by someone to expose the popular MP who is front-runner for London's top job. However, the identity of the complainant made no difference to the findings by the committee and the comissioner that Mr Livingstone failed to disclose his substantial income. Alan Williams, the Labour deputy chairman of the privileges committee, said last night: \"I told my colleagues that when they came to their judgment on this case they should erase from their minds that they were dealing with Ken - they should think they were deciding about Joe Bloggs MP.

Accounts released to MPs by Mr Livingstone showed that between June 1998 and February 2000 he had made nearly \u00a324,000 from the Independent, nearly \u00a333,000 from the Evening Standard, \u00a335,000 from Speakers for Business for 10 speeches and \u00a311,000 from Prime Performers for four speeches.

      "body": "<p><strong> Bush story</strong><br> British consumer electronics stalwart Bush Audio has once again surprised observers by announcing a series of innovative products. Hot on the heels of the internet TV range it unveiled last week, comes the first ever digital terrestrial PC TV card that enables users to tune into all 11 free digital terrestrial channels. </p> <p>The PCC3, which goes on sale in July priced at \u00a3150, also boasts a digital VCR option that stores up to an hour's worth of programming. The card can be upgraded to access Digital Text, and the company is hoping to offer a conditional access module that will allow PC owners to watch ONdigital's pay TV stations. </p> <p>Bush also introduced what it is billing as the first truly mass-market convergence product. The Ultimate MM hooks up to a TV to enable users to store video programmes on its hard disk, play DVDs and CDs, record CDs, play and record MP3 and WMA files, surf the Net, send emails and run standard PC programs. The company hopes to have the product in the stores in the autumn, selling for around \u00a31,200. </p> <p>Bush has also given more details of its internet TV range. The company is offering two ways of getting TV users on to the net. The first is a \u00a3100 standalone box that can bring the internet to any standard TV. Bush is also offering three sets, a 14inch, 21inch and 28inch that have the internet facilities already built in. Internet functions can be controlled using either a traditional TV handset or the set's accompanying QWERTY keyboard. </p> <p><strong> ONdigital</strong><br> ONdigital has become the latest company to take Tony Blair's words about bringing the internet to the masses to heart.

      "bodyText": "Bush story British consumer electronics stalwart Bush Audio has once again surprised observers by announcing a series of innovative products. Hot on the heels of the internet TV range it unveiled last week, comes the first ever digital terrestrial PC TV card that enables users to tune into all 11 free digital terrestrial channels. The PCC3, which goes on sale in July priced at \u00a3150, also boasts a digital VCR option that stores up to an hour's worth of programming. The card can be upgraded to access Digital Text, and the company is hoping to offer a conditional access module that will allow PC owners to watch ONdigital's pay TV stations. Bush also introduced what it is billing as the first truly mass-market convergence product. The Ultimate MM hooks up to a TV to enable users to store video programmes on its hard disk, play DVDs and CDs, record CDs, play and record MP3 and WMA files, surf the Net, send emails and run standard PC programs. The company hopes to have the product in the stores in the autumn, selling for around \u00a31,200. Bush has also given more details of its internet TV range. The company is offering two ways of getting TV users on to the net. The first is a \u00a3100 standalone box that can bring the internet to any standard TV. Bush is also offering three sets, a 14inch, 21inch and 28inch that have the internet facilities already built in. Internet functions can be controlled using either a traditional TV handset or the set's accompanying QWERTY keyboard. ONdigital ONdigital has become the latest company to take Tony Blair's words about bringing the internet to the masses to heart. In two weeks time it is set to launch its TV-based email system ONmail. For a one-off payment of \u00a330, subscribers will be able to send and receive emails and use up to five different addresses. As the system uses transparent graphics, users can also compose and send emails while watching TV programmes.

      "trailText": "<p>Microsoft's games console aims to blow away the competition, writes  Jack Schofield</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Microsoft plans to go head-to-head with three giant Japanese corporations, Sony, Sega and Nintendo, for the games console market. Leading games companies have already started developing for the system, which is based on PC technology, and which will go on sale in the US in about 18 months. </p> <p>In all, Microsoft claims the console, codenamed X-Box, will deliver about three times the performance of Sony's PlayStation 2, which went on sale in Japan earlier this month. J Allard, general manager of the X-Box platform reckons it will \"blow people's socks off\". </p> <p>The console represents a change of strategy for the American software house, which has previously supplied operating systems that other companies could use in their hardware. The X-Box will be a Microsoft branded product, and will conform to games console industry business practices, not PC industry approaches. The specification will be fixed at launch, not subject to continuous changes and upgrades, like PCs. </p> <p>Allard says: \"We're not confused: this is a single-function device entirely focused on the games market.\" Like the Sony PlayStation 2 and forthcoming Nintendo Dolphin, it will also play DVD movies and music CDs. However, John O'Rourke, director of marketing in Microsoft's gaming division in Seattle, says: \"We are positioning the X-Box 100% as a games console. We can't try to be another multi-purpose device. We have to focus on creating great games.\" </p> <p>The X-Box is basically derived from a general-purpose device: the PC. But as Allard points out, \"the X-Box will not be compatible with PC games\", and PCs will not be able to run X-Box games. The X-Box will be a closed proprietary system with its own peripherals, such as control pads, and will be sold at a competitive (low) price. Profits will come mainly from sales of games - and developers will have to license rights to publish games for the system, as they do with rival consoles. </p> <p>There should be no shortage of software, because the system is based on the DirectX software interface already used by about 97% of Windows games. Allard reckons it will be simple for companies to develop PC and branded X-Box versions of games with just the \"finishing off\" stage being different. </p> <p>Electronic Arts, the biggest independent games software house, is interested in X-Box games. Acclaim, Activision, Eidos, Hasbro, Infogrames Konami, Namco and Titus have announced their support. </p> <p>Graphics expert Jez San, chief executive of British games developer Argonaut Games, is enthusiastic: \"It will be out a year after the PlayStation 2 so you'd expect it to be better, but it's very good for the entire industry: a bit of stability in a PC-style games machine is hugely beneficial.\" </p> <p>The X-Box - which Bill Gates unveiled at a game developers conference in San Jose last Friday, following launch events in London and Tokyo - also represents big wins for Intel and nVidia. The processor will be derived from a 600MHz Intel Pentium III, with Intel snatching the business from rival AMD the day before the announcement. The graphics chip will be supplied by nVidia. Gates says it will be able to do a trillion operations a second, which will make photo-realistic games possible. </p> <p>The X-Box will run a stripped down version of Microsoft's robust Windows 2000, with the bulk of the operating system on games discs, interfacing with a stub of code built into the X-Box. Allard says there will be no boot-up process, and the operating system will be invisible to users. </p> <p>To support complex PC-type games, the X-Box will have a built-in hard drive - a first for the console market. It will also have a 100 megabit Ethernet network port. This will enable users to link machines for network play, or connect to broadband communications networks via ADSL phone lines or cable modems. </p> <p>Microsoft has made a deep study of the console market, and thinks it has the formula. Further, Allard says Microsoft is prepared to spend the money necessary to establish the system. \"The budget we have is astronomical. The launch of Windows 95 is going to look like a whisper compared with what we are going to do on the X-Box.\" </p> <p>If the company has a weakness, it's that it has not been very good at creating games. It doesn't have properties like Nintendo's Mario and Donkey Kong, or Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog . \"Why is X-Box going to be successful?\" asked Gates. \"The answer is simple: it will have better games. That's what this business is all about, that's what the customers want.\" </p> <p>Microsoft thinks its ace is that most game developers are already familiar with DirectX and will be able to produce great games quickly. But unless it and its allies can come up with something special in the next 18 months, the X-Box is not going to fly. </p> <p>\u0095 The X-Box website is at <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com\">www.xbox.com</a>. </p> <p>\u0095 A transcript of Bill Gates's launch speech is at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/03-10gdc.htm\">www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/03-10gdc.htm </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Microsoft plans to go head-to-head with three giant Japanese corporations, Sony, Sega and Nintendo, for the games console market. Leading games companies have already started developing for the system, which is based on PC technology, and which will go on sale in the US in about 18 months. In all, Microsoft claims the console, codenamed X-Box, will deliver about three times the performance of Sony's PlayStation 2, which went on sale in Japan earlier this month. J Allard, general manager of the X-Box platform reckons it will \"blow people's socks off\". The console represents a change of strategy for the American software house, which has previously supplied operating systems that other companies could use in their hardware. The X-Box will be a Microsoft branded product, and will conform to games console industry business practices, not PC industry approaches. The specification will be fixed at launch, not subject to continuous changes and upgrades, like PCs. Allard says: \"We're not confused: this is a single-function device entirely focused on the games market.\" Like the Sony PlayStation 2 and forthcoming Nintendo Dolphin, it will also play DVD movies and music CDs. However, John O'Rourke, director of marketing in Microsoft's gaming division in Seattle, says: \"We are positioning the X-Box 100% as a games console. We can't try to be another multi-purpose device. We have to focus on creating great games.\" The X-Box is basically derived from a general-purpose device: the PC. But as Allard points out, \"the X-Box will not be compatible with PC games\", and PCs will not be able to run X-Box games. The X-Box will be a closed proprietary system with its own peripherals, such as control pads, and will be sold at a competitive (low) price. Profits will come mainly from sales of games - and developers will have to license rights to publish games for the system, as they do with rival consoles. There should be no shortage of software, because the system is based on the DirectX software interface already used by about 97% of Windows games. Allard reckons it will be simple for companies to develop PC and branded X-Box versions of games with just the \"finishing off\" stage being different. Electronic Arts, the biggest independent games software house, is interested in X-Box games. Acclaim, Activision, Eidos, Hasbro, Infogrames Konami, Namco and Titus have announced their support. Graphics expert Jez San, chief executive of British games developer Argonaut Games, is enthusiastic: \"It will be out a year after the PlayStation 2 so you'd expect it to be better, but it's very good for the entire industry: a bit of stability in a PC-style games machine is hugely beneficial.\" The X-Box - which Bill Gates unveiled at a game developers conference in San Jose last Friday, following launch events in London and Tokyo - also represents big wins for Intel and nVidia. The processor will be derived from a 600MHz Intel Pentium III, with Intel snatching the business from rival AMD the day before the announcement. The graphics chip will be supplied by nVidia. Gates says it will be able to do a trillion operations a second, which will make photo-realistic games possible. The X-Box will run a stripped down version of Microsoft's robust Windows 2000, with the bulk of the operating system on games discs, interfacing with a stub of code built into the X-Box. Allard says there will be no boot-up process, and the operating system will be invisible to users. To support complex PC-type games, the X-Box will have a built-in hard drive - a first for the console market. It will also have a 100 megabit Ethernet network port. This will enable users to link machines for network play, or connect to broadband communications networks via ADSL phone lines or cable modems. Microsoft has made a deep study of the console market, and thinks it has the formula. Further, Allard says Microsoft is prepared to spend the money necessary to establish the system. \"The budget we have is astronomical. The launch of Windows 95 is going to look like a whisper compared with what we are going to do on the X-Box.\" If the company has a weakness, it's that it has not been very good at creating games. It doesn't have properties like Nintendo's Mario and Donkey Kong, or Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog . \"Why is X-Box going to be successful?\" asked Gates. \"The answer is simple: it will have better games. That's what this business is all about, that's what the customers want.\" Microsoft thinks its ace is that most game developers are already familiar with DirectX and will be able to produce great games quickly. But unless it and its allies can come up with something special in the next 18 months, the X-Box is not going to fly. \u0095 The X-Box website is at www.xbox.com. \u0095 A transcript of Bill Gates's launch speech is at www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/03-10gdc.htm",

      "body": "<p>If the future really is a \"wireless websphere\", 5,000 Helsinki residents will be the first to experience it. In Paris on Monday, IBM announced a $1bn project to build a \"virtual village\" in Helsinki, in conjunction with Sonera, Finland's phone company, and other suppliers. </p> <p>It will be the first community based on third-generation (3G) wireless communications which will deliver high speed internet to mobile and fixed devices. But the backers argue that it will be possible to replicate the model anywhere in the world. </p> <p>Pekka Sivonen, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.digia.com/\" target=\"_new\">Digia</a>, a Finnish software house, said: \"By 2005, the Helsinki Wireless Virtual Village is going to cover more than 1,000 companies and more than 5,000 residents within a one kilometre radius. Together with IBM, we're making a massive step towards realising a relevant and real-life wireless information society.\" </p> <p>The virtual village will be run using IBM's <a href=\"http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/\" target=\"_new\">WebSphere Everyplace Suite</a> of software for Unix computers. On Monday, IBM also announced partnerships with Cisco, Ericsson, Intel, Motorola, Nokia, Palm, Symbian and others to create wireless networks based on open standards. In particular, IBM and Motorola will work together to integrate WebSphere Everyplace with Motorola's Mix (Mobile Internet Exchange), VoxML voice markup language, and Wap (Wireless application protocol) phones. </p> <p>Janiece Webb, the senior vice president in charge of Motorola's personal networks group, said mobile data systems had failed in the US because there were three different systems, which led to a lack of software support. \"We really need a standard. With IBM, we're trying to create a level playing field where you can't hold anybody hostage, and you're only as good as your ability to run fast and innovate.\" </p> <p>David McKenzie, director of pervasive computing in IBM's European divisions, said: \"WebSphere Everyplace is a significant step forward: it will support any device over any network. The product is, as far as we know, the most advanced of its type anywhere.\" </p> <p>WebSphere Everyplace provides \"transcoding\" - translation between standard web pages written in standard HTLM (Hypertext Markup Language) and Wap's WML (Wireless Markup Language) - replication and data synchronisation (to make sure data held in different places is consistent), and network management facilities from IBM's Tivoli subsidiary. </p> <p>Mark Bregman, IBM's US-based general manager of pervasive computing, concedes that the right approach now would be to create websites in XML (Extensible Markup Language) and generate whatever code might be required, \"but not everybody's there yet\". </p> <p>WebSphere Everyplace will be available in about eight weeks for two versions of Unix: IBM's AIX and Sun's Solaris. Versions for the Linux clone of Unix and Microsoft's Windows 2000 will follow. Bregman said the software suite would allow other suppliers to \"focus on the applications, not the plumbing\". </p> <p>IBM is targeting WebSphere Everyplace at Internet service providers (ISPs) and some \"vertical markets\" such as banks, travel booking companies, and large retailers such as supermarkets. McKenzie says that more than 100 banks are interested in offering banking facilities via mobile phones.

      "bodyText": "If the future really is a \"wireless websphere\", 5,000 Helsinki residents will be the first to experience it. In Paris on Monday, IBM announced a $1bn project to build a \"virtual village\" in Helsinki, in conjunction with Sonera, Finland's phone company, and other suppliers. It will be the first community based on third-generation (3G) wireless communications which will deliver high speed internet to mobile and fixed devices. But the backers argue that it will be possible to replicate the model anywhere in the world. Pekka Sivonen, chief executive of Digia, a Finnish software house, said: \"By 2005, the Helsinki Wireless Virtual Village is going to cover more than 1,000 companies and more than 5,000 residents within a one kilometre radius. Together with IBM, we're making a massive step towards realising a relevant and real-life wireless information society.\" The virtual village will be run using IBM's WebSphere Everyplace Suite of software for Unix computers. On Monday, IBM also announced partnerships with Cisco, Ericsson, Intel, Motorola, Nokia, Palm, Symbian and others to create wireless networks based on open standards. In particular, IBM and Motorola will work together to integrate WebSphere Everyplace with Motorola's Mix (Mobile Internet Exchange), VoxML voice markup language, and Wap (Wireless application protocol) phones. Janiece Webb, the senior vice president in charge of Motorola's personal networks group, said mobile data systems had failed in the US because there were three different systems, which led to a lack of software support. \"We really need a standard. With IBM, we're trying to create a level playing field where you can't hold anybody hostage, and you're only as good as your ability to run fast and innovate.\" David McKenzie, director of pervasive computing in IBM's European divisions, said: \"WebSphere Everyplace is a significant step forward: it will support any device over any network. The product is, as far as we know, the most advanced of its type anywhere.\" WebSphere Everyplace provides \"transcoding\" - translation between standard web pages written in standard HTLM (Hypertext Markup Language) and Wap's WML (Wireless Markup Language) - replication and data synchronisation (to make sure data held in different places is consistent), and network management facilities from IBM's Tivoli subsidiary. Mark Bregman, IBM's US-based general manager of pervasive computing, concedes that the right approach now would be to create websites in XML (Extensible Markup Language) and generate whatever code might be required, \"but not everybody's there yet\". WebSphere Everyplace will be available in about eight weeks for two versions of Unix: IBM's AIX and Sun's Solaris. Versions for the Linux clone of Unix and Microsoft's Windows 2000 will follow. Bregman said the software suite would allow other suppliers to \"focus on the applications, not the plumbing\". IBM is targeting WebSphere Everyplace at Internet service providers (ISPs) and some \"vertical markets\" such as banks, travel booking companies, and large retailers such as supermarkets. McKenzie says that more than 100 banks are interested in offering banking facilities via mobile phones. In the longer term, however, he thinks that B2B (business to business) applications will be more significant than these business to consumer services. Examples include mobile professionals, and sales and service people working in the field. McKenzie also expects \"demand from countries where they don't have the wired infrastructure in place, when you can get a 2 megabit wireless service to a fixed device - which you'll get with UMTS [the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System which covers a range of forthcoming 3G wireless systems.]. The TV is going to have a role here: it doesn't have to be mobile.\" IBM will start by support ing Palm handheld computers - it already sells a rebadged version of the Palm - and mobile phones using Psion's Epoc operating system, from the Symbian spin-off. However, McKenzie and other IBM staff say the intention is to support \"any device over any network\", including devices running Microsoft's Windows CE and other operating systems. McKenzie points out that IBM already runs one of the world's largest networks with more than 300,000 staff using its Lotus Notes workgroup software. \"But we've got one customer talking about supporting 7 million users with five devices each, one of which is a mobile phone, within three to five years.

The launch of Wap (wireless application protocol) has been dogged by technical glitches, lack of handsets and expectations raised far, far too high.</p> <p>So it was with some excitement that I finally got my hands on one of the new Nokia Wap phones. Contrary to some of the hype, they do not mean that you can browse the web on a mobile. Instead, you can look at a number of special Wap-enabled sites published in WML (wireless mark-up language) which cut internet pages down into sizes suitable for a mobile's tiny screen. This means that if I want football scores on the bus, searchable train times on the station platform, even the met office weather before I draw back the curtains, all I do is make a quick call. </p> <p>My first impression was of a handset more like my first ever mobile phone than the very latest in net technology. Although much lighter than that brick, the Nokia carries a couple of centimetres extra width and has an expanded screen. It also has a new dial - or \"navi-roller\" - sitting beneath the screen, acting as a combination of mouse and key pad substitute. </p> <p>Only a few major sites are up and running. They include the BBC, Lastminute.com and the Guardian. Without wider web access your Wap experience will be limited to the portal your phone goes to automatically, made up only of sites which have partnered with your phone company.</p> <p>A good first port of call is one of the few Wap-only search engines such as <a href=\"http://www.waptastic.com\" target=\"_new\">www.waptastic.com</a> which also carries the latest wap news and a decent set of frequently asked questions. The more functional <a href=\"http://www.wapaw.com\" target=\"_new\">www.wapaw.com</a> acts as both a search engine and directory for WML sites. It's also worth bookmarking <a href=\"http://www.Wapforum.org\" target=\"_new\">www.Wapforum.org</a> if you are technically minded. </p> <p>The next thing was to put the addresses into the phone, no easy task. It is tedious to input complicated addresses using either the navi-roller or the number keypad (and a lot of WML addresses are very long and complicated). This is why the portal operated by your service provider is very important, as it will offer a range of services in one site. </p> <p>If your phone is a Nokia 7110e (new phones from the likes of Motorola and others are coming on to the market), it will have a built in link to a Wap-based portal courtesy of the service provider, in my case Orange. The package includes news from ITN, an online nationwide business directory and even links to Parker's car prices and Loot, the small-ads newspaper.</p> <p>Loot's site is good because its rented accommodation section is online. Searches for rented accommodation can be undertaken while you are actually out looking; exactly the kind of thing Wap is really all about. The other main thing I have been using my phone for is checking sports results. I was delighted that a full match report of the recent clash between Liverpool and Manchester United was available within 30 minutes of the final whistle, but disappointed that recent Six Nations rugby scores were lagging around one hour behind real time.</p> <p>I can also send email.

Displacing 53,000 tons fully loaded and capable of 30 knots, she was even more powerful than her elder sister Bismarck (sunk with great difficulty by the bulk of the Royal Navy in May 1941) and was based in occupied Norway from January 1942.</p> <p>From there she posed a permanent threat to Allied shipping on the harshest and most dangerous convoy route, to north-west Russia. Whenever a convoy sailed, the heaviest British naval forces had to be deployed to provide for a possible surface raid by Hitler's monster and her supporting ships, in addition to the perennial threats from U-boats and the Luftwaffe.

The convoy was ordered personally by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, to scatter because he believed the Tirpitz was about to attack - which it never did.

The Germans did indeed intend to send her against the convoy; but they left the grisly demolition to U-boats and planes after his order to scatter, and the battleship calmly returned to port without firing a shot or sailing anywhere near PQ 17.</p> <p>The catastrophe made British forces even more determined to destroy the monster in her north Norwegian fastness. The first of many abortive air-raids failed in March 1942, but was enough to make the Germans permanently hesitant (had the Royal Navy only known) to deploy their biggest naval asset. Tirpitz spent most of her war skulking in Altenfjord, Foettenfjord and various other mountain-dominated misty inlets, firing her guns in anger only once, in an ineffectual bombardment of Spitzbergen island in September 1943.</p> <p>It was in that month that John Dixon, flying alone as usual in his unarmed, long-range Spitfire with cameras in its nose, located the Tirpitz in her customary lair of Altenfjord. His discovery enabled the Admiralty to go ahead with a raid by midget submarines, or X-craft, specially developed for the purpose. A brilliant attack, for which two Victoria Crosses were awarded, put the Tirpitz out of action for six months.</p> <p>But she was so strongly built that she survived this and several more air-attacks, though finally reduced to the status of a floating battery. It was only in November 1944 that RAF Lancaster bombers armed with six-ton \"Tallboy\" bombs finally managed to sink the ship at Tromso.

It also used to be the world's most profitable corporation, but in 1993, it was better known for making the world's biggest losses: $8bn in one year, $16bn over three years. Big Blue was desperate, and hired an outsider, Louis V Gerstner Jr, to turn things around. The former McKinsey &amp; Co consultant succeeded beyond most people's expectations, and has taken the company's share price from an all-time low to an all-time high. It would be fascinating to know how he did it, besides spending $25bn on stock buybacks, but IBM Redux doesn't really explain. </p> <p> Partly this is Gerstner's fault, and partly IBM's. Gerstner didn't even give Garr - a former IBM speechwriter - an interview, and the company provided only minimal help. Garr does have some good accounts of things like, for example, the dramatic change in IBM's advertising, but Gerstner never emerges as a real presence. Nor is this a business casebook. Garr does not provide enough details of IBM's financial performance, and he does not analyse the workings of its numerous divisions. There are no tables, charts or graphs. </p> <p>If Gerstner really has effected \"the business turnaround of the decade\", surely there should be something spectacular to discuss. But there isn't. Most of IBM's divisions are still churning out dull products that are going nowhere fast, with most of the growth coming from a services business of questionable profitability. And although services now bring in a third of IBM's $87.5bn revenues, Garr barely pays them a glance. IBM Redux is a useful and readable book, and it highlights the characters of several members of King Louis' court. But exactly how Gerstner earned the $500m he could make from turning round the Big Blue battleship remains a mystery. (JS) </p> <p> <strong> Programming Applications with WAP</strong> By Steven Mann, Wiley, \u00a332.50<br> If you are tired of waiting for WAP (wireless application protocol) phones to become available, you could do worse than gen up on the programming language that lies behind it. Tens of thousands of experts are trying to work out killer applications for internet phones which are likely to be one of the biggest selling consumer products of the decade. But there is no reason why you can't try to make some of your own programs if only because the small size of screens on the phone means that programming is inevitably less complicated than on the web itself. </p> <p> This book is primarily aimed at application developers but is written in a way that is accessible to ordinary human beings. Once you have typed in a simple seven-line program to produce a simple phrase on screen, it at least serves to demystify the subject. Mobile phones are about to bring the internet to a mass market. There's no reason why they shouldn't bring programming to the people as well. This won't be the book that does that, but it is a good place to start learning what it is all about. (VK)</p>",

Then, Encyclopaedia Britannica went online free. It now gets 17 million hits a month. What Britannica did to the inferior Encarta encyclopaedia - Microsoft has just begun giving it away if you buy \u00a357 family Millennium Dome tickets - the new Oxford English Dictionary website should do to Scrabble and crosswords. The subscription rates look off-putting. If you're purely an individual user, you'd be better off sticking with the best of existing free dictionaries on www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/rbeard/diction.html or looking for a cut-price deal on the \u00a3250 CD-rom. But otherwise this instantly updateable website should make the OED far more accessible at work, at home and in leisure if you can get hold of a corporate, educational or public library log-on - allowing unlimited users and usage - than it has been in 20 arm-breaking book volumes at \u00a31,800 a throw. What you get is the world's most admired dictionary, the richest of guides to the glories of the language as well as to its meanings.

At least nine stations have banned a new cartoon series because of fears of pressure from religious groups, who suggest that the portrayal of God as an amiable character who looks like the late Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead is offensive. God, the Devil and Bob was broadcast this week for the first time in a regular slot to all the stations affiliated to the NBC network in the US. But pressure from religious groups, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, claims of bad taste and fears of economic reprisals have led stations in Utah, Idaho, Mississippi, Indiana and Louisiana to pull the plug on the programme. The series, created by Mathew Carlson, who once studied to become a priest, portrays God with the laid-back voice of the veteran film actor James Garner. God wears dark glasses and has the amiable countenance and demeanour of Garcia (who for a sizeable number of his fans, the Deadheads, was God anyway). At the heart of the story is Bob, a car worker from Detroit who finds himself torn between God and the Devil, portrayed, in the tradition of villains in American productions, by a British actor, Alan Cummings. The series, shown at prime time, looks at the dilemmas facing Bob and how he makes his choices. In this week's edition, God appears in a green T-shirt munching corn nuts and tells Bob he cannot help him out because: \"It's a tough week for me, Bob, there's a crisis in Africa.\" Bob, meanwhile, chides God for making naked women so seductive that he has to watch porn. \"This kind of tasteless and trivial portrayal of God does a disservice to the millions of American television viewers who have deeply held religious beliefs,\" said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Executives in deeply religious areas in the southern states have decided that the series is in poor taste and have informed NBC and the producers of the show, Carsey-Werner Productions, that they will not be screening it. The stations' decision is an example of the power that religious groups hold in the US - as the unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate John McCain found to his cost last week.

NBC is disappointed at the decision of the stations but said it hoped that once they have had a chance to see the series at length they may relent and take it after all. This is not the first time that fears about a religious backlash have prompted television companies to act. Last year, Fox required changes to re-runs of The Simpsons after pressure from the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. It had objected to a sequence in which a hungry Bart Simpson had inquired: \"Mom, can we go Catholic so we can get communion wafers and booze?\" To which Marge Simpson replied: \"No one is going Catholic.

The singer, who retreated from the public eye and lived a solitary life concentrating on yoga after being hounded by the press, is considering making a new recording. Yesterday, her friend and agent, musician Staffan Linde, told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet that Faltskog was considering going back to the recording studios for the first time since her 1987 solo album I Stand Alone. Dubbed the Greta Garbo of Swedish popular music, Ms Faltskog's last public sighting was at a party in 1998. He said: \"She is listening to various songs and we'll see if she thinks the material seems right. If it doesn't measure up then perhaps it won't happen.\" Faltskog was the youngest member of Abba and inspired a trend for blue eye shadow and matching culottes amongst teenage girls all over the world. After winning the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo, the group went on to have nine number ones and 23 hits in Britain alone. Abba last appeared together as a group in 1982. Famously, the two couples of the girl-boy-girl-boy were married. In 1971, Ms Faltskog married Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus but they later divorced. In 1990 she married a Swedish surgeon Thomas Sonnenfield, but the marriage ended after 18 months. Before Abba, Agnetha recorded six solo albums. Interest in the group has surged in recent years with Mamma Mia!, a successful West End musical by Ulvaeus and fellow Abba songwriter Benny Andersson featuring their hits, and a five-year chart run for Abba Gold, a greatest hits compilation which has sold more than 3.5m in Britain. Tribute bands abound, including Australians Bjorn Again, fixtures on the festival circuit, and the A*Teens, youthful Abba clones from Sweden whose album of covers, The Abba Generation, has sold 1m in Europe.",

She was sad, and she'd been saying so for a long time. But nobody listened to her much. They were too busy spinning their private fantasies and cracking their public jokes, because Ferrari had the biggest breasts in the world.</p> <p>They were gross, gargantuan, grotesque - surgically enhanced and silicone-stuffed. The Guinness Book of Records says they weighed 6lb 2oz (2.8kg) apiece, and measured her bust at 54G. She wore a specially engineered bra day and night and could not sleep on her stomach or her back (they interfered with her breathing). She was afraid to travel by plane in case they exploded.</p> <p>The breasts were not the only part of Ferrari that were not entirely natural. She had undergone multiple cosmetic surgery on her lips, cheeks, nose, forehead, eyebrows and stomach: 25 operations in five years. She was Miss Tits Europe, a smiling, collagen-crammed star of stage and screen, sort of. She had a song and striptease act that drew tens of thousands to nightclubs in France, Germany, Italy and Belgium; she was a regular on Channel 4's Eurotrash.</p> <p>Early on, she had also performed in a couple of hardcore skinflicks. Explicit pictures of her could be found on nearly 1,000 internet porn sites. But she had managed to get out of that and was trying to launch herself as a singer. Her first single was a bouncy Eurodisco number wittily entitled Airbag Generation. Her second, recorded just before she died 11 days ago, aged 30, was rather more bluesy. It was called Set Me Free.</p> <p>Lolo - les lolos is French for knockers, jugs, melons, what you will - was running from something. \"All this stuff,\" she once said, referring to the operations, \"has been because I can't stand life. But it hasn't changed anything. There are moments when I disconnect totally from reality. Then I can do anything, absolutely anything. I swallow pills. I throw myself out of windows. Dying seems very easy then.\"</p> <p>The night before she did die, Ferrari wasn't well. She had taken her usual fistful of antidepressants and sleeping pills - she was on 12mg of prescription uppers a day - but also some antibiotics for a bad sore throat. The autopsy's verdict was death by natural causes, but the results of a more detailed drug test, due out later this week, will establish whether it was a drug overdose that killed her.</p> <p>Her husband and manager, Eric Vigne, found her body in the upstairs bedroom of their modest house on the hillside above Grasse in the south of France. \"She had wanted to sleep alone,\" he says, \"so she could feel at ease, and cough without waking me up. So for once I slept downstairs. When I went up on the Sunday morning, I thought she was still sleeping. Her body was cold.\"</p> <p>Ferrari had very few friends. But people who took the time to talk to her seriously were invariably charmed. \"She would talk so intimately, so openly,\" says Elisabeth Alexandre, who spent several days with her for French Marie Claire magazine just after the big breast operation and the Cannes film festival of 1995 that really launched her on the world.</p> <p>\"She was really very touching. You wanted to imagine her in a dream world with a big, airy house and white bunny rabbits and pink butterflies and friends who would like her truly for what she was, not for the money they could make out of her. The reality was very different.\"</p> <p>Born Eve Valois in the central French town of Clermont-Ferrand in 1970, Ferrari was the second of four children, a bright and pretty girl. Her father, a senior official in France's nuclear energy programme, was relocated to Brittany when she was a toddler, and the family moved to the chic resort town of La Baule.</p> <p>There Eve went to the local lyc\u00e9e, finishing up with a respectable baccalaur\u00e9at. To her teachers and the rest of the outside world, she looked set for a solid and sensible career, perhaps in medicine or in teaching. But nobody, it seems, had seen how deeply a disastrously unhappy home life had already marked her.</p> <p>\"My mother told me I was ugly and stupid,\" she told one interviewer. \"She said I was only good for emptying chamber pots. I wanted to be an anaesthetist, but you can't learn with a mother like that. Actually, I'm like my mother. She thinks she's ugly too. When I was born, it was herself that she saw and she stuck all sorts of negative stuff on me. She did all she could to stop me living.\"</p> <p>To another interviewer, she went further: \"My mother was always very unhappy with my father. My father was this macho guy who was never there and deceived her openly. So she revenged herself on me. She told me I was revolting too, that no one would ever want me. She hit me sometimes with a riding crop. I was frightened and I was ashamed; I wanted to change my face, my body, to transform myself. I wanted to die, really.\"</p> <p>Eve left school and launched herself on a small-time modelling career, appearing in a couple of girlie mags. And then she met Eric Vigne. She was 17; he was 39. He was big, bearded, cool. A laid-back, child-of-the-60s manner hid the sharp mind of an entrepreneur.</p> <p>Vigne's urgent desire to make lots of money perfectly matched the teenager's urgent desire to ditch her body: they were married within a year. Two years later, in 1990, the operations began. Vigne encouraged her; it was he who designed her mouth and eyebrows and came up with the plans for her mammoth breasts. The newly named Lolo Ferrari - the surname, which led to a three-year legal battle with the Italian car company, was her maternal grandfather's - felt scared at first, but soon got used to it.</p> <p>\"For my mouth,\" she said in 1996, \"we removed my Cupid's bow, tucked the mucous membranes up to my nose, and filled my lips with collagen. There's no particularly odd feeling or anything, but I have to put lipsalve on all the time. I adore being operated on. I feel wonderful in clinics. I love the feeling of a general anaesthetic - falling into this black hole and knowing I'm being altered as I sleep.\"</p> <p>The breasts went first to 41in, then to 46in. They were desensitised and the skin was stretched nearly to bursting point. Ferrari lived in constant fear, as she mimed her songs and took off her clothes in club after club around Europe, that some madman would jump up on the stage and try to puncture them.</p> <p>Beyond 46in, it became increasingly hard to find a plastic surgeon willing to take on the job. A couple of years ago, Vigne described the operation that made her a monstrous 54G. \"I calculated the volume, the diameter, I drew up the plans and I took them to a guy I know who designs fuselage moulds for the aeronautics industry,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The designer made the moulds, and I gave them to a prosthetics maker who produced the empty silicone implants. It took a long, long time to find a surgeon willing to perform the operation. He removed the old implants and replaced them with the new. Each one was filled with two litres of serum. A bit later we increased it to three.\"</p> <p>Ferrari insisted she was happy with the changes that were made to her body. \"Having a big bust comforts me,\" she told yet another French interviewer. \"It makes me more sure of myself. I'm like a transvestite - I've created a femininity that's completely artificial. But I'd like to have even bigger breasts. I can't because there are medical problems - you can't stretch the skin any more.\"</p> <p>It frightened her, she said, to think of herself as skin, bone and blood. She wore a ring on every finger and dozens of bracelets and bangles; she painted her long fingernails pink. Her skin was the one thing she couldn't change, so she covered it with jewellery and makeup. If she didn't, she would have anxiety attacks, feeling, she said, that she was suddenly back with her old face.</p> <p>And, of course, none of it worked. Ferrari became completely estranged from her family and had not spoken to them for years at the time of her death. \"Every time they saw me, my parents told me to get my breasts shrunk and take off my rings and cut my high heels down,\" she said. \"When someone tells me something like that, I just want to die.\"</p> <p>Without meeting her, psychologists said Lolo probably suffered from the rare condition of dysmorphophobia - an irrational conviction that one's body is repulsive. Once embarked on that path, says a Paris psychiatrist, Fran\u00e7ois Chauchot, there is no going back.</p> <p>\"It's a vicious downward spiral,\" he says. \"It will never end, because no amount of operations will ever be enough to put the body right. Exterior appearance counts for more than personality; there's no distance any more. And when one more frustration appears, these people collapse easily - to the point, certainly, of suicide.\"</p> <p>Ferrari's progressive metamorphosis into a grotesquely proportioned inflatable doll looks like a long slow suicide. Vigne, who initially insisted she did not take her own life, now says Ferrari visited an undertaker before she died, chose a white coffin, and specified that she should be buried with her favourite teddy bear.</p> <p>\"She wanted to be a star,\" he says, \"but she couldn't bear living. She often said she'd kill herself if I wasn't there, and a few times she tried.\" But further than that he will not go. Nor will any of the other men who, despite all the signs that something here was dreadfully, horribly wrong, helped Eve to become Lolo, fuelled her fears and made money out of her malaise.</p> <p>The producers at Eurotrash, who were happy to show her dizzying cleavage fronting another dismal Eurohit or attempting some ordinary, everyday task for a laddish laugh, did not return phone calls. And Vigne, after five minutes of unashamed grief, hangs up with the words: \"Enough people have exploited me and Lolo already. If you want me to talk any more, you'll have to pay.\"</p>",

But she had managed to get out of that and was trying to launch herself as a singer. Her first single was a bouncy Eurodisco number wittily entitled Airbag Generation. Her second, recorded just before she died 11 days ago, aged 30, was rather more bluesy. It was called Set Me Free. Lolo - les lolos is French for knockers, jugs, melons, what you will - was running from something. \"All this stuff,\" she once said, referring to the operations, \"has been because I can't stand life. But it hasn't changed anything. There are moments when I disconnect totally from reality. Then I can do anything, absolutely anything. I swallow pills. I throw myself out of windows. Dying seems very easy then.\" The night before she did die, Ferrari wasn't well. She had taken her usual fistful of antidepressants and sleeping pills - she was on 12mg of prescription uppers a day - but also some antibiotics for a bad sore throat. The autopsy's verdict was death by natural causes, but the results of a more detailed drug test, due out later this week, will establish whether it was a drug overdose that killed her. Her husband and manager, Eric Vigne, found her body in the upstairs bedroom of their modest house on the hillside above Grasse in the south of France. \"She had wanted to sleep alone,\" he says, \"so she could feel at ease, and cough without waking me up. So for once I slept downstairs. When I went up on the Sunday morning, I thought she was still sleeping. Her body was cold.\" Ferrari had very few friends. But people who took the time to talk to her seriously were invariably charmed. \"She would talk so intimately, so openly,\" says Elisabeth Alexandre, who spent several days with her for French Marie Claire magazine just after the big breast operation and the Cannes film festival of 1995 that really launched her on the world. \"She was really very touching. You wanted to imagine her in a dream world with a big, airy house and white bunny rabbits and pink butterflies and friends who would like her truly for what she was, not for the money they could make out of her. The reality was very different.\" Born Eve Valois in the central French town of Clermont-Ferrand in 1970, Ferrari was the second of four children, a bright and pretty girl. Her father, a senior official in France's nuclear energy programme, was relocated to Brittany when she was a toddler, and the family moved to the chic resort town of La Baule. There Eve went to the local lyc\u00e9e, finishing up with a respectable baccalaur\u00e9at. To her teachers and the rest of the outside world, she looked set for a solid and sensible career, perhaps in medicine or in teaching. But nobody, it seems, had seen how deeply a disastrously unhappy home life had already marked her. \"My mother told me I was ugly and stupid,\" she told one interviewer. \"She said I was only good for emptying chamber pots. I wanted to be an anaesthetist, but you can't learn with a mother like that. Actually, I'm like my mother. She thinks she's ugly too. When I was born, it was herself that she saw and she stuck all sorts of negative stuff on me. She did all she could to stop me living.\" To another interviewer, she went further: \"My mother was always very unhappy with my father. My father was this macho guy who was never there and deceived her openly. So she revenged herself on me. She told me I was revolting too, that no one would ever want me. She hit me sometimes with a riding crop. I was frightened and I was ashamed; I wanted to change my face, my body, to transform myself. I wanted to die, really.\" Eve left school and launched herself on a small-time modelling career, appearing in a couple of girlie mags. And then she met Eric Vigne. She was 17; he was 39. He was big, bearded, cool. A laid-back, child-of-the-60s manner hid the sharp mind of an entrepreneur. Vigne's urgent desire to make lots of money perfectly matched the teenager's urgent desire to ditch her body: they were married within a year. Two years later, in 1990, the operations began. Vigne encouraged her; it was he who designed her mouth and eyebrows and came up with the plans for her mammoth breasts. The newly named Lolo Ferrari - the surname, which led to a three-year legal battle with the Italian car company, was her maternal grandfather's - felt scared at first, but soon got used to it. \"For my mouth,\" she said in 1996, \"we removed my Cupid's bow, tucked the mucous membranes up to my nose, and filled my lips with collagen. There's no particularly odd feeling or anything, but I have to put lipsalve on all the time. I adore being operated on. I feel wonderful in clinics. I love the feeling of a general anaesthetic - falling into this black hole and knowing I'm being altered as I sleep.\" The breasts went first to 41in, then to 46in. They were desensitised and the skin was stretched nearly to bursting point. Ferrari lived in constant fear, as she mimed her songs and took off her clothes in club after club around Europe, that some madman would jump up on the stage and try to puncture them. Beyond 46in, it became increasingly hard to find a plastic surgeon willing to take on the job. A couple of years ago, Vigne described the operation that made her a monstrous 54G. \"I calculated the volume, the diameter, I drew up the plans and I took them to a guy I know who designs fuselage moulds for the aeronautics industry,\" he said. \"The designer made the moulds, and I gave them to a prosthetics maker who produced the empty silicone implants. It took a long, long time to find a surgeon willing to perform the operation. He removed the old implants and replaced them with the new. Each one was filled with two litres of serum. A bit later we increased it to three.\" Ferrari insisted she was happy with the changes that were made to her body. \"Having a big bust comforts me,\" she told yet another French interviewer. \"It makes me more sure of myself. I'm like a transvestite - I've created a femininity that's completely artificial. But I'd like to have even bigger breasts. I can't because there are medical problems - you can't stretch the skin any more.\" It frightened her, she said, to think of herself as skin, bone and blood. She wore a ring on every finger and dozens of bracelets and bangles; she painted her long fingernails pink. Her skin was the one thing she couldn't change, so she covered it with jewellery and makeup. If she didn't, she would have anxiety attacks, feeling, she said, that she was suddenly back with her old face. And, of course, none of it worked. Ferrari became completely estranged from her family and had not spoken to them for years at the time of her death. \"Every time they saw me, my parents told me to get my breasts shrunk and take off my rings and cut my high heels down,\" she said. \"When someone tells me something like that, I just want to die.\" Without meeting her, psychologists said Lolo probably suffered from the rare condition of dysmorphophobia - an irrational conviction that one's body is repulsive. Once embarked on that path, says a Paris psychiatrist, Fran\u00e7ois Chauchot, there is no going back. \"It's a vicious downward spiral,\" he says. \"It will never end, because no amount of operations will ever be enough to put the body right. Exterior appearance counts for more than personality; there's no distance any more. And when one more frustration appears, these people collapse easily - to the point, certainly, of suicide.\" Ferrari's progressive metamorphosis into a grotesquely proportioned inflatable doll looks like a long slow suicide. Vigne, who initially insisted she did not take her own life, now says Ferrari visited an undertaker before she died, chose a white coffin, and specified that she should be buried with her favourite teddy bear. \"She wanted to be a star,\" he says, \"but she couldn't bear living. She often said she'd kill herself if I wasn't there, and a few times she tried.\" But further than that he will not go. Nor will any of the other men who, despite all the signs that something here was dreadfully, horribly wrong, helped Eve to become Lolo, fuelled her fears and made money out of her malaise. The producers at Eurotrash, who were happy to show her dizzying cleavage fronting another dismal Eurohit or attempting some ordinary, everyday task for a laddish laugh, did not return phone calls. And Vigne, after five minutes of unashamed grief, hangs up with the words: \"Enough people have exploited me and Lolo already. If you want me to talk any more, you'll have to pay.\"",

Mr Hall said Andersen had spent the relatively quiet second half of 1999 reinventing itself around the needs of electronic commerce.<br> Overall managing partner Joe Forehand said: \"The electronic economy is too new and fast changing for consultants to offer advice from the sidelines\". Ultimately, Mr Hall said, Andersen would like to drop the term \"consultant\" as its activities often overlapped with that of investment banks and other advisers.

      "bodyText": "Vodafone takes lead in bid fight The government's auction of five next generation mobile phone licences continued yesterday with 13 contenders switching their bids between licences as the auction moved to round 31. The highest offer of \u00a3541.4m by Vodafone was for licence B, while Eircom's subsidiary 3GUK muscled in with a \u00a3421m offer for licence A that has been reserved for a new operator. Telefonica was level pegging its bid for licence C at \u00a3211m, while NTL Mobile and TIW tied at \u00a3212m for licence E. News Corp backed One.Tel offered \u00a3206.9m for licence D. The offers for five licences have crept to \u00a31.6bn with the provisional announcement of the winners likely on March 24. Andersen disappoints Andersen, the international consultancy group, announced yesterday that it had boosted revenues 8% in 1999 to \u00a35.6bn. UK managing partner James Hall said he was \"a bit disappointed\" by the lack of growth and blamed the fact that clients had drawn in their horns mid-year, ahead of anticipated Y2K bug problems. Mr Hall said Andersen had spent the relatively quiet second half of 1999 reinventing itself around the needs of electronic commerce. Overall managing partner Joe Forehand said: \"The electronic economy is too new and fast changing for consultants to offer advice from the sidelines\". Ultimately, Mr Hall said, Andersen would like to drop the term \"consultant\" as its activities often overlapped with that of investment banks and other advisers. Andersen is in the middle of a lengthy divorce from Arthur Andersen, the accountancy practice from which it emerged. HSBC launches new service HSBC Holdings HSBC Holdings said that it had launched HSBC Premier, its first global banking service for personal customers. Free access to current account funds through any HSBC cash machine and free cheque encashment are two of the services provided by the new service. In addition to these features are a global calling card and free internet services. Unions take up euro cause Four of Britain's big trade unions launched a campaign in favour of the euro, criticising the government for its lukewarm approach to the single currency. \"Had arguments been pressed more heavily, Europe would be more popular,\" said John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general workers' union.",

      "body": "<p>Bargain fashion chain Matalan yesterday unveiled plans to create 2,000 jobs in 18 new out-of-town superstores in the next eight months. </p> <p>Fashion retail is one of the toughest businesses to make money in and for any other chain such a plan would be regarded as a bold move. But Matalan has bucked almost every trend in its sector in the past 12 months. </p> <p>The company is now the UK's fastest growing fashion chain. The outlets will be around 30,000sq ft - the same size as an average Tesco and half as big again as the chain's existing outlets. </p> <p>The group, founded in 1985 by Liverpudlian ex-market stallholder John Hargreaves, and modelled on US discounter WalMart, was one of the few retail success stories last year. </p> <p>While rivals struggled for sales, Matalan was raking in cash. Over Christmas its like-for-like sales climbed 19.2%. The product range covers womens, mens and kids clothing in own brand labels but also includes must-have labels like Wonderbra, Sloggi, Calvin Klein and Versace. </p> <p>The company floated in May 1998 at 285p and its shares rocketed to \u00a327 before they were split to improve marketability. Earlier this month they hit a peak of 662p - compared to a recalculated initial float price of some 50p - and yesterday they added 12.5p to finish at 530p. The bulk of the shares are still held by Mr Hargreaves - and his holding has created a scarcity value - but Matalan now has 1.7% of the UK fashion market and is valued at around \u00a32bn (or more than rivals Debenhams, Arcadia and New Look put together). </p> <p>The first of the new mega-store formats will open tomorrow week in St Helens, Merseyside with 100 new staff. The store count will reach 117 by the end of this year and the company plans to operate 200 outlets by 2005. </p> <p>Most analysts remain big fans. Seymour Pierce, for example rates the group \"a class act\", with excellent trading. But it stops short of a buy recommendation - reckoning that the price is up with events.</p>",

But Matalan has bucked almost every trend in its sector in the past 12 months. The company is now the UK's fastest growing fashion chain. The outlets will be around 30,000sq ft - the same size as an average Tesco and half as big again as the chain's existing outlets. The group, founded in 1985 by Liverpudlian ex-market stallholder John Hargreaves, and modelled on US discounter WalMart, was one of the few retail success stories last year. While rivals struggled for sales, Matalan was raking in cash. Over Christmas its like-for-like sales climbed 19.2%. The product range covers womens, mens and kids clothing in own brand labels but also includes must-have labels like Wonderbra, Sloggi, Calvin Klein and Versace. The company floated in May 1998 at 285p and its shares rocketed to \u00a327 before they were split to improve marketability. Earlier this month they hit a peak of 662p - compared to a recalculated initial float price of some 50p - and yesterday they added 12.5p to finish at 530p. The bulk of the shares are still held by Mr Hargreaves - and his holding has created a scarcity value - but Matalan now has 1.7% of the UK fashion market and is valued at around \u00a32bn (or more than rivals Debenhams, Arcadia and New Look put together). The first of the new mega-store formats will open tomorrow week in St Helens, Merseyside with 100 new staff. The store count will reach 117 by the end of this year and the company plans to operate 200 outlets by 2005. Most analysts remain big fans. Seymour Pierce, for example rates the group \"a class act\", with excellent trading. But it stops short of a buy recommendation - reckoning that the price is up with events.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To get to Douglas Gordon's flat in a 19th-century Glasgow tenement you have to go up a spiralling staircase. You fumble for a light switch. You hear a door open above. Up there it's very dark. </p> <p>This moment of anxiety recalls the installation Feature Film that Gordon created in London with Artangel last year, a film of conductor James Conlon's hands leading an orchestra through Bernard Herrmann's score for Hitchcock's Vertigo. The best joke was getting to it up a spiral staircase and realising halfway that you had \"become\" James Stewart trying to get up the stairs of the mission tower. You might also think of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped (Gordon, a Stevenson fan, has published a book called Kidnapping): there, the young narrator stays with his malicious uncle who sends him to bed at the top of the house. The staircase gives way... </p> <p>At the top of the stairs, however, Gordon's flat is bright and modern, with lots of technological equipment and a fridge that appears to be full of personalised beer from the company that sponsored Feature Film. </p> <p>Gordon's successes include the 1996 Turner Prize, the 1998 Hugo Boss prize - America's closest equivalent to the Turner - and a string of shows at European museums. He currently has a retrospective at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne in Paris, and later this year a show at the Liverpool Tate, a two-header with Turner. He characterises himself as \"a mild mannered but incredibly competitive person\", and he makes it clear exactly what the scale of this ambition is. He loves the work of Barnett Newman and Richard Serra, and says he's \"competing against that, not against Damien and Rachel\". Tough talk, but the show in Paris is special. Fascinating, disconcerting, it lingers in your mind like a nightmare. </p> <p>Within the museum's vast space, he has built a funhouse - or is it a minotaur's labyrinth? The exhibition is called Sheep and Goats, a Biblical allusion that confused the French, who thought it had something to do with BSE. Inside, everything is dark, the walls painted black, the only light coming from monitors and projections hidden through the space. You are faced with a choice between a red and a blue curtain. There are secret doors, mirrors and passageways. Monitors display bits of Gordon's body fighting each other: a portrait of the artist as a divided self. </p> <p>At the centre is a room where you watch films shown in Glasgow between December 1965 and September 1966, when Gordon's mother was carrying him in her womb; from Spartacus to that year's Bond - \"My mum was a great Sean Connery fan\" - to the Hammer shocker The Nanny. </p> <p>Other surprises lie in wait. A photograph of the artist hitching, trying to attract motorists' sympathy with a sign that reads Psycho, leads to a remote space where his 1993 installation 24 Hour Psycho is showing in solitary menace. Yet the most uncomfortable thing in the show is a brightly lit space in which are written the names of all the people Gordon acknowledges knowing. The list is alienating, irritating, frightening. He does not know you. You are cast out. </p> <p>To be an artist is to tell a story about yourself. In this show Gordon sets out his melancholy artistic autobiography which is also an essay about autobiography and the idea of the \"retrospective\". He is reluctant to admit it is autobiographical, which is typical of the misdirection that runs through his art. Yet he loves to recount the highlights of his life. It is no surprise when he says, \"I didn't want to be an artist; I wanted to be a writer.\" </p> <p>Slumped on a beanbag in his front room, not far from what Hitchcock in The 39 Steps called \"the bright lights of Sauchiehall Street\", he tells me his story. It goes like this: Douglas Gordon was born in Glasgow in 1966 to a Protestant family. His father was a pattern-maker in the city's shipbuilding industry. In 1972 his mother converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses, so he was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness and had no more birthday parties after that date. He knocked on doors and was inculcated with a literal belief in Satan. Gordon is close to his parents, who encouraged him to become an artist; he often discusses his work with them. His background is imprinted on everything he does. He met the devil in a bar in Berlin in 1998: \"I saw him. With horns and stuff. Absolutely true. I'd still love to go back to Berlin.\" </p> <p>Brought up in a God-fearing family, Gordon loved to watch film, mainly on TV. His art exults in the wickedness of cinema. There's a lassitude to the way he makes art, an explicit departure from the straight and narrow. He got the idea for 24 Hour Psycho sitting around at his parents' house watching a video of the film, slowing it down in an effort to see Janet Leigh more closely in the scene where Norman spies on her undressing. \"I've never believed in that inspiration stuff,\" he says. \"I think if anybody lounged around as much as I do and watched as much TV as I do they'd probably come up with the same works...\" </p> <p>Most of his film memories are of seeing films on television - John Ford's The Searchers was a family favourite and he has since proposed a version that lasts five years, the time it takes John Wayne to find the girl kidnapped by Apaches. He has a vivid inpression of Glasgow cinemas as exotic buildings. \"Walking past a cinema in the old days when cinemas had production stills outside, I remember looking at A Clockwork Orange and being dragged away. I remember that, and also Last Tango in Paris - of course the stills would show nothing.\" When he was seven? And isn't this straight out of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Day for Night? \"I've still never seen A Clockwork Orange properly. Last Tango's a different story - I've seen that too many times. I want my work to have the impact that I felt watching a movie in the afternoon, going in the sunlight. You come out and it's difficult to relate to people. I remember it vividly with Last Tango in Paris, being pretty shaken by it, coming out from the matinee - it was dark - going to a bar and having a drink. You look at a girl and what do you think about, compared with what you've just seen?\" </p> <p>In his Paris exhibition, you enter a room where three black-and-white images are unreeling on a wall. It takes a while to realise this is the same film, with the same characters, at different times in the action. Gradually, the voices and shadows take on a structure. At the far left, a man is in a doctor's room being given bad news - the worst. He has less than 24 hours to live. He has been poisoned; there is no cure. The man rages. On the next screen, the same man is just starting to talk to the doctor. On the furthest screen he's running up the steps into the building. </p> <p>This is Gordon's latest work, D\u00e9j\u00e0-Vu, an installation screening the 1950 film noir D.O.A. at three speeds. The film turns into sculpture. It weighs on you. To know that you are going to die and also to be living a continual loop. It's a hellish but competely truthful image: we all know we are going to die, but we have to live as if we are not. </p> <p>It comes as a shock when he claims he can't bear to watch horror films. He talks about Dead of Night, a 1945 British horror film that, like his Paris installation, turns on the idea of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In his favourite scene a man sees a hearse whose driver says \"Just room for one inside\" and then doesn't get on a bus because the conductor says the same thing. The bus crashes. </p> <p>\"That is the most creepy film. I remember one night I was on my own and Dead of Night came on the TV. I couldn't watch it, I was so frightened. The way I was brought up, I think I've never actually watched a horror film, ever. I still haven't watched The Exorcist, though I've used it in a work. I cannot; it's too much. Rosemary's Baby freaked me out so much I couldn't even watch a John Cassavetes film afterwards. Have you seen The Blair Witch Project? I won't see it.\" </p> <p>So how could he watch Psycho? \"That's not a horror film - it's not frightening at all. Horror films are irrational. The great thing about Hitchcock is that it's totally rational. You identify with her and him.\" Hitchcock is more like Shakespeare, according to Gordon: there's a moral order beyond the violence. In Rosemary's Baby there is no order, no reason: \"Nobody wants to live in an apartment block where your partner is going to get fucked by the devil.\" </p> <p>Gordon is the best of adverts for the Turner Prize. Since he won it, he has produced rich and ambitious work, culminating in his Paris show dealing with memory, identity - and judgment. The title Sheep and Goats is intended in all seriousness as a Biblical image of the saved and the damned, with the implication that you are saved as a sheep, or condemned as a goat, according to which path you take through the exhibition. \"There are so many choices to make that you leave not knowing what you are,\" says Gordon. But could the title also be saying something about the British art that emerged in the 90s and is due for some critical scrutiny? </p> <p>Sheep and Goats is a major retrospective in a major museum. In June it will be followed by Gordon's first retrospective at a British museum when Tate Liverpool shows him in tandem with Turner. This exhibition, curated by Mark Francis, former director of the Andy Warhol Museum, explicitly compares Gordon's use of darkness and light to the Romantic painter. Sheep or goat. I think Douglas Gordon knows exactly which he is. </p> <p>\u0095 Douglas Gordon: Sheep and Goats is at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne, Avenue de Pr\u00e9sident Wilson, Paris (00 33 1 53 67 40 00), till April 30.

      "bodyText": "To get to Douglas Gordon's flat in a 19th-century Glasgow tenement you have to go up a spiralling staircase. You fumble for a light switch. You hear a door open above. Up there it's very dark. This moment of anxiety recalls the installation Feature Film that Gordon created in London with Artangel last year, a film of conductor James Conlon's hands leading an orchestra through Bernard Herrmann's score for Hitchcock's Vertigo. The best joke was getting to it up a spiral staircase and realising halfway that you had \"become\" James Stewart trying to get up the stairs of the mission tower. You might also think of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped (Gordon, a Stevenson fan, has published a book called Kidnapping): there, the young narrator stays with his malicious uncle who sends him to bed at the top of the house. The staircase gives way... At the top of the stairs, however, Gordon's flat is bright and modern, with lots of technological equipment and a fridge that appears to be full of personalised beer from the company that sponsored Feature Film. Gordon's successes include the 1996 Turner Prize, the 1998 Hugo Boss prize - America's closest equivalent to the Turner - and a string of shows at European museums. He currently has a retrospective at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne in Paris, and later this year a show at the Liverpool Tate, a two-header with Turner. He characterises himself as \"a mild mannered but incredibly competitive person\", and he makes it clear exactly what the scale of this ambition is. He loves the work of Barnett Newman and Richard Serra, and says he's \"competing against that, not against Damien and Rachel\". Tough talk, but the show in Paris is special. Fascinating, disconcerting, it lingers in your mind like a nightmare. Within the museum's vast space, he has built a funhouse - or is it a minotaur's labyrinth? The exhibition is called Sheep and Goats, a Biblical allusion that confused the French, who thought it had something to do with BSE. Inside, everything is dark, the walls painted black, the only light coming from monitors and projections hidden through the space. You are faced with a choice between a red and a blue curtain. There are secret doors, mirrors and passageways. Monitors display bits of Gordon's body fighting each other: a portrait of the artist as a divided self. At the centre is a room where you watch films shown in Glasgow between December 1965 and September 1966, when Gordon's mother was carrying him in her womb; from Spartacus to that year's Bond - \"My mum was a great Sean Connery fan\" - to the Hammer shocker The Nanny. Other surprises lie in wait. A photograph of the artist hitching, trying to attract motorists' sympathy with a sign that reads Psycho, leads to a remote space where his 1993 installation 24 Hour Psycho is showing in solitary menace. Yet the most uncomfortable thing in the show is a brightly lit space in which are written the names of all the people Gordon acknowledges knowing. The list is alienating, irritating, frightening. He does not know you. You are cast out. To be an artist is to tell a story about yourself. In this show Gordon sets out his melancholy artistic autobiography which is also an essay about autobiography and the idea of the \"retrospective\". He is reluctant to admit it is autobiographical, which is typical of the misdirection that runs through his art. Yet he loves to recount the highlights of his life. It is no surprise when he says, \"I didn't want to be an artist; I wanted to be a writer.\" Slumped on a beanbag in his front room, not far from what Hitchcock in The 39 Steps called \"the bright lights of Sauchiehall Street\", he tells me his story. It goes like this: Douglas Gordon was born in Glasgow in 1966 to a Protestant family. His father was a pattern-maker in the city's shipbuilding industry. In 1972 his mother converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses, so he was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness and had no more birthday parties after that date. He knocked on doors and was inculcated with a literal belief in Satan. Gordon is close to his parents, who encouraged him to become an artist; he often discusses his work with them. His background is imprinted on everything he does. He met the devil in a bar in Berlin in 1998: \"I saw him. With horns and stuff. Absolutely true. I'd still love to go back to Berlin.\" Brought up in a God-fearing family, Gordon loved to watch film, mainly on TV. His art exults in the wickedness of cinema. There's a lassitude to the way he makes art, an explicit departure from the straight and narrow. He got the idea for 24 Hour Psycho sitting around at his parents' house watching a video of the film, slowing it down in an effort to see Janet Leigh more closely in the scene where Norman spies on her undressing. \"I've never believed in that inspiration stuff,\" he says. \"I think if anybody lounged around as much as I do and watched as much TV as I do they'd probably come up with the same works...\" Most of his film memories are of seeing films on television - John Ford's The Searchers was a family favourite and he has since proposed a version that lasts five years, the time it takes John Wayne to find the girl kidnapped by Apaches.

      "body": "<p>The captain of the plane has just finished explaining why we are still parked up in Heathrow. We should be in the air, he says, but we're waiting for someone to arrive. That someone is Ross Noble, one of Britain's most gifted - and least punctual - comedians. </p> <p>At 23, Noble has almost achieved his \"lifetime ambition\" of travelling the world, thanks chiefly to his talent and the willingness of foreign comedy clubs to pay for his flights and rooms. But Noble is no Vegas comedian with a sparkly suit and a dull line in universal material. His performances are usually wholly improvised and see him weaving gold out of the barest, blandest details of his audience's lives. A man who works in IT is as likely to spark off brilliantly surreal material as a man who feeds the elephants in a zoo. </p> <p>It was this fascinating ability to think on his feet that got Noble shortlisted for a Perrier award at last year's Edinburgh festival. And now it's taking him to Budapest, then Warsaw. At least, that's the plan. </p> <p>Finally, Noble boards the plane, a mass of blue coat and wild hair. \"Sorry I'm late,\" he says as he takes his seat. \"I got distracted by something.\" </p> <p>Some hours later, waiting at a bleak Budapest tram stop for a once again very late Noble, I realise I should have checked whether or not he owns a watch. When he does arrive, he again mutters something about having been \"distracted by something\". He's brought a small MiniDisc recorder with him, to make his own comedy and travel programme for Radio 4, which he brings out at odd intervals and which attracts even more attention than his shock of brightly coloured hair. </p> <p>The gig tonight is at a local theatre, the Merlin. We've a few hours to kill, and a few things to see, so we take it easy. Our tram eventually arrives, yellow, screeching and with blank, dour faces pressed up against each grimy and scratched window. Inside, the tram is just one slow-moving earthquake - a deafening mix of metal, stone and, bizarrely, bells. </p> <p>As we shudder towards the centre of town, the sky is dark, but the river Danube darker. \"It's not quite as blue as I'd hoped it was going to be, I'll be honest,\" says Noble, about to take the thought further but distracted instead by Gellert Hill, one of Budapest's most impressive landmarks. It's a cliff, well over 100m high, named after the Venetian bishop Gerardus, a man supposedly responsible for converting the Magyars to Christianity in the 11th century. Vengeful heathens finally took hold of Gerardus and, a local informs us, \"tied the monk to a wheelbarrow, and tossed him off\". </p> <p>\"So is that a statue of him up there at the top of the hill?\" asks Noble in his Newcastle accent, \"because if it is, d'you not think they should have put it at the bottom, all smashed up?\" The man laughs uneasily, looks slightly confused and wanders away. </p> <p>Twenty minutes later, Noble and I have clambered to the top of the hill, where we take in a view so picturesque that, as Noble points out, even the two teenagers sniffing glue a few feet from the summit can't spoil it. But it's a hard climb. \"I don't blame that Gellert fella for taking the wheelbarrow option down,\" says Noble. \"I can't face the walk, either.\" </p> <p>Eager to escape the bitter cold, we take a bus towards a local market. Noble, it transpires, is a keen collector of knick-knacks, trinkets and - let's face it - tat. There are many stalls, but it soon becomes clear that Noble and I are the sole customers. </p> <p>In one row of five stalls you might walk away with a gun, a dancing wind-up monkey, some Chinese pornography, an old toilet, a sofa or some Nazi paraphernalia. Noble, however, spots an old accordion. \"Oh, listen, this always happens to me. I walk into a place like this, see something like that and instantly think that I've always wanted one. If we don't get away from this stall, I'll end up buying that accordion.\" We walk swiftly away. Within 15 minutes, at the other side of the market, Noble has bought a banjo. </p> <p>We make it to the Merlin a little before nine. We would have been there earlier, but Noble got \"distracted by something\". It's an incredibly ornate building from the outside, but the stage is set up in a bare, L-shaped room, which Noble manages to use in a great piece of improvised comedy. Then he talks about the trams we took today, the baths we passed, the streets we walked and the hill we climbed. </p> <p>The audience appreciate the effort and want to join in. \"What's the story with that monk who jumped off the cliff?\" asks Noble at one point. \"He was pushed!\" shouts a man in the audience, prompting Noble to launch into a fantastical story about monks with an interest in extreme sports, grassy knolls and bungee ropes made of tapestries. </p> <p>Ninety minutes later, we've learnt much about Budapest, including the fact that Gerardus was pushed off the cliff not in a wheelbarrow but in an internally spiked barrel - something Noble later terms \"a specific Hungarian monk-related disposal unit\", which causes one man to slap another on the back then drop his pint. </p> <p>The next morning we arrive in Warsaw after a painful 12-hour train journey. At each border, men in uniform would enter our tiny cabin and demand to see our passports, followed by more men in uniform - customs. Each group would wake us, stamp our documents and grumpily leave - a total of six times. </p> <p>A cab takes us straight to Dziesieciolecia stadium, home to one of Europe's largest car-boot sales. Noble spots an antique mandolin. \"Now, I have actually genuinely always wanted one of them,\" he says, \"but I can't buy that, else I'll end up buying loads of other stuff I don't need.\" Within half an hour he is walking away with a white fur hat, some binoculars and the laser sights from a Russian sniper rifle. Each item is referred to in his show, in the basement of the Marriott Hotel - probably qualifying them as tax-deductible. </p> <p>That night at Warsaw airport I lose sight of Noble as our baggage is being inspected but soon hear him trying to tell someone who patently speaks no English what he's doing with the laser sights, and how he's not a spy or anything. It's more than 30 minutes before he reappears. </p> <p>By now we're supposed to be boarding. What happened? \"Nothing,\" he says. \"They let me straight through.\" So why the half-hour wait? \"Oh, I just got distracted by something.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Ross Noble's next UK gig is at the Komedia, Brighton (01273 647100), on May 20.</p>",

Having impressed so often since the turn of the year, the Anfield club appear to be working studiously towards ensuring that their season ends in anti-climax. While the solitary point they gathered from an untidy game was sufficient, just, to move them back into the Premiership's top three they have lost their way somewhat. Blessed with a watertight defence, they are not losing - but it is wins they need as they seek the money pot of Champions League qualification. Had their finishing not been so wretched, a win they would certainly have had. Not until the evening's final quarter did Aston Villa show any interest in building upon the one point they held at kick-off. Liverpool's opportunity to collect a maximum return came and went just after the half-hour when they paid a high price for what many would see as a curious decision to allow Michael Owen to take a penalty awarded after Gareth Southgate had felled Patrik Berger. After just 15 minutes of senior football in eight hamstrung weeks Owen - not Berger, not Emile Heskey - stepped forwards to place the ball on the spot. His kick was ferocious but struck the underside of the crossbar before dropping down. Believing the ball had fallen behind the line, Owen, fleetingly, raised his arms in triumph; he was to be disappointed. It was not Owen's night. The Boy Wonder missed several chances he would normally have been expected to take, most notably in the 13th minute when he latched on to Steven Gerrard's fine pass only to steer his shot tamely into the legs of the Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman. The recovery of Owen welcome though it may have been for club and country, did no favours for Anfield's latest cult figure, the Dutchman Erik Meijer, whose reward for a tireless display against Sunderland at the weekend was demotion to the substitutes' bench. As the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier embraces the system of squad rotation, many will be called upon but many more left disappointed in the years that lie ahead. Heskey was another young man who was to endure a less than satisfying night. The youngster tried manfully to suppress a natural instinct to drift out towards the touchline but, sadly, without too much success. Villa's role was of a supporting nature but with Paul Merson and Steve Stone energetic and enthusiastic in central midfield their counter-attacks, rare though they were, did hold at least a measure of promise. They went close just once, Julian Joachim drifting around St\u00e9phane Henchoz only to cross tamely into the area when the goal lay at his mercy. Owen should have won the game for Liverpool shortly before his inevitable withdrawal just after the hour. Having found himself on the end of Heskey's nicely weighted and intelligent pass he should have done rather more than lift his shot over the crossbar from 10 or so yards. The impressive David Thompson was to go a little closer shortly afterwards but Enckelman was equal to the task, throwing himself down to block one of only a handful of shots which Liverpool were to land on what proved to be a most elusive target.",

With luck, somebody will have caught its exhilarating live work for a disc. </p> <p>The tightness of the band generally sidelined preoccupations about solo stars, but James Carter's roaring baritone solos, a mixture of swing geniality and paint-stripping Coltranesque ferocity, were sensational throughout the show. Carter's building of solo odysseys from close-to-the-beat stalking, through whirling fast runs and out into blasting abstractions, and his urgent relationship with Mark Mondesir, put a crucial charge under the band. Jean-Baptiste, a sometime sax player, now restricts himself entirely to clarinet and bass clarinet, with a pure and penetrating sound on the former and a rich, reverberating eloquence on the latter that meshed expressively with Carter's guttural harangues. Jean-Baptiste uses the tone palette of his unusual group well, his arrangements imparting fresh resonances to fairly conventional funky and Latin themes, and borrowing elements from reggae, classical music and Eastern European folk without making them sound like jazz composer's tourism. </p> <p>Zoe Rahman's subtle turns of the expected melody line and playful trills, where a stretch of Latin-piano chord-slugging might have done, also galvanise the band. Her poise, imagination and technique are clearly qualities on the rise. There's even some straight jazz grooving, notably on the occasional fast blues, and Carter's deep appreciation of the swing-sax tradition is set alight by it.

      "body": "<p>Scottish Radio Holdings yesterday launched a \u00a3116m hostile bid for Border Television, one of only two independent ITV companies left in the UK. </p> <p>The company gave details of its unsolicited offer after a meeting between the two sides on Monday ended in Border directors deciding to fight the bid. The Scottish Radio offer is also understood to have elicited approaches to Border from Capital Radio, Scottish Media Group, Chrysalis and Kelvin Mackenzie's Wireless Group, raising the prospect of a bidding war. </p> <p>Other candidates that have run the slide rule over Border include Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian newspaper. </p> <p>Shares in Border climbed 19% to \u00a310.75, just a penny below Scottish Radio's all-paper offer of \u00a310.76 per share. A cash alternative is on offer of \u00a310.25 a share. </p> <p>One beneficiary of a bid battle would be Labour peer and arts presenter Lord (Melvyn) Bragg - pictured left - a former Border director who still holds more than 100,000 shares. </p> <p>Scottish Radio chief executive Richard Findlay called on Border to be \"realistic\" about its future as an independent company. \"The whole media sector is consolidating and if they want to serve properly their viewers and listeners, shareholders and staff they are better off with us,\" he said. </p> <p>Scottish Radio held talks with Border two years ago when the offer on the table was at \u00a34 a share. The new bid is at a premium of 31% to the Border price last Thursday, the day before speculation over an impending bid forced Scottish Radio to make a statement. </p> <p>A merged business would put Border's four radio stations in with the Scottish Radio's 15 franchises in Scotland and Ireland. Scottish Radio suggested that its long experience in the sector would enable it to make better use of Border's assets. </p> <p>If successful, Scottish Radio, which also owns local newspapers and an outdoor advertising business, would retain the TV station. \"It may be small but even a speck of gold glisters,\" Mr Findlay said. </p> <p>Paul Corley, Border's chief executive, said the Scottish Radio offer did not represent fair value. \"Everything has a price,\" he said. \"But the board's stated aim is to remain independent and we have a very strong year ahead of us. Our existing radio businesses should begin to mature and we are going for new licences.\" </p> <p>He expected changes to the broadcasting act next year to remove limits on owning both radio and ITV stations, which could send the value of smaller independents soaring. </p> <p>If Border falls, Ulster would be left as Britain's only independent ITV contractor.</p>",

The company gave details of its unsolicited offer after a meeting between the two sides on Monday ended in Border directors deciding to fight the bid. The Scottish Radio offer is also understood to have elicited approaches to Border from Capital Radio, Scottish Media Group, Chrysalis and Kelvin Mackenzie's Wireless Group, raising the prospect of a bidding war. Other candidates that have run the slide rule over Border include Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian newspaper. Shares in Border climbed 19% to \u00a310.75, just a penny below Scottish Radio's all-paper offer of \u00a310.76 per share. A cash alternative is on offer of \u00a310.25 a share. One beneficiary of a bid battle would be Labour peer and arts presenter Lord (Melvyn) Bragg - pictured left - a former Border director who still holds more than 100,000 shares. Scottish Radio chief executive Richard Findlay called on Border to be \"realistic\" about its future as an independent company. \"The whole media sector is consolidating and if they want to serve properly their viewers and listeners, shareholders and staff they are better off with us,\" he said. Scottish Radio held talks with Border two years ago when the offer on the table was at \u00a34 a share. The new bid is at a premium of 31% to the Border price last Thursday, the day before speculation over an impending bid forced Scottish Radio to make a statement. A merged business would put Border's four radio stations in with the Scottish Radio's 15 franchises in Scotland and Ireland. Scottish Radio suggested that its long experience in the sector would enable it to make better use of Border's assets. If successful, Scottish Radio, which also owns local newspapers and an outdoor advertising business, would retain the TV station. \"It may be small but even a speck of gold glisters,\" Mr Findlay said. Paul Corley, Border's chief executive, said the Scottish Radio offer did not represent fair value. \"Everything has a price,\" he said. \"But the board's stated aim is to remain independent and we have a very strong year ahead of us. Our existing radio businesses should begin to mature and we are going for new licences.\" He expected changes to the broadcasting act next year to remove limits on owning both radio and ITV stations, which could send the value of smaller independents soaring. If Border falls, Ulster would be left as Britain's only independent ITV contractor.",
