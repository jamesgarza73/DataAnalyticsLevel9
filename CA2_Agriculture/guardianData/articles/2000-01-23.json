As usual he took a moment to chide those directors who had not managed to contribute to the latest issue. </p> <p>Swanton himself kept writing to the end. The doyen of all cricket correspondents wrote his first piece in May 1926 for All Sports Weekly , a profile of Frank Woolley; his last appears in this month's Cricketer . In between he wrote more than eight million words, mostly on cricket but also, sporadically, on football, rugby and golf. </p> <p>After leaving Cranleigh, he worked with the London Evening Standard from 1927-39. Then after the War, during which he was a prisoner in the hands of the Japanese, he was the Daily Telegraph 's cricket correspondent for 30 years. In the meantime he was appointed editorial director of The Cricketer in 1966. He was also on hand when the first live cricket commentaries were broadcast. Soon his summaries of the day's play in those familiar patrician tones became minor works of art. 'But let me begin by reading the card...' </p> <p>In addition to all that, Swanton wrote more than 20 books on the game as well as founding his own itinerant cricket team, the Arabs CC, who roamed the Commonwealth and often included the likes of Richie Benaud and Colin Ingleby-MacKenzie. He himself was a useful cricketer who appeared for Middlesex against the universities in 1937 and 1938. And he helped to launch the writing careers of many of our established correspondents. John Woodcock, Christopher Martin-Jenkins and, very briefly, Scyld Berry all began their careers in cricket in Swanton's employment, dictating, though never having the temerity to amend, his copy. No wonder his autobiography was entitled, albeit with uncharacteristic modesty, Sort of A Cricket Person. </p> <p>There have always been those, quite often his closest friends, who felt that Swanton's pomposity needed to be pricked now and then. Brian Johnston, when spotting smoke emanating from a distant St John's Wood chimney, once famously remarked: 'Now they've elected Swanton Pope.' In his latter days the accusation had less force; in my experience Swanton was increasingly capable of laughing at himself and his pathological aversion to coloured clothing, the no-ball law, unshaven cricketers, the sweep and, heaven forfend, the reverse sweep. </p> <p>Attending Cricketer board meetings with Swanton present were a joy. Often the agenda would be discarded and the topic of conversation would shift on to the relative merits of Woolley or Bradman or Hammond.</p> <p>Then came the realisation that Swanton had seen all these men play, that he knew most of them personally. In fact Swanton was told that he was in his pram when WG Grace made 140 for London County against Forest Hill in 1907, though he never presumed to describe that innings. But he could tell you which way the wind was blowing at Lord's when Woolley, his cricketing hero, opened the batting for England with Jack Hobbs in 1930. His longevity added to his authority. </p> <p>The one regret of his professional career must have been his absence from the greatest cricketing story in history, the Bodyline tour of 1932-33. During the summer of 1932, when working for the Evening Standard , he was covering the game between Essex and Yorkshire at Leyton when Holmes and Sutcliffe scored a record 555 for the first wicket. His paper was, in Swanton's words, 'last in the queue' for the one public telephone box available and his copy missed the edition. </p> <p>As a consequence he was not sent to Australia; instead the job went to the paper's tennis correspondent, Bruce Harris. There is scope for thinking - albeit mischievously - that Bodyline would not have taken place had Swanton been there. It's not difficult to imagine him striding up to Jardine and saying, 'Now, look here Douglas, this has got to stop', and Jardine sedately acquiescing. </p> <p>He was undoubtedly an establishment man. With tongue in cheek (I think) he accosted me when he heard that I was going to start scribbling for this newspaper a decade ago: 'What are you doing working for that pinko rag?' In the corridors of power at Kent, where he served on the committee for decades, he would have been in favour of the likes of Chris Cowdrey and Matthew Fleming rather than the more proletarian Chris Tavare or Steve Marsh. In his last piece, which encompassed the men of influence of the last century, he included amateur stalwarts such as Lord Harris, Plum Warner, Gubby Allen and Harry Altham, men of his ilk. Raymond Illingworth was always unlikely to be included. But also there was Sir Frank Worrell. </p> <p>Swanton was not so blinkered as many of his peers over the issue of South Africa. Throughout his lifetime he spent many happy months in Barbados, which may have contributed to his spotting the evils of apartheid sooner than many in the cricketing establishment. </p> <p>He was stunned by the omission of Basil D'Oliveira in 1968 and after much agonising wrote that the 1970 tour of England by the South Africans should be called off. This was radical stuff for the Telegraph cricket correspondent. At an election party soon after at the Savoy, he recalled how the then deputy editor had expressed surprise at Swanton's smiling presence: 'Oh, I thought you had gone over to the enemy.' </p> <p>Swanton remained an independent, quick-witted thinker to the end. From now on Cricketer board meetings will be gloomier affairs.</p>",

There is scope for thinking - albeit mischievously - that Bodyline would not have taken place had Swanton been there. It's not difficult to imagine him striding up to Jardine and saying, 'Now, look here Douglas, this has got to stop', and Jardine sedately acquiescing. He was undoubtedly an establishment man. With tongue in cheek (I think) he accosted me when he heard that I was going to start scribbling for this newspaper a decade ago: 'What are you doing working for that pinko rag?' In the corridors of power at Kent, where he served on the committee for decades, he would have been in favour of the likes of Chris Cowdrey and Matthew Fleming rather than the more proletarian Chris Tavare or Steve Marsh. In his last piece, which encompassed the men of influence of the last century, he included amateur stalwarts such as Lord Harris, Plum Warner, Gubby Allen and Harry Altham, men of his ilk. Raymond Illingworth was always unlikely to be included. But also there was Sir Frank Worrell. Swanton was not so blinkered as many of his peers over the issue of South Africa. Throughout his lifetime he spent many happy months in Barbados, which may have contributed to his spotting the evils of apartheid sooner than many in the cricketing establishment. He was stunned by the omission of Basil D'Oliveira in 1968 and after much agonising wrote that the 1970 tour of England by the South Africans should be called off. This was radical stuff for the Telegraph cricket correspondent. At an election party soon after at the Savoy, he recalled how the then deputy editor had expressed surprise at Swanton's smiling presence: 'Oh, I thought you had gone over to the enemy.' Swanton remained an independent, quick-witted thinker to the end. From now on Cricketer board meetings will be gloomier affairs.",

'People announcing they are going to sign him are not serious'; Juventus have confirmed they are prepared to release Daniel Fonseca to any Premiership club willing to take him on loan; Spurs are ready to make a firm bid for Chris Sutton once Chelsea's European campaign ends; Gerard Houllier has ruled out making any Liverpool 'panic buys' to cover the absence of Robbie Fowler; Everton boss Walter Smith has warned he needs new players to keep the club safe from relegation; Bradford manager Paul Jewell plans to complete two signings this week; Derby have released Russell Hoult to Portsmouth on loan - but could be set to move for Bournemouth star Ian Cox; Everton have denied preparing a bid for Rangers' out of favour midfielder Jorg Albertz; Titi Camara's cousin Momo Camara is expected to sign for Leicester this week; Bryan Robson is chasing a mystery South American striker after deciding against a fresh bid for Palace's Matt Svensson; QPR midfielder Paul Murray is set to join Newcastle on loan with a view to a permanent move; Southampton are watching Norwegian full-back Alexander Aas of Odd Grenland; Tottenham are considering a summer move for Romanian international Constantin Galca; Forest's Gianluca Petrachi is set to join Perugia ; and Charlton have agreed a \u00a31m deal for controversial Jamaican striker Ricardo Fuller of Tivoli Gardens.",

You just cannot move him.' </p> <p>As one might expect of a striker with his build, Viduka can appear sluggish. But as Lauchlan points out: 'He has quick feet.' </p> <p>Viduka himself attributes his success over the past six months ('the best period of my career') simply to the higher level of training and coaching at Celtic. 'I have also got to know the other players better,' he adds. </p> <p>The extent to which he has grown in confidence is perhaps best illustrated by his willingness to show his general ball- skills as well as his finishing ability. Referring to Celtic's habit of embellishing their biggest wins with seemingly arrogant tricks, he says: 'I really love it when we are three or four goals up, and I can relax and enjoy myself. </p> <p>'If I see the opportunity do do a little trick, then I will take it. It is not as if I am looking to take the mickey out of anybody.' </p> <p>For tonight's match, though, against a team in relegation trouble, nobody should be surprised if Viduka and Celtic have to settle for a more pragmatic approach to achieve their quest. </p> <p>Barnes, pointing out that Kilmarnock have proved strong in defence, if not attack, says: 'We are going to have to show a lot of discipline and patience to break them down.' </p> <p>Kilmarnock's manager, Bobby Williamson, whose team were unlucky to fall 1-0 to Celtic - through a late, hotly disputed Mark Burchill goal - in their last league meeting, at Rugby Park in September, says: 'We have some good players but we need to learn the lessons of what went on before the break.

      "body": "<p>Premiership football clubs could be buying players with serious illnesses and injuries without knowing it, according to senior figures within the game. </p> <p>For transfers no longer need medical clearance following a change in the rules by soccer's world governing body Fifa. </p> <p>It is also claimed that increasing financial pressures on managers to get results means some are unwilling to make sufficient checks before deciding whether to complete signings, especially on players from abroad, while others are willing to conceal injuries to ensure transfers go through. </p> <p>Transfer deals only used to be concluded once players had passed a rigorous examination by doctors. Such scrutiny led to many deals being called off at the eleventh hour. </p> <p>But, after the case of Jean Marc Bosman - which won freedom of movement for players in Europe, Fifa has made a special amendment to its transfer regulations rendering the medical hurdle a thing of the past. It states: 'A transfer between clubs shall not be made subject to the positive results of a medical examination.' </p> <p>Alan Hodson, the FA's chief medical officer, believes that managers are now willing to accept the new arrangements for business reasons. 'What are you going to do,' he asked, 'if a foreign player turns up to sign 24 hours before a transfer deadline without the proper medical papers? If he's good enough, you'll be tempted to sign him.' </p> <p>Arsenal's Nigerian striker Nwankwo Kanu's move from Ajax to Inter Milan almost collapsed when he was diagnosed as suffering from a serious heart defect. The entire deal came close to being called-off and the problem was rectified through surgery and Kanu resumed his career. </p> <p>Graham Penman, from Windsor Insurance Brokers, who insures players at all Premiership clubs, said: 'It's up to insurers whether to take the risk - and in that instance (Kanu) I don't think it would have been likely for cover to have been granted.' </p> <p>It's understood that Kanu's move to Highbury only went through after stringent checks determined he could withstand the rigours of the Premiership. </p> <p>The FA has now launched a major screening programme of 15 and 16-year-olds attending English clubs' centres of excellence in an attempt to detect the sort of defects which claimed the life of Daniel Yorath, the teenage son of former Welsh boss Terry in 1994. The FA's programme is being conducted by a network of 18 cardiologists across the country.</p>",

It is also claimed that increasing financial pressures on managers to get results means some are unwilling to make sufficient checks before deciding whether to complete signings, especially on players from abroad, while others are willing to conceal injuries to ensure transfers go through. Transfer deals only used to be concluded once players had passed a rigorous examination by doctors. Such scrutiny led to many deals being called off at the eleventh hour. But, after the case of Jean Marc Bosman - which won freedom of movement for players in Europe, Fifa has made a special amendment to its transfer regulations rendering the medical hurdle a thing of the past. It states: 'A transfer between clubs shall not be made subject to the positive results of a medical examination.' Alan Hodson, the FA's chief medical officer, believes that managers are now willing to accept the new arrangements for business reasons. 'What are you going to do,' he asked, 'if a foreign player turns up to sign 24 hours before a transfer deadline without the proper medical papers? If he's good enough, you'll be tempted to sign him.' Arsenal's Nigerian striker Nwankwo Kanu's move from Ajax to Inter Milan almost collapsed when he was diagnosed as suffering from a serious heart defect. The entire deal came close to being called-off and the problem was rectified through surgery and Kanu resumed his career. Graham Penman, from Windsor Insurance Brokers, who insures players at all Premiership clubs, said: 'It's up to insurers whether to take the risk - and in that instance (Kanu) I don't think it would have been likely for cover to have been granted.' It's understood that Kanu's move to Highbury only went through after stringent checks determined he could withstand the rigours of the Premiership. The FA has now launched a major screening programme of 15 and 16-year-olds attending English clubs' centres of excellence in an attempt to detect the sort of defects which claimed the life of Daniel Yorath, the teenage son of former Welsh boss Terry in 1994. The FA's programme is being conducted by a network of 18 cardiologists across the country.",

We have been working very hard on the training pitch.' </p> <p>Arsenal had better take note, not that Manchester United's winter break in Brazil has gone unnoticed in north London, because both Stam and his manager agree the defending champions are ready for a big game. </p> <p>'Of course it is likely to be physical against Arsenal,' Stam said. 'We are prepared for that, and we are the sort of team who can play it both ways. We always set out to play football, but we don't have a problem if things get a little heated. It's part of the game and our team is full of players who can look after themselves. I think Arsenal are a little bit the same. Neither of us is willing to put up with being bullied.' </p> <p>The Dutch defender is relatively new to this country, but it does not take long to appreciate that games between United and Arsenal tend to involve an extra bit of spice. A keen rivalry is natural given that the two clubs have dominated the past decade, but there are points to be scored at virtually every level of confrontation, and even the two managers, in their vastly different ways, enjoy winding each other up. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger only made the briefest comment last week on United's good fortune in fixing up warm-weather training facilities for themselves while everyone else was taking part in the FA Cup, but Sir Alex Ferguson was ready and waiting with an answer. 'He's right,' said the United manager, not in the least defensively. 'We've had a great preparation for this match. A bit of sun, some really good training; the results might have been disappointing but it was still a great trip. I think there's a freshness to our team now and that could be important.' </p> <p>Contrary to the impression given a fortnight ago, Manchester United will not receive an automatic invitation into next year's Club World Championship on the strength of their victory over Palmeiras in Tokyo last year. Fifa now intend to make an announcement in March concerning the venue and format of the next competition, and which teams might be taking part. Only two things are certain. One is that withdrawal from the FA Cup is not an option for English teams next season. The other is that Ferguson and United will still be keen to take part. 'We would be delighted to go back, wherever and whenever it is played,' Ferguson said. 'Someone said it might be in Tahiti next year, and we would definitely be up for that.' </p> <p>A workaholic like Stam might detect a certain facetiousness here, but at least Ferguson is being consistent. He has always argued for a winter break, and he is not about to deny that Fifa have just handed exactly that to Manchester United. The only problem is that everyone else will soon want the same. 'People like myself have been talking about winter breaks for years,' Ferguson said. 'But the fact is that existing competitions are getting bigger. Fixtures are expanding everywhere you look, there are more internationals, more Champions League games and so on, so that top players are hardly getting a summer break any more, let alone a winter one.' </p> <p>Something will have to give, but Ferguson is not saying what. Either that or he simply doesn't know. 'I don't want to give my own opinion because it's too controversial,' he said. 'Uefa would argue that the League should be reduced, they would like to see every country play a maximum of 34 games, but I think English football might be different from the rest. The Premiership is such an exciting league it might be hard to make a decision to reduce matches. I don't think it would be popular and I don't know who would vote for it. But I do think it's worth trying to take a break at this time of year. We have certainly felt the benefit in training. It's always difficult to judge how well the team is going when you have had a break from matches, but the lads are expecting a big game on Monday and they are ready for it.' </p> <p>Arsenal realise defeat at Old Trafford would leave them too big a gap to close in their 15 remaining League games after tomorrow. Wenger might draw some comfort from the knowledge that one of United's games in hand is at Elland Road, but the other two are against Middlesbrough and Sheffield Wednesday, and will have been played within the next 10 days. 'We've acted quickly to fill in our blank dates,' Ferguson said. 'We don't want a backlog of fixtures when the Champions League starts up again. Potentially we have nine more Champions League games to play, I certainly hope we play that many, and with 19 Premiership matches left we have 28 games to fit into just over three months. So the Arsenal game is not really a crunch game in terms of the title because it comes a bit too early, but it should provide a better barometer as to how each club is placed.' </p> <p>Arsenal are placed at a disadvantage by the absence of Tony Adams and virtually all their recognised strikers, though Ferguson does not expect anything less than a hard game. 'The roles are reversed from the game here two years ago when we were the ones missing a few important players,' he said. 'Arsenal won that day, but there was nothing between the sides. Arsenal are always going to be formidable, and though Ars\u00e8ne has added a few players to his squad, he still has a solid core of experience. You always have to work hard to win these matches, the main thing is to ensure you are ready for them, and this time I think we are.' </p> <p>Stam certainly is. Team spirit is currently so high, he reckons, that not even Roy Keane's renegotiated wages are a subject of dressing-room discontent. To a man, the Manchester United players are behind their captain.

      "body": "<p>Andy Hunt made a triumphant return to his former home county yesterday when his hat-trick took Charlton four points clear at the top of Division One. Hunt opened the scoring against the run of play just before the break and struck twice in the space of five minutes late in the second half to secure a sixth successive league win for Alan Curbishley's side. </p> <p>The margin of victory flattered the visitors, however, and had Norwich managed to capitalise on their early domination, the outcome could have been very different. </p> <p>The Norwich manager, Bruce Rioch, summed up the game when he said, 'We've gone out there and played really well and yet lost. I think everyone watching would agree it was never a 3-0 game, but sometimes matches go that way. Charlton took their chances and we didn't and that was the deciding factor in the end.' </p> <p>Hunt, who had an unsuccessful trial with the Carrow Road side in the early Nineties, opened the scoring on 42 minutes, sidefooting home Graham Stuart's in-swinging corner from close range, his half-volley going in off the crossbar. </p> <p>He struck again on 73 minutes to put the game beyond the battling home side, with Robinson again the provider, his astute ball from the halfway line putting his col league in the clear.

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunt made a triumphant return to his former home county yesterday when his hat-trick took Charlton four points clear at the top of Division One. Hunt opened the scoring against the run of play just before the break and struck twice in the space of five minutes late in the second half to secure a sixth successive league win for Alan Curbishley's side. The margin of victory flattered the visitors, however, and had Norwich managed to capitalise on their early domination, the outcome could have been very different. The Norwich manager, Bruce Rioch, summed up the game when he said, 'We've gone out there and played really well and yet lost. I think everyone watching would agree it was never a 3-0 game, but sometimes matches go that way. Charlton took their chances and we didn't and that was the deciding factor in the end.' Hunt, who had an unsuccessful trial with the Carrow Road side in the early Nineties, opened the scoring on 42 minutes, sidefooting home Graham Stuart's in-swinging corner from close range, his half-volley going in off the crossbar. He struck again on 73 minutes to put the game beyond the battling home side, with Robinson again the provider, his astute ball from the halfway line putting his col league in the clear. Hunt's first effort went through the half-hearted block of the goalkeeper Andy Marshall before trickling into the net. Four minutes later Hunt's triumph, and Norwich's misery, was complete as the in-form frontman - and Charlton's leading goal scorer - made it 3-0, heading home a right-wing cross from Robinson who completed a hat-trick of assists. The late goals were rough justice on the Canaries who had dominated the early part of the game against a strangely out-of-sorts Charlton, who struggled to get to grips with the late withdrawal of skipper Mark Kinsella with a stomach bug. 'I had a right blast at them at half-time,' said the manager, Alan Curbishley. 'I gave them a few days off and they looked very sluggish but, fortunately, Dean Kiely made some good saves early on. In the end, we scored our goals at the right time and I'm delighted to have got the points, even though we didn't play as well as we can.' Kiely made four good stops before the break, the best on 19 minutes when he dived bravely at the feet of Iwan Roberts during a frantic goalmouth scramble. Five minutes later the Norwich top scorer wasted his side's clearest chance of the match as he sidefooted wide of an open goal. Norwich continued to look the better side and had chances to draw level in the second half, one Matt Jackson effort being headed off the line by Stuart.

You would have been wrong. Scottish football is facing a fight that will make the Battle of Bannockburn look like the Highland Games. </p> <p>James Alexander Gordon will now have to learn two new names to read out on Saturday's Sports Report , Elgin and Peterhead. These two Highland League teams have been voted into the Scottish League to replace the two extra teams going into the Premier League next season. They haven't got there because they are the best teams: they aren't. What counts is the size of their grounds and number of supporters.</p> <p>In fact half of the teams in the Scottish first division are not eligible for promotion simply because they do not have 10,000 all-seat stadiums. Such rules mean that whole regions of Scotland such as the Borders don't even have a league team to support. Borders team Gala have once again failed the entry test so local kids who have turned their backs on rugby union in droves have no big games to go to. </p> <p>The Highland League have lost five of their teams to the Scottish League in recent years, yet this so-called promotion is no guarantee of financial success as Inverness Caledonian Thistle have found out. Having merged two Inverness clubs and built a new stadium they are holding their own in the first division. </p> <p>According to the local papers, however, Inverness are said to be more than \u00a32 million in the red. The problem is that the Inverness punters have hardly come out in their droves to watch their new team. Walking through the streets of Inverness at Christmas I never saw any one in a 'Cally' shirt. In fact most of the kids and older blokes were wearing Celtic or Rangers shirts, and the two lads sitting behind me at the game against Clydebank wore Rangers scarves. Given the problems that Inverness have faced, it's surprising that the Highland League teams are so keen to join the Scottish League. </p> <p>The Old Firm want to do precisely the opposite. We all know that Rangers and Celtic could fill Ibrox or Parkhead even if they were playing a pub team. The problem is that such fixtures don't bring any TV money and that's essential if the two big clubs want to compete with the best in Europe. Even the ratings for the Old Firm games shown live on Sky are well below those of English Premiership matches. The big two are now beginning to think the unthinkable, leaving their own domestic league.</p> <p>Talk has resurfaced recently about the setting up of a new 'Atlantic League' with the big teams in Holland and Belgium. The Glasgow teams think that their future lies outside Scotland and they know that TV will be far more interested in Rangers v Ajax or Celtic v PSV Eindhoven than games against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. </p> <p>The new league is a serious proposition, but the real end game for the Old Firm is entry into the English Premiership. There are already plans for Celtic and Rangers to pay the Scottish League compensation for their loss, but there is one big obstacle in their way. That, of course, is the old problem of Britain having four football teams and our proper reluctance to give that up. The age-old argument is that if Scottish teams play in the English League then we would have to have a British team. </p> <p>People forget that we have Welsh teams in the English League and yet Wales still have a separate national team. This argument is even weaker now that Uefa have allowed international status to anyone who wants it. </p> <p>The hot word in Glasgow is that Rangers and Celtic will make their move as soon as England have been awarded the right to hold the 2006 World Cup, which is now looking odds on. No one will dare suggest a British team then. The big English clubs are all very keen to let the Scottish teams in, knowing that they will not only guarantee sell-out gates but also the much-needed TV revenue. </p> <p>Scottish fans may not like to lose their two biggest clubs to England, any more than we like the Champions League, but if they all supported their local clubs like Inverness Caledonian Thistle then it probably wouldn't happen. </p>",

James Alexander Gordon will now have to learn two new names to read out on Saturday's Sports Report , Elgin and Peterhead. These two Highland League teams have been voted into the Scottish League to replace the two extra teams going into the Premier League next season. They haven't got there because they are the best teams: they aren't. What counts is the size of their grounds and number of supporters. In fact half of the teams in the Scottish first division are not eligible for promotion simply because they do not have 10,000 all-seat stadiums. Such rules mean that whole regions of Scotland such as the Borders don't even have a league team to support. Borders team Gala have once again failed the entry test so local kids who have turned their backs on rugby union in droves have no big games to go to. The Highland League have lost five of their teams to the Scottish League in recent years, yet this so-called promotion is no guarantee of financial success as Inverness Caledonian Thistle have found out. Having merged two Inverness clubs and built a new stadium they are holding their own in the first division. According to the local papers, however, Inverness are said to be more than \u00a32 million in the red. The problem is that the Inverness punters have hardly come out in their droves to watch their new team. Walking through the streets of Inverness at Christmas I never saw any one in a 'Cally' shirt. In fact most of the kids and older blokes were wearing Celtic or Rangers shirts, and the two lads sitting behind me at the game against Clydebank wore Rangers scarves. Given the problems that Inverness have faced, it's surprising that the Highland League teams are so keen to join the Scottish League. The Old Firm want to do precisely the opposite. We all know that Rangers and Celtic could fill Ibrox or Parkhead even if they were playing a pub team. The problem is that such fixtures don't bring any TV money and that's essential if the two big clubs want to compete with the best in Europe. Even the ratings for the Old Firm games shown live on Sky are well below those of English Premiership matches. The big two are now beginning to think the unthinkable, leaving their own domestic league. Talk has resurfaced recently about the setting up of a new 'Atlantic League' with the big teams in Holland and Belgium. The Glasgow teams think that their future lies outside Scotland and they know that TV will be far more interested in Rangers v Ajax or Celtic v PSV Eindhoven than games against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. The new league is a serious proposition, but the real end game for the Old Firm is entry into the English Premiership. There are already plans for Celtic and Rangers to pay the Scottish League compensation for their loss, but there is one big obstacle in their way. That, of course, is the old problem of Britain having four football teams and our proper reluctance to give that up. The age-old argument is that if Scottish teams play in the English League then we would have to have a British team. People forget that we have Welsh teams in the English League and yet Wales still have a separate national team. This argument is even weaker now that Uefa have allowed international status to anyone who wants it. The hot word in Glasgow is that Rangers and Celtic will make their move as soon as England have been awarded the right to hold the 2006 World Cup, which is now looking odds on. No one will dare suggest a British team then. The big English clubs are all very keen to let the Scottish teams in, knowing that they will not only guarantee sell-out gates but also the much-needed TV revenue. Scottish fans may not like to lose their two biggest clubs to England, any more than we like the Champions League, but if they all supported their local clubs like Inverness Caledonian Thistle then it probably wouldn't happen.",

First, Steve Harper made a flying save to keep out a 36th-minute Gayle header and then Carl Leaburn pulled a shot wide when it looked easier to score five minutes later.

Next to have a pop was Gary Speed, who struck a 30-yard free-kick so powerfully that Sullivan must have heard it whistling towards him like a bullet with his name on it. Fortunately for Wimbledon, it soon had Sullivan's hands on it after he made a good, low save to his left. Wimbledon should have been in front by the break. First, Steve Harper made a flying save to keep out a 36th-minute Gayle header and then Carl Leaburn pulled a shot wide when it looked easier to score five minutes later. Carl Cort also went close. Wimbledon's persistence was rewarded with a fortunate goal two minutes into the second half. An Alan Kimble free-kick led to confusion in the Newcastle penalty area and Harper's attempted punch clear bounced off Robbie Earle's unsuspecting knee and straight back past him into the net. Maybe the lumpy excuse for a pitch played a role, but Dyer's miss on the hour, when sent clear by Kevin Gallacher, looked a shocker and indicated that Newcastle's fate was already determined. And so it was when the unmarked Gayle headed in a Kenny Cunningham cross nine minutes later.",

Hopes of the latter were enhanced in a convincing victory over fellow strugglers Watford, who suffered their seventh defeat in eight Premiership matches. Manager Paul Jewell, armed with a reported \u00a35 million budget to spend before the transfer deadline, is prepared to take what would be a considerable gamble on a player whose inflated opinion of his own worth recently saw him turn down a move to France's Montpellier. A late consolation goal from Heidar Helguson, who turned in a cross from Robert Page, concealed the comfort of a Bradford victory achieved despite losing impressive keeper Matt Clarke after an accidental collision with Paul Robinson in the 71st minute. An encounter between the Premiership's least productive attack - belonging to the hosts - and the worst defensive team did not hold much promise for a feast of offensive football. Indeed, it should come as no surprise that it took a disastrous piece of defensive play from the visitors to gift Bradford an opening goal. After 24 minutes, an attempted one-two between Dean Windass and Dean Saunders was only halted by a blatant foul on the former, committed jointly by Robert Page and Paul Robinson. Peter Beagrie stepped up to convert City's seventeenth goal in 23 league games this season. It could have been a turning point in Bradford's season, considering the significance of an encounter that even the most amateur pundit might have earmarked last summer as an important relegation 'six-pointer'. As it transpired, it took them all of nine minutes to surrender momentum and advantage. Xavier Gravelaine looked to have delayed his pass toolong as Bradford retreated in numbers, but the Frenchman hesitated cleverly, eventually passing to the new Icelandic striker, Heidar Helguson, who was overlapping into space on the left. His low cross found Micah Hyde, who swept the ball in from close range. It was the response that the game needed, providing an inspiration to two teams who are barely capable of adopting a defensive approach even if they so wished. Four minutes after the equaliser, Watford conceded their forty-ninth goal of the season when Gareth Whalley collected a loose ball 40 yards out and was allowed to advance without even the threat of a challenge. Finally, 25 yards from goal and with the Watford defence at last considering an end to their inertia, Whalley unleashed a left-foot shot that went in off the right-hand post. The first period ended in controversy when Saunders appeared to catch defender Steve Palmer with an errant elbow, the Watford man staying on the field for treatment as the remaining players headed towards the dressing room.

'He's talking rot,' said Ngconde Balfour, minister of sport and recreation in South Africa. 'I respect Bobby Charlton as a great player but he shouldn't say these things. </p> <p>'We have fought colonialism for years. We are sick of colonialism. Don't patronise us.' His comments were made at a reception hosted by the South African High Commission in Accra, where four of the five bidding countries for 2006 made presentations last week. </p> <p>England, South Africa, Germany and Morocco are in the Ghanaian capital to address Fifa dignitaries ahead of the African Nations Cup, which kicked off here yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>Brazil stayed at home to host Fifa's site inspection team. </p> <p>Sir Bobby said: 'I am appalled and hurt by this personal attack. For over 25 years I have been coming to Africa to do what I can to help the development of football here. I haven't done so because I had to but because I wanted to. </p> <p>'The whole world knows about and discusses the problems of crime and violence in South Africa. It's not something that I have raised. It's reported in newspapers around the world. It's no good South African politicians trying to deflect the blame onto me. </p> <p>'We will continue to promote the positive case for England. That's what matters. Ours is a positive campaign and it will remain so.' </p> <p>One of the 24 Fifa executives who will select the 2006 venue in July, Botswana's Abdul Bhamjee, was present when Balfour gave his anti-England speech to a gathering of a hundred local media and businessmen. Bhamjee kept a diplomatic silence afterwards. </p> <p>Balfour said England had based their bid not on their own strength but on 'deceit and downright lies' in trying to highlight security fears in their main rival's bid. </p> <p>'Show me a man who says his country does not have a crime problem and I'll show you a liar,' he said. </p> <p>'I personally took the Queen of England around the streets of Alexandria on her recent visit to South Africa... and she came back without a scratch. If they [England] take the Queen as an example perhaps they will stop talking this rot.' </p> <p>The rot, according to Balfour, came in an interview (13 January) when Sir Bobby was asked about crime in South Africa. Sir Bobby responded: 'Every now and then somebody sends me a copy of a South African newspaper which tables all the problems they have had. A World Cup given to a country at the wrong time, and I don't just mean South Africa, would be a disaster.' </p> <p>England, who will be back canvassing in Africa in March, have to make a bid presentation to world football's continental federation in the next few months. Ghana was the first stop; next they go to Paraguay, then the Caribbean. The 2006 bid director, Alec McGiven pointed out that Sir Bobby had coached children from every country in Africa except Libya. </p> <p>Last Tuesday Sir Bobby attended the launch of a community youth football project in two of Accra's most deprived areas, and he had done 'an enormous amount of work' on the continent. </p> <p>McGiven added: 'We are all very upset by this attack. It's totally unnecessary and is spoiling the good relations that exists between the rival bids. We are determined to get on without these distractions.' </p> <p>Bookmakers William Hill make South Africa the even-money favourite to win the July vote. England are next at 5-4, Germany third in the betting at 4-1 and both Brazil and Morocco are rank outsiders.</p>",

One of the 24 Fifa executives who will select the 2006 venue in July, Botswana's Abdul Bhamjee, was present when Balfour gave his anti-England speech to a gathering of a hundred local media and businessmen. Bhamjee kept a diplomatic silence afterwards. Balfour said England had based their bid not on their own strength but on 'deceit and downright lies' in trying to highlight security fears in their main rival's bid. 'Show me a man who says his country does not have a crime problem and I'll show you a liar,' he said. 'I personally took the Queen of England around the streets of Alexandria on her recent visit to South Africa... and she came back without a scratch. If they [England] take the Queen as an example perhaps they will stop talking this rot.' The rot, according to Balfour, came in an interview (13 January) when Sir Bobby was asked about crime in South Africa. Sir Bobby responded: 'Every now and then somebody sends me a copy of a South African newspaper which tables all the problems they have had. A World Cup given to a country at the wrong time, and I don't just mean South Africa, would be a disaster.' England, who will be back canvassing in Africa in March, have to make a bid presentation to world football's continental federation in the next few months. Ghana was the first stop; next they go to Paraguay, then the Caribbean. The 2006 bid director, Alec McGiven pointed out that Sir Bobby had coached children from every country in Africa except Libya. Last Tuesday Sir Bobby attended the launch of a community youth football project in two of Accra's most deprived areas, and he had done 'an enormous amount of work' on the continent. McGiven added: 'We are all very upset by this attack. It's totally unnecessary and is spoiling the good relations that exists between the rival bids. We are determined to get on without these distractions.' Bookmakers William Hill make South Africa the even-money favourite to win the July vote. England are next at 5-4, Germany third in the betting at 4-1 and both Brazil and Morocco are rank outsiders.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Take a look at the US box office charts and you'll see Next Friday sitting proudly at the top. Next Friday? You won't have read about it in any of the lists of films to look out for this year, commercially or artistically. The pundits are calling it a surprise hit, though they should have seen it coming. </p> <p>The sequel to 1995's knockabout ghetto comedy Friday is typical of several trends. It proved that, despite the wealth of future classics playing in American cinemas, unpretentious comedies can always win the day. And like last year's The Best Man, it shows that mainstream African-American comedies can cross over. </p> <p>Along with The Spy Who Shagged Me, it also indicates that a slow-burning video hit can set up its sequel for success at the cinema - Friday spent 100 weeks lurking in the video charts. But most of all it is confirmation that the 30-year-old executive producer, writer and star of Next Friday, Ice Cube, has arrived in the movie big time. Hip hop has had some kind of relationship with the movies for years, going back to Wild Style in 1982 and early embarrassments such as Krush Groove. But unlike rock music and the movies, things have progressed. Throughout the Nineties rappers have been given a chance to play roles in films which move beyond their music persona. And more than a handful have turned out to be decent actors. Will Smith and Ice T spring to mind, but the list extends to Busta Rhymes doing a voice for the Rugrats movie. </p> <p>There is also a niche audience for films starring rappers and no one else which has been served by New Orleans hip hop entrepreneur Master P, who churns out cheap, nasty and profitable films that will never make it this side of the Atlantic. </p> <p>Former rapper Ice Cube stands out from the crowd. He has a three-picture deal with New Line, and Next Friday has taken $17 million in its first week, despite the fact that comedian Chris Tucker is not there to repeat his starring role from the original film. Ice Cube says this is because Tucker 'doesn't smoke weed or use profanities now', but Tucker's escalating salary - currently $4m a movie, against a total budget of $10m for Next Friday - might have had something to do with it. </p> <p>There is nothing profound about the film. The plot has Compton homeboy Ice Cube being sent to live with relatives in the sub urbs, and a typical gag involves getting a vacuum cleaner stuck to someone's face while trying to get rid of marijuana fumes. The reviews have been harsh, but even if Ice Cube were worried about that - and I suspect he isn't - he's got the respectability angle covered. Before Next Friday reaches British audiences we'll have a chance to see him in David O'Russell's much praised Gulf war adventure-satire Three Kings. This puts him in the company of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg - an ex-rapper of sorts - and Spike Jonze as US soldiers going in search of Saddam's gold just after the ceasefire. It's an excellent, unpredictable film in which Ice Cube plays a deeply religious soldier. </p> <p>He's good in it, but that's no surprise either - his acting has been good since his first film. 'I kind of fell into it,' he says. 'I wasn't really thinking about acting, but I ran into John Singleton in 1988. He was telling me he had this script. I didn't really pay him attention.' </p> <p>Singleton's film was Boyz 'n the Hood , named after a song Ice Cube wrote when he was 16. The film was made in 1991, with Ice Cube playing Doughboy, the childhood friend of Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr) who cannot steer clear of violence on the streets. Ice Cube had had no acting training but he fired his acting coach after a couple of days on the advice of the film's star, Laurence Fishburne. Fishburne was proved right when Ice Cube got excellent reviews. </p> <p>Since then he has made regular excursions from recording to appear in mainstream films, including Walter Hill's Trespass (1992) and the risible Anaconda in 1997. But it was Friday that turned him from a rapper who acted into a force in the movies. He says the reason he wrote the script is because he was bored on tour in Europe. There were two obvious blueprints he could have followed: the harsh realism of Boyz 'n the Hood or the Scarface pastiche of New Jack City. He ignored them both. </p> <p> Friday is about one day in the life of two amiable losers - played by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker - from South Central LA. The film has an anti-gun moral and Ice Cube plays the baffled straight man led astray by Tucker. He was standing his hard man rap persona on its head. And it worked. </p> <p>As it happens, the life his character leads in Friday is closer to Ice Cube's upbringing than the gun-toting world of his records. Born O'Shea Jackson, his family was stable, both parents had decent jobs and he did well at school. The song 'Boyz 'n the Hood' was written before he had ever seen a drive-by shooting or played a part in gang warfare. </p> <p> Friday led to Ice Cube's debut as a director with The Players Club . 'I was starting to direct my own videos because they weren't coming out exactly how I wanted, so I started trying to learn from directors I was working with, picking up traits just to help myself. It got to the point where I said, \"I'm ready. Next time I write another film, I'm going to direct it.\" The film cost only $5m and picked up $23m at the box office. </p> <p>The easy assumption is that Ice Cube's film success has come on the back of his music career. But the hip hop world has a ferocious turnover, and for most fans Ice Cube is a figure from the past. He explains: 'When you do movies you can't promote records, so those records suffer.' </p> <p>At 30, Ice Cube must realise he has a better future as an actor and filmmaker than trying to compete with the latest young hardcases. It's a calculation others have made. Queen Latifah now has a solid acting career that doesn't lean at all on the fact that she used to make records. Starting out well as an opinionated waitress in Jungle Fever and briefly starring in her own sitcom, Latifah can currently be seen in The Bone Collector and heard as the voice of a character in Bringing Out The Dead. </p> <p>So why do rappers - be they hardcore stars like Ice Cube or pop idols like Will Smith or Marky Mark - make the transition to the screen in a way few pop stars can manage? L.L. Cool J suggested in Interview magazine recently that 'creating, memorising and performing rap music comes from the same part of the brain as acting does. Rock 'n' roll is about singing; rap music, to a certain extent, is acting.' </p> <p>L.L. Cool J's acting career has also picked up as his music has tailed off. Recently he was in Halloween H20 and the expensive shark flop Deep Blue Sea and he now has a substantial part in Oliver Stone's American football epic Any Given Sunday . His theory about rappers and acting is one that comes up most times the question is asked. It's certainly true that hip hop is saturated with film imagery. But there is no easy explanation of why Ice Cube is a better actor than David Bowie, just the consistent celluloid evidence that he is. </p> <p>There's one exception that should be made. The rapper who had the biggest potential to be a film star was the late Tupac Shakur. But unlike the others he was not a gangsta rapper first and an actor second. He was a drama school product who became a rapper and adopted the tough guy persona when gangsta rap took over hip hop. And he paid the ultimate price for it. </p> <p>Tupac was a fine actor, and in films such as Gridlock'd he played characters with a vulnerability that matched his delicate face - rather than the 'Thug Life' tattoo he had on his stomach. A rapper who shares Tupac's Fame -style education is Mos Def, contemporary hip hop's most thoughtful major figure.

      "bodyText": "Take a look at the US box office charts and you'll see Next Friday sitting proudly at the top. Next Friday? You won't have read about it in any of the lists of films to look out for this year, commercially or artistically. The pundits are calling it a surprise hit, though they should have seen it coming. The sequel to 1995's knockabout ghetto comedy Friday is typical of several trends. It proved that, despite the wealth of future classics playing in American cinemas, unpretentious comedies can always win the day. And like last year's The Best Man, it shows that mainstream African-American comedies can cross over. Along with The Spy Who Shagged Me, it also indicates that a slow-burning video hit can set up its sequel for success at the cinema - Friday spent 100 weeks lurking in the video charts. But most of all it is confirmation that the 30-year-old executive producer, writer and star of Next Friday, Ice Cube, has arrived in the movie big time. Hip hop has had some kind of relationship with the movies for years, going back to Wild Style in 1982 and early embarrassments such as Krush Groove. But unlike rock music and the movies, things have progressed. Throughout the Nineties rappers have been given a chance to play roles in films which move beyond their music persona. And more than a handful have turned out to be decent actors. Will Smith and Ice T spring to mind, but the list extends to Busta Rhymes doing a voice for the Rugrats movie. There is also a niche audience for films starring rappers and no one else which has been served by New Orleans hip hop entrepreneur Master P, who churns out cheap, nasty and profitable films that will never make it this side of the Atlantic. Former rapper Ice Cube stands out from the crowd. He has a three-picture deal with New Line, and Next Friday has taken $17 million in its first week, despite the fact that comedian Chris Tucker is not there to repeat his starring role from the original film. Ice Cube says this is because Tucker 'doesn't smoke weed or use profanities now', but Tucker's escalating salary - currently $4m a movie, against a total budget of $10m for Next Friday - might have had something to do with it. There is nothing profound about the film. The plot has Compton homeboy Ice Cube being sent to live with relatives in the sub urbs, and a typical gag involves getting a vacuum cleaner stuck to someone's face while trying to get rid of marijuana fumes. The reviews have been harsh, but even if Ice Cube were worried about that - and I suspect he isn't - he's got the respectability angle covered. Before Next Friday reaches British audiences we'll have a chance to see him in David O'Russell's much praised Gulf war adventure-satire Three Kings. This puts him in the company of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg - an ex-rapper of sorts - and Spike Jonze as US soldiers going in search of Saddam's gold just after the ceasefire. It's an excellent, unpredictable film in which Ice Cube plays a deeply religious soldier. He's good in it, but that's no surprise either - his acting has been good since his first film. 'I kind of fell into it,' he says. 'I wasn't really thinking about acting, but I ran into John Singleton in 1988. He was telling me he had this script. I didn't really pay him attention.' Singleton's film was Boyz 'n the Hood , named after a song Ice Cube wrote when he was 16. The film was made in 1991, with Ice Cube playing Doughboy, the childhood friend of Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr) who cannot steer clear of violence on the streets. Ice Cube had had no acting training but he fired his acting coach after a couple of days on the advice of the film's star, Laurence Fishburne. Fishburne was proved right when Ice Cube got excellent reviews. Since then he has made regular excursions from recording to appear in mainstream films, including Walter Hill's Trespass (1992) and the risible Anaconda in 1997. But it was Friday that turned him from a rapper who acted into a force in the movies. He says the reason he wrote the script is because he was bored on tour in Europe. There were two obvious blueprints he could have followed: the harsh realism of Boyz 'n the Hood or the Scarface pastiche of New Jack City. He ignored them both. Friday is about one day in the life of two amiable losers - played by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker - from South Central LA. The film has an anti-gun moral and Ice Cube plays the baffled straight man led astray by Tucker. He was standing his hard man rap persona on its head. And it worked. As it happens, the life his character leads in Friday is closer to Ice Cube's upbringing than the gun-toting world of his records. Born O'Shea Jackson, his family was stable, both parents had decent jobs and he did well at school. The song 'Boyz 'n the Hood' was written before he had ever seen a drive-by shooting or played a part in gang warfare. Friday led to Ice Cube's debut as a director with The Players Club . 'I was starting to direct my own videos because they weren't coming out exactly how I wanted, so I started trying to learn from directors I was working with, picking up traits just to help myself. It got to the point where I said, \"I'm ready. Next time I write another film, I'm going to direct it.\" The film cost only $5m and picked up $23m at the box office. The easy assumption is that Ice Cube's film success has come on the back of his music career. But the hip hop world has a ferocious turnover, and for most fans Ice Cube is a figure from the past. He explains: 'When you do movies you can't promote records, so those records suffer.' At 30, Ice Cube must realise he has a better future as an actor and filmmaker than trying to compete with the latest young hardcases. It's a calculation others have made. Queen Latifah now has a solid acting career that doesn't lean at all on the fact that she used to make records. Starting out well as an opinionated waitress in Jungle Fever and briefly starring in her own sitcom, Latifah can currently be seen in The Bone Collector and heard as the voice of a character in Bringing Out The Dead. So why do rappers - be they hardcore stars like Ice Cube or pop idols like Will Smith or Marky Mark - make the transition to the screen in a way few pop stars can manage? L.L. Cool J suggested in Interview magazine recently that 'creating, memorising and performing rap music comes from the same part of the brain as acting does. Rock 'n' roll is about singing; rap music, to a certain extent, is acting.' L.L. Cool J's acting career has also picked up as his music has tailed off. Recently he was in Halloween H20 and the expensive shark flop Deep Blue Sea and he now has a substantial part in Oliver Stone's American football epic Any Given Sunday . His theory about rappers and acting is one that comes up most times the question is asked. It's certainly true that hip hop is saturated with film imagery. But there is no easy explanation of why Ice Cube is a better actor than David Bowie, just the consistent celluloid evidence that he is. There's one exception that should be made. The rapper who had the biggest potential to be a film star was the late Tupac Shakur. But unlike the others he was not a gangsta rapper first and an actor second. He was a drama school product who became a rapper and adopted the tough guy persona when gangsta rap took over hip hop. And he paid the ultimate price for it. Tupac was a fine actor, and in films such as Gridlock'd he played characters with a vulnerability that matched his delicate face - rather than the 'Thug Life' tattoo he had on his stomach. A rapper who shares Tupac's Fame -style education is Mos Def, contemporary hip hop's most thoughtful major figure. He has had parallel music and acting careers from the start, but his profile as an actor should really take off when Spike Lee's next film, Bamboozled , comes out. 'Mos is great,' Lee enthused recently. All of which leaves only one question: when's the Puff Daddy film - and can we do anything to stop it? It turns out that Puffy was scheduled to appear in Any Given Sunday , but dropped out at the last minute. Then it was announced he had taken an option on King Suckerman , by the excellent Washington-based crime novelist George P. Pelecanos. But that was two years ago, and nothing more has been heard. Perhaps the reputation of rappers in the movies will be left intact, after all.

At Arsenal, we never, ever started any brawls - we just finished them.' </p> <p>It was all part of a siege mentality encouraged by George Graham, which, Rocastle believes, made a significant impression on Ferguson. He explains how the Londoners were expected to beat a hasty retreat from Lancashire, tails between legs. 'But we went into the Man United players lounge with our heads held high,' he counters.

Blairite catch-phrases, such as `sus-tained modernisation', pepper his conversation.</p> <p>`People haven't fully grasped the depth and breadth of the modernisation programme,' he claims. The most noticeable difference is the Geordie accent, though even that is much softened by constant contact with Londoners.</p> <p>He certainly has a point when he claims the changes he is introducing to the NHS have not yet caught on with the public. The Health Service is reckoned to be the biggest single cause of the drastic fall in Blair's personal standing in the country in the opening weeks of the year.</p> <p>Some individual horror stories , particularly that of Mavis Skeet, whose operation for throat cancer was cancelled four times until it became too late , are so bad that Milburn admits he has no excuse to offer.</p> <p>`When ghastly things happen in hospitals, it is obviously an awful thing, and Mrs Skeet is a particularly awful case,' he said. `I don't shed responsibility for any of this. It is terrible when these things happen.</p> <p>`We acknowledge that we have a lack of capacity in the Health Service, and secondly that that takes time to put right.' But there ends the mea culpa. For the rest of an hour-long interview in his Whitehall office, Milburn was ebullient, argumentative, bursting with plans and statistics, and exuding optimism.</p> <p>`Waiting lists are coming down. We have the biggest hospital building programme this country has ever seen. We have got every casualty department in the country being modernised, new services like NHS Direct and more nurses returning to the NHS. These are big changes, but they are just the start.'</p> <p>The way Milburn tells it, last week's apparent U-turn , when an extra \u00a311 billion promised by Tony Blair one day turned out to be no more than an aspiration two days later , was just a technicality. The extra money is on the way. All NHS staff , including the often forgotten non-medical staff , are in line for generous pay awards. The man who only months ago, as a Treasury Minister, was sternly holding down public spending has transformed into Mr Spend, Spend, Spend.</p> <p>He vowed there would be `more investment, and sustained investment over a period of years , because we need sustained increases in income if we are going to have the sort of modern health service people quite rightly want to see'.</p> <p>To get that extra money, he is willing to upset Treasury mandarins who cannot bear the idea that taxpayers should be told which parts of the tax they pay goes into what public service. In Treasury jargon, it's called `hypothecation', and is to be sternly discouraged. But Milburn says: `I've got a fairly open mind about hypothecation. I think there are down sides as well as up sides.</p> <p>`I welcome the fact that the Chancellor decided that if tobacco taxes were increased that money will essentially be hypothecated for the NHS. That will be very helpful for next year. There are good arguments to say maybe we could do more there.'</p> <p>Though he refused to utter the \u00a311bn figure , which came from experts analysing Blair's words on television a week ago, rather than from the Prime Minister himself , Milburn confirmed every detail of the arithmetic that produced it. Health spending in the UK is below the European average by about 1 per cent of our gross domestic product. Barring an economic catastrophe, the difference will be made up in five years, and all that extra money will go into the NHS.</p> <p>When the Tories accuse Milburn of being ideologically opposed to private healthcare, they have a point. `The private healthcare market in Britain is in trouble and isn't expanding,' he said. `The growth in health spending in the UK, on our plans, will come from growth in the NHS. I think that's the right thing to do, because I think it's the fairest and the most efficient means of getting healthcare to the majority of people.</p> <p>`All expenditure, whether it is public or private, is of course dependent on the economy. Let's not pretend that if we had a system of private health insurance in our country, as the Conservatives want, that it wouldn't be susceptible to economic fluctuation. It would actually be more sensitive to economic fluctuation.</p> <p>`And why? Because if you are having to insure yourself against health risk, then if you lose your job or you have lower disposable income, the first thing to go is private health insurance.'</p> <p>Once he has started on the subject of private medicine, it is hard to get him off. It is as if a hidden streak of Old Labour left over from his days as a young left-wing activist is peering through. `I do believe absolutely that the Conservatives have made the most profound political misjudgment,' he claimed. `They have walked off the playing-field. They have abandoned the postwar consensus on health. They have put all their eggs in the private health insurance basket. They have got themselves into the deepest political water.'</p> <p>The calculation that the Tories have blundered, giving him an avenue of escape from an embarrassing political crisis, may explain why he appears little concerned his standing is roughly equivalent to that of the former manger of his favourite football team, Ruud Gullit.</p> <p>`Let's not pretend I'm the only Health Minister in the world in the hot seat. Healthcare systems the world over are under pressure. Some of these problems just go with the territory.'</p>",

The Health Service is reckoned to be the biggest single cause of the drastic fall in Blair's personal standing in the country in the opening weeks of the year. Some individual horror stories , particularly that of Mavis Skeet, whose operation for throat cancer was cancelled four times until it became too late , are so bad that Milburn admits he has no excuse to offer. `When ghastly things happen in hospitals, it is obviously an awful thing, and Mrs Skeet is a particularly awful case,' he said. `I don't shed responsibility for any of this. It is terrible when these things happen. `We acknowledge that we have a lack of capacity in the Health Service, and secondly that that takes time to put right.' But there ends the mea culpa. For the rest of an hour-long interview in his Whitehall office, Milburn was ebullient, argumentative, bursting with plans and statistics, and exuding optimism. `Waiting lists are coming down. We have the biggest hospital building programme this country has ever seen. We have got every casualty department in the country being modernised, new services like NHS Direct and more nurses returning to the NHS. These are big changes, but they are just the start.' The way Milburn tells it, last week's apparent U-turn , when an extra \u00a311 billion promised by Tony Blair one day turned out to be no more than an aspiration two days later , was just a technicality. The extra money is on the way. All NHS staff , including the often forgotten non-medical staff , are in line for generous pay awards. The man who only months ago, as a Treasury Minister, was sternly holding down public spending has transformed into Mr Spend, Spend, Spend. He vowed there would be `more investment, and sustained investment over a period of years , because we need sustained increases in income if we are going to have the sort of modern health service people quite rightly want to see'. To get that extra money, he is willing to upset Treasury mandarins who cannot bear the idea that taxpayers should be told which parts of the tax they pay goes into what public service. In Treasury jargon, it's called `hypothecation', and is to be sternly discouraged. But Milburn says: `I've got a fairly open mind about hypothecation. I think there are down sides as well as up sides. `I welcome the fact that the Chancellor decided that if tobacco taxes were increased that money will essentially be hypothecated for the NHS. That will be very helpful for next year. There are good arguments to say maybe we could do more there.' Though he refused to utter the \u00a311bn figure , which came from experts analysing Blair's words on television a week ago, rather than from the Prime Minister himself , Milburn confirmed every detail of the arithmetic that produced it. Health spending in the UK is below the European average by about 1 per cent of our gross domestic product. Barring an economic catastrophe, the difference will be made up in five years, and all that extra money will go into the NHS. When the Tories accuse Milburn of being ideologically opposed to private healthcare, they have a point. `The private healthcare market in Britain is in trouble and isn't expanding,' he said. `The growth in health spending in the UK, on our plans, will come from growth in the NHS. I think that's the right thing to do, because I think it's the fairest and the most efficient means of getting healthcare to the majority of people. `All expenditure, whether it is public or private, is of course dependent on the economy. Let's not pretend that if we had a system of private health insurance in our country, as the Conservatives want, that it wouldn't be susceptible to economic fluctuation. It would actually be more sensitive to economic fluctuation. `And why? Because if you are having to insure yourself against health risk, then if you lose your job or you have lower disposable income, the first thing to go is private health insurance.' Once he has started on the subject of private medicine, it is hard to get him off. It is as if a hidden streak of Old Labour left over from his days as a young left-wing activist is peering through. `I do believe absolutely that the Conservatives have made the most profound political misjudgment,' he claimed. `They have walked off the playing-field. They have abandoned the postwar consensus on health. They have put all their eggs in the private health insurance basket. They have got themselves into the deepest political water.' The calculation that the Tories have blundered, giving him an avenue of escape from an embarrassing political crisis, may explain why he appears little concerned his standing is roughly equivalent to that of the former manger of his favourite football team, Ruud Gullit. `Let's not pretend I'm the only Health Minister in the world in the hot seat. Healthcare systems the world over are under pressure. Some of these problems just go with the territory.'",

He was more than efficient yesterday, setting up Fo\u00e9's goal before seeing a shot hacked off the line four minutes later. Song, known by the less sophisticated 'Songey' at Anfield, defended exceptionally and must have been disappointed his team were not home and dry by half-time. Pierre Wome, Patrick Mboa and Sorelle Njitap all shone against spineless opponents. The second half was a different story, thanks in part to the changes made by Ghana's Italian coach, Giuseppe Dossena - a team mate of Gianluca Vialli in Sampdoria's 1991 title-winners. Ghana, who had used all three subs by the 67th minute, equalised through Kwame Ayew, brother of the former African Footballer of the Year, Abedi Pele. They deserved their draw in a fast and hard game and the crowd seemed happy enough. Ghana: Kingston, Kuffour, Baidoo, Gargo (Edusei, 55), Nyarko, Ahinful (Ofori-Quaye, 36), Akonnor, Gyan, Johnson, Ayew, Addo (Appiah, 67) Cameroon: Alioum, Mayer,Song, Kalla, Wome, Njanka, Fotsi Njitap, Foe, Olembe (Mettomo, 81), Job (Ndiefi, 64), Mboma (Eto'o, 80)",

      "byline": "Frank Rich",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At the end of a century defined by the American success story, the two men considered most likely to succeed to the American presidency are both running away from their pasts. Al Gore, brought up in a ritzy hotel by a Washington political family, has reinvented himself as a down-home Tennessean; George Bush, a political prince educated at Andover, Yale and Harvard, is now a man of the people in cowboy boots. The man whose job they covet, of course, is the former Bill Blythe, son of a travelling salesman and product of the disreputable gambling town of Hot Springs, Arkansas, who, via Georgetown, Oxford and Yale, long ago remade himself (for a while, anyway) into the Man From Hope. </p> <p>These days, white American kids can reinvent themselves as black in a youth culture dominated by hip-hop. Ralph Lauren instructs us all on how to be old-school white. In a country where obsession with body image is now a transgenerational religion, the metamorphoses promised by plastic surgery outnumber Baskin-Robbins flavours. Those who wish to remake themselves in gender, age or biography, whether for fun, profit or criminality, need merely trot out a new screen name on AOL, which in its 5.0 upgrade increases the number of possible fictive identities per subscriber from five to seven. </p> <p>It's into this fluid world that The Talented Mr Ripley has been released. Written and directed by Anthony Minghella, of the Oscar-anointed English Patient, the film stars the gilded Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow; it is sumptuously set in the Technicolor 1950s, in lush climes stretching from a penthouse terrace on Central Park West to Venice, Rome, San Remo and a bucolic, cliff-hanging village on the Amalfi Coast. But for all those glittering trappings, this is no Good Will Hunting or Shakespeare in Love. Damon and Paltrow are not a couple in the film, and they would as soon kill each other as kiss. </p> <p>The earnest, upwardly mobile Tom Ripley, played by Damon, isn't particularly greedy or ambitious, but he does want to rise above his drab circumstances to grab the right, socially acceptable lifestyle, along with love and money. By the time he takes a wrong turn in pursuit of his fantasy, we're already along for the ride. </p> <p>When we first meet him, he's a pallid, immaculate young man with Clark Kent glasses and fastidious manners. But he lives in a mean flat in Manhattan, and his actual job is as an attendant in a concert-hall lavatory. Thanks to a borrowed navy blazer and a chance encounter, Tom Ripley encourages a shipping magnate named Herbert Greenleaf in his mistaken belief that Tom had been at Princeton with his son Dickie, class of '56. Dickie Greenleaf - a dazzling all-American golden boy and a role very likely to confer stardom on British actor Jude Law - is off idling in Italy, sybaritically pursuing a dilettante's calling as a jazz saxophonist and a romance with Marge Sherwood (Paltrow), an aspiring writer from his Park Avenue set. Dickie's disapproving dad offers Tom $1,000 to visit his son in Italy and bring him home to take his rightful place in the family business. </p> <p>The movie's first moments - the warped-lullaby musical theme reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's for Vertigo, the jagged credits in the style of Saul Bass's for North by Northwest - recall Hitchcock's high-style movies of the Fifties, in which that mercurial director sometimes took perverse delight in casting James Stewart, American Everyman, in neurotic roles far removed from his angelic Frank Capra heroes. In Vertigo, Stewart was John (Scottie) Ferguson, a smart, emotionally remote detective whose psyche plunges into voyeurism and sexual obsession once he is sent by a shipping magnate on a mission that tosses him into a bizarre plot of mistaken identity, murder and suicides both real and faked. In The Talented Mr Ripley, Damon, only recently seen as Steven Spielberg's American Everyman, Private Ryan, portrays another smart, emotionally reticent Peeping Tom, and his parallel assignment for another shipping magnate tosses him into similar horrors. The tight-lipped Tom Ripley, looking a bit like the pre-superstar Andy Warhol of the Fifties, falls in love with the bronzed, self-assured Dickie Greenleaf as surely as Stewart did with Kim Novak. </p> <p>But there he and his predecessor part. Where Scottie wants to remake the Novak character into his dream girl, Tom wants to remake himself into his dream boy. He wants to duplicate Dickie - in looks, in savoir-faire, in Gucci accessories - until he can pass as being to the manner, and perhaps even to the Greenleaf manor, born. 'I always thought, \"Better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody,\"' Tom says, and no matter what the human cost, including the annihilation of his own self, he will not be denied. Clark Kent wills himself into Superman, but a Superman as ruthless as Macbeth. </p> <p>Tom Ripley was born in the imagination of the novelist Patricia Highsmith (1921-95), who made a life's work of her ostracism from the American mainstream and her own subsequent self-reinvention. 'Everyone in the book is making themselves up in some shape or form, and that's what she was doing herself,' as Minghella puts it. Born Mary Patricia Plangman (she later took her stepfather's surname) to separated, soon-to-be-divorced parents, Highsmith was reared by a grandmother in Fort Worth, then moved at age six with her mother, a fashion illustrator for Women's Wear Daily, to Greenwich Village. Later, Highsmith would matter-of-factly tell interviewers how she didn't meet her father until she was 12 and of how her mother had tried to abort her by drinking turpentine five months into the pregnancy. After graduating from university, Highsmith made a living writing scenarios for action comic books, then started her own itinerant wanderings through America. The Talented Mr Ripley, the second of Highsmith's 20-odd books, was written in 1955 as she uprooted herself from Massachusetts to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Finally, she fled to Europe, where she spent most of her adult life. </p> <p>In a rare TV interview she granted the South Bank Show in the early Eighties, Highsmith is a forbidding, unsmiling figure in a Burberry trench coat with a pugnacious, pouchy face framed by thick, parted black hair; she looks rather like her favourite bird, the owl. At the end, she was living alone in a remote Italian-speaking village with a population of 250 perched in Switzerland. Tom Ripley - whom she belatedly brought back in four other books; the first, 15 years after his debut - was her favourite creation. 'He could be called psychotic,' she said, defending him against the charge of amorality levelled by Melvyn Bragg. 'But I would not call him insane because his actions are rational. I consider him a rather civilised person who kills when he absolutely has to.' If there's 'not much to be admired' about him, she added, he was also 'not entirely to be censured'. </p> <p>In the literary arena, Highsmith never got the breaks of the blue-chip authors of her time. Her first novel - 1950's Strangers on a Train, which lays out some of the Ripley themes of class envy, identity switching and male-male infatuation (beta with alpha, in current lingo) - was snapped up by Hitchcock and made into a classic film. But the director had kept his identity covert while pursuing the rights, thereby nabbing the book for the bargain price of $7,500, and the screenplay's famous co-writer, Raymond Chandler, got more credit for what was on-screen than did the obscure author of the novel that was its source. Highsmith did have her literary champions in her native America, including Truman Capote and Graham Greene (who celebrated her as 'the poet of apprehension' in a 1970 essay), but her books sold better in Europe. Only in 1991 did Highsmith reveal that her own identities included 'Claire Morgan', author of The Price of Salt, a paperback lesbian novel that had sold a million copies nearly 40 years earlier. By then her career was taking on a certain bleak circularity: just as Strangers on a Train had been rejected by six publishers at the start, so her final novel, Small g: A Summer Idyll, was rejected by Knopf in America (though published in Europe) the year she died, nearly a half-century later. As a postscript Highsmith might well find unamusing, Knopf has brought out three of the Ripley novels in a handsome, if posthumous, Everyman's edition. </p> <p>The Talented Mr Ripley was made into a movie once before, the French Purple Noon, which Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment directed in 1960, with Alain Delon as Ripley. It tacked on a morally unambiguous ending, reversed Ripley's implicit sexuality and de-Americanised its characters. Minghella was hired to write the current version by its executive producer, Sydney Pollack, when The English Patient was in limbo; Minghella finished his first draft just as his movie went into rehearsal in Rome. He hadn't originally planned to direct Ripley, but found himself so captivated by the material that he asked the studio to wait for him until he was free to take it on. Once The English Patient hit it big and other offers flooded in, he could have abandoned Highsmith for safer ground, but didn't. Even so, 'this film was never intended to be more than a chamber film,' says the director. Like him, the star actors all committed to this risky project before their biggest career breakthroughs might have pulled them in more conventional directions: Damon before the release of Good Will Hunting, Paltrow before she had signed on to Shakespeare in Love, Cate Blanchett as she was still shooting Elizabeth. </p> <p>Blanchett, intriguingly, plays a character that didn't exist in Highsmith: another expatriate East Side socialite who gets caught in the Tom-Dickie web. In a witty inversion of Ripley's efforts to trade up in social class, she uses an assumed name to disguise her identity as a textile heiress. It is but one of many significant alterations Minghella has made to the novel. Dickie's father has been deepened into a more controlling Jamesian blue blood; two deaths and other characters have been added as well, even as some of the book's plot devices have been streamlined. </p> <p>'You've drunk the drink, and the taste that's left in your mouth is what you go with,' says Minghella about adaptation. His Ripley is a riff on Highsmith. Literally so: in the novel, Dickie is a would-be painter, not a sax player. By making the switch, Minghella, himself a pianist, is able to turn Dickie and Tom's thwarted bond into an almost musical duet. The closest their relationship comes to some sort of unspoken consummation is an early nocturnal scene in a smoky Naples jazz club where Dickie's sultry sax partners with Tom's tentative piano on 'My Funny Valentine'. It's a cultural moment of exquisite nuance: Damon (in his own voice) precisely mimics the tragic Chet Baker's famous androgynous rendition of the song, whose lyric carries the longing of its tragically unhappy author, Lorenz Hart, a closeted, alcoholic homosexual who saw himself as a graceless outsider among the glamorous showbiz elite. </p> <p>Minghella, who is not gay, also had to figure out what to do about the book's use of Ripley's guarded sexual identity. In the novel, Marge says dismissively of Tom: 'All right, he may not be queer. He's just a nothing, which is worse. He isn't normal enough to have any kind of sex life, if you know what I mean.' Marge speaks for the vacillating Highsmith, who once said of Tom that he's a 'little bit homosexual... not that he's ever done anything about that'. (In the later Ripley books, she none-too-convincingly marries him off.) Minghella agrees that the character is a virgin who has been left out of sex as he has been left out of life's parties, but he is more candid in displaying Tom's unspoken desire for (and tenderness towards) Dickie. In one of the movie's saddest, at times hallucinatory motifs, Damon repeatedly steals glances at Jude Law in any reflected surface he can find, expressing his affection with a terrified furtiveness that is at once sinister and heartbreaking. </p> <p>Minghella removes Highsmith's stereotypes, the lingo of 'perverts' and 'sissies', only to find that his movie could land in another potential minefield by today's PC standards. Could the new Ripley be found guilty of equating homosexuality with Tom's criminal pathology? </p> <p>Minghella says of Tom's attraction to Dickie: 'The studio would have been thrilled if it was transmogrified into a love for Marge - he wants the life, so he wants the girl! Having not done that, you lay yourself open to criticism for dramatising a man with ambivalent sexuality who kills people. I'm desperate that no one infer a connection between his actions in the film and his sexuality. But it's a sorry state of affairs if you can only write about a homosexual character who behaves well - that's another kind of tyranny, I think. The minute you try to pull back from what's sensual and erotic, you're losing your nerve, and I just didn't want to shrink away from the romance of it; it's very tender to me. It seems to me so much the fabric of the story - not so much that Tom was gay but that he was in love with Dickie and with Dickie's life.' </p> <p>As balance, and to provide a stunning plot twist not in Highsmith, Minghella has expanded a character who appears in only a few lines in the novel, Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), into an important player, 'a gay person who is centred and comfortable with himself'. Without making a case out of it, the movie also generates sympathy for Tom as a closeted homosexual, with a boldness that wouldn't have been ventured by Highsmith in the Fifties. </p> <p>For all his alterations, Minghella has contradicted the book's intentions in only one substantive way: his Ripley has the stirrings of a conscience. The director is willing to risk criticisms from Highsmith purists. 'There's so much nihilism in film right now,' he explains. 'If I'm going to tell a story that's so bleak and so much a journey of a soul, if in the end Ripley was just going to go about his business, what's the journey?' In Minghella's view, to do so 'is a cynical statement, and a very easy one'. </p> <p>Everywhere else, the film enhances the novel rather than challenges it. A soft-spoken Englishman reared on the Isle of Wight by working-class parents of Italian stock who ran an ice cream business and morning-to-midnight caf\u00e9, the 45-year-old Minghella relates intensely to Ripley's and Highsmith's outsider status. 'Every English person was a Dickie Greenleaf to me,' he says of his childhood, and he drew heavily on his adolescent longings in the script, his memories 'of being behind the glass of an ice cream van' serving better-off neighbours, of delivering his parents' wares through the tradesmen's entrance of the Isle of Wight's monied Royal Yacht Squadron. </p> <p>But he has also deepened the movie's reach as a totemic American fable. A serious student of American culture since he arrived as a young man at the University of Hull, where he ultimately became a lecturer in drama before beginning his writing career in theatre and television, Minghella has used the vantage point of the century's end - and the perspective of an outsider - to set Highsmith's story within a historical context that wouldn't have been possible at mid-century. </p> <p>Advancing the novel's time frame from the early to the late Fifties, Minghella has been able to capitalise on the voluptuous Italy of il boom - a belated postwar prosperity as giddy as America's. The wealthy, sexually liberated Rome of the movie's key sequences is right out of the 1959 La Dolce Vita, a backdrop in contrast to the relatively strait-laced Americans in the foreground. Even in their Continental idyll, where they try to reinvent themselves as slumming bohemian artistes and Camus-caffeinated existentialists, Dickie and Marge covet kitchen appliances and sports cars; they nominally maintain separate residences rather than shacking up, as befits the conventions of their social class and the pre-Sixties, pre-Pill culture. When Tom sees two Italian men being physically affectionate with each other - an image inspired by a Cartier-Bresson photograph of the period - he recoils as if mortified, even though it's an intimacy he craves. </p> <p>To Minghella, an important aspect of his movie, which could be teased out of the novel only with the advantage of Nineties hindsight, is 'the collusion of men during a period in American social history when it was at its zenith' - that is, in the years just before the dawn of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique.

      "bodyText": "At the end of a century defined by the American success story, the two men considered most likely to succeed to the American presidency are both running away from their pasts. Al Gore, brought up in a ritzy hotel by a Washington political family, has reinvented himself as a down-home Tennessean; George Bush, a political prince educated at Andover, Yale and Harvard, is now a man of the people in cowboy boots. The man whose job they covet, of course, is the former Bill Blythe, son of a travelling salesman and product of the disreputable gambling town of Hot Springs, Arkansas, who, via Georgetown, Oxford and Yale, long ago remade himself (for a while, anyway) into the Man From Hope. These days, white American kids can reinvent themselves as black in a youth culture dominated by hip-hop. Ralph Lauren instructs us all on how to be old-school white. In a country where obsession with body image is now a transgenerational religion, the metamorphoses promised by plastic surgery outnumber Baskin-Robbins flavours. Those who wish to remake themselves in gender, age or biography, whether for fun, profit or criminality, need merely trot out a new screen name on AOL, which in its 5.0 upgrade increases the number of possible fictive identities per subscriber from five to seven. It's into this fluid world that The Talented Mr Ripley has been released. Written and directed by Anthony Minghella, of the Oscar-anointed English Patient, the film stars the gilded Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow; it is sumptuously set in the Technicolor 1950s, in lush climes stretching from a penthouse terrace on Central Park West to Venice, Rome, San Remo and a bucolic, cliff-hanging village on the Amalfi Coast. But for all those glittering trappings, this is no Good Will Hunting or Shakespeare in Love. Damon and Paltrow are not a couple in the film, and they would as soon kill each other as kiss. The earnest, upwardly mobile Tom Ripley, played by Damon, isn't particularly greedy or ambitious, but he does want to rise above his drab circumstances to grab the right, socially acceptable lifestyle, along with love and money. By the time he takes a wrong turn in pursuit of his fantasy, we're already along for the ride. When we first meet him, he's a pallid, immaculate young man with Clark Kent glasses and fastidious manners. But he lives in a mean flat in Manhattan, and his actual job is as an attendant in a concert-hall lavatory. Thanks to a borrowed navy blazer and a chance encounter, Tom Ripley encourages a shipping magnate named Herbert Greenleaf in his mistaken belief that Tom had been at Princeton with his son Dickie, class of '56. Dickie Greenleaf - a dazzling all-American golden boy and a role very likely to confer stardom on British actor Jude Law - is off idling in Italy, sybaritically pursuing a dilettante's calling as a jazz saxophonist and a romance with Marge Sherwood (Paltrow), an aspiring writer from his Park Avenue set. Dickie's disapproving dad offers Tom $1,000 to visit his son in Italy and bring him home to take his rightful place in the family business. The movie's first moments - the warped-lullaby musical theme reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's for Vertigo, the jagged credits in the style of Saul Bass's for North by Northwest - recall Hitchcock's high-style movies of the Fifties, in which that mercurial director sometimes took perverse delight in casting James Stewart, American Everyman, in neurotic roles far removed from his angelic Frank Capra heroes. In Vertigo, Stewart was John (Scottie) Ferguson, a smart, emotionally remote detective whose psyche plunges into voyeurism and sexual obsession once he is sent by a shipping magnate on a mission that tosses him into a bizarre plot of mistaken identity, murder and suicides both real and faked. In The Talented Mr Ripley, Damon, only recently seen as Steven Spielberg's American Everyman, Private Ryan, portrays another smart, emotionally reticent Peeping Tom, and his parallel assignment for another shipping magnate tosses him into similar horrors. The tight-lipped Tom Ripley, looking a bit like the pre-superstar Andy Warhol of the Fifties, falls in love with the bronzed, self-assured Dickie Greenleaf as surely as Stewart did with Kim Novak. But there he and his predecessor part. Where Scottie wants to remake the Novak character into his dream girl, Tom wants to remake himself into his dream boy. He wants to duplicate Dickie - in looks, in savoir-faire, in Gucci accessories - until he can pass as being to the manner, and perhaps even to the Greenleaf manor, born. 'I always thought, \"Better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody,\"' Tom says, and no matter what the human cost, including the annihilation of his own self, he will not be denied. Clark Kent wills himself into Superman, but a Superman as ruthless as Macbeth. Tom Ripley was born in the imagination of the novelist Patricia Highsmith (1921-95), who made a life's work of her ostracism from the American mainstream and her own subsequent self-reinvention. 'Everyone in the book is making themselves up in some shape or form, and that's what she was doing herself,' as Minghella puts it. Born Mary Patricia Plangman (she later took her stepfather's surname) to separated, soon-to-be-divorced parents, Highsmith was reared by a grandmother in Fort Worth, then moved at age six with her mother, a fashion illustrator for Women's Wear Daily, to Greenwich Village. Later, Highsmith would matter-of-factly tell interviewers how she didn't meet her father until she was 12 and of how her mother had tried to abort her by drinking turpentine five months into the pregnancy. After graduating from university, Highsmith made a living writing scenarios for action comic books, then started her own itinerant wanderings through America. The Talented Mr Ripley, the second of Highsmith's 20-odd books, was written in 1955 as she uprooted herself from Massachusetts to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Finally, she fled to Europe, where she spent most of her adult life. In a rare TV interview she granted the South Bank Show in the early Eighties, Highsmith is a forbidding, unsmiling figure in a Burberry trench coat with a pugnacious, pouchy face framed by thick, parted black hair; she looks rather like her favourite bird, the owl. At the end, she was living alone in a remote Italian-speaking village with a population of 250 perched in Switzerland. Tom Ripley - whom she belatedly brought back in four other books; the first, 15 years after his debut - was her favourite creation. 'He could be called psychotic,' she said, defending him against the charge of amorality levelled by Melvyn Bragg. 'But I would not call him insane because his actions are rational. I consider him a rather civilised person who kills when he absolutely has to.' If there's 'not much to be admired' about him, she added, he was also 'not entirely to be censured'. In the literary arena, Highsmith never got the breaks of the blue-chip authors of her time. Her first novel - 1950's Strangers on a Train, which lays out some of the Ripley themes of class envy, identity switching and male-male infatuation (beta with alpha, in current lingo) - was snapped up by Hitchcock and made into a classic film. But the director had kept his identity covert while pursuing the rights, thereby nabbing the book for the bargain price of $7,500, and the screenplay's famous co-writer, Raymond Chandler, got more credit for what was on-screen than did the obscure author of the novel that was its source. Highsmith did have her literary champions in her native America, including Truman Capote and Graham Greene (who celebrated her as 'the poet of apprehension' in a 1970 essay), but her books sold better in Europe. Only in 1991 did Highsmith reveal that her own identities included 'Claire Morgan', author of The Price of Salt, a paperback lesbian novel that had sold a million copies nearly 40 years earlier. By then her career was taking on a certain bleak circularity: just as Strangers on a Train had been rejected by six publishers at the start, so her final novel, Small g: A Summer Idyll, was rejected by Knopf in America (though published in Europe) the year she died, nearly a half-century later. As a postscript Highsmith might well find unamusing, Knopf has brought out three of the Ripley novels in a handsome, if posthumous, Everyman's edition. The Talented Mr Ripley was made into a movie once before, the French Purple Noon, which Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment directed in 1960, with Alain Delon as Ripley. It tacked on a morally unambiguous ending, reversed Ripley's implicit sexuality and de-Americanised its characters. Minghella was hired to write the current version by its executive producer, Sydney Pollack, when The English Patient was in limbo; Minghella finished his first draft just as his movie went into rehearsal in Rome. He hadn't originally planned to direct Ripley, but found himself so captivated by the material that he asked the studio to wait for him until he was free to take it on. Once The English Patient hit it big and other offers flooded in, he could have abandoned Highsmith for safer ground, but didn't. Even so, 'this film was never intended to be more than a chamber film,' says the director. Like him, the star actors all committed to this risky project before their biggest career breakthroughs might have pulled them in more conventional directions: Damon before the release of Good Will Hunting, Paltrow before she had signed on to Shakespeare in Love, Cate Blanchett as she was still shooting Elizabeth. Blanchett, intriguingly, plays a character that didn't exist in Highsmith: another expatriate East Side socialite who gets caught in the Tom-Dickie web. In a witty inversion of Ripley's efforts to trade up in social class, she uses an assumed name to disguise her identity as a textile heiress. It is but one of many significant alterations Minghella has made to the novel. Dickie's father has been deepened into a more controlling Jamesian blue blood; two deaths and other characters have been added as well, even as some of the book's plot devices have been streamlined. 'You've drunk the drink, and the taste that's left in your mouth is what you go with,' says Minghella about adaptation. His Ripley is a riff on Highsmith. Literally so: in the novel, Dickie is a would-be painter, not a sax player. By making the switch, Minghella, himself a pianist, is able to turn Dickie and Tom's thwarted bond into an almost musical duet. The closest their relationship comes to some sort of unspoken consummation is an early nocturnal scene in a smoky Naples jazz club where Dickie's sultry sax partners with Tom's tentative piano on 'My Funny Valentine'. It's a cultural moment of exquisite nuance: Damon (in his own voice) precisely mimics the tragic Chet Baker's famous androgynous rendition of the song, whose lyric carries the longing of its tragically unhappy author, Lorenz Hart, a closeted, alcoholic homosexual who saw himself as a graceless outsider among the glamorous showbiz elite. Minghella, who is not gay, also had to figure out what to do about the book's use of Ripley's guarded sexual identity. In the novel, Marge says dismissively of Tom: 'All right, he may not be queer. He's just a nothing, which is worse. He isn't normal enough to have any kind of sex life, if you know what I mean.' Marge speaks for the vacillating Highsmith, who once said of Tom that he's a 'little bit homosexual... not that he's ever done anything about that'. (In the later Ripley books, she none-too-convincingly marries him off.) Minghella agrees that the character is a virgin who has been left out of sex as he has been left out of life's parties, but he is more candid in displaying Tom's unspoken desire for (and tenderness towards) Dickie. In one of the movie's saddest, at times hallucinatory motifs, Damon repeatedly steals glances at Jude Law in any reflected surface he can find, expressing his affection with a terrified furtiveness that is at once sinister and heartbreaking. Minghella removes Highsmith's stereotypes, the lingo of 'perverts' and 'sissies', only to find that his movie could land in another potential minefield by today's PC standards. Could the new Ripley be found guilty of equating homosexuality with Tom's criminal pathology? Minghella says of Tom's attraction to Dickie: 'The studio would have been thrilled if it was transmogrified into a love for Marge - he wants the life, so he wants the girl! Having not done that, you lay yourself open to criticism for dramatising a man with ambivalent sexuality who kills people. I'm desperate that no one infer a connection between his actions in the film and his sexuality. But it's a sorry state of affairs if you can only write about a homosexual character who behaves well - that's another kind of tyranny, I think. The minute you try to pull back from what's sensual and erotic, you're losing your nerve, and I just didn't want to shrink away from the romance of it; it's very tender to me. It seems to me so much the fabric of the story - not so much that Tom was gay but that he was in love with Dickie and with Dickie's life.' As balance, and to provide a stunning plot twist not in Highsmith, Minghella has expanded a character who appears in only a few lines in the novel, Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), into an important player, 'a gay person who is centred and comfortable with himself'. Without making a case out of it, the movie also generates sympathy for Tom as a closeted homosexual, with a boldness that wouldn't have been ventured by Highsmith in the Fifties. For all his alterations, Minghella has contradicted the book's intentions in only one substantive way: his Ripley has the stirrings of a conscience. The director is willing to risk criticisms from Highsmith purists. 'There's so much nihilism in film right now,' he explains. 'If I'm going to tell a story that's so bleak and so much a journey of a soul, if in the end Ripley was just going to go about his business, what's the journey?' In Minghella's view, to do so 'is a cynical statement, and a very easy one'. Everywhere else, the film enhances the novel rather than challenges it. A soft-spoken Englishman reared on the Isle of Wight by working-class parents of Italian stock who ran an ice cream business and morning-to-midnight caf\u00e9, the 45-year-old Minghella relates intensely to Ripley's and Highsmith's outsider status. 'Every English person was a Dickie Greenleaf to me,' he says of his childhood, and he drew heavily on his adolescent longings in the script, his memories 'of being behind the glass of an ice cream van' serving better-off neighbours, of delivering his parents' wares through the tradesmen's entrance of the Isle of Wight's monied Royal Yacht Squadron. But he has also deepened the movie's reach as a totemic American fable. A serious student of American culture since he arrived as a young man at the University of Hull, where he ultimately became a lecturer in drama before beginning his writing career in theatre and television, Minghella has used the vantage point of the century's end - and the perspective of an outsider - to set Highsmith's story within a historical context that wouldn't have been possible at mid-century. Advancing the novel's time frame from the early to the late Fifties, Minghella has been able to capitalise on the voluptuous Italy of il boom - a belated postwar prosperity as giddy as America's. The wealthy, sexually liberated Rome of the movie's key sequences is right out of the 1959 La Dolce Vita, a backdrop in contrast to the relatively strait-laced Americans in the foreground. Even in their Continental idyll, where they try to reinvent themselves as slumming bohemian artistes and Camus-caffeinated existentialists, Dickie and Marge covet kitchen appliances and sports cars; they nominally maintain separate residences rather than shacking up, as befits the conventions of their social class and the pre-Sixties, pre-Pill culture. When Tom sees two Italian men being physically affectionate with each other - an image inspired by a Cartier-Bresson photograph of the period - he recoils as if mortified, even though it's an intimacy he craves. To Minghella, an important aspect of his movie, which could be teased out of the novel only with the advantage of Nineties hindsight, is 'the collusion of men during a period in American social history when it was at its zenith' - that is, in the years just before the dawn of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique. In this sense, he feels Paltrow won't get enough credit for a performance that in the Fifties could have been a Grace Kelly glamour turn ('Hitchcock would have cast Gwyneth in everything'). Though Marge is the character who sees most clearly through Ripley's game, she is manipulated or patronised by every man on screen, straight or gay - each of whom is intent on keeping her in her place and in the dark. For the film's narcissistic straight men, she's a good egg; for the closeted gay characters, she's an unwitting decoy. Minghella says that in addition to looking again at Vertigo and contemporaneous Fellini movies (particularly his favourite, I Vitelloni ) in preparing Ripley, he helped nail down the young American characters' cultural and sexual milieu by reading memoirs by bisexual Sixties poet and social critic Paul Goodman and gay author and poet Paul Monette who died of Aids in 1995. Yet the larger American themes of The Talented Mr Ripley, sounded by Ripley's relentless mission to reinvent himself along the lines of his gaudiest dreams, transcend the movie's particular time and place. Both as written initially by Highsmith and then expanded by Minghella, what might have been a narrow thriller seems like a mordant recap of a classic, perhaps the classic, strain in American literature and social history. Minghella talks affectionately about American writers from Wharton and James to Tennessee Williams and Raymond Carver. But the biggest influence on his Ripley screenplay seems to be one he didn't mention: Fitzgerald. In Minghella's screenplay, Ripley is an unmistakable descendant of Gatsby, that 'penniless young man without a past' who will stop at nothing to will his romantic idol, Daisy, into believing he is of her class. By making Ripley not just a fraudulent Princetonian but also a men's room menial - a detail not in Highsmith's book - Minghella heightens the parallel to Gatsby, who invoked an Oxford pedigree to cloak his humble past as James Gatz, a janitor. For much of the way, especially given the empathy and intelligence with which Damon laces (and yet never sentimentalises) a spooky role, it is possible to admire Ripley as 'talented' in the way that Fitzgerald saw Gatsby as 'great' - as a grand dreamer with the creative vision to make something of himself. They might have been the kind of dreamers who have always built America, had they not overreached. The brilliance of Highsmith's conception of Tom Ripley was her ability to keep the heroic and demonic American Dreamer in balance in the same protagonist - thus keeping us on his side well after his behaviour becomes far more sociopathic than that of a con man like Gatsby (even allowing for the rumours that Gatsby had 'killed a man once'). Ripley's debut was in 1955, the era of the Beats and anti-heroes and also of a new mainstream critique of the American 'success' story, typified by nonfiction books like 1958's The Affluent Society, by John Kenneth Galbraith. A half-century later still, Ripleys seem almost a constant on the American landscape - the real-life landscape as well as that of the culture. Outlaw Americans have always thrived in prosperous times like Fitzgerald's Twenties and Highsmith's Fifties - and in the Gold-Rush frontier before that - when success seems to be everywhere and in such tantalising reach. Our twin economic peaks of the Eighties and Nineties have produced a share of characters who could have walked right out of the pages of a Highsmith novel. In the early Eighties, a young man named David Hampton bamboozled some of the chicest households on the Upper East Side into believing he was Sidney Poitier's son - in part by persuading them that he had been a classmate of their children's at various elite schools. (In John Guare's fictionalised stage version of the story, Six Degrees of Separation, the impostor learns how to fake his identity by having an affair with a male Ivy League undergrad - a tactic that Ripley uses in Highsmith's novel.)

Beck was so convincing that he befriended Michael Douglas and served as an adviser and bit player for Oliver Stone's Wall Street. Only after the crash was it discovered that Beck's legendary tales of derring-do in the Vietnam War and clandestine adventures with the CIA were fiction. The current boom has created not just self-invented New Economy pin-ups such as internet entrepreneur Jim Clark but also the likes of Martin Frankel, who, with the right lies, his East Coast estate and impressive computer consoles, passed himself off as a financial genius while supposedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from US insurance companies. Though he was a gawky, bespectacled high-school dropout and so neurotic that he suffered from 'trader's block', he somehow convinced his prey, as well as the many women he attracted to his harem, that he was a brilliant stock speculator and world-class sybarite.

This could have been Ripley's upwardly mobile reading list - or items on the self-improvement checklist kept by the young James Gatz. (Martin Frankel also kept a list, found after his capture, the first item on which was 'launder money'.) There's something about Ripley, in both his desire for a better life and his eagerness to discard the unhappy past, that is built into the American character, most alluringly so, and we live in a time when, more than ever, a new life is plausible.

      "body": "<p> The NHS is under-resourced. Every user knows it. Its staff know it. The political establishment accepts it. The Prime Minister has admitted as much. Britain has fewer doctors and hospital beds per head than almost any other country in Europe. More needs to be spent, so when Blair committed himself last week to raising health expenditure to the European average by the end of the next parliament there should have been a national sense of relief. Instead it was an occasion for hand-wringing, Prime Ministerial wobble and general disbelief. </p> <p>It couldn't be done, it was said. There isn't and there won't be enough money. Blair was dodging difficult choices about which taxes to raise. The Conservatives insisted that the only means to this end was to allow the private sector to lead the charge, urging the reintroduction of tax relief for private health insurance. And then Number 10 seemed to get windy, briefing on Monday that it was only an aspiration - and conditional in any case on the economy doing well. </p> <p>But for once beleaguered liberal Britain should not look a gift horse in the mouth; this is an occasion for a cheer. The Prime Minister, despite his partial retreat, has set an important benchmark for the desirable growth of NHS spending, and by implication other key programmes such as education and transport. He has also put down a marker that the extraordinarily large Treasury surpluses projected in the years ahead will be spent on improving public services and not given away in tax cuts. And he has put the Tories on the spot; they have to match his commitment or demonstrate that private health insurance can achieve the same result - a demonstration that is beyond them. In the new politics of how to spend the budget surpluses, Blair - panicked perhaps by the hysterical reaction to the comparatively small rise in flu cases and media overkill - has set the political agenda. It is an important moment. </p> <p>The scale of the implied increase in NHS spending is vast. The \u00a350 billion (in round numbers) spent on the NHS in Britain at the moment is 5.7 per cent of GDP; another \u00a39bn - or 1 per cent of GDP - is spent on health privately. The crude European average is 8 per cent of GDP, but that is simply arrived at by adding up each country's average and dividing it by the total, so that Luxembourg's spending has the same importance as Germany's. If you weight the calculation by size of country, the real average of European health spending, according to the King's Fund, is 8.6 per cent of GDP. </p> <p>Because the Blair Government does not plan to expand the private health sector, it will have to pay to close the gap of 1.9 per cent of GDP itself - \u00a317bn at today's prices. If it wants to do that over the next six years, health spending will have to rise by just under 8 per cent a year in real terms to 2006; if spending grows at only 5 per cent annum in real terms - the figure the Prime Minister cited - then it will take a full 12 years to reach the true European average. And if the Europeans further increase spending, then it will take longer still. It takes time to redress a generation of neglect. </p> <p>Can 8 per cent growth in NHS spending until 2006 be achieved without raising taxes? The straight answer is yes, even though it would push Gordon Brown's demanding framework for spending and borrowing to the limit. But spending in every other department could only grow in line with the growth of GDP, the reason for Cabinet restiveness last week. </p> <p>If this is a surprise, it is because almost nobody seems to have come to terms with the transformation in public finances under New Labour. The combination of Brown's 'stealth' taxes, equivalent to more than 2 per cent of GDP, sticking to the Conservatives' spending plans for the first two years of this parliament, economic growth of close to 2 per cent instead of recession in 1999, the fall in unemployment and continuing low inflation has been stunning. The current budget surplus last year was \u00a37bn; it will more than double by 2003. </p> <p>Indeed if the long run economic growth rate is the 2.5 per cent now assumed by the Treasury, then as the TUC calculated in its submission to the Treasury's Spending Review last week, public spending could be raised another \u00a312bn by 2004 and, on my calculations, to the necessary \u00a317bn for the NHS by 2006 - and still leave the \u00a37bn safety margin Brown had last year. </p> <p>If growth turns out lower, then the NHS budget can be protected by running down the safety margin; and in an economic downturn borrowing is allowed even under Brown's rules. A European class health service is ours for the having - and without raising taxes. </p> <p>The Conservative proposition that the alternative can be achieved through private insurance is for the birds and, while New Labour retreats and tem porises in so many areas of policy, it is good to see some iron in its soul over private medical insurance. It is expensive, focused on those who are good medical risks, and rarely extends to the over-75s who are most in need. Worse, even if it worked in building up the private sector, it would have the perverse result of driving up the NHS's cost as private contractors bid up wages to attract the limited number of trained staff. </p> <p>But the proof is in the pudding. Tax relief on medical insurance for the over-60s was introduced in 1990; but by 1997, when Labour abolished it, only 1 per cent more of the over-60s had taken advantage of the tax break. Moreover as the human genome project is completed, we will soon know each individual's DNA structure and predicted health experience; in this emerging world private insurance is madness, because those known to be poor risks will simply not be able to insure themselves at a reasonable premium. Poor Liam Fox, the Shadow Health Secretary, is stuck with a ludicrous, provenly unworkable policy that is out of kilter with the times - the mirror image of Labour's 1983 far-fetched commitment to extend nationalisation to promote economic efficiency. </p> <p>The only way to fund the NHS is through general taxation or comprehensive social insurance; the hypothecated health tax is another blind alley. If all NHS spending is dependent on a stand-alone or hypothecated tax, then its revenues will go up and down with the economic cycle; if only part is hypothecated, then by the second or third year it becomes impossible to disentangle what is new and what is old money. </p> <p>On the NHS New Labour is making a stand.

      "bodyText": "The NHS is under-resourced. Every user knows it. Its staff know it. The political establishment accepts it. The Prime Minister has admitted as much. Britain has fewer doctors and hospital beds per head than almost any other country in Europe. More needs to be spent, so when Blair committed himself last week to raising health expenditure to the European average by the end of the next parliament there should have been a national sense of relief. Instead it was an occasion for hand-wringing, Prime Ministerial wobble and general disbelief. It couldn't be done, it was said. There isn't and there won't be enough money. Blair was dodging difficult choices about which taxes to raise. The Conservatives insisted that the only means to this end was to allow the private sector to lead the charge, urging the reintroduction of tax relief for private health insurance. And then Number 10 seemed to get windy, briefing on Monday that it was only an aspiration - and conditional in any case on the economy doing well. But for once beleaguered liberal Britain should not look a gift horse in the mouth; this is an occasion for a cheer. The Prime Minister, despite his partial retreat, has set an important benchmark for the desirable growth of NHS spending, and by implication other key programmes such as education and transport. He has also put down a marker that the extraordinarily large Treasury surpluses projected in the years ahead will be spent on improving public services and not given away in tax cuts.

      "body": "<p>For 20 years now John Sayles has been one of the most interesting and truly independent figures on the American movie scene, initially writing clever exploitation genre flicks for Roger Corman to pay for his own modestly budgeted pictures. Much of his work has been political, films with large ensemble casts looking at communities in conflict and transition - in the past in the case of Matewan (his account of a coal miners' strike in the 1920s); in the present with City of Hope (the anatomy of a declining New Jersey industrial town). Occasionally - as with Passion Fish, set in the Louisiana bayous - he has ventured, less successfully in my view, into the pastoral mode. </p> <p>His new and very fine movie, Limbo, encompasses all his previous work. It starts out as an exploration of a troubled community, turns briefly into a thriller that evokes Hemingway's To Have and Have Not and ends up as a wilderness survival story. The setting is a small port on the coast of Alaska, America's last frontier, the place of exile and self-mortification for which Jack Nicholson is heading at the conclusion of Five Easy Pieces . Haskell Wexler's images capture this remote world in all its chilly, austere beauty. </p> <p>Initially cross-cutting between the local salmon cannery on its last operation and the open-air wedding of a wealthy entrepreneur's daughter, the movie introduces us to a variety of characters - businessmen, cannery workers, fishermen, a pair of middle-aged lesbian lawyers, a freelance bush pilot - before focusing on two of them. One is a native Alaskan in his late forties, Joe Gastineau (the always admirable Sayles regular, David Strathairn), who lost his chance of playing college basketball when he injured a knee as a high-school senior, then gave up deep-sea fishing for odd-job work after surviving the traumatic sinking of a fishing boat. </p> <p>The other is Donna De Angelo (the feisty Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), a divorced country singer pushing 40, who has drifted through 36 states before ending up in the limbo of Alaska with her 16-year-old daughter Noelle (Vanessa Martinez). Following a pattern in Sayles' movies, the man lives under the shadow of a powerful father, the woman is at odds with a rebellious daughter, and these two bruised people fence warily when they meet. </p> <p>Joe is very much part of this town's history. The son of a pioneering family, he worked in the declining fishing business, then in a pulp mill until it was closed, and now works on the fringes of the tourist industry. 'History is our future here,' says a local booster who sees Alaska on its way to being a giant theme park, an 'authentic' Disneyland offering safe adventures. Donna is part of this new economy, performing in a bar left over from Gold Rush days that's on its way to becoming a historic landmark. The romance is subtly located in the context of the changing community and Donna and Joe are falling in love as Joe's young half-brother Bobby (Casey Siemaszko) turns up from Southern California. </p> <p>Bobby, who's as cocky and talkative as Joe is quiet and taciturn, has given up fishing for taking tourists out to sea in warmer waters, and he lures his brother into accompanying him on a two-day trip on his fancy boat to impress a wealthy client he's going to pick up. Joe takes Donna and her daughter along for a little adventure that turns into a big one. Because Bobby, the shady opportunist, has got involved with drug dealers and has an assignation with Mafiosi he's seeking to placate. The film's mood suddenly changes, and Joe, Donna and Noelle become first fugitives, then desperate survivors on an uninhabited island. </p> <p>Yet though the movie twice switches genres, it remains thematically all of a piece. Keeping a rendezvous with destiny determined by their social situation, the trio are having for real the ersatz experience offered to tourists. 'This is what they call quality time, people pay money to come and live like this,' says Donna bitterly, knowing they may never escape. One of the movie's most brilliant devices is to have Noelle discover in a ruined farmhouse the diary kept by a pioneer's daughter. She reads it aloud by firelight, a few entries at a time, and the story it tells is an encoded version of their own predicament. The effect is both moving and strangely haunting.</p>",

His 10-year reign was punctuated by allegations from critics that he was damaging the corporation's creative output. </p> <p>Critics as varied as Michael Grade, former head of Channel 4; Mark Tully, distinguished India correspondent; and playwright Dennis Potter led the revolt. They condemned Birt as 'Big Brother', a 'control freak', 'a bureaucratic vandal' and a 'croak-voiced Dalek'. It was said his management style made the BBC 'a secretive, top-heavy and forbidding fortress from which no stray opinion is permitted to escape the BBC's own thought police'. </p> <p>Birt was at the centre of an early controvery when it was revealed he was being paid as a freelance via his own private company, his wife had two BBC salaries and his \u00a34,000 Giorgio Armani 'wardrobe expenses' were being claimed in tax returns. </p> <p>One senior BBC programme-maker said yesterday: 'Birt set new standards in bullying, cost-cutting and enriching himself. He sacked thousands of staff and appointed endless bureaucrats who had futile meetings to implement debilitating and lunatic plans. </p> <p>'Staff morale has still not recovered. He could not be less well qualified to be a management guru.' Although he collected many enemies, some people outside the organisation believed his reforms were laid the foundations for the BBC enter the digital age. 'It hurt a lot, but it needed to happen,' said one commentator. </p> <p>Birt 'auditioned' half a dozen literary agents before choosing Jonathan Lloyd, managing director of Curtis Brown, who has a reputation for securing big money deals. </p> <p>Birt and Lloyd, who also represents Raymond Seitz, the former US ambassador to Britain, and Marion Keyes, the bestselling Irish novelist, are negotiating with six publishing houses, including Random House, Fourth Estate and HarperCollins. </p> <p>The two men have handed publishers a document marked 'Private and Confidential', which outlines the autobiography. </p> <p>Birt and Lloyd originally proposed a third book on the media in the twenty-first century, but industry sources say it was dropped after publishers said the market was too small for three Birtian tomes. Although he is famously said to have a grey image even on colour television, Birt, 55, who was ennobled in the New Year honours, is convinced he can produce a bestseller. </p> <p>Lloyd told The Observer the books would be 'among the most riveting and important of the year'. He denied Birt's public image would put off readers. 'People are entitled to their opinions but the books are exciting and original.' Asked whether he was confident he would secure a hefty advance for his client, Lloyd said: 'I always do.' </p> <p>Publishers close to the negotiations are less sure. They dismiss Birt's proposal as 'a yawn'. </p> <p>'If John Birt feels he will get \u00a3250,000 for a proposal like that, he is in for a shock,' one said. 'The autobiography proposal reads like his Who's Who entry and the management book sounds like the Ladybird Book of Organisational Theory rather than an international bestseller.' </p> <p><strong>How to be a BBC fat cat and make sure you lap up the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me</strong></p> <p> <strong> Do: </strong> <br>\u0095 Sack 4,000 staff and bring in a new tier of highly-paid middle managers, accountants and management consultants. <br>\u0095 Give yourself a \u00a350,000 pay rise when everyone else is getting 1.5 per cent and ensure that your wife is paid two salaries. \u0095 Communicate by terse handwritten memo only. <br>\u0095 Dismiss critics as 'fuddy duddy old soldiers sniping with their muskets'. <br>\u0095 Tutor the canteen staff in the art of napkin folding, especially into the shape of dinosaurs. <br>\u0095 Get the licence payer to stump up thousands for your leaving do. </p> <p> <strong> Don't:</strong> <br>\u0095 Work for the company that pays you <br>\u00a3410,000 a year.

He sacked thousands of staff and appointed endless bureaucrats who had futile meetings to implement debilitating and lunatic plans. 'Staff morale has still not recovered. He could not be less well qualified to be a management guru.' Although he collected many enemies, some people outside the organisation believed his reforms were laid the foundations for the BBC enter the digital age. 'It hurt a lot, but it needed to happen,' said one commentator. Birt 'auditioned' half a dozen literary agents before choosing Jonathan Lloyd, managing director of Curtis Brown, who has a reputation for securing big money deals. Birt and Lloyd, who also represents Raymond Seitz, the former US ambassador to Britain, and Marion Keyes, the bestselling Irish novelist, are negotiating with six publishing houses, including Random House, Fourth Estate and HarperCollins. The two men have handed publishers a document marked 'Private and Confidential', which outlines the autobiography. Birt and Lloyd originally proposed a third book on the media in the twenty-first century, but industry sources say it was dropped after publishers said the market was too small for three Birtian tomes. Although he is famously said to have a grey image even on colour television, Birt, 55, who was ennobled in the New Year honours, is convinced he can produce a bestseller. Lloyd told The Observer the books would be 'among the most riveting and important of the year'. He denied Birt's public image would put off readers. 'People are entitled to their opinions but the books are exciting and original.' Asked whether he was confident he would secure a hefty advance for his client, Lloyd said: 'I always do.' Publishers close to the negotiations are less sure. They dismiss Birt's proposal as 'a yawn'. 'If John Birt feels he will get \u00a3250,000 for a proposal like that, he is in for a shock,' one said. 'The autobiography proposal reads like his Who's Who entry and the management book sounds like the Ladybird Book of Organisational Theory rather than an international bestseller.' How to be a BBC fat cat and make sure you lap up the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me Do: \u0095 Sack 4,000 staff and bring in a new tier of highly-paid middle managers, accountants and management consultants. \u0095 Give yourself a \u00a350,000 pay rise when everyone else is getting 1.5 per cent and ensure that your wife is paid two salaries. \u0095 Communicate by terse handwritten memo only. \u0095 Dismiss critics as 'fuddy duddy old soldiers sniping with their muskets'. \u0095 Tutor the canteen staff in the art of napkin folding, especially into the shape of dinosaurs. \u0095 Get the licence payer to stump up thousands for your leaving do. Don't: \u0095 Work for the company that pays you \u00a3410,000 a year. Be a freelance and reduce your tax bills instead. \u0095 Buy your own Giorgio Armani suits. The tax man will kit you out. \u0095 Tell the chairman if you have the Exclusive of the Decade, such as, say, the first and only TV interview with Princess Diana. \u0095 Stay in London on Fridays. Head straight for your country retreat. \u0095 Leave when your successor is appointed. Hang on for five months annoying everyone until you get a peerage. Then head for the door.",

The dynamic 12-minute ditch-digging finale, in which water is brought to the farm's ailing crops, draws on Soviet cinema and is classic textbook stuff. The film was deliberately held up by United Artists lest it influence the 1934 election in which Socialist author Upton Sinclair was running for governor.

This is the kind of French boulevard farce that rarely reaches Britain nowadays. No doubt like Weber's My Father the Hero and Three Fugitives it'll be remade in Hollywood. Place Vendome (1998, 15, Artificial Eye, VHS Retail/Rental) Catherine Deneuve gives one of her best performances as the alcoholic widow of a king-pin of the exclusive French jewellery world reacting to his mysterious suicide and her possession of a cache of dodgy diamonds. Nicole Garcia's thriller is as polished as the gems it centres on and as dark and labyrinthine as the conspiratorial international subculture she explores.",

The Democratic and Republican Parties each will hold precinct meetings at more than 2,100 locations across the state, including schools, libraries, fire stations, grain co-ops, even private living rooms. Here is a guide to the methods and meaning of a sometimes mysterious process: Q. What is a caucus? A: A party meeting at the precinct level at which citizens express their candidate preferences and pick delegates to their county conventions. It's the lowest level of party politics. Q: Who takes part? A: Anyone who is old enough to vote and a member of the party is eligible, but traditionally only a small number of Iowans shows up - about 10 per cent of the state's 1.8 million registered voters. Q: What happens at a caucus? A: Participants, led by a chairman or chairwoman, indicate their preferences for their party's presidential nomination, pick delegates to their county conventions and discuss party business, including their party platforms. About half the people leave, then those who are the real activists get down to brass tacks. Q: What happens next?

Q: How did all this get started? A: 'It was something of an accident of history,' says Drake University professor Hugh Winebrenner.

      "body": "<p>There seems hardly to have been a day without rain the past few weeks, and I have lost count of the times I have arrived home for dinner dithering with cold and soaked through to my shirt. Which would be fine if I was Colin Firth or Charlie Dimmock, but I am not. What I really want to hear as I hang my woolly hat to dry is the hiss and bubble of a steamed pudding rattling in its pot on the stove. Of course, there is no such thing, but once I am out of my sodden boots and the kettle's on, then in theory at least there could be. </p> <p>It takes about 20 minutes to get a steamed pudding ready for the stove. You beat the eggs and sugar 'til they are as light as a Mr Whippy cornet, fold in flour, a handful of dried fruits and a shake or two of spice, then scoop the batter into a pudding basin and tie it up like a Christmas present before putting it on to steam peacefully while you make the rest of your supper. It is lifted an hour or two later from its steaming bath, as comforting as an old sweater, and you realise there are a few things actually worth getting cold and wet for. </p> <p>As a nation, we may have grown out of making steamed puddings, but I am not sure we have really grown out of eating them. Order the treacle sponge in a restaurant and you will find an air raid of pudding spoons heading for your plate for 'just a little taste'. Need I add that they will all come from those who previously had smugly turned away the dessert menu. No chef worthy of his toque could fail to offer a hot pudding nowadays, no matter what the logistical nightmare of getting hot chocolate sponge going out in fine nick all through dinner. </p> <p>If, as I believe, hot nursery, suety puddings are a part of our national culinary identity, then why do we so rarely cook them at home? My guess is partly due to the fact that our central heating tends to come from radiators rather than food, and our desire for a meal high in stodge has generally lessened somewhat to take on the lighter cooking of the Mediterranean. And who honestly wants a fugged-up kitchen with rivulets running down the windows and pools of water on the windowsills? Yet I have rarely known a dome of pastry or sponge with a steady drizzle of treacle, marmalade or jam meet with many refusals. </p> <p>The Victorians were fond of fruit puddings made in a crock basin and cooked in steam, yet the sheer jollity and generosity of a figgy pudding or pippin-stuffed apple hat seems at odds with the gloomy don't-talk-at-the-table meals one imagines going on in the larger upstairs-downstairs households. Cookery books of that period are full of suet puddings, while recipes for jam roly-poly (better known to all schoolchildren as dead man's leg), the appetisingly named spotted dick, and Sussex pond pudding, with its filling of brown sugar, butter and a whole lemon, continue well into the latter years of the twentieth century. It is only in the past few years that such heartwarming food has suddenly fallen from grace. </p> <p>There is nothing difficult about making most steamed puds. The sponge is nothing more complicated than a cake batter, and its habit of absorbing the treacle or sauce that you so generously put in the bottom of the basin and mysteriously vanishes during cooking is soon rectified by an extra jugful on the table. Suet pastry is by far the easiest of all pastries to make, and contains relatively very little of the dreaded saturated fat anyway. It's only once a winter, after all. Problems arise with the cooking more often than in the making. You need to keep the water out - once it gets inside the necessary swaddling of greaseproof and muslin, you will end up with a soggy pudding. This is one occasion to go to a bit of trouble in the kitchen. I suggest you wrap the bowl in buttered, pleated greaseproof - the pleat will stop the paper tearing as your bonny pudding rises and shines - and secure it round the rim of the bowl with both a rubber band and some string. Then you need to do the same with foil, or better, I think, some cheap muslin. I say better because it is easier to lift the pudding from the scalding depths by its tuft of fabric. </p> <p>Too much is made of turning out the finished pudding. Despite the fact that I have proudly upturned two apple and marmalade hats and an apricot and lemon sponge this week, I still think they can be served from the basin without shame. It is just culinary exhibitionism, really, but anyone who cites a stuck pudding as a reason not to make them should take note that it is a rather weak excuse not to have another go. </p> <p>You will need a jug of something to accompany even the most heavily treacled mound. I do think custard is over-egging the pudding, so to speak, and I would always take the cream route. It seems more pleasing with the moist sponge or sticky, suety filling. None of that tiresomely fashionable cr\u00e8me frache, either. Such a British pudding deserves nothing less than a jug of double cream. 'What? Suet, eggs, sugar and double cream. Is he trying to kill us?' I can hear you cry. Not at all, I am simply trying to show you a good time. </p> <p><strong> Steamed apricot and lemon pudding</strong> </p> <p> If you can't get hold of the squashy, ready-to-eat dried apricots, then soak the firmer variety in water for an hour or so before draining and chopping them. Serves 8 </p> <p>4 heaped tbsps lemon curd </p> <p>150g butter </p> <p>120g unrefined golden caster sugar </p> <p>150g ready-to-eat dried apricots </p> <p>2 large free-range eggs </p> <p>170g self-raising flour </p> <p>the grated zest and juice of a lemon </p> <p>You will also need a buttered 1-litre pudding basin, some greaseproof paper, tin foil or muslin and some string. </p> <p>Lightly butter the pudding basin, then spoon the lemon curd into the bottom. Put the butter and sugar into the bowl of a food mixer and beat until white and fluffy. Meanwhile, chop the apricots finely. The simplest way to do this is to cut them into thick slices then blitz them in a food processor until they look like chopped candied peel. Add the eggs to the butter and sugar - it will curdle a bit, but it doesn't matter - then slowly fold in the flour. Slowly mix in the apricots, then the lemon zest and juice. </p> <p>Bring a pan of water to the boil, enough to come a third of the way up the basin. You may have to adjust this when the full basin goes in, and top it up as the pudding cooks. Scoop the mixture into the buttered basin. </p> <p>Cut a piece of greaseproof paper to fit the top of the basin, so that some hangs over the edges, and butter one side of it. Fold a pleat into the paper so that it will not tear when the sponge expands. Lay the folded paper over the top of the pudding, then cover that with tin foil or muslin, and tie it securely. I use string and a rubber band. </p> <p>Put the pudding into the water. Cover with a lid and steam for an hour and a half. You can turn the pudding out, though it tastes just as good spooned from the basin. </p> <p> <strong> Apple and marmalade suet pudding</strong> </p> <p> This might appeal to those who find steamed puddings too cloying. The apples are tender but keep their shape; the marmalade and the juice of the apples bubbles down to a sweet-sharp sauce. I do think it needs a jug of pouring cream, though. And you might like to add a few cloves or a pinch of mixed spice to the apples. Serves 6 </p> <p>200g self-raising flour </p> <p>100g grated suet </p> <p>a little water </p> <p>800g dessert apples </p> <p>the juice of half a lemon </p> <p>8 tbsps marmalade </p> <p>You will also need a buttered 1-litre pudding basin, some greaseproof paper, tin foil or muslin and some string. </p> <p>Peel the apples, core them and cut them into thick wedges. Toss them with the lemon juice. </p> <p>Put the flour into a mixing bowl, add a pinch of salt and the suet, then pour in enough water to make a stiff dough. This is usually about 6 tablespoons of water, but the amount will vary somewhat according to the flour. Your dough should be soft enough to roll out easily. </p> <p>Shape the pastry into a short, thick sausage. Cut thin slices from the dough and press them into the bottom and sides of the buttered pudding basin so that the entire area is covered, leaving enough dough to roll out for a lid. </p> <p>Spoon the marmalade into the apples, mix together, then pile into the lined basin, scraping all the marmalade in, too. Roll or pat out the remaining dough to fit the top of the basin. Wet the edge of the pastry - you can use water, but a bit of marmalade is even more effective - and press the edges together so that the apples are sealed in pastry. </p> <p>Cut a piece of greaseproof paper to fit the top of the basin, so that some hangs over the edges, and butter one side of it. Fold a pleat into the paper so that it will not tear when the dough expands. Lay the folded paper over the top of the pudding, then cover that with tin foil or muslin, and tie it securely. I use string and a rubber band. </p> <p>Bring a pan of water to the boil and put the pudding into it so that the water comes about a third of the way up the basin. You may have to top it up as the pudding cooks. Cover tightly with a lid and leave to steam for a good two hours until well risen. You can turn out the pudding, though it tastes just as good spooned from the basin.</p>",

Snowdrops, hellebores and aconites go some way towards appeasing that hunger, but however lovely they are - and the combination of snowdrops and hellebores is one that I look forward to as eagerly as I do any flowers of high summer - they are not enough. They are like the jewels stitched on to an Elizabethan gown, but until the spring florification the dress remains hidden. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there are other rich colours to be had at this time of year, even though it will not involve a single flower. A number of barks shine with jewel-like brilliance in the depth of winter, especially now, in the month or two between the sap beginning to rise and the first leaf buds emerging. They would be diminished by the brightness of spring, let alone the glare of summer, but are the brightest thing in the landscape on a grey, even wet, January day. Cometh the hour, cometh the plant. </p> <p>A number of trees, such as acers and birches, have decorative skin-like barks, but I am thinking now about shrubs or trees that can be pruned to behave like a shrub and which will produce their firework show of bark in a year or two. The best-known and perhaps, for all its ubiquity, the best, is the dogwood Cornus alba, which has brilliant stems in shades of crimson. It is the new growth that shines the most, and if you coppice them back hard to a stool a few inches from the ground, the smooth, whippy stems grow up thicket-thick like a haze of intense coral. They look fantastic en masse, and if you have got the room to grow them in a large group (although this can make your garden look like a corporate parking area), the trick is to cut half of them back entirely every other March. A less drastic measure is to cut half of each shrub back each year. </p> <p>All the varieties of C alba grow in almost all conditions (hence their invariable use in municipal and corporate planting), but they thrive in rich, slightly damp soil in full sun. C alba 'Sibirica' (sometimes called 'westonbirt') is the most common, principally, I suspect, because it does not get too big and therefore is better suited to small gardens, but there are a number of C alba varieties, all red shoots except C alba 'Kesselringii', which has melodramatic purple-black stems. If you have more space, C amomum is a more vigorous shrub and has purple shoots (and blue berries). Both are striking, if not cheery. The common dogwood, C sanguinea, has rich stems and wonderful, deep-purple autumn leaves (there are miles of dogwood hedges along lanes around here), and the cultivated variety 'Winter Beauty' or 'Winter Flame' has all its robustness with orangey stems. C stolonifera 'Flaviramea' has shoots that are yellow ochre at the tips, maturing to a rich olive green at their base. In my own garden, it seems to produce much denser growth than C alba and shimmers rather than glows. These niceties matter on a bleak January afternoon. Shimmer or glow, these dogwoods all mix well together, especially if they are all grown in moist soil with air and light around them. </p> <p>There are some willows that have fabulously bright skins on their branches that can also be cut back hard every year to encourage more vigorous, vivid growth. I cannot overstress the point that shrubs grown for their bark should be cut back very hard - the harder you cut them back, the more vigorous the resulting growth, and the more dynamic the growth, the more intense the colour between December and March. With dogwoods, they have to be cut ruthlessly to the ground, but willows can be pollarded, which means retaining a single stem or trunk and making your pruning cuts at any height off it, reducing it for a few weeks to little more than a knob-topped walking stick. But it will soon resprout, and as the years go by, this point will become gnarled and knotty and the trunk will gradually get bigger, while its haircut shoots and contracts annually. </p> <p>While the dogwoods will grow anywhere, willows have a preference for damp soil, though they will struggle on in chalk or sand. But give any willow some nice, soggy ground to get its roots into, and it will feel thoroughly at home. One of my pet hates is the 'Kilmarnock' willow, which achieved quite unwarranted popularity a few years ago and now sits looking like a tassellated standard lamp in a million gardens. It can look OK-ish, if clipped into a lollipop - a ball sitting on its trunk - but if your soil is at all rich, it would be far better to grow one of the coloured-stemmed willows. There is a good choice. The golden willow, Salix alba 'Vitellina', with yellow stems veering towards a yolky orange, or S x rubens , the scarlet willow, S alba 'Britzensis', which is more vermilion than scarlet. S daphnoides has purple stems coated in cottony bloom. S irrorata is also supposed to have a spectacularly luminous white coating over purple stems. I have never grown this, but I must get one. </p> <p>Although willows and dogwoods look best in groups, there is hardly any need to buy them in bulk (unless you are impatient) because they all take very easily as hardwood cuttings, especially the willows. When I cut them back in early March, I always stick a group of 20cm-long stems in a row in a corner of the seed bed, perhaps adding some sharpsand to the narrow trench first. They can be planted out the following autumn. </p> <p>A few of the ornamental brambles have stems that are covered in a white bloom over winter, which makes them starkly ornate. There is Rubus biflorus, which has green shoots beneath the white waxy covering, R thibetanus, which has underlying brownish purple stems and ferny leaves. R thibetanus 'Silver fern' is particularly ferny and the bloom apparently almost blue. I have never grown it, but am tempted by this description. The problem with these ornate brambles is one of space. I do grow the R cockburnianus 'Goldenvale', primarily for its lime-green foliage in spring and summer, but it also has wonderful winter stems, a pinky red dusted with a white bloom. This also takes terribly easily from cuttings, and I have found that it quickly becomes invasive if you don't keep it cut back, as it roots wherever the arching stems touch the soil. Prune it like another bramble, the autumn fruiting raspberry, and cut the whole thing to the ground each spring, which will stymie any incipient suckers and encourage new growth. The true Cockburnianus seems to have a whiter bloom than 'Goldenvale', and is probably a better bet for winter display. </p> <p><strong> Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong><br> Observer readers can buy a Cornus alba 'Sibirica' for \u00a317.99, including UK p&amp;p.

The voices of the most shameless perception-managers would surely falter when they were asked how 'moderate' New Labour had contrived policies on the powers of juries to deliver true verdicts that were more extreme than their supposedly mad opponents. Their discomfort and mendacity would have kept me in work for months. </p> <p>If what follows is written with a certain bitterness, it is because the Conservatives are determined to deprive me of my simple pleasure and possibly my living by forcing the admission that Tony Blair is telling the truth about them - a dirty job which I never thought I'd have to be the someone to do. </p> <p>In the Commons last week, William Hague and Liam Fox, his health spokesman, were filled with outraged innocence after Blair condemned them as lurchers who were planning to privatise the NHS. Labour was presenting an 'offensive caricature', they said, presumably without knowing that a tape of Fox addressing a delighted audience of private-health insurers and wide-eyed free marketeers from the Adam Smith Institute at last year's Conservative Party conference was doing the rounds. It has him describing how he will gut the health service and revive the foul climate which allowed the City to perpetrate its most systematic fraud of the last century. </p> <p>That he can think this way suggests that the Conservatives have either reached a stage of dangerous pottiness of their own accord or that they have mis taken the isolated and self-congratulatory mood of reactionary London for the spirit of the country itself. If your social life consists of meeting the type of person who is invited to Spectator lunches, it is easy to believe that 'everyone' agrees that Neil Hamilton is innocent and Michael Portillo could be Prime Minister and Trollope is a far greater novelist than Dickens and, as all the rightist papers said last week, that the NHS must be privatised in whole or part. You are as likely to be as surprised when fierce attachment to the service destroys politicians who threaten it, as you were by the Labour landslide or the mass wailing for the martyred Saint Di. </p> <p>The insurers were so eager to hear Fox they turned up at an 8am breakfast rally entitled 'NHS plc: Are Markets Good for Your Health?' Fox began with a mild criticism of their industry. His complaint was not that private operators provided an incredibly inefficient and costly alternative to the health service, or that they allowed the wealthy to queue jump, or that they were parasites exploiting the skills of state-trained doctors and nurses, but that their products were 'all far too expensive, too inflexible and not styled towards individual patients' - who we will doubtless have to learn to call customers if we're ever unlucky enough to find him in office. </p> <p>He had come to help them restyle themselves and make their fortunes. The Conservatives would revive their businesses with the help of an apparently innocuous promise to the electorate. Their 'Patients' Guarantee' would make admitting those needing life-saving surgery the highest priority for the NHS under a Conservative government. Few people objected to the guarantee when it was proposed - but, as Fox said, 'no one has picked up yet what it actually means' - people 'haven't thought through the implications of what we're doing'. </p> <p>If 'you are seeing the sickest people first it inevitably means that those with the in-growing toe nail or the cyst will have to wait,' he explained. 'They will have to find other ways of getting the treatment required, perhaps by having private medical insurance.' The reduction of the NHS from a universal service to a rump dealing only with grave illnesses would suit the insurers who have no desire to meet the open-ended costs of, say, caring for a man with Aids and would much rather organise neat, quick operations. By ignoring expensive nuisances, 'the private sector could offer new health care products for the lowest priority illnesses'. If you needed a new hip, in other words, you would have to go private if you had the money or wait for months or years in pain if you would not or could not pay. </p> <p>Among his friends, Fox could afford to be explicit about the trickery behind the Patients' Guarantee. 'What we are starting is perhaps a Trojan horse' in the health service, he said. </p> <p>The poor would be hit twice when his footsoldiers overran the unsuspecting citadel. Not only would they be unable to afford to play the system, but their taxes would subsidise the tax breaks for the private insurance taken out by wealthier people. That the Conservatives can consider taking from the poor to give to the rich shows they remain the party of the poll tax. I hear that Fox is now toying with the alternative of forcing everyone to buy insurance and that some of his colleagues are starting to worry about the electoral consequences of his adoration of the private sector. In Blackpool, he happily admitted his desire to relieve a fraudulent industry when he cried 'what we're proposing could revolutionise private insurance in the way we revolutionised pensions in the 1980s'. </p> <p>His party's pension revolution was the swindle that euphemistic business journalists call 'the pensions mis-selling affair', as if insurance companies earned plump commissions by fooling millions in to abandoning perfectly good occupational pensions and paying through the nose for paltry private alternatives as accidentally as a confused shop assistant short changing a customer. </p> <p>The financial pages are still stuffed with reports of the fines imposed on insurers and the costs of compensating their victims - now \u00a312 billion and rising. Which, then, of the following options is madder? That Fox expects to be taken seriously when he appears to know nothing about the disgrace of the insurance industry? Or that he knows all too well and will nevertheless unleash the same spivs on the NHS? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/nhs/Story/0,2763,125964,00.html\">Highlights of Liam Fox's speech</a> (Real audio)</p> <p>When Jack Straw's name comes up and you snort that a child could mould a better man out of Plasticine, Third Way colleagues protest. 'Granted he's an authoritarian who pretends to be fighting for the common people against the Hampstead \u00e9lite while removing the rights of the same people to dispense justice on juries, but he's not all bad. Think of Pinochet!' they shout (or, rather, shouted). 'Think of his stand on racism!' </p> <p>To be fair, they once had a point. Straw himself cites his decision to hold an inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence as the sole difference between his policies and Michael Howard's. Unlike many Conservatives, New Labour does not have a racist language and the Home Office is anxious assure us that its plans to throw citizens out of jury rooms will not lead to black defendants being punished by prejudiced magistrates. Straw has been quoting research to any one who will listen that 'proves' that magistrates are if anything more likely to acquit ethnic minority defendants than white suspects. </p> <p>Yet the nice manners and discourse of Blairism conceal much. Every now and again the mask slips and the real fears of the \u00e9lite are shown in all their foolishness. It is hard to imagine a more characteristic member of the new establishment than David Lipsey. He was a journalist - political editor of the Economist in the early Nineties - who demonstrated his worth to the Government and was rewarded with seats on inquires into the future of the health service and elevation to the peerage. In last week's debate in the House of Lords he gave a frank assessment of why juries' right to determine innocence or guilt in relatively serious cases should be quashed. </p> <p>'I should like to make a point about the black community,' he said. 'At least some of them may opt for trial by jury in the hope that they will get an \"O.J. Simpson.\" They hope there will be enough black jurors who are fundamentally hostile to the criminal justice system.' </p> <p>This careless destruction of Straw's pretence that he is supporting the many against the few is hard to better. Repressive governments hate juries because they give ordinary people power. And what happens? Those dark, lumpen faces we glimpse from our people carriers stick together and make a mockery of our wigs and institutions. </p> <p>Nor were his comments an aberration. The marvellous Helena Kennedy, who should have her statue outside the Old Bailey for leading the defence of jurors, explained that the Home Office research wasn't as definitive as it seemed. Other studies Straw forgets to mention showed pretty conclusively that the Irish faced discrimination at the hands of magistrates. Take the Irish out of the 'whites' and you discover what most people know in their guts is true: blacks and Asians are far more likely to be convicted by magistrates.</p>",

It is hard to imagine a more characteristic member of the new establishment than David Lipsey. He was a journalist - political editor of the Economist in the early Nineties - who demonstrated his worth to the Government and was rewarded with seats on inquires into the future of the health service and elevation to the peerage. In last week's debate in the House of Lords he gave a frank assessment of why juries' right to determine innocence or guilt in relatively serious cases should be quashed. 'I should like to make a point about the black community,' he said. 'At least some of them may opt for trial by jury in the hope that they will get an \"O.J. Simpson.\" They hope there will be enough black jurors who are fundamentally hostile to the criminal justice system.' This careless destruction of Straw's pretence that he is supporting the many against the few is hard to better. Repressive governments hate juries because they give ordinary people power. And what happens? Those dark, lumpen faces we glimpse from our people carriers stick together and make a mockery of our wigs and institutions. Nor were his comments an aberration. The marvellous Helena Kennedy, who should have her statue outside the Old Bailey for leading the defence of jurors, explained that the Home Office research wasn't as definitive as it seemed. Other studies Straw forgets to mention showed pretty conclusively that the Irish faced discrimination at the hands of magistrates. Take the Irish out of the 'whites' and you discover what most people know in their guts is true: blacks and Asians are far more likely to be convicted by magistrates.",

      "body": "<p>The president of the European Central Bank is a passionate believer in the integrity of individual European cultures and the need for every country to choose its own social model. He is also an economic liberal: this combination would in Britain make him a paid-up Euro-sceptic, or at the very least a triumphant member of David Owen's New Europe group. </p> <p>But Wim Duisenberg, the chain-smoking Dutch liberal socialist, has come to the opposite conclusion: the route to individual liberty, and to cultural and political diversity in Europe is the stability of the European single currency. </p> <p>Duisenberg could hardly say anything else, of course, but British Eurosceptics and the ECB President cannot both be right. After the first year of the euro's trading, the sceptics would say they have had the better of the argument. The euro has depreciated by nearly 15 per cent and has threatened to breach the one dollar level; monetary policy is set too tight for sluggish Germany and Italy, yet too loose for booming Portugal and Ireland; and the President of the European Commission has warned Italy that its successful membership of the euro cannot be sustained if its inflation rate does not fall quickly to the European average. The currency is creaking at the seams. </p> <p>But from the 35th floor of the Euro Tower in Frankfurt's financial district, the prospect is rather different. Duisenberg bridles at the criticism that the euro is already a depreciating currency. 'I always find it a bit unfair to say that the euro has fallen by 12 to 14 per cent. What you do then is compare the current rate of the euro with the exchange rate that emerged on one day - 4 January last year. It is more relevant to compare the rate over the last three months with the very stable rate of between 1.08 and 1.10 [against the dollar] that existed prior to the birth of the euro in 1997 and 1998. Depreciation vis-\u00e0-vis that rate - that is relevant, and there is no denying it.' </p> <p>It is not all black. He cites German exports as one notable beneficiary, but is quick to point out that in France and the Netherlands the recovery has been led by domestic demand rather than by exports. As for the currency creaking at the seams, he is scornful. 'We have delivered what we promised; that is, more or less price stability. Europe would not have had such a low average interest rate level without the euro.' </p> <p>He thinks the euro has given a new dynamism to Europe. Along with the single market, it has dramatically opened things up: 'Enhancing the liberalisation of and openness of the European economy _ The euro has contributed to the fast European economic recovery, which was in a sluggish condition, almost a slump, at the end of 1998 and beginning of 1999, so that there is now much healthier growth than was anticipated almost a year ago.' </p> <p>He is sharply critical of the German and French nationwide collective wage bargaining systems: 'Over the 15 years from 1982 to 1997, wage costs per unit of output in both countries have grown on average by 2.4 per cent, consistently exceeding productivity growth over such a long period and undermining the competitiveness worldwide of German and French exports.' </p> <p>He wants both countries to copy the Dutch and break the system down so that wage increases can reflect local differences. He is watching uneasily the biggest German engineering union - IG Metall - pitching for 5.5 per cent this month, as that will become the benchmark for wage settlements across Germany. </p> <p>As for the US, he says: 'What we're seeing is remarkable growth and productivity. I am not sure how much it can be explained by the permeation of information technology. Is the economy on a path of permanently higher productivity growth? Will it fall back to its old path? It is too early too judge.' </p> <p>On the other hand: 'One thing I am convinced of is that the current wave of extra productivity growth which has started in the US will spill over into the rest of the world, and in particular to Europe. Things here always happen later than in the US. Maybe we are seeing US developments in some pockets of Europe - for instance in countries such as France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Denmark.' </p> <p>I suggest that all six coun tries have simply benefited from low interest rates both in the run-up to euro membership and now; and that the removal of the exchange rate risk in their interest rate structure has been very stimulative. He is dismissive: 'You must be more of a monetarist than I am,' he laughs. </p> <p>Interest rates can impact on growth only via investment, and the responsiveness of investment to interest rates is very low, he argues. What he does note is that the European money supply has grown at an annual rate of 6 per cent for months, but even that growth has been partly generated by the euro itself; business has been using euros to finance a wave of mergers and acquisitions. It's a very delicate judgment, deciding on Europe-wide eco nomic conditions: 'There is no slack in Portugal, in the Netherlands, in Belgium or in Ireland; they are close to overheating. Elsewhere, the opposite is the case, in particular in Germany and Italy. We look at the European economy as a whole. It makes our work somewhat more difficult, and we are still in the learning process.' </p> <p>The ECB has set itself the demanding objective of securing a Europe-wide inflation rate of somewhere below 2 per cent. The British government, by contrast, has pitched the target at 2.5 per cent as the centre of a range that can move 1.5 per cent either side of the target, and requires the Bank of England to explain if inflation exceeds those parameters - so that too little inflation is as 'problematic' as too much. The British criticism of the ECB is that it does not do the same because it is obsessed with price stability, building in a deflationary bias to its policy-making. </p> <p>Duisenberg rebuts the charge. 'If our analysts were to indicate that we might be in for a period of negative inflation or deflation, I would be as concerned as I would be if it was the other way round - that we would be heading for a period where inflation were to exceed the 2 per cent limit we have set for ourselves. The only reason we have not announced a range with zero at the bottom is that we are not sure yet how much the measurement bias in European inflation figures may overstate the actual inflation rate.' </p> <p>And what about British entry to the euro? He hopes that Britain will join, and recognises that Britain has a different financial structure in which short-term interest rates, particularly in the housing market, play a larger role than in Europe and could pose problems. But Ireland, with a similar system, has joined without lower interest rates igniting inflation. 'Inflation in Ireland is around 2 per cent, despite fears of overheating. That may be an indication that behavioural relations of consumers, of investors, of government may have changed through the structural shock that has taken place by participating in the single currency area.' </p> <p>He does not think that Britain, if it joined, would necessarily have to tighten fiscal policy to offset lower interest rates in the euro area, or take special technical measures to check the growth in credit. What has happened in Ireland - and in the Netherlands - could happen in Britain. </p> <p>But with the pound trading at close to DM3.20, entry at current exchange rates would lock in a punitive degree of uncompetitiveness. Duisenberg is uncompromising. The ECB would not connive at any pre-entry devaluation of the pound to ease British entry. </p> <p>'It would have to comply with all the convergence criteria that have been applied to all the founding father countries of the euro area. Britain would have to demonstrate that it had an inflation rate and interest rates over the years that were not more than a certain percentage different from the euro area. And the pound would demonstrably have had to have been stable vis \u00e0 vis the euro; it would not have depreciated in the two years ahead of entry.' </p> <p>That implies a very demanding exchange rate, I comment, the price you pay for joining late. 'It's the price you pay for staying out,' counters Duisenberg. </p> <p>And what about the lack of accountability of the ECB, the criticism levelled at it in Britain? There is no Europe-wide political institution strong enough to hold it to account. </p> <p>He disagrees: 'The discussion on accountability seems to have more to do with emotion than rationality. It is accountability to the public at large, and that comes through various channels: the European parliament, the Council of Ministers, to the public directly through interviews like this and speeches. </p> <p>Monetary policy is a matter of confidence. You don't get confidence for nothing; you have to work and earn it. It's a great effort for us at the Central Bank to explain what we are doing and why we are doing it. I believe we are more open, more transparent than any central bank in the world.' </p> <p>Why such a passionate response? 'Equal justice for all is not just a slogan; it must have content. I want people to be free to choose what they want to preserve or the way they want to develop themselves. That can mean different social models around Europe. But I believe in the free movement of people across borders.' </p> <p>Hence his commitment to the euro. Frankfurt is less than an hour-and-a-half's flight from London, from British Euro-sceptics and their demons. It may as well be on a different planet.</p>",

Later, he realised that everybody was in love with her and through their 43-year marriage, his feelings for his beloved wife never dwindled, even when Iris's brilliant mind had been reduced to the confused state of an Alzheimer's sufferer. </p> <p>The first of this two-part collection, Iris: A Memoir deals with Bayley's memories of their early days together and then the realisation that her mind is being paralysed and disintegrated by this terrible and mysterious affliction. </p> <p>The second part, Iris and Friends, focuses more on the latter stages of her illness. This is not melancholy, though it is very moving. Bayley finds solace in the memories of his own childhood, his 'friends' as he calls them. He finds nothing but 'compensations' in her illness, 'lucid moments, cuddles, humour' and enjoys the hours when she sleeps so he can 'plunge back into the cool river of memory'. </p> <p>Although frequent thoughts of double suicide enter his mind, he abandons them, understanding that suicide is only a good idea 'at the time, for the time' and that it is not a friend to him or Iris. </p> <p>It is a mark of Derek Jacobi's brilliance that the listener forgets that he is the reader. With humility, Jacobi relinquishes his own persona to take on that of Bayley. It is crucial to the authenticity of the reading and few could accomplish such a difficult task.</p>",

Later, he realised that everybody was in love with her and through their 43-year marriage, his feelings for his beloved wife never dwindled, even when Iris's brilliant mind had been reduced to the confused state of an Alzheimer's sufferer. The first of this two-part collection, Iris: A Memoir deals with Bayley's memories of their early days together and then the realisation that her mind is being paralysed and disintegrated by this terrible and mysterious affliction. The second part, Iris and Friends, focuses more on the latter stages of her illness. This is not melancholy, though it is very moving. Bayley finds solace in the memories of his own childhood, his 'friends' as he calls them. He finds nothing but 'compensations' in her illness, 'lucid moments, cuddles, humour' and enjoys the hours when she sleeps so he can 'plunge back into the cool river of memory'. Although frequent thoughts of double suicide enter his mind, he abandons them, understanding that suicide is only a good idea 'at the time, for the time' and that it is not a friend to him or Iris. It is a mark of Derek Jacobi's brilliance that the listener forgets that he is the reader. With humility, Jacobi relinquishes his own persona to take on that of Bayley. It is crucial to the authenticity of the reading and few could accomplish such a difficult task.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Terence Rattigan</strong> <br>Michael Darlow <br>Quartet \u00a325, pp530 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502365841,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Michael Darlow's book, which is a revision of an earlier one (co-written with Gillian Hodson and published in 1979), aims to reveal Rattigan as a more subversive figure than he could seem when he was uncrowned king of the West End theatre. Rattigan was brusquely dethroned in the Fifties with the arrival of the movement known as the 'kitchen sink', which had no patience with craftsmanship and the implicit. </p> <p>The problem didn't lie in Rattigan's unfamiliarity with the sink - not to mention the kitchen - but elsewhere, in a bedroom where no women were entertained. Authenticity was suddenly the touchstone of drama, while the laws against his sort of private life (and the censorial office of the Lord Chamberlain) remained firmly in place. </p> <p>Now that gay men's lives can be examined, and even to some extent taken for granted, a book like this one needs some sophistication - a sense that attitudes have a history. It's not enough to say, of schools like the one which Rattigan (born 1911) attended, Harrow, that they were 'breeding grounds of the worst kind of male chauvinism'. Of course they were. It's just that male chauvinists were called sons of Empire then. </p> <p>It was a rare homosexual of Rattigan's vintage who didn't agonise over the reasons for his dismal orientation, and to look for them in his parents. Darlow seems to have made no progress beyond such Freudian pieties, announcing ominously that Terence 'grew up to side with his mother against his father'. </p> <p>Quite right too. Frank Rattigan led Vera a merry dance with his affaires (Darlow's preferred spelling throughout), and his undignified exit from the diplomatic service badly dented a prosperity that had seemed secure. Still, Frank opposed Terence's desire to be a playwright only until his promise was recognised, and then provided modest backing.</p> <p>When Rattigan was a success, his father enjoyed the philandering opportunities which the theatrical world offered in profusion. When Frank by mistake opened a letter from a hotel manager in Paris complaining about Terence's conduct with another man, his shocked diatribe was undercut by a confession of his own. Frank had given Terence's gramophone to a lady friend, and would he please not tell Mum? </p> <p>Nor was Vera Rattigan a smothering mother out of the text books. When Terence was undecided as to which of two plays he should submit to a theatre manager, her advice was brisk rather than indulgent: better give him a good farce than a bad drama. </p> <p>Darlow quotes Rattigan's contemporary Cecil Beaton on the shame he felt about his desires, and perhaps it's reasonable to assume a similar response in another young man. But Darlow concedes that it is 'quite probable' that Terence had an affair, while a schoolboy, with the racing correspondent of the Daily Express, a family friend who also gave him tips on the gee-gees, which hardly suggests inhibition. </p> <p>Rattigan started off as a stern critic of No\u00ebl Coward, though when fashions changed in the Fifties they formed a defensive alliance of dinosaurs - dinosaurs in dressing gowns. But Rattigan's attitude to love doesn't seem so far from the older man's. Coward regarded passion as something to be dreaded and endured, rather than wished for, a sort of flu of the heart.

      "bodyText": "Terence Rattigan Michael Darlow Quartet \u00a325, pp530 Buy it at BOL Michael Darlow's book, which is a revision of an earlier one (co-written with Gillian Hodson and published in 1979), aims to reveal Rattigan as a more subversive figure than he could seem when he was uncrowned king of the West End theatre. Rattigan was brusquely dethroned in the Fifties with the arrival of the movement known as the 'kitchen sink', which had no patience with craftsmanship and the implicit. The problem didn't lie in Rattigan's unfamiliarity with the sink - not to mention the kitchen - but elsewhere, in a bedroom where no women were entertained. Authenticity was suddenly the touchstone of drama, while the laws against his sort of private life (and the censorial office of the Lord Chamberlain) remained firmly in place. Now that gay men's lives can be examined, and even to some extent taken for granted, a book like this one needs some sophistication - a sense that attitudes have a history. It's not enough to say, of schools like the one which Rattigan (born 1911) attended, Harrow, that they were 'breeding grounds of the worst kind of male chauvinism'. Of course they were. It's just that male chauvinists were called sons of Empire then. It was a rare homosexual of Rattigan's vintage who didn't agonise over the reasons for his dismal orientation, and to look for them in his parents. Darlow seems to have made no progress beyond such Freudian pieties, announcing ominously that Terence 'grew up to side with his mother against his father'. Quite right too. Frank Rattigan led Vera a merry dance with his affaires (Darlow's preferred spelling throughout), and his undignified exit from the diplomatic service badly dented a prosperity that had seemed secure. Still, Frank opposed Terence's desire to be a playwright only until his promise was recognised, and then provided modest backing. When Rattigan was a success, his father enjoyed the philandering opportunities which the theatrical world offered in profusion. When Frank by mistake opened a letter from a hotel manager in Paris complaining about Terence's conduct with another man, his shocked diatribe was undercut by a confession of his own. Frank had given Terence's gramophone to a lady friend, and would he please not tell Mum? Nor was Vera Rattigan a smothering mother out of the text books. When Terence was undecided as to which of two plays he should submit to a theatre manager, her advice was brisk rather than indulgent: better give him a good farce than a bad drama. Darlow quotes Rattigan's contemporary Cecil Beaton on the shame he felt about his desires, and perhaps it's reasonable to assume a similar response in another young man. But Darlow concedes that it is 'quite probable' that Terence had an affair, while a schoolboy, with the racing correspondent of the Daily Express, a family friend who also gave him tips on the gee-gees, which hardly suggests inhibition. Rattigan started off as a stern critic of No\u00ebl Coward, though when fashions changed in the Fifties they formed a defensive alliance of dinosaurs - dinosaurs in dressing gowns. But Rattigan's attitude to love doesn't seem so far from the older man's. Coward regarded passion as something to be dreaded and endured, rather than wished for, a sort of flu of the heart. Rattigan's first success, French Without Tears, featured a character who has learned to separate sex from love and thereby spared himself the routine torments. Rattigan, too, seems to have kept his lovers at arm's length, indulging their tantrums but resisting their claims. A partial exception was Kenneth Morgan, who lived with Rattigan in the late Forties, then left him for another man and shortly afterwards killed himself. Rattigan's 1952 play The Deep Blue Sea, which in its first draft treated a homosexual 'affaire', opens with a suicide attempt using the same means (gas fire). The case for Rattigan as a confessional playwright, dutifully made by Darlow, pretty much begins and ends here, with the notion that Morgan's suicide was a fertile trauma. It doesn't really add up.

Most surprising is that he has chosen to consider the ways in which a person's occupation often defines his or her sense of identity through a variety of manual, non-cerebral professions - some skilled, some mundane, some highly unusual - but all a refreshing change from the postmodern vogue for novels about writers or academics writing novels about writers.</p> <p>The stories are all first-person narratives and, taken together, feel uncannily like a series of Talking Heads monologues; it's tempting to read them aloud in the appropriate accent. As readers of his novels will know, Thorpe has an acute ear for the cadences of speech; here he creates his narrators vividly through linguistic tics and repeated phrases - though there is a sense that his delight in his characters' idiosyncratic voices at times overrides the content of the narrative. </p> <p>This is not to say that he hasn't done his research extremely thoroughly. The narrators range across decades and continents, including, among others, a dustman nearing retirement, a German blacksmith's wife, the foreman of a timber-mill in pre-Independence Congo, a young Pakistani factory worker and an Australian stone-mason in Mediterranean France. The details of the various professions involved are equally meticulous, and it's encouraging to note that in his acknowledgements, Thorpe thanks a Monsieur Fuster 'for showing me how a mattock is made'. </p> <p>Some of these narratives are really impressive. The title story, a Ghanaian refugee's account of coming to Britain in the Sixties with the hope of studying, is both heart-breaking and optimistic in its depiction of ignorance and casual racism, in the face of which the innocent narrator is forced to modify his hopes and his integrity - though, crucially, without abandoning either: </p> <p>'I was proud of my room even with the smell, the lack of proper daylight and the fizzing sockets. I wandered about the area and noticed other squats like ours, cheek-by-jowl with cleaned-up houses bearing brass plaques in which tapping typewriters could sometimes be heard. The little caffs, full of steam and smoke, enabled me to read a book all morning for a few pennies of warmth.' </p> <p>'Bins', the opening story, boasts a splendid narrator who is pure Alan Bennett: 'And that gravel was murder to trot over, with a 10-ton bin on your back. Like a bloody donkey on the beach at Cromer, you felt like sometimes. Now my youngsters moan about Lord So-and-So not depositing his wheelie out at the end of his drive, or at the tradesman's entrance, or wherever happens to be the most convenient for them. \"Do you really expect Lord So-and-So to lug out his wheelie along 300 yards of deep gravel for your bloody convenience?\" I snap back. \"Work!\" '. </p> <p>That the collection is uneven is a result of Thorpe's ambitious breadth of subjects. The most successful stories are those with English narrators because the author is writing in English, which may seem an obvious point, but in a book where authentic narrative voice is the driving force, it is an important one. Creating a French or German narrator with a convincingly idiomatic voice in English (where the reader is supposed to take it as read that they are telling their tale in their native tongue) requires a leap of imagination that is tricky when the story follows one with an English narrator. The real difficulty with Shifts is that, although most of the stories work individually, as a collection there is not enough change of register between them.</p>",

Brief Interviews with Hideous Men is, well, briefer, being a collection of, short stories or, more accurately, as Wallace himself puts it, 'not vignettes or scenarios or allegories or fables, exactly, though neither are they really qualifiable as short stories (not even as those upscale microbrewed Flash Fictions that have become so popular in recent years - even though these belletristic pieces are really short, they just don't work like Flash Fictions are supposed to).' That is the problem, or maybe the delight, of this book; there is almost nothing to say about it that isn't already said, or acknowledged, within the work itself. </p> <p>And yet, that might suggest it is part of (Wallace again) 'the tired old \"Hey-look-at-me-looking-at-you-looking-at-me\" agenda of tired old S.O.P. metafiction'. Which it isn't. Wallace can work within the apparent form of such games, and even write about such games or (by extension, inevitably), write about writing about such games. Yet he also writes fictions - plausible, or detailed, or insanely detailed, or sad or disturbing fictions - that seem, eerily, to centre on the same concerns about communication that those metafictional, postmodern, wearily ironic games do; which is to say these short fictions are, in short, about how we can't or don't talk to each other. And though they are very very funny, they are also deadly serious. </p> <p>The first piece, on page zero, establishes the ground of the collection (as that pagination suggests). Entitled 'A Radically Condensed History of Postindustrial Life', it reads: </p> <p>\"When they were introduced, he made a witticism, hoping to be liked. She laughed extremely loudly, hoping to be liked. Then each drove home alone, staring straight ahead, with the very same twist to their faces. The man who'd introduced them didn't like either of them, though he acted as if he did, anxious as he was to preserve good relations at all times. One never knew, after all, did one now did one now did one.\" </p> <p>The double- or triple-bind of the situation - that infinite, spiralling recession in those final words - is the dilemma of any 'relationship': that there is a hideous mismatch between how we try to appear to others (to please them, to appear cool, because you never know, do you now?) and how we are, or perceive ourselves to be; and if they are doing this to us (and they are, because, after all, we are anxious to preserve good relations), then we are in a pickle. </p> <p>A very similar pickle, of course, to the knots and tangles of metafiction and postmodern irony, but a much more serious pickle because metafiction, after all, is just a game, a slick, knowing, trying-to-be-cool game. Wallace plays on the problem from different angles, in different styles and formats, with different characters. 'The Depressed Person', which won an O. Henry award, painstakingly follows the loops and spirals of depressive self-obsession and self-loathing, twinned with the depressive's awareness of how repulsive such self-absorption is, and how manipulative it can appear, which feeds back into further depression and self-loathing, and so on; by turns the story inspires dark laughter, pity, and real irritation; but it describes with punishing accuracy the cruel way in which depression consumes its victims and their friends. </p> <p>Self-absorption, one way or another, afflicts all the interviewees in the book, who range from men who manipulate women into bed by lies, strategies and even, at their most manipulative, an attempt to flatter by a sham-honesty about how manipulative they are. The stories are funny, clever, often disturbing; and what makes them still more so is the fact that some of these 'hideous men' are employing feminist critiques to affirm the very misogyny those critiques were supposed to have exposed. </p> <p>There is a moral tone to the work that belies its facility with the tricksiness of postmodernism. In the two pieces titled 'The Devil Is A Busy Man', two anecdotes treat a similar problem from different angles; is altruism possible, given how suspicious we are of each other's - and even our own - motivation? 'Signifying Nothing' is a bold piece which could be about child abuse, or repressed memory, or power relations in a family. The fact that it is impossible to say for sure, and the terrible multiplicity of meanings that could attach themselves to that title, represents the dilemmas and uncertainties of all such cases. The question of how much honesty is possible or appropriate in relationships pervades the volume. </p> <p>Yet the most 'literary' and least 'realist' pieces address these questions with just as much passion and bravery. 'Tri-Stan Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko' is a futuristic account of television entertainment executives rendered as mythic Gods and characters; thus enacting its own target, which is the appropriation of classic myths for cheap entertainment. Along the way there are some pertinent shots at how unoriginal this sort of playfulness is, and how it does not flatter an audience to point out to them the artificiality of art. Wallace's loathing of the speed with which popular entertainment can appropriate criticism and repackage it as yet more entertainment recurs in his work, but seems particularly venomous here, beneath some rather neat jokes. </p> <p>He could, of course, be accused of merely colluding with the vapidities of a modern culture where everything is put into inverted commas. (One of Wallace's characters insistently puts in those inverted commas as he speaks, a gesture punctuating the text as 'f.f.', or '[flexion of upraised fingers]', a staggeringly annoying gesture which one sees all too often and is nicely observed here.) But when one reads 'Octet', a virtuoso piece of imploding metafiction, one doubts it. Wallace comes as close as is possible to asking for trust, offering sincerity, dealing with empathy and the writer-reader relationship. </p> <p>Indeed, at one point he says: 'None of that was very clearly put and might well ought to get cut. It may be that none of this real-narrative-honesty-v.-sham-narrative-honesty stuff can even be talked about up front.' </p> <p>That line is more than a joke. It sums up the difficulty tackled by the entire book, in that it asks for a leap of faith that we take it seriously. The alternative is a world of infinitely receding mirrors-in-mirrors, self-mockery, nihilism, of which there is an uncanny image at the end of the book: 'giving up the ghost entirely for a blank slack gagged mask's mindless stare - unseen and unseeing - into a mirror I could not know or feel myself without. No not ever again.' This is a book of formidable creative intelligence, and real moral purpose.</p>",

Henry award, painstakingly follows the loops and spirals of depressive self-obsession and self-loathing, twinned with the depressive's awareness of how repulsive such self-absorption is, and how manipulative it can appear, which feeds back into further depression and self-loathing, and so on; by turns the story inspires dark laughter, pity, and real irritation; but it describes with punishing accuracy the cruel way in which depression consumes its victims and their friends. Self-absorption, one way or another, afflicts all the interviewees in the book, who range from men who manipulate women into bed by lies, strategies and even, at their most manipulative, an attempt to flatter by a sham-honesty about how manipulative they are. The stories are funny, clever, often disturbing; and what makes them still more so is the fact that some of these 'hideous men' are employing feminist critiques to affirm the very misogyny those critiques were supposed to have exposed. There is a moral tone to the work that belies its facility with the tricksiness of postmodernism. In the two pieces titled 'The Devil Is A Busy Man', two anecdotes treat a similar problem from different angles; is altruism possible, given how suspicious we are of each other's - and even our own - motivation? 'Signifying Nothing' is a bold piece which could be about child abuse, or repressed memory, or power relations in a family. The fact that it is impossible to say for sure, and the terrible multiplicity of meanings that could attach themselves to that title, represents the dilemmas and uncertainties of all such cases. The question of how much honesty is possible or appropriate in relationships pervades the volume. Yet the most 'literary' and least 'realist' pieces address these questions with just as much passion and bravery. 'Tri-Stan Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko' is a futuristic account of television entertainment executives rendered as mythic Gods and characters; thus enacting its own target, which is the appropriation of classic myths for cheap entertainment. Along the way there are some pertinent shots at how unoriginal this sort of playfulness is, and how it does not flatter an audience to point out to them the artificiality of art. Wallace's loathing of the speed with which popular entertainment can appropriate criticism and repackage it as yet more entertainment recurs in his work, but seems particularly venomous here, beneath some rather neat jokes. He could, of course, be accused of merely colluding with the vapidities of a modern culture where everything is put into inverted commas. (One of Wallace's characters insistently puts in those inverted commas as he speaks, a gesture punctuating the text as 'f.f.', or '[flexion of upraised fingers]', a staggeringly annoying gesture which one sees all too often and is nicely observed here.) But when one reads 'Octet', a virtuoso piece of imploding metafiction, one doubts it. Wallace comes as close as is possible to asking for trust, offering sincerity, dealing with empathy and the writer-reader relationship. Indeed, at one point he says: 'None of that was very clearly put and might well ought to get cut. It may be that none of this real-narrative-honesty-v.-sham-narrative-honesty stuff can even be talked about up front.' That line is more than a joke. It sums up the difficulty tackled by the entire book, in that it asks for a leap of faith that we take it seriously. The alternative is a world of infinitely receding mirrors-in-mirrors, self-mockery, nihilism, of which there is an uncanny image at the end of the book: 'giving up the ghost entirely for a blank slack gagged mask's mindless stare - unseen and unseeing - into a mirror I could not know or feel myself without. No not ever again.' This is a book of formidable creative intelligence, and real moral purpose.",

To live up to The Silence of the Lambs, in Hannibal Thomas Harris had to turn the heroic anti-hero Lecter and FBI agent Clarice Starling into sexually involved cannibals, staring at each other across the opened skull and steaming brains of their still-living victim. Horror quickly becomes camp, nastily comic, ludicrous. Birdman is, likewise, a sickeningly baroque novel: the gothic masquerading as realism; a certain wild and pornographic imagination pegged into place by the medical jargon and the stock sentimentality of the central characters. </p> <p> Birdman is set in Greenwich. Its hero, Jack Caffery, is new to the Met's murder squad, the AMIP, and his first case is the brutal killings of five young women, all ritualistically murdered and dumped on wasteland near the Millennium Dome (a site that'll be popping up in lots of novels, I'd guess). The sexual serial killer that he's after has a creepy signature: he inserts a living bird into the chests of his victims.</p> <p>Caffery knows that the killer will strike again. The dark heart of the novel is necrophilia. It's a crime that is described in queasy and almost empathetic detail. Of course, there's no subject that is unfit for fiction, but some subjects are more problematical. It is hard to describe killing a woman and then having intercourse with her gradually decomposing body without lurching into pornography. Mo Hayder can't do it. I don't know who could. </p> <p>Caffery is a handsome, doomy young man, with a hidden sadness in his life. It is this sadness that makes him an obsessive, tormented detective ripe for a sequel. He has, at the beginning of the novel, a girlfriend who is beautiful and brittle and rich, and who can't understand the depths of his grief; and by the end a girlfriend who is also beautiful, but who is an artist and so more sympathetic to his self-indulgent gloom.</p> <p>The journey of the novel is a detective trail, but it is also a clich\u00e9d tale of Caffery's redemption - his self-forgiveness; the 'yes' he can finally say to life that contrasts with the ghastly negatives of the murderer he tracks. It's all too slick and morally assuaging, the clashing contrasts between death and life, the violent struggle between evil and good. And although there's a compelling quality about the book - its prose is a canny mix of the quasi-literary and the streetwise, it pushes all the right buttons, has a giddying kind of excitement in its escalating horrors - it left me with a nasty taste in my mouth. I felt as if I'd been had. I'd read to the end what I wished I hadn't begun.</p>",

Birdman is, likewise, a sickeningly baroque novel: the gothic masquerading as realism; a certain wild and pornographic imagination pegged into place by the medical jargon and the stock sentimentality of the central characters. Birdman is set in Greenwich. Its hero, Jack Caffery, is new to the Met's murder squad, the AMIP, and his first case is the brutal killings of five young women, all ritualistically murdered and dumped on wasteland near the Millennium Dome (a site that'll be popping up in lots of novels, I'd guess). The sexual serial killer that he's after has a creepy signature: he inserts a living bird into the chests of his victims. Caffery knows that the killer will strike again. The dark heart of the novel is necrophilia. It's a crime that is described in queasy and almost empathetic detail. Of course, there's no subject that is unfit for fiction, but some subjects are more problematical. It is hard to describe killing a woman and then having intercourse with her gradually decomposing body without lurching into pornography. Mo Hayder can't do it. I don't know who could. Caffery is a handsome, doomy young man, with a hidden sadness in his life. It is this sadness that makes him an obsessive, tormented detective ripe for a sequel. He has, at the beginning of the novel, a girlfriend who is beautiful and brittle and rich, and who can't understand the depths of his grief; and by the end a girlfriend who is also beautiful, but who is an artist and so more sympathetic to his self-indulgent gloom. The journey of the novel is a detective trail, but it is also a clich\u00e9d tale of Caffery's redemption - his self-forgiveness; the 'yes' he can finally say to life that contrasts with the ghastly negatives of the murderer he tracks. It's all too slick and morally assuaging, the clashing contrasts between death and life, the violent struggle between evil and good. And although there's a compelling quality about the book - its prose is a canny mix of the quasi-literary and the streetwise, it pushes all the right buttons, has a giddying kind of excitement in its escalating horrors - it left me with a nasty taste in my mouth. I felt as if I'd been had. I'd read to the end what I wished I hadn't begun.",

      "body": "<p>Philippe Noiret has his nose in Le Figaro when I arrive. His legs are crossed, his suit is three-piece tweed, adorned with a yellow hankie. A silk patterned bow-tie blooms from his neck. He looks a perfect English gentleman, with the flamboyant bulk of a French aristocrat, and a touch of something madder, a little perverse anarchy. He manages to look both welcoming and forlorn as he stands up. 'One can read Le Figaro ,' he says apologetically, 'as long as one knows in advance how reactionary it is.' </p> <p>He has grown a wispy white beard and aged 40 years since his 'first real film', as he calls Louis Malle's Zazie Dans Le M\u00e9tro , but he is otherwise wonderfully similar to the character he played then - Gabriel, the camp, perfumed uncle who dealt extravagant politeness and resigned melancholy in equal measure. He can't really be equated, though, with any one of his roles. 'I've played homosexuals, transvestites, assassins, bourgeois, princes, craftsmen, labourers, farmers,' he says. 'I've played everything.' </p> <p>Noiret is now in his seventieth year, and he made his hundredth film more than a decade ago. He is considered, in France, something of a national treasure - he was President Mitterrand's favourite actor. And yet he is best known here and in the US for playing a venerable Italian projectionist (in Cinema Paradiso) and a famous Latin American poet (in Il Postino). This, he says, is one of the many 'paradoxes' of his career. He is often described as a character actor, as if he could really disguise himself, but his strong build and mournful, cartoonish face make a very recognisable signature, whether he uses them in the service of gravitas (as in Tavernier's Life and Nothing But), rowdy arrogance (as in his new film, The King of Paris) or light entertainment (as in D'Artagnan's Daughter). </p> <p>Noiret speaks slow, florid French, with rounded vowels that seem to rise from his belly. He talks about performing texts you can 'get your teeth into', and you can really imagine him taking pleasure in chewing each word. He has a quick ear for irony, a modesty that melts effortlessly into conversation, and would probably love, if it could be couched in the right sort of prose, a good row. 'The critics were unanimous,' he says at one point, rather triumphantly, 'in dragging us through the mud!' The performance in question was a play, two years ago. It was the first time he'd been on stage for 35 years. Ironically, his new movie, The King of Paris is about a distinguished stage actor of the 1930s who is trying to get into film. The part was written for Noiret by director Dominique Maillet, before either of them suspected a return to the theatre would be on the cards. Maillet, a former journalist, had written a book about Noiret, with his collaboration. He knew everything about him, and was in a good position to tailor a role to his life and to his talents. </p> <p>Noiret was born in Lille, in northern France. His father was in the rag trade, and because the company he worked for had branches all over the country, the family moved around, and ended up in Toulouse during the war. They moved to Paris in 1946, where Philippe was expelled from the lyc\u00e9e (his grades were awful) and sent to a school run by a Catholic order called the Oratoriens - D'Artagnan was a former pupil. There, a teacher encouraged his interest in the theatre, and invited contemporary authors - Montherlant, Julien Green - to come and give their opinion on Noiret's thespian potential. </p> <p>He got work soon after he left, among other things as an extra in Jean-Louis Barrault's company. And one day a wild dream came true - Jean Vilar took him on at his Th\u00e9tre National Populaire. Vilar is not much known about here, but he was the founder of the Avignon festival, and was at the time the most important figure in European theatre. </p> <p>Noiret recalls that 'Vilar lived in the service of an idea, which was to bring to the theatre people who wouldn't normally go, who had perhaps never been. So he did market research in all the big commercial and industrial companies on the outskirts of Paris, and set up subscription systems with them - the tickets were very affordable. And then he did a series of little things which were very important in changing the relationship certain classes had to the theatre. For example, instead of starting the performance at nine o'clock as usual, he began at eight because he thought, quite rightly, that a lot of people could then come straight from work; you could have dinner in the theatre, as well. The programme was the entire text of the play with photographs of the production, so you left with a book. And there was often some kind of music-hall evening, so Edith Piaf came to sing, as did Maurice Chevalier.' </p> <p>Noiret says the TNP is one of his fondest memories, and, he adds, the place he met his wife, Monique Chaumette, who also acted in the troupe, and with whom he still lives. </p> <p>Even in his youth, Noiret played older men. 'I've always been large,' he says, 'with a deep voice, so I never had the physique for roles like valets or harlequins. I played G\u00e9rard Philipe's father when I was 24. I didn't catch up to the age I had always played until I was about 40.' </p> <p>But an awareness of his size has become an essential part of his technique. 'One of the few important things you can learn in this business,' he says, 'is to always know what is on view. You know, when you first come to the cinema from the theatre you feel lost, and then you understand that there are rules you can learn. And later, as you go on, you understand that there aren't any rules, that everything you thought you understood never existed. But there is this one remaining rule, I think, which is to have an idea of the importance you have in a shot, a sense of the volume you take up.' </p> <p>It would seem safe, if indelicate, to speculate that some of his volume stems from his love of food. The film which secured Noiret's international reputation was Marco Ferreri's La Grande Bouffe of 1973. The plot is simple: four friends retire to a country house in order to eat, or rather feast, themselves to death. Their meals are fantastical and over the top; many of them are based on dishes prepared by Napoleon's chef. One of Noiret's co-stars, Marcello Mastroianni, explained how the order of their deaths was decided: '[Catherine] Deneuve [his lover at the time] and I had been planning for some time to take a vacation in Jamaica, so I asked Marco to kill me off first so the trip wouldn't be ruined. Then Piccoli had another picture to make, so he was killed off. Ugo had to do something else, so he didn't want to stick around till the end, either. Noiret was like the cat that swallowed the canary.' </p> <p>Last to go in the film, Noiret in the flesh has an air of the contented gourmet about him. He shared his love of fine food with another of his directors - Alfred Hitchcock. In fact, Noiret's first response to the mere mention of Hitchcock is that he was 'delicious'. </p> <p>They worked together on one of the director's late films, Topaz , and Noiret has a wonderful story about their gastronomic friendship: 'The first scene we shot when we got to the studio in Los Angeles was one in which I had to eat and drink. Before the shoot Hitchcock called me over and said, \"I sent for some duck pt\u00e9 d'Amiens for you, all the way from France, because I know that one is very good. And I've chosen a Bordeaux Cheval Blanc nineteengodknowswhat... for you. But since that wine is too good for the film, I've had it decanted into bottles of ordinary burgundy. But what's inside them is this Bordeaux - so you can drink the wine and eat the pt\u00e9.\"' </p> <p>'So,' he continues, 'we filmed the first scene. I was very moved to be on that big set at Universal, with this great director, all that silence - he terrorised people, not us, but people in general - so we film the first take, a master shot. I eat, I drink, I eat, I drink, I say nothing - I don't have any lines - I do the scene. He says \"CUT!\" There's a pause, and he says, \"MISTER NOIRET!\"' - Noiret imitates Hitchcock in a booming voice, with an English accent - 'Oh, I was a wreck - what had I done? I said, yes, sir? He said, \"HOW WAS THE PATE?\"' </p> <p>Towards the end of our conversation I show Noiret a book I have just bought, about the films of Agn\u00e8s Varda. Her first film was also one of his earliest ( La Pointe Courte , 1955). Varda had been the photographer at the Th\u00e9tre National Populaire, and in the book are snaps of many of Noiret's old friends. He flicks through with a random curiosity: 'Louis Aragon - what a shit he was... Ah, Delphine Seyrig, everyone was in love with her... charming woman. Sad, that. That's the worst thing. It's not getting old. It's watching others disappear. I've a got a photo in my study which Agn\u00e8s Varda took of all the TNP troupe - G\u00e9rard Philipe, Maria Casar\u00e8s, Monique and everyone... I could put little crosses all over it. It's terrible.' </p> <p>But before he has time to dwell on the matter he has picked up his coat, put on his hat, and escorted me, gently, outside. Almost immediately, he removes his hat again, with the sort of sweeping gesture only a true musketeer could pull off, and holds out his hand: 'It's been a great pleasure.' </p> <p>\u0095 The Philippe Noiret season at the Institut Fran\u00e7ais in London runs from 27 Jan-23 Feb. The King of Paris opens next month.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Fantasy football will be enlisted this week in the battle to make maths fun and end the innumeracy of many of Britain's soccer-obsessed children . </p> <p>Education Secretary David Blunkett has decided that a nationwide schools fantasy league is the way to catch the imagination of boys, who are often bored by figures. The Sheffield MP - under fire for demanding the sacking of Danny Wilson, the manager of his beloved Sheffield Wednesday - has entered his own team in the league, which has been running in 200 pilot schools since the beginning of the season. </p> <p>Wilson will gain some consolation from the fact that Blunkett's team is performing 'very badly indeed', according to sources close to the Minister. This may, however, have something to do with the Education Secretary's decision to include players from Sheffield Wednesday, who have been at the bottom of the Premiership for most of the season. </p> <p>'If I was as poor at my job as Education and Employment Secretary as I am at fantasy football, I'd have to sack myself,' said Blunkett last night. </p> <p>The Minister's other recent foray into football has not been too successful either. Blunkett and three other Sheffield MPs proposed an early-day motion in the Commons last week suggesting that Wilson should be sacked after talks with Charterhouse, a finance house that backs Sheffield Wednesday. </p> <p>Football managers rallied behind Wilson and told the MPs to stop interfering with the running of the club. Blunkett and two of the MPs later distanced themselves from the demand for Wilson's head. </p> <p>Each child will pay \u00a33.50 a year to join the fanstasy league, 20 pence of which goes to children's charity Barnardos. The league is run by a non-profit organisation which also produces maths lessons to be used with the game. </p> <p>Entrants use an imaginary \u00a350 million to buy their team of Premiership players. The performance of the children's teams in real weekend matches leads to a ranking in the fantasy league. Each week the schools will be posted the results showing the leading teams, ranked by school and individual pupil. </p> <p>Ministers have decided the pilot scheme has been a huge success in persuading reluctant boys to start using maths. </p> <p>After being extended to the secondary sector, it will be launched in primary schools next season. </p> <p>The fantasy league forms part of Maths Year 2000, which follows last year's National Year of Reading. The Government has set itself a target of 75 per cent of 11- year-olds reaching the ex-pected level at maths by the end of 2002. In last year's tests 69 per cent of boys and girls reached that level. But by the time they take GCSEs at 16, boys fall behind girls in all subjects. </p> <p>A government spokesman said: 'Boys traditionally have performed poorly and have regarded failure at maths as a badge of pride. That has got to stop.' </p> <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair, who will launch the scheme on Tuesday, said: 'The football may be a fantasy, but the maths is for real. Tackling under-achievement in the three Rs is a top priority. The literacy strategy has been a huge success. This has been followed by the Government's numeracy strategy. That is starting to make a real difference.' </p> <p>David Reynolds, Professor of Education at Loughborough University and the man responsible for the Government's numeracy strategy, said last night: 'We have not always taught maths in a way that children can really take to heart. This is potentially very exciting.' </p> <p>The most successful school in the pilot scheme is St Thomas Moore High in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. </p> <p>True to form, the single best manager is a girl from Eastbrook School in Dagenham, Essex, who will be honoured by the Prime Minister on Tuesday. </p> <p>'Girls are beating boys at everything nowadays,' said Blunkett. 'Boys should see this as a challenge and make sure they aren't left behind.' </p> <p><strong>How it works</strong></p> <p>\u0095 At the beginning of the season the 'manager' chooses a team using a set budget - \u00a350 million in the case of the schools league - from a list of real players in the Premiership (in Blunkett's team, for instance, Manchester United's star striker Dwight Yorke will have cost considerably more than West Ham veteran John Moncur). </p> <p>\u0095 Each week the players are given points for goals scored, or in the case of defenders and goalkeepers, their ability to keep goals out. Points are then docked for own goals, bookings and sendings off. The teams are then ranked according to the total points scored. </p> <p>\u0095 At least once a season, managers are allowed a transfer 'window' to buy and sell players, while keeping within their fixed budget.</p>",

Wilson will gain some consolation from the fact that Blunkett's team is performing 'very badly indeed', according to sources close to the Minister. This may, however, have something to do with the Education Secretary's decision to include players from Sheffield Wednesday, who have been at the bottom of the Premiership for most of the season. 'If I was as poor at my job as Education and Employment Secretary as I am at fantasy football, I'd have to sack myself,' said Blunkett last night. The Minister's other recent foray into football has not been too successful either. Blunkett and three other Sheffield MPs proposed an early-day motion in the Commons last week suggesting that Wilson should be sacked after talks with Charterhouse, a finance house that backs Sheffield Wednesday. Football managers rallied behind Wilson and told the MPs to stop interfering with the running of the club. Blunkett and two of the MPs later distanced themselves from the demand for Wilson's head. Each child will pay \u00a33.50 a year to join the fanstasy league, 20 pence of which goes to children's charity Barnardos. The league is run by a non-profit organisation which also produces maths lessons to be used with the game. Entrants use an imaginary \u00a350 million to buy their team of Premiership players. The performance of the children's teams in real weekend matches leads to a ranking in the fantasy league. Each week the schools will be posted the results showing the leading teams, ranked by school and individual pupil. Ministers have decided the pilot scheme has been a huge success in persuading reluctant boys to start using maths. After being extended to the secondary sector, it will be launched in primary schools next season. The fantasy league forms part of Maths Year 2000, which follows last year's National Year of Reading. The Government has set itself a target of 75 per cent of 11- year-olds reaching the ex-pected level at maths by the end of 2002. In last year's tests 69 per cent of boys and girls reached that level. But by the time they take GCSEs at 16, boys fall behind girls in all subjects. A government spokesman said: 'Boys traditionally have performed poorly and have regarded failure at maths as a badge of pride. That has got to stop.' Prime Minister Tony Blair, who will launch the scheme on Tuesday, said: 'The football may be a fantasy, but the maths is for real. Tackling under-achievement in the three Rs is a top priority. The literacy strategy has been a huge success. This has been followed by the Government's numeracy strategy. That is starting to make a real difference.' David Reynolds, Professor of Education at Loughborough University and the man responsible for the Government's numeracy strategy, said last night: 'We have not always taught maths in a way that children can really take to heart. This is potentially very exciting.' The most successful school in the pilot scheme is St Thomas Moore High in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. True to form, the single best manager is a girl from Eastbrook School in Dagenham, Essex, who will be honoured by the Prime Minister on Tuesday. 'Girls are beating boys at everything nowadays,' said Blunkett. 'Boys should see this as a challenge and make sure they aren't left behind.' How it works \u0095 At the beginning of the season the 'manager' chooses a team using a set budget - \u00a350 million in the case of the schools league - from a list of real players in the Premiership (in Blunkett's team, for instance, Manchester United's star striker Dwight Yorke will have cost considerably more than West Ham veteran John Moncur). \u0095 Each week the players are given points for goals scored, or in the case of defenders and goalkeepers, their ability to keep goals out. Points are then docked for own goals, bookings and sendings off. The teams are then ranked according to the total points scored. \u0095 At least once a season, managers are allowed a transfer 'window' to buy and sell players, while keeping within their fixed budget.",

      "body": "<p>If someone told you that the Government had implemented a plan to censor the Internet use of 12 million British subjects you would say they were scaremongering. Think again. Index on Censorship has a terrific story about the so-called 'National Grid for Learning', designed to ensure that Britain's 12 million schoolchildren do not have access to anything on the Web that is not approved by David Blunkett and the commercial contractors implementing the grid.</p> <p>Blunkett regularly vies with Jack Straw for the title of the most authoritarian minister in the Blair cabinet. Even so, arrangements to censor children's use of the Net take one's breath away.</p> <p>The Index article quotes from his speech introducing the Superhighway Safety Pack. 'I am determined,' he rants, 'to ensure that children are protected from unsuitable material. We all share a responsibility to make sure that children's use of the Internet is appropriate and safe.'</p> <p>Suppliers to the Learning Grid are 'expected to offer adequate filtering of the material which can be accessed through their connections to the Internet'.</p> <p>Ah, those magic words: 'appropriate', 'safe', 'adequate' and 'filtering' - the catch phrases of intellectual nannies, censors and authoritarians everywhere. Who is to judge what is appropriate, safe or adequate? Why, the companies supplying connections to, and material for, Blunkett's fatuous grid.</p> <p>And how will they meet his requirements? Answer: by installing the kind of filtering software which is already a byword for stupidity, insensitivity and illiberality. The kind of software which - as astronomer Heather Couper told Index - prevents a schoolboy from accessing a website she has co-developed. Why? Because the site explains how to do 'naked-eye observations' of the stars from your back garden. God alone knows what Blunkett would make of the transit of Venus.</p> <p>The net is buzzing with conjecture about why Bill Gates has handed control of Microsoft to Steve Ballmer. It depends what you mean by 'control' of course, but some wags have suggested it is because Gates wants to spend more time learning Linux, the open-source operating system, which is slowly but surely beginning to threaten Microsoft's hold on the network server market. If so, it would be a typically far-sighted move by a man who has always been very good at taking the long view.</p> <p>For the Linux bandwagon continues to roll. The most vivid proof of this is IBM's announcement that it is seeking to establish Linux as a serious competitor to Windows in the corporate world. IBM developers are to work with Linux hackers to develop e-business software which can run on various hardware platforms.</p> <p>And Netcraft - the company which surveys the Web to see what software servers are using - reported that even the Queen's website has switched to Linux. Gates's hopes of a Royal Warrant are receding.</p> <p>Still with Linux, people have speculated for years about what Linus Torvalds, the Finn who created Linux, has been doing since moving to Transmeta, a pathologically secretive Californian start-up. Now we know.</p> <p>On Wednesday the company unveiled a revolutionary microprocessor codenamed Crusoe - a computing engine designed exclusively with mobile applications in mind. Among the claims for this new technology are Wintel compatibility and incredibly low power consumption, which, if true, will make Crusoe processors perfect for the wireless 'information appliances' regarded as the Next Big Thing.</p> <p>If nothing else, this might take some of the shine off ARM, the darling of UK investors because of its stranglehold on the mobile market. But perhaps the most significant thing about Crusoe is that it comes with Linux on a chip.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto=john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p>For links and background material see: <a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "If someone told you that the Government had implemented a plan to censor the Internet use of 12 million British subjects you would say they were scaremongering. Think again. Index on Censorship has a terrific story about the so-called 'National Grid for Learning', designed to ensure that Britain's 12 million schoolchildren do not have access to anything on the Web that is not approved by David Blunkett and the commercial contractors implementing the grid. Blunkett regularly vies with Jack Straw for the title of the most authoritarian minister in the Blair cabinet. Even so, arrangements to censor children's use of the Net take one's breath away. The Index article quotes from his speech introducing the Superhighway Safety Pack. 'I am determined,' he rants, 'to ensure that children are protected from unsuitable material. We all share a responsibility to make sure that children's use of the Internet is appropriate and safe.' Suppliers to the Learning Grid are 'expected to offer adequate filtering of the material which can be accessed through their connections to the Internet'. Ah, those magic words: 'appropriate', 'safe', 'adequate' and 'filtering' - the catch phrases of intellectual nannies, censors and authoritarians everywhere. Who is to judge what is appropriate, safe or adequate? Why, the companies supplying connections to, and material for, Blunkett's fatuous grid. And how will they meet his requirements? Answer: by installing the kind of filtering software which is already a byword for stupidity, insensitivity and illiberality. The kind of software which - as astronomer Heather Couper told Index - prevents a schoolboy from accessing a website she has co-developed. Why? Because the site explains how to do 'naked-eye observations' of the stars from your back garden. God alone knows what Blunkett would make of the transit of Venus. The net is buzzing with conjecture about why Bill Gates has handed control of Microsoft to Steve Ballmer. It depends what you mean by 'control' of course, but some wags have suggested it is because Gates wants to spend more time learning Linux, the open-source operating system, which is slowly but surely beginning to threaten Microsoft's hold on the network server market. If so, it would be a typically far-sighted move by a man who has always been very good at taking the long view. For the Linux bandwagon continues to roll. The most vivid proof of this is IBM's announcement that it is seeking to establish Linux as a serious competitor to Windows in the corporate world. IBM developers are to work with Linux hackers to develop e-business software which can run on various hardware platforms. And Netcraft - the company which surveys the Web to see what software servers are using - reported that even the Queen's website has switched to Linux. Gates's hopes of a Royal Warrant are receding. Still with Linux, people have speculated for years about what Linus Torvalds, the Finn who created Linux, has been doing since moving to Transmeta, a pathologically secretive Californian start-up. Now we know. On Wednesday the company unveiled a revolutionary microprocessor codenamed Crusoe - a computing engine designed exclusively with mobile applications in mind. Among the claims for this new technology are Wintel compatibility and incredibly low power consumption, which, if true, will make Crusoe processors perfect for the wireless 'information appliances' regarded as the Next Big Thing. If nothing else, this might take some of the shine off ARM, the darling of UK investors because of its stranglehold on the mobile market. But perhaps the most significant thing about Crusoe is that it comes with Linux on a chip. john.naughton@observer.co.uk For links and background material see: www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/",

Our cupboards and filing systems can't cope with it all, so it spills out on to floors and table tops, gradually taking over our houses and our lives. How many clothes do you own (and still insist you have nothing to wear)? How many corkscrews? We're the most materially endowed generation in history - and that's our problem. Without being aware of it, the stuff we spend our lives and money acquiring has become a constant, overwhelming source of stress, affecting everything from our lifestyle choices to our personal development.</p> <p>Our overfilled, cluttered houses aren't sanctuary from a hostile world anymore, or even sleek machines for living. They're messy, never finished, a constant source of stress, guilt and anxiety. Most of our time is spent working to get more stuff or to maintain the stuff we have already (cars to service, collections to add to, consumer durables to repair or replace, all that furniture to clean, objects to dust), leaving us exhausted, time-famished and trapped at our income levels, with no choice to downshift or change direction. Although we live in a culture of unprecedented plenty, we have the mindset of hoarders. Our textbooks from college, odd socks, gifts we didn't want and never use: we can't throw anything away. We've become hostages to our stuff.</p> <p>Dejunking - clearing out all that clutter and living a cleaner, simpler life - has become an almost spiritual movement in the USA, an even bigger, greedier culture than our own, and is just beginning to take off here. Done properly - which means approached from an emotional and philosophical point of view as well as a practical one - dejunking is far more than an extension of spring cleaning. On one level, it involves a gradual purging of all the stuff you don't need that is clogging up your house and your life.</p> <p>On another level, it's nothing short of a personal liberation.</p> <p>People who have dejunked talk about the experience as a turning point, which has allowed them to reassess their lives and to feel lighter and more free than they have done for years. As the physical junk gets cleared out, other kinds of junk inevitably follow: one woman, stuck in a cold and difficult marriage, reported feelings of depression and restlessness which grew for many years. Then she started clearing out her junk, and couldn't stop. She went through her house, throwing away the detritus of 15 years. Six months later, she filed for divorce from her husband. \"And hers is not an unusual story,\" reports Janet Luhrs, author of The Simple Living Guide (US edition) and editor of the Simple Living newsletter. \"Clearing the clutter away can be very cathartic. It leaves you space - literally and emotionally. As the burden of all that stuff begins to lift, you become more aware of your emotional mess. And you start to clear that up, too.\"</p> <p>Don Aslett is a cleaning specialist, and the author of many bestselling books about clutter control. He believes that we're addicted to stuff, investing it with magical qualities like love, security, or personal development. \"By the time we emerge from childhood, we firmly believe that things make us happy,\" he says. \"If one little thing gives us pleasure, then surely more things will increase our pleasure. And things can change us, make us better. For instance, \"I can't keep my lawn as nice as Larry's. A bigger, better mower is the answer\"; \"the kids won't do their homework. I'm sure it'll help if we buy a computer or an encyclopedia set\" or \"I'm unpopular; a new dandruff shampoo should do the trick\". We learn to measure our self-worth by how other people see us, and we look for more and better ways to make ourselves impressive - which translates as getting and keeping more stuff.\" And of course, we're wrong. In his book Britain on the Couch, the psychologist Oliver James points out that although we have many times more possessions than our parents' generation, we rate ourselves as unhappier with our lives.</p> <p>Don Aslett sees dejunking as nothing less than a way to save your own life. \"Junk is everywhere,\" he says. \"It's on us, in us and around us, and we have to take back our control of it. Religious leaders, doctors, psychologists, scientists and 40 other kinds of \"improvers\" will all tell you the same thing. When you get the junk out of your life, everything improves - mentally, physically and emotionally.\"</p> <p>Michelle Passoff makes her living from other people's clutter - she's a 'clutter consultant' and author of Lighten Up! Free Yourself From Clutter (HarperPerennial, US edition). \"A long time ago, I noticed that when something big happened in my life, I would go on a cleaning binge. One day I had a thought: \"Suppose I did it the other way around. Would a big clear-out lead to big things happening in my life?\" She found that it did. \"Trust me, it is liberating to let go,\" she insists. \"It's like a balloon tethered to the ground that's been released.\" Dejunking, she says, goes way beyond just throwing some old junk away. \"It's a truth-telling process. Getting rid of the most basic forms of clutter in the physical environment is a path towards cleaning whatever is in the way of fulfilment anywhere.\"</p> <p>It sounds like a grandiose claim until you remember that feeling of deep satisfaction you get from sorting out a kitchen drawer or cupboard. It's such a simple thing: making something messy and dirty into something clean and tidy, imposing your own order on chaos. Imagine that feeling extended to your whole house, and then to your whole life, and you begin to see why dejunkers get so evangelical. If you want to clean up your life, we offer this beginner's guide to dejunking.</p> <p><b>Reasons to dejunk</b></p> <p><b>You are your clutter</b><br> We gain much of our identity and reputation from the stuff we surround ourselves with. It's why most of us don't like inviting people back to our houses until we know them well - it's too private, too revealing. Don Aslett calls it our 'visual autobiography'. \"People treat you differently if you're drowning in clutter. If they can't sit on the back seat of your car because it's full of junk, or you're constantly borrowing pens/stamps/tissues, etc because you can't find them in your bag, they read you as disorganised, undisciplined and sloppy. The first good reason to dejunk is because people will treat you better.\"</p> <p><b>Clutter steals your space</b><br> If you don't use half of the stuff you own, it isn't harmlessly lying around - it's eating into 50 per cent of your space. \"Go into your wardrobe or your kitchen,\" advises Aslett. \"Get a roll of masking tape, and tape off half of it. That's what your clutter is doing to your environment.\"</p> <p><b>More clutter equals more cleaning</b><br> Housework is like tax - inevitable. But Aslett estimates that 40 per cent of the time spent cleaning is spent just handling, getting around, and moving clutter out of the way. Add on the time spent cleaning the stuff you don't need or use (all those tasteful objects, the three walls of books you'll never read again, the extra tables and stands and who knows what else), and that's a huge slice of time spent just servicing your clutter.</p> <p><b>Clutter is a constant distraction</b><br> \"Having lots of stuff around you is kind of ballast against the world,\" observes Janet Luhrs. \"You can put all your energy into acquiring and displaying things, rather than dealing with real human emotions or interactions. I know one couple who are avid collectors of figurines, and I believe they have that collection in place of a real family.\"</p> <p>Michelle Passoff also believes in the dark side of clutter. \"People are constantly asking themselves what they should do with their lives: which relationships, which work, which direction. The truth is, that life sends us little messages and signs all the time, in the form of small events or intuitions or conversations. But you have to be alert, open and sensitive to receiving them, and we just can't be that when we're living overcrowded lives. Our stuff surrounds us and distracts us from the real purposes of our lives.\"</p> <p><b>How to begin dejunking</b></p> <p>\u0095 Start gradually. \"Do a single cupboard or a couple of drawers to begin with,\" advises Janet Luhrs. \"Start with the easy stuff. Get yourself a couple of rubbish sacks and fill them with the things you've been meaning to throw away or know you don't want.\"When you've done it, she says, \"you'll feel good. You'll begin to see how the positive effects dejunking will have on you. You'll want to do more\".</p> <p>\u0095 Fill another couple of sacks or boxes with your 'Maybe' stuff. \"This is the kind of stuff you've had hanging around, that you don't use and probably don't want, but you know, maybe you'll need it some day.\" Put all of this in boxes, with a date 6-12 months from today. \"Go back to it on that date, and if you haven't had to use it by then, you don't need it. Don't even open the boxes, just throw them away.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Know what you want to achieve. \"Ask yourself what you're clearing this clutter to make room for,\" says Michelle Passoff. \"Most people say: to feel happier, or more at peace. Those are great goals, but they aren't specific enough. What makes you happy? What do you want? What does being at peace mean to you? If you make a list of your personal goals, it will guide you towards what you need to throw away and what you need to keep.\"</p> <p>\u0095 You don't have to throw everything away. \"People worry that I'll make them throw away their most precious memorabilia,\" says Passoff. \"But all I do is make clients look at each object in their life, and think about it. Does this object have positive or negative connotations for them? Does it keep them weighted in the past (one client still had her wedding dress from a dissolved, abusive marriage)? You should only keep things that make you feel good, function better, and contribute to the quality of your life. If you have a load of old stuff - say, your dead aunt's old shoes that you can't bear to throw away because you loved your aunt - try this: take a photograph of the shoes, put it into a beautiful frame, and throw the shoes away.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Know the difference between dejunking and organising. \"You need less things,\" says Janet Luhrs, \"not more things to put your things in\". \"Being organised is a good thing,\" admits Michelle Passoff, \"but you shouldn't get to that until you have sorted and dejunked everything else. When you're left with the good stuff, the stuff you actively want and need, then it's time to buy your filing cabinets and labels.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Make a record. \"Seriously. Take before, during and after pictures as you begin to clean up your life. It will encourage you, and let you see how far you've come,\" says Passoff. \"Keep a dejunk diary. If you're dealing with all this stuff, a lot of emotions come up. Those letters which remind you of an old lover, the silver tea service your mother gave you. Write down how it makes you feel to contemplate getting rid of this stuff. It's all part of the cleansing process.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Make a plan. \"This is where you take an honest look at everything you have in your home. You need to know exactly what you've got,\" says Passoff. \"Break your home up into areas - room by room, or cupboard by cupboard - and do one bit at a time. A thorough dejunk session shouldn't take less than 2-4 hours. Calculate how many of those sessions you'll need to do to get to what I call ground zero, then schedule them in.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Understand that clutter never goes away. \"So long as there is mail, delivery services, families, there will be clutter,\" says Passoff. \"You need to keep on top of it. Dejunking helps you rethink your attitude to stuff. Shopping is so pass\u00e9. Spend the money on a nice meal out or tickets for the theatre with friends.\" Janet Luhrs suggests that adults have pacts to only give each other gifts they can actually use - wine, food, bath treats - rather than just things.</p> <p><b>What is junk?</b></p> <p>Although dejunking means you will end up with a lot less stuff, it doesn't mean you have to give away everything. Most of us have so much stuff, we forget what is really valuable and what is just junk. Michelle Passoff offers these simple guidelines:</p> <p>\u0095 Jumbled up stuff is junk. That's a load of stuff that doesn't go together, like the hall table with the cat's toys, unpaid bills and your daily mail, or a dresser with loose change, make-up and some notes from your evening class spilled on to it. Clutter has no logic. A good basic rule? Separate all unrelated items from each other.</p> <p>\u0095 Rubbish is junk. Basically, clutter is rubbish. Three-quarters of the piles on paper on desks and tabletops are things that just haven't been thrown away yet.</p> <p>\u0095 Unfinished business is junk. Scraps of paper with telephone numbers of people whose calls you haven't returned, bags of clothes standing inside the front door that you haven't given to the charity shop, letters you haven't yet responded to - this is the kind of clutter that's mobile. It follows you around, and if you leave it unattended long enough, it changes from junk into big problems.</p> <p>\u0095 Indecision turns into junk. Can't decide if you'll ever wear that dress again? Can't decide whether to go to that party? Indecision is a warning sign: if you're always having thoughts like those, your unworn clothes and unanswered invitations, or abandoned painting project gradually turn into junk. Clutter is all the stuff you push aside and tell yourself you'll think about later. Fear of regret often stops people being more decisive or throwing things away. Having a more positive approach to making choices builds your confidence - and dejunks your clutter.</p> <p><i>For more advice and information about dejunking, try the following:</i></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freefromclutter.com\" target=\"_new\">www.freefromclutter.com</a> is Michelle Passoff's website - a fund of dejunk philosophy and practical advice.

Dejunking helps you rethink your attitude to stuff. Shopping is so pass\u00e9. Spend the money on a nice meal out or tickets for the theatre with friends.\" Janet Luhrs suggests that adults have pacts to only give each other gifts they can actually use - wine, food, bath treats - rather than just things. What is junk? Although dejunking means you will end up with a lot less stuff, it doesn't mean you have to give away everything. Most of us have so much stuff, we forget what is really valuable and what is just junk. Michelle Passoff offers these simple guidelines: \u0095 Jumbled up stuff is junk. That's a load of stuff that doesn't go together, like the hall table with the cat's toys, unpaid bills and your daily mail, or a dresser with loose change, make-up and some notes from your evening class spilled on to it. Clutter has no logic. A good basic rule? Separate all unrelated items from each other. \u0095 Rubbish is junk. Basically, clutter is rubbish. Three-quarters of the piles on paper on desks and tabletops are things that just haven't been thrown away yet. \u0095 Unfinished business is junk. Scraps of paper with telephone numbers of people whose calls you haven't returned, bags of clothes standing inside the front door that you haven't given to the charity shop, letters you haven't yet responded to - this is the kind of clutter that's mobile. It follows you around, and if you leave it unattended long enough, it changes from junk into big problems. \u0095 Indecision turns into junk. Can't decide if you'll ever wear that dress again? Can't decide whether to go to that party? Indecision is a warning sign: if you're always having thoughts like those, your unworn clothes and unanswered invitations, or abandoned painting project gradually turn into junk. Clutter is all the stuff you push aside and tell yourself you'll think about later. Fear of regret often stops people being more decisive or throwing things away. Having a more positive approach to making choices builds your confidence - and dejunks your clutter.

      "body": "<p>The potential benefits of eating a healthy diet have been proffered for many years - my grandmother spouted 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away', yet as simple as this adage sounds, we're more than ever recording appallingly high incidences of heart disease and cancer, flu epidemics and colds. Our environment must take some of the blame. However, a major contributing factor is that too few people have the knowledge, or inspiration, to take advantage of food's ability to keep us well. After all, the body's defenders can only derive their raw ingredients from the food we place in our stomach.</p> <p><b>The antioxidant factor</b></p> <p>A general healthy diet is the best framework for a healthy life. When it comes to fending off disease and minimising the effects of ageing, we need specifically to look to a group of nutrients called 'antioxidants'. These include bioflavonoids, vitamins C and E, Lycopene, beta-carotene (which the body converts into vitamin A), and the minerals selenium and zinc. This group of nutrients reduces your likelihood of developing cancer and heart disease, as well as other diseases of ageing such as arthritis and cataracts, by boosting the immune system, producing anti-cancer substances, preventing blood fats from oxidising and depositing in the blood vessels, and by their 'antioxidant' activity.</p> <p>Our bodies need oxygen, but the process of oxidation (resulting from exposure to oxygen) can be harmful, creating unstable by-products - molecules known as free radicals. These molecules interact with those that make up our body's cells, causing damage and disease. While the process of oxidation has always gone on, our bodies are now producing far more free radicals as a result of stress, pollution - including cigarette smoke and car exhaust fumes - and exposure to too much ultraviolet light from the sun; so we need to boost our antioxidant intakes to counteract these antagonists.</p> <p>The good news is, that since antioxidants can be found in so many foods, the body can derive all the necessary antioxidants from eating the real thing; you don't need to take supplements. A good five portions of fruits or vegetables every day will get you to the antioxidant target. If you can push it towards eight, even better, especially when you feel vulnerable or run down, or you have a strong family history of heart disease or diet-related cancers such as those of the colon or breast. This may sound a lot, but since a portion is only an apple, or a large tomato, the target can be met. Have fresh juice (made from three oranges) in the morning, vegetables or salad with your meals and pieces of fruit afterwards or in between. Nutrient values depreciate, so eat produce as fresh as possible and keep soaking and cooking time in water to a minimum. Cooked vegetables (soups, casseroles) can be healthy, but include a degree of rawness in your supply.</p> <p><b>Sourcing your antioxidants</b></p> <p>Vitamin C is one of the best-known antioxidant vitamins. Many people are under the illusion that they need 1,000mg a day, but the recommended daily intake to avoid disease is only 60mg. Consuming more than this can be of no real benefit unless your body has a greater than average need for vitamin C, for example if you smoke. Vitamin C is water soluble and the body cannot store excess amounts; if you consume more than you need, your body will simply excrete it. Many people take a vitamin C supplement because they fear there will be little of the vitamin left by the time the produce is eaten, after it has endured long journeys and possibly spent weeks in cold storage.</p> <p>While vitamin C content does diminish with time, if we shop regularly and conscientiously, following natural seasons as much as possible, we should be able to glean sufficient vitamin C from our diet. Frozen or tinned fruits and vegetables can be rich in this nutrient, as can some processed foods where manufacturers add vitamin C to food - listed as 'ascorbic acid' on some labels. While I support the addition of vitamins to foods where appropriate, fresh, nutritious produce is the best option - you're less likely to experience other unwanted substances such as sugar and fat.</p> <p>The main sources of vitamin C are fresh fruits and vegetables: a kiwi fruit or helping of steamed broccoli contains about 50mg and a large orange contains about 70mg. Other rich sources include: dark green leafy vegetables, red, green and yellow peppers, watercress, potatoes, especially new with their skins on, green peas and mangetout. Fruits: strawberries and kiwis, grapefruit and other citrus fruits, blackcurrants, rosehips, guava, mango, papaya, lychees, raspberries, nectarines and peaches.</p> <p>Bioflavonoids are particularly concentrated in citrus fruits such as oranges, tangerines, clementines, grapefruit, lemons and limes, especially in the peel, skin or outer layers of plants - so candied peel and mince pies have more to them than meets the eye. Wash the produce well to remove any waxes and chemical residues.</p> <p>Vitamin E is a phenomenally powerful antioxidant. Many people feel, especially my male patients who are worried about the prospect of a heart attack, that they need to take an antioxidant tablet containing vitamin E, but this is unnecessary. The suggested safe intake of 3-4mg a day is easily obtained from a well-balanced diet that includes vitamin E-rich foods such as avocados, blackberries, mangoes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, spinach, watercress, nuts and seeds, wheatgerm and wholegrain cereal, soft margarine and vegetable oils.</p> <p>Beta-carotene (converted to vitamin A in the body) is found in orange, yellow and green vegetables and fruits such as carrots, dark green vegetables, asparagus, peas, courgettes, leeks, lettuce (especially Cos), okra, parsley, tomatoes, peppers, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, apricots and peaches (fresh and dried), mangoes, passion fruit, papayas, plums, watermelons and yellow-fleshed melons such as cantaloupe.</p> <p>Lycopene (present in tomatoes) is specifically good at preventing prostate cancer. Men who eat 10 portions of tomato-based foods a week - this could be tomato sauce, a Bloody Mary (a glass being a portion), tomato ketchup, or tomato and mozzarella salad - can reduce their risk by up to 40%.</p> <p>Selenium is needed in tiny, but regular amounts. It is mainly found in foods grown in soil, but their selenium content varies. Modern farming practices have reduced the amount of selenium found in the produce, which has led to some scientists advocating a supplement. However, based on current research there is no call for this, as even the reduced levels of selenium are adequate. Selenium is also found in nuts, sunflower seeds, wholewheat bread, milk, hard crumbly cheeses, eggs, chicken, lean meat, offal, fish and shellfish.</p> <p>Plants contain the majority of antioxidant vitamins and selenium - so we need only add some zinc-rich foods to make up the complete antioxidant quota.</p> <p>Zinc-rich foods include shellfish, canned sardines, turkey, goose, lean meats, offal, Parmesan and other hard crumbly cheeses, eggs, wholegrain breads and rice, nuts and seeds (including peanut butter and tahini), wheatgerm and wholegrain cereals, pulses, lentils, green vegetables, dried fruits, passion fruit. You should ideally have a zinc-rich food three to four times a week - a portion being a couple of eggs, a chicken breast-sized piece of lean red meat or a small tin of sardines served on slices of wholemeal toast. If you know you've been cutting corners with your diet or been under a lot of stress (which increases the rate at which the body uses up antioxidants), include a portion of zinc-rich food every day to give your antioxidant levels a top-up. Keep water intake up to 2.5 litres a day.</p> <p><b>Improving cultures</b></p> <p>The end products of food entering our colons strongly affect the bacterial cultures and their activities. Scientists have recently found that certain bacteria which live inside our colon can produce Butyrates and other substrates which are thought to reduce the incidence of certain cancers and heart disease. This research is still in its infancy, but based on the evidence to date, it's prudent to include some bacteria (acidophilus and bifidus) in our anti-disease diet. You can take them in various forms, but I think they are most effectively absorbed from natural yoghurt. Look out for 'live' or 'bio' yoghurts with these substances. A good daily dosage would be 20mg which can be found in a small pot of yoghurt. For those with sensitive digestions, seek the approval of your GP before taking these bacteria.</p> <p>\u0095 Receive a free copy of Jane Clarke's Manifesto when you order a copy of Jane Clark's Body Foods for Life at the special discount price of \u00a312.99 (rrp \u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Credit card fraud soared by 40 per cent last year. Organised criminals using the Internet have fuelled the rise to a record \u00a3190 million, security experts warned. Consumer spending on credit and debit cards in December rose by \u00a3500m to \u00a314.5 billion, the Credit Card Research Group will announce tomorrow. One in every thousand of those transactions was fraudulent, according to credit security firm Apacs. The Home Office admitted last week that cyber-crime is booming. Counterfeiting is responsible for 10 per cent of total fraud, according to Apacs. The rest is believed to be due to the rise of Internet and telephone sales. Experts warn that a counterfeiting technique known as 'skimming' is more popular than ever. A genuine card is swiped through a card-reader, its data copied and used to make new magnetic strips for fake cards. Organised gangs, believed to have Mafia and Triad links, recruit skimmers, often in restaurants or petrol stations, according to the security firms. Up to 80 per cent of skimming is being attributed to Chinese Triads and the fear is that workers are recruited not just in Britain but also in their native country before they reach the UK.

      "body": "<p>The best of public service, the worst of public service. A week ago I finished my stint as a porter at one of the best hospitals in the land, St Thomas'. From the high-rise wards you get a stunning view of London: the Millennium Wheel, Nelson's Column but, best of all, just across the Thames, Sir Charles Barry's Palace of Westminster. </p> <p>But even in this centre of medical excellence, bang opposite the locus of power in Britain, too many patients too often were treated late, their care neglected, their dignity insulted, in a way that was tantamount to cruelty. That may seem like rhetoric, a wild exaggeration. See it for yourself, and you come away convinced: the reality of the NHS at ground level for the patient is bleak, an insult while all around them Blair's Britain - or at least the PR - shines and glimmers. At the Accident and Emergency unit, an agony of time wasted. A waiting room with dozens of patients nursing their misery in silence. Three hours. Four hours. Five. Don't misunderstand. If there is something seriously wrong with you - a horribly bashed head from a road accident, blood gushing uncontrollably - the nurses and doctors, the whole, wonderful system, will kick marvellously into play and you will be treated in the best possible way. </p> <p>The curse in the NHS is to be ill, but not life-threateningly ill. To have cut your thumb, not your artery. To have banged your head badly, but not crushed it. You go to the A&amp;E just to have it checked. That's when you have to wait. In the modern age, when you click on information in the twinkling of an eye, or catch a train or a plane and move around the world at a speed unimaginable to your parents, it is wrong, an insult to have to wait longer than an hour. But that, under the National Health Service, is a commonplace. </p> <p>Go to transport on the lower ground floor of St Thomas' Lambeth Wing. There you will see sick old ladies and dignified old men waiting... and waiting. The lifts don't work properly. There aren't enough wheelchairs. Hospital appointments get cancelled because there aren't enough staff, or they're sick, or too highly pressed. This is a scandalous perversion of the beautiful idea of a health service, free to all who need it. </p> <p>Go to the geriatric wards. The tang of piss, the soft, sweet decay of faeces are constants. That's not because the nurses treat their patients with contempt. It's just that they are not enough nurses. So, young as they are, they make grim and miserable decisions. I wheeled one old man down to X-ray even though he had soiled himself. The nurse didn't have the time to wash him. It's wonderful that the Government has given the nurses a bit more money. It's not so wonderful that this extra pay comes out of the NHS budget. That means more misery, more waiting, for the patients. </p> <p>A week ago, in The Observer , I noted the quiet heroism of nurses and doctors and patients. I noted their immense courage, but I accepted the status quo . On Tuesday something happened which opened my eyes. I had to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs about Kosovo. Yes, military intervention by the West ended the unbearable tyranny of a tiny minority of Serbs over the Albanian majority in that small province. We were right to fight. </p> <p>The proceedings were attended by five civil servants... one to film, one to take a shorthand note, and three to ensure everything worked smoothly. Reporters and academics drank free fizzy water. Below, a myriad of helpful policemen showed the way to the canteen. The lifts worked beautifully, the food was fine. </p> <p>And through the windows I could see the bleak tower blocks of St Thomas'. It was one of those striking moments in life. If public services can work so efficiently in Parliament, why is the same public service so bloody awful 200 yards away? It is, of course, unfair to pick on St Thomas'. There are many hospitals around the country, and GPs' waiting rooms, where the same story is so depressingly obvious that people have given up complaining. </p> <p>The Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, won't do much until he comes under pressure. The solution to the problem is simple. If our schools and prisons require robust and independent inspectors, then what is so different about our hospitals and GPs' surgeries? The country is crying out for an OfHealth - independent inspectors who can bring the NHS up to standard. If that costs more money, then so be it. Its first head could be someone like Robert Winston, whose elderly mother was treated terribly in hospital. No one in casualty should wait longer than an hour. No one should suffer three cancelled appointments in a row. The NHS inspectors should be able to say: this hospital needs money. </p> <p>Of course, Milburn, New Labour, and the rest of them in Westminster could do absolutely nothing about creating a new inspectorate to raise standards in the health service. But it is impossible to see life at St Thomas' and life at Westminster, and not come away with the impression that the people at Westminster are thumping hypocrites. And the patients across the Thames wait.</p>",

From the high-rise wards you get a stunning view of London: the Millennium Wheel, Nelson's Column but, best of all, just across the Thames, Sir Charles Barry's Palace of Westminster. But even in this centre of medical excellence, bang opposite the locus of power in Britain, too many patients too often were treated late, their care neglected, their dignity insulted, in a way that was tantamount to cruelty. That may seem like rhetoric, a wild exaggeration. See it for yourself, and you come away convinced: the reality of the NHS at ground level for the patient is bleak, an insult while all around them Blair's Britain - or at least the PR - shines and glimmers. At the Accident and Emergency unit, an agony of time wasted. A waiting room with dozens of patients nursing their misery in silence. Three hours. Four hours. Five. Don't misunderstand. If there is something seriously wrong with you - a horribly bashed head from a road accident, blood gushing uncontrollably - the nurses and doctors, the whole, wonderful system, will kick marvellously into play and you will be treated in the best possible way. The curse in the NHS is to be ill, but not life-threateningly ill. To have cut your thumb, not your artery. To have banged your head badly, but not crushed it. You go to the A&amp;E just to have it checked. That's when you have to wait. In the modern age, when you click on information in the twinkling of an eye, or catch a train or a plane and move around the world at a speed unimaginable to your parents, it is wrong, an insult to have to wait longer than an hour. But that, under the National Health Service, is a commonplace. Go to transport on the lower ground floor of St Thomas' Lambeth Wing. There you will see sick old ladies and dignified old men waiting... and waiting. The lifts don't work properly. There aren't enough wheelchairs. Hospital appointments get cancelled because there aren't enough staff, or they're sick, or too highly pressed. This is a scandalous perversion of the beautiful idea of a health service, free to all who need it. Go to the geriatric wards. The tang of piss, the soft, sweet decay of faeces are constants. That's not because the nurses treat their patients with contempt. It's just that they are not enough nurses. So, young as they are, they make grim and miserable decisions. I wheeled one old man down to X-ray even though he had soiled himself. The nurse didn't have the time to wash him. It's wonderful that the Government has given the nurses a bit more money. It's not so wonderful that this extra pay comes out of the NHS budget. That means more misery, more waiting, for the patients. A week ago, in The Observer , I noted the quiet heroism of nurses and doctors and patients. I noted their immense courage, but I accepted the status quo . On Tuesday something happened which opened my eyes. I had to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs about Kosovo. Yes, military intervention by the West ended the unbearable tyranny of a tiny minority of Serbs over the Albanian majority in that small province. We were right to fight. The proceedings were attended by five civil servants... one to film, one to take a shorthand note, and three to ensure everything worked smoothly. Reporters and academics drank free fizzy water. Below, a myriad of helpful policemen showed the way to the canteen. The lifts worked beautifully, the food was fine. And through the windows I could see the bleak tower blocks of St Thomas'. It was one of those striking moments in life. If public services can work so efficiently in Parliament, why is the same public service so bloody awful 200 yards away? It is, of course, unfair to pick on St Thomas'. There are many hospitals around the country, and GPs' waiting rooms, where the same story is so depressingly obvious that people have given up complaining. The Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, won't do much until he comes under pressure. The solution to the problem is simple. If our schools and prisons require robust and independent inspectors, then what is so different about our hospitals and GPs' surgeries? The country is crying out for an OfHealth - independent inspectors who can bring the NHS up to standard. If that costs more money, then so be it. Its first head could be someone like Robert Winston, whose elderly mother was treated terribly in hospital. No one in casualty should wait longer than an hour. No one should suffer three cancelled appointments in a row. The NHS inspectors should be able to say: this hospital needs money. Of course, Milburn, New Labour, and the rest of them in Westminster could do absolutely nothing about creating a new inspectorate to raise standards in the health service. But it is impossible to see life at St Thomas' and life at Westminster, and not come away with the impression that the people at Westminster are thumping hypocrites. And the patients across the Thames wait.",

      "body": "<p>Heavier lorries are set to rumble on to Britain's roads within a year in a controversial move that will enrage environmentalists and the rail industry. </p> <p> The Government's transport advisory body is expected to give the green light to the 44-tonne juggernaut becoming the norm for road haulage. Opponents of the move fear that lifting the limit again - it was raised from 38 to 40 tonnes last January - is the 'thin end of the wedge' that will soon lead to 50-tonners and ultimately continental-style 70-tonne 'super-lorries' roaring around UK motorways and towns. </p> <p> The Commission for Integrated Transport (CFIT), appointed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, is expected to present its report in late February or early March, arguing that increasing the limit to 44 tonnes will mean fewer lorries on roads. It is understood the Government is almost certain to accept the report, despite saying in its election manifesto that it was 'unpersuaded'. </p> <p> Sources close to the CFIT insist that it will support raising the limit on two conditions: that rail freight grants are boosted substantially and that poorly enforced laws on lorry weights, speeds, emissions and driver hours are tightened. </p> <p> Graham Smith, planning director at English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway (EWS), the US company that controls the UK rail freight market, said the move could lead to road haulage prices dropping by 15 per cent: he faced losing up to a fifth of his business. 'It would slow the growth we have generated and put at risk our existing business.' </p> <p> Meanwhile, the Government is expected to argue that heavier lorries will not cause damage to roads and bridges because their weight is spread over six axles rather than the standard five, and their size cannot increase. </p> <p> James Hookham, policy director at the Freight Transport Association, said the changes would mean 14 per cent fewer lorries on the roads since with denser goods, weight limits are often reached before the container is full. </p> <p> The FTA is campaigning vigorously not only for a rise in weight limits and a reduction in duty on diesel fuel, but for vehicle excise duty, or 'road tax', to be lowered to match continental rates. </p> <p>Hookham denied that the FTA wanted the limit raised above 44 tonnes. But Lynn Sloman, assistant director of pressure group Transport 2000, said: 'Freight lobbyists say, in evidence given to CFIT, that 44-tonnes is seen as a stepping stone to 50 tonnes. That is appalling.' </p> <p> Friends of the Earth and the Council for the Protection of Rural England claim traffic and road damage will increase. </p> <p> Tony Berkeley, chairman of the Rail Freight Group, said his industry would 'go beserk'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Heavier lorries are set to rumble on to Britain's roads within a year in a controversial move that will enrage environmentalists and the rail industry. The Government's transport advisory body is expected to give the green light to the 44-tonne juggernaut becoming the norm for road haulage. Opponents of the move fear that lifting the limit again - it was raised from 38 to 40 tonnes last January - is the 'thin end of the wedge' that will soon lead to 50-tonners and ultimately continental-style 70-tonne 'super-lorries' roaring around UK motorways and towns. The Commission for Integrated Transport (CFIT), appointed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, is expected to present its report in late February or early March, arguing that increasing the limit to 44 tonnes will mean fewer lorries on roads. It is understood the Government is almost certain to accept the report, despite saying in its election manifesto that it was 'unpersuaded'. Sources close to the CFIT insist that it will support raising the limit on two conditions: that rail freight grants are boosted substantially and that poorly enforced laws on lorry weights, speeds, emissions and driver hours are tightened. Graham Smith, planning director at English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway (EWS), the US company that controls the UK rail freight market, said the move could lead to road haulage prices dropping by 15 per cent: he faced losing up to a fifth of his business. 'It would slow the growth we have generated and put at risk our existing business.' Meanwhile, the Government is expected to argue that heavier lorries will not cause damage to roads and bridges because their weight is spread over six axles rather than the standard five, and their size cannot increase. James Hookham, policy director at the Freight Transport Association, said the changes would mean 14 per cent fewer lorries on the roads since with denser goods, weight limits are often reached before the container is full. The FTA is campaigning vigorously not only for a rise in weight limits and a reduction in duty on diesel fuel, but for vehicle excise duty, or 'road tax', to be lowered to match continental rates. Hookham denied that the FTA wanted the limit raised above 44 tonnes. But Lynn Sloman, assistant director of pressure group Transport 2000, said: 'Freight lobbyists say, in evidence given to CFIT, that 44-tonnes is seen as a stepping stone to 50 tonnes. That is appalling.' Friends of the Earth and the Council for the Protection of Rural England claim traffic and road damage will increase. Tony Berkeley, chairman of the Rail Freight Group, said his industry would 'go beserk'.",

It is too big a thing for that. But in Britain's brief democratic history, the report of Lord Wakeham's Royal Commission on Lords reform is a moment for the whole country to reflect on.</p> <p>This last week was the one when a committee of serious, intelligent people agreed that electing politicians was not good enough. Wakeham said he wanted the new chamber to be mostly unelected so it had 'a far wider range of expertise and experience', reflected all walks of life, was more independent and was 'representative of the whole of British society'. The inescapable conclusion is that his Commission does not think democratic election can provide a chamber of experienced, varied, independent and representative people. This is offensive but also, I fear, based on sound observation.</p> <p>The Commons has become a dull, whipped chamber, scarce on independent minds, with too few women and non-white British, and far too many people whose only skill is inching - perhaps I should say millimetering - up a greasy pole, having never worked with their hands or created a company or had a new thought in their safe little lives.</p> <p>Yet this, as any fule kno, is not the real point. Britain could very easily have a varied, independent-minded Senate by choosing a smaller total number of people by PR for a 15-year term, on a rolling series of elections, and paying them properly. If we wanted such a thing, of course. Instead we are presented with this strange paradox. The reformed second chamber is to be made deliberately illegitimate, in the sense of being mostly unelected, because it must not undermine the mystic authority of the Commons.</p> <p>Yet it is also to be 'broadly representative' of the country, both through its elected minority and in the majority of party-political appointees who would match 'the political opinion of the country as a whole, as expressed in votes cast at the most recent general election'. So we are offered a fresh chamber which will be more intelligent, more diverse, with more women and better qualified to oversee our laws and liberties, chosen independently of Downing Street - but also one which reflects the state of the nation. And this in order to 'protect' the dimmer, cowed, political hacks' chamber a few hundred yards to the east?</p> <p>It reminds me a little of my father's garden, when he once planted a stake to hold up a rose-tree; but the tree died and the stake grew.

Why? Because there is no New Labour ruling class. There are far too few reliable cronies to run a country, and almost none if you are also looking, as an appointments commission would have to, for people who have status and authority in their own right. Tony Blair has been hunting for Snarks, searching relentlessly for a new establishment cadre which is loyal and tough. But after much expense of smiles, hope, soap, forks and even railway shares, this hunt has been a comprehensive failure. Narks have been uncovered in some numbers, but of Snarks there has been, thus far, no sign.</p> <p>Robert Winston, the popular medical icon and New Labour peer, goes and tells the truth about the NHS to the New Statesman . He denies himself, but his words bite him back. Helena Kennedy, who once seemed to be the ultimate New Labour place-woman, a Blair baroness, turns on Jack Straw over jury trials in a display of magnificent, highly successful and gutsy disloyalty. Lady Mallalieu, ditto. Polly Toynbee, who has doughtily fought against knee-jerk oppositionism in the Guardian , goes to the Dome, and is appalled, and leaves no syllable unminced in saying precisely why.</p> <p>Much the same goes for journalists, actors, rock stars and business leaders enrolled at one stage or another as Friends of Tony. Given the size of the Government's mandate and the success of the economy, there are remarkably few reliable New Labourites in New Labour's New Britain. And so it would be in an appointed chamber. Look around and you will not find a group of respected, successful and varied people who would take a place there for 15 years and do what they were told. Life has moved on. Things aren't like that any more. It would be a chamber of Winstons, Toynbees and Helena Kennedys, feeling entirely free to air uncomfortable truths, criticise and rebel. Once appointed, why would they not? And just what, exactly, would they be expected to show loyalty to?</p> <p>Had New Labour developed and articulated a clear ideology of its own, they would have been able to look at it, measure themselves against it, and say yes or no. Jack Straw's latest idea, they could ask - well, does that fit with what the Government believes about society? But New Labour has deliberately eschewed the big picture and gone instead for a politics of 'practical' solutions to immediate problems, dressed in a cheery populism and conducted in a fluid, post-ideological world where there are no natural enemies or last-ditch positions of principle.</p> <p>And it has been exhilarating, no doubt about that; we have watched the New Labour tide flash at lightning speed across huge English mudflats, roar up previously arid conservative creeks and drench Middle Britain. How far can this spread? How wide can it go? But the trouble with having no natural enemies is that you have no natural friends either. In good times, you can draw in previously unimaginable allies to your grand coalition. But that same miles-wide, inches-deep inundation can, with equally extraordinary speed, streak away again. The moon tugs, the economy turns nasty, and there's a great sucking sound. The Matthew Freuds of this world will not stick around and nor may many of the voters.</p> <p>It is conventional, at such a point in the argument, to urge Mr Blair to be more ideological, clearer about the principles upon which his Government rests, and more realistic about who his friends and enemies are. I so move. But the truth is that similar trends are apparent right across the developed world and that one national party, clutching its Third Way in both hands, is very unlikely to remake, by itself, a coherent politics of the kind we had and lost in the twentieth century. While that is so, most people today are loyal not to political ideas, but to their own professions, experiences, institutions and instincts. The Government cannot rely on ideological loyalty, for that is Old Labour. It has power and patronage, but frankly its carrots aren't appetising compared to the money, status and prestige on offer elsewhere. A poorly-paid quango job? A seat in the Lords in return for obedience? A gong? (It has now become the fashion for journalists to leak their refusal of gongs, thus grandly awarding themselves a kind of superior, virtual honour.) Who needs it?</p> <p>So, when push comes to shove, Kennedy is a human rights lawyer, not a Labour Peer. All that huge crowd baying about New Labour's iron grip at the centre, its monstrously successful gagging of dissent, are completely wrong. Its problem is almost entirely the reverse, that there is no reliable new establishment and, from the health service to its anti-jury legislation, things fall apart, to the general glee of the chattering classes. Better, therefore, to turn back to first principles. Better to try to create a reformed democracy, on proper political, liberal principles, which is what Britain needs. If doing the wrong thing isn't going to work, you might as well do the right thing.</p>",

Once appointed, why would they not? And just what, exactly, would they be expected to show loyalty to? Had New Labour developed and articulated a clear ideology of its own, they would have been able to look at it, measure themselves against it, and say yes or no. Jack Straw's latest idea, they could ask - well, does that fit with what the Government believes about society? But New Labour has deliberately eschewed the big picture and gone instead for a politics of 'practical' solutions to immediate problems, dressed in a cheery populism and conducted in a fluid, post-ideological world where there are no natural enemies or last-ditch positions of principle. And it has been exhilarating, no doubt about that; we have watched the New Labour tide flash at lightning speed across huge English mudflats, roar up previously arid conservative creeks and drench Middle Britain. How far can this spread? How wide can it go? But the trouble with having no natural enemies is that you have no natural friends either. In good times, you can draw in previously unimaginable allies to your grand coalition. But that same miles-wide, inches-deep inundation can, with equally extraordinary speed, streak away again. The moon tugs, the economy turns nasty, and there's a great sucking sound. The Matthew Freuds of this world will not stick around and nor may many of the voters. It is conventional, at such a point in the argument, to urge Mr Blair to be more ideological, clearer about the principles upon which his Government rests, and more realistic about who his friends and enemies are. I so move. But the truth is that similar trends are apparent right across the developed world and that one national party, clutching its Third Way in both hands, is very unlikely to remake, by itself, a coherent politics of the kind we had and lost in the twentieth century. While that is so, most people today are loyal not to political ideas, but to their own professions, experiences, institutions and instincts. The Government cannot rely on ideological loyalty, for that is Old Labour. It has power and patronage, but frankly its carrots aren't appetising compared to the money, status and prestige on offer elsewhere. A poorly-paid quango job? A seat in the Lords in return for obedience? A gong? (It has now become the fashion for journalists to leak their refusal of gongs, thus grandly awarding themselves a kind of superior, virtual honour.) Who needs it? So, when push comes to shove, Kennedy is a human rights lawyer, not a Labour Peer. All that huge crowd baying about New Labour's iron grip at the centre, its monstrously successful gagging of dissent, are completely wrong. Its problem is almost entirely the reverse, that there is no reliable new establishment and, from the health service to its anti-jury legislation, things fall apart, to the general glee of the chattering classes. Better, therefore, to turn back to first principles. Better to try to create a reformed democracy, on proper political, liberal principles, which is what Britain needs. If doing the wrong thing isn't going to work, you might as well do the right thing.",

It is a little symbol of the degree of control Tony Blair's team normally wields. Most weeks the plans in the grid and the actual week's events bear a close relationship.</p> <p>But not for the past fortnight. As a Downing Street aide admitted: 'We have been firefighting. We have lost our grip.'</p> <p>The question being asked - hardly for the first time - is whether something fundamental is happening in British politics. Is this Government, about to mark its 1,000th day in power after a period of unparalled popularity, finally looking mortal?</p> <p>One member of the No 10 Policy Unit admitted: 'All governments are about a process of voter disillusionment. The job of the Prime Minister is to slow the process and the task of the Opposition is to accelerate it. Up until now, we have been doing pretty well'.</p> <p>But now the problems are mounting - with acres of bad news about the Health Service, Blair's personal poll rating, public spending, crime figures, the race to be London's mayor, reform of the Lords, jury trials, and the business dealings of Geoffrey Robinson. Disillusionment may finally have set in.</p> <p>One semi-detached Cabinet Minister spoke of a new bout of infighting in the Cabinet, in part attributable to the recognition that some of its members may have only 18 months at most left in their job. 'They want to leave a mark for posterity.'</p> <p>Another claimed that Downing Street's communications empire had been overreaching itself. Big picture messages have been undelivered. Others have been mismanaged.</p> <p>Yet a third Cabinet member, this one speaking from the Left of the party, disagrees, insisting that the public remains unmoved by recent bad publicity.</p> <p>There is division also among pollsters and academics over whether we are witnessing a turning point in Blair's fortunes, or simply a bad week at the office for an otherwise remarkably popular Prime Minister.</p> <p>John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University, sounds a note of caution by challenging whether the electorate was ever really hooked on Blair in the first place. Labour may have won a 179-seat majority, but it only secured 43 per cent of the vote on a low turnout.</p> <p>Curtice argues: 'It had the active support of less than one third of the electorate. In terms of share of the vote, it did better in every election between 1945 and 1970. In 1997, the Conservatives lost, rather than Labour won, and since the election Labour's biggest asset has remained the Conservatives.'</p> <p>Expectations about Labour have always been limited, Curtice insists. 'Over a year ago I did a poll for the BBC which showed most people thought taxes had risen and the NHS had deteriorated. That has been reflected in Labour's performance in real elections. In the European elections, Labour's share was almost the same as the Conservatives' in 1994.'</p> <p>But Curtice thinks Labour is now flirting with danger. 'For the most part this has been a Government that has avoided banana skins. It has avoided a serious disjuncture between what it said before the election and what has happened thereafter. The Bernie Ecclestone affair [which revealed that the Grand Prix overlord had made a large donation to Labour while lobbying for relaxed tobacco sponsorship rules] was very serious, and since then the past fortnight over the NHS has been the second most serious moment for the Government.'</p> <p>So long as the debate about the Health Service remained a technical argument over spending, Labour was unscathed, Curtice claims, but with the appearance of grim human stories revealing the failures of the NHS, the issue went critical.</p> <p>But Curtice, like others, concludes: 'The NHS crisis so far has not been so fundamental to the electorate's perceptions as the ERM crisis in 1992. Leaving the ERM overnight ruined the Conservatives' claim to be the party to run the economy. Labour remains the party of the NHS.'</p> <p>Nick Sparrow at ICM, the Observer's pollster, is less sanguine about Labour's fortunes.'Blair's personal rating is on the slide. It's not a blip. The perception out there is \"we voted for a change in the NHS and in education\", and the perception out there is that nothing, and I underline the word nothing, has changed.</p> <p>'After 18 years of Conservative rule, Labour had a difficult job managing expectations, just as the ANC did after the end of apartheid. Now, approaching the next election, Cabinet Ministers are telling the electorate \"we need longer\".'</p> <p>Reflecting a message to Labour MPs last week by Millbank, Sparrow - who also polls for the Tories - warned: 'Labour must be concerned that its vast army of soft voters will choose to sit on their hands at the next election. If turnout falls below 1997 levels - a distinct possibility, then the result could be very bad for Labour and not easily predictable for the pollsters.'</p> <p>Professor Anthony King, the respected poll interpreter for Gallup in the Daily Telegraph , does not detect huge disillusionment since, like Curtice, he does not think 1997 reflected a surge of enthusiasm for Labour. 'Many people seem to think such a huge majority reflects the high hopes of an electorate. In reality most people just thought Labour might be more honest and more concerned with the public services. Above all, they won because they thought they would be safe. As a result, they don't feel that let down. Ergo, it is rather hard for the Government to fall from grace.'</p> <p>King pauses and chuckles, adding: 'Especially since the only alternative is the Tories.'</p> <p>Two pollsters closer to Labour - Peter Kellner and Deborah Mattison - support King, rather than Sparrow.</p> <p>Following Monday's Mirror poll showing Blair's personal approval rating had fallen from 62 to 49 - a finding that rattled Downing Street - Kellner checked back to find a similar fall had occurred in the summer when the Prime Minister was under fire over his exclusive Italian beach holiday. His rating is undoubtedly lower than a year ago, but it tends to move around with controversies.</p> <p>'If you look at the tracking data on voting intentions, there has barely been any movement. If there was a seriously credible opposition, the Government would potentially be in quite a lot more trouble than at present.'</p> <p>Mattison, prized by Labour for her focus group work for the party, says some women perceive the Government as too male, but most of the chatterati criticism of Blair - over jury trials, for instance - has no wider resonance.</p> <p>But Tony Travers from the London School of Economics reckons a crunch point has arrived. 'After you have been in power for three years, it is very difficult to argue that you have not had enough time to change the direction of policy. It cannot be a coin cidence, however, that Cabinet Minister after Cabinet Minister is making speeches setting out their 10-year programme. They are trying to manage expectations about how long it takes to turn the Government tanker around.'</p> <p>For this reason alone Blair must recognise he faces potentially his most fraught period and the pressure in the first instance may come from the party. In a revealing question and answer session with party workers in London last Wednesday, Blair constantly referred to his personal frustration at the slow pace with which Whitehall worked. 'If there is one thing I have learnt in government, it is how long it takes to get things done,' he said.</p> <p>He tried to remind the party that it could not retreat on the policies that had won such a large Commons majority. He defended the decision to stick to Tory spending limits in the first 'two very tight years' by pointing out that the Government had been paying out more in interest payments than on the entire school system in England.</p> <p>And he admitted he was under sustained pressure to do more. 'I have a stream of people coming into my office - all of them with good causes and all of which cost money.' He then begged the party to remember that the Government was only halfway through the first year of a more generous spending regime covering 1999-2000, and the two years thereafter.</p> <p>But Mark Seddon, editor of the left-wing weekly Tribune , believes the defensive tone and pledge to increase NHS spending to the EU average marks a turning point. 'The wind is beginning to change. They are having to row back and drop some of these mantras about modernisation. A line has been drawn against further privatisation in the NHS and we now have a commitment to increase NHS spending year on year.'</p> <p>Yet Seddon remains as mystified as any about the precise origins of the Blair NHS spending pledge made on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme.</p> <p>Downing Street insists that Blair and Gordon Brown spoke last Saturday by phone about the NHS and agreed the idea. The Chancellor was in Scotland and Blair at his weekend retreat at Chequers.</p> <p>Some Treasury sources suggest the two only agreed to hold out the prospect of year-on-year real term increases of 5 per cent - something Health Secretary Alan Milburn had already suggested on the BBC's Today programme.</p> <p>Yet Blair was hardly forced into the idea under the pressure of cross-examination by David Frost. He offered the proposal, saying: 'If this July when we work out the next three-year [spending] period we can carry on getting real terms rises in the Health Service of about 5 per cent, then at the end of that five years we will be in a position when our Health Service spending comes up to the average of the European Union.'</p> <p>The five-year period to which he was referring was due to end in April 2006, although Blair got into a muddle over his starting dates. The whole promise was conditional on the performance of the economy.</p> <p>The briefings that followed led to a string of contradictory stories as to what the promise meant in terms of billions of pounds, adding to the sense that this was a pledge dreamt up on the back of an envelope in panic.</p> <p>The imbroglio pre-empted a large part of the negotiations over the Government- wide spending review due to be completed this summer. The other spending ministries had not been informed in advance of the pledge.</p> <p>It all left one disgruntled Education Minister saying: 'We badly need the equivalent of a flu outbreak in the classrooms.'</p> <p>Either way Curtice reckons the big story of the past fortnight is that public spending is back on the agenda.</p> <p>He says: 'Elite opinion has finally realised that the electorate had moved on from demanding ever more tax cuts. It is destabilising for Labour politicians who have spent years thinking such cuts are the only way to win elections in Britain. That may be the real significance of the past few weeks.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every day Downing Street staffers prepare a one-page grid setting out the Government's daily announcements for the week, and the other key media events. It is a little symbol of the degree of control Tony Blair's team normally wields. Most weeks the plans in the grid and the actual week's events bear a close relationship. But not for the past fortnight. As a Downing Street aide admitted: 'We have been firefighting. We have lost our grip.' The question being asked - hardly for the first time - is whether something fundamental is happening in British politics. Is this Government, about to mark its 1,000th day in power after a period of unparalled popularity, finally looking mortal? One member of the No 10 Policy Unit admitted: 'All governments are about a process of voter disillusionment. The job of the Prime Minister is to slow the process and the task of the Opposition is to accelerate it. Up until now, we have been doing pretty well'. But now the problems are mounting - with acres of bad news about the Health Service, Blair's personal poll rating, public spending, crime figures, the race to be London's mayor, reform of the Lords, jury trials, and the business dealings of Geoffrey Robinson. Disillusionment may finally have set in. One semi-detached Cabinet Minister spoke of a new bout of infighting in the Cabinet, in part attributable to the recognition that some of its members may have only 18 months at most left in their job. 'They want to leave a mark for posterity.' Another claimed that Downing Street's communications empire had been overreaching itself. Big picture messages have been undelivered. Others have been mismanaged. Yet a third Cabinet member, this one speaking from the Left of the party, disagrees, insisting that the public remains unmoved by recent bad publicity. There is division also among pollsters and academics over whether we are witnessing a turning point in Blair's fortunes, or simply a bad week at the office for an otherwise remarkably popular Prime Minister. John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University, sounds a note of caution by challenging whether the electorate was ever really hooked on Blair in the first place. Labour may have won a 179-seat majority, but it only secured 43 per cent of the vote on a low turnout. Curtice argues: 'It had the active support of less than one third of the electorate. In terms of share of the vote, it did better in every election between 1945 and 1970. In 1997, the Conservatives lost, rather than Labour won, and since the election Labour's biggest asset has remained the Conservatives.' Expectations about Labour have always been limited, Curtice insists. 'Over a year ago I did a poll for the BBC which showed most people thought taxes had risen and the NHS had deteriorated. That has been reflected in Labour's performance in real elections. In the European elections, Labour's share was almost the same as the Conservatives' in 1994.' But Curtice thinks Labour is now flirting with danger. 'For the most part this has been a Government that has avoided banana skins. It has avoided a serious disjuncture between what it said before the election and what has happened thereafter. The Bernie Ecclestone affair [which revealed that the Grand Prix overlord had made a large donation to Labour while lobbying for relaxed tobacco sponsorship rules] was very serious, and since then the past fortnight over the NHS has been the second most serious moment for the Government.' So long as the debate about the Health Service remained a technical argument over spending, Labour was unscathed, Curtice claims, but with the appearance of grim human stories revealing the failures of the NHS, the issue went critical. But Curtice, like others, concludes: 'The NHS crisis so far has not been so fundamental to the electorate's perceptions as the ERM crisis in 1992. Leaving the ERM overnight ruined the Conservatives' claim to be the party to run the economy. Labour remains the party of the NHS.' Nick Sparrow at ICM, the Observer's pollster, is less sanguine about Labour's fortunes.'Blair's personal rating is on the slide. It's not a blip. The perception out there is \"we voted for a change in the NHS and in education\", and the perception out there is that nothing, and I underline the word nothing, has changed. 'After 18 years of Conservative rule, Labour had a difficult job managing expectations, just as the ANC did after the end of apartheid. Now, approaching the next election, Cabinet Ministers are telling the electorate \"we need longer\".' Reflecting a message to Labour MPs last week by Millbank, Sparrow - who also polls for the Tories - warned: 'Labour must be concerned that its vast army of soft voters will choose to sit on their hands at the next election. If turnout falls below 1997 levels - a distinct possibility, then the result could be very bad for Labour and not easily predictable for the pollsters.' Professor Anthony King, the respected poll interpreter for Gallup in the Daily Telegraph , does not detect huge disillusionment since, like Curtice, he does not think 1997 reflected a surge of enthusiasm for Labour. 'Many people seem to think such a huge majority reflects the high hopes of an electorate. In reality most people just thought Labour might be more honest and more concerned with the public services. Above all, they won because they thought they would be safe. As a result, they don't feel that let down. Ergo, it is rather hard for the Government to fall from grace.' King pauses and chuckles, adding: 'Especially since the only alternative is the Tories.' Two pollsters closer to Labour - Peter Kellner and Deborah Mattison - support King, rather than Sparrow. Following Monday's Mirror poll showing Blair's personal approval rating had fallen from 62 to 49 - a finding that rattled Downing Street - Kellner checked back to find a similar fall had occurred in the summer when the Prime Minister was under fire over his exclusive Italian beach holiday. His rating is undoubtedly lower than a year ago, but it tends to move around with controversies. 'If you look at the tracking data on voting intentions, there has barely been any movement. If there was a seriously credible opposition, the Government would potentially be in quite a lot more trouble than at present.' Mattison, prized by Labour for her focus group work for the party, says some women perceive the Government as too male, but most of the chatterati criticism of Blair - over jury trials, for instance - has no wider resonance. But Tony Travers from the London School of Economics reckons a crunch point has arrived. 'After you have been in power for three years, it is very difficult to argue that you have not had enough time to change the direction of policy. It cannot be a coin cidence, however, that Cabinet Minister after Cabinet Minister is making speeches setting out their 10-year programme. They are trying to manage expectations about how long it takes to turn the Government tanker around.' For this reason alone Blair must recognise he faces potentially his most fraught period and the pressure in the first instance may come from the party. In a revealing question and answer session with party workers in London last Wednesday, Blair constantly referred to his personal frustration at the slow pace with which Whitehall worked. 'If there is one thing I have learnt in government, it is how long it takes to get things done,' he said. He tried to remind the party that it could not retreat on the policies that had won such a large Commons majority. He defended the decision to stick to Tory spending limits in the first 'two very tight years' by pointing out that the Government had been paying out more in interest payments than on the entire school system in England. And he admitted he was under sustained pressure to do more. 'I have a stream of people coming into my office - all of them with good causes and all of which cost money.' He then begged the party to remember that the Government was only halfway through the first year of a more generous spending regime covering 1999-2000, and the two years thereafter. But Mark Seddon, editor of the left-wing weekly Tribune , believes the defensive tone and pledge to increase NHS spending to the EU average marks a turning point. 'The wind is beginning to change. They are having to row back and drop some of these mantras about modernisation. A line has been drawn against further privatisation in the NHS and we now have a commitment to increase NHS spending year on year.' Yet Seddon remains as mystified as any about the precise origins of the Blair NHS spending pledge made on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme. Downing Street insists that Blair and Gordon Brown spoke last Saturday by phone about the NHS and agreed the idea. The Chancellor was in Scotland and Blair at his weekend retreat at Chequers. Some Treasury sources suggest the two only agreed to hold out the prospect of year-on-year real term increases of 5 per cent - something Health Secretary Alan Milburn had already suggested on the BBC's Today programme. Yet Blair was hardly forced into the idea under the pressure of cross-examination by David Frost. He offered the proposal, saying: 'If this July when we work out the next three-year [spending] period we can carry on getting real terms rises in the Health Service of about 5 per cent, then at the end of that five years we will be in a position when our Health Service spending comes up to the average of the European Union.' The five-year period to which he was referring was due to end in April 2006, although Blair got into a muddle over his starting dates. The whole promise was conditional on the performance of the economy. The briefings that followed led to a string of contradictory stories as to what the promise meant in terms of billions of pounds, adding to the sense that this was a pledge dreamt up on the back of an envelope in panic. The imbroglio pre-empted a large part of the negotiations over the Government- wide spending review due to be completed this summer. The other spending ministries had not been informed in advance of the pledge. It all left one disgruntled Education Minister saying: 'We badly need the equivalent of a flu outbreak in the classrooms.' Either way Curtice reckons the big story of the past fortnight is that public spending is back on the agenda. He says: 'Elite opinion has finally realised that the electorate had moved on from demanding ever more tax cuts. It is destabilising for Labour politicians who have spent years thinking such cuts are the only way to win elections in Britain. That may be the real significance of the past few weeks.'",

Gone are fields glinting with frost in the thin winter sun, and icicles dangling from barns. Gone are the frozen lakes, and warmly wrapped rosy-cheeked children skating on ponds. </p> <p>Instead, Britain is enjoying daffodils before Christmas, grass that grows throughout the year, and plants that bloom twice a year. Birds that used to be silenced by freezing weather now sing through the winter. Other birds that once migrated to Africa at the first sign of cold are staying put. </p> <p>Britain - or at least the southern part of it - is rapidly becoming a frost-free zone, according to data compiled by the Meteorological Office for The Observer. Global warming is heating up nights more rapidly than days, making it rare for temperatures to dip below zero. </p> <p>The figures show that the number of frosty nights in central England has already fallen by a third in the past 40 years. In the Sixties, the temperature dropped below zero on average 47 nights a year. By the Seventies, it did so on only 39 nights a year, and in the Nineties that has fallen again to 35. On most of those occasions it dipped below zero briefly and was not cold enough to cause a ground frost. The Met Office predicts the number of freezing nights will drop by a further 50 per cent in the next 50 years. </p> <p>One key indicator watched by climatologists is ice formation on the surface of Lake Windermere. Until the mid-Eighties, it partially froze on average on 10 days a year. However, no ice has appeared on the lake since 1989. </p> <p>Another key test of the severity of winter has been the date at which birds such as the song thrush and blue tit start singing again in the spring. Tim Sparks, at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, used to monitor the event across the country as part of a range of spring tests, but not any more. 'We had to abandon the birdsong tests, because they now just sing all the way through winter. We can no longer record it as a spring event. </p> <p>'We're seeing changes in two decades that you wouldn't expect to see in a lifetime. It's really quite astonishing. Nature is really confused.' </p> <p>As The Observer predicted in November, last year was the hottest since records began in Britain in 1659. The main reason, however, was not hot days but warm nights. </p> <p>'The nights are getting warmer at a more rapid rate than days - no one knows why, but it may be to do with the degree of cloudiness,' said Geoff Jenkins, climate change specialist at the Met Office. 'We're absolutely certain the decline in frost is due to global warming.' </p> <p>The death of frost - and generally warmer winters - has had a dramatic impact on wildlife and gardens. According to the National Trust, nature has been more confused this year than any other. </p> <p>Barry Champion, head gardener at Trelissick gardens in south Cornwall counted 125 plants in flower on 1 January this year - compared with 80 last year. 'It's the most advanced year I can remember,' he said. 'I had one plant flower in December when it's meant to flower in July. Other shrubs are flowering twice a year, in spring and autumn.' </p> <p>Across the country, snowdrops and daffodils, traditionally seen as heralding spring, were flowering before Christmas. At the National Trust gardens in Killerton in south Devon, daffodils appeared on 14 December. </p> <p>'We're certainly not getting as many frosts, and we don't have to worry about protecting plants from it in winter now,' said head gardener Andrew Mudge. 'There's virtually no dormant season now. The grass is growing all time, and we have to cut it throughout winter, which we never used to.' </p> <p>In the past few years, the Trust has started to cultivate oranges in more than half a dozen of its properties. 'The crops are not bad - we're getting a few fruit per plant,' said the Trust's head of gardens, Mike Calman. 'We're getting more of a continental climate - like this winter. I mean, where is it?' </p> <p>The decline of frost, and the milder winter, is increasing the range of plants that can be grown in Britain, but gardeners as well as environmentalists are quick to point out it isn't all for the good. </p> <p>'You don't get something for nothing. You'll get more pests and diseases which like warmer, moister climates,' said Calman. 'Also, if plants don't go to sleep in winter, a late frost can be devastating.' Last year, a late frost killed the Trust's entire crop of apples at Sizergh Castle in Cumbria. </p> <p>Dr Ute Collier, head of climate change at the Worldwide Fund for Nature, insisted the warm winters were a mixed blessing. 'Some people might think it's good for their garden, but we're also getting much stormier winters. The sea level will be rising, and we'll get more floods,' she said.

      "bodyText": "Michael Portillo has struck a secret deal with William Hague's second-in-command to clear his way to becoming the next Tory leader, according to a highly placed source in the party. The report of the deal, which underlines the bitter tensions at the heart of the Tory party as Hague's rivals vie for power, was furiously denied last night by Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude. It shows the depth of rivalry inside the Tory party, with Conservatives who were once confident they represented the party mainstream now fearful they are being isolated by the better organised and more determined right wing. The source claimed the Maude-Portillo pact was finalised in a Pimlico tapas bar well known as a scene of political intrigue. He said that information came from the boastful indiscretion of someone inside the Maude-Portillo political circle. But Maude said last night: 'This is absolutely, unequivocally untrue. I have never been to this place. I have never heard of it. Also, it would have been perfectly sensible for me to have dinner with Michael Portillo.

The deal was allegedly done in the Goya tapas bar, a favourite spot for plotting because its cellar restaurant is full of alcoves. The battle between left and right for the heart of the Tory party has seen a group dubbed the Pimlico plotters spending months working behind the scenes, trying to make sure every new Tory MP elected next year is from the Thatcherite Right. Insiders say they have a vast network of sympathisers in Tory seats where the sitting MP is expected to quit at the next election, and in key marginals. It has been built up through Conservative Way Forward, a pressure group backed by Thatcher and by the Democracy Movement, funded by the right-wing millionaire Paul Sykes.

With postnatal depression hitting at least one mother in seven, the findings will renew debate over the care of children in early years and provision of parental leave.

One patient was recently given ECT on a fixed table, and when he started vomiting they couldn't remove him quick enough to prevent him choking. He ended up brain damaged and permanently paralysed.</p> <p>Psychiatrists increase voltage until they get a twitching toe - a sign that, despite paralysing drugs, the body's nervous system is in major convulsion. The electrical storm raging through every synapse of the brain is meant to cure patients, although psychiatrists admit they have no idea how.</p> <p>Rebecca Jason (not her real name), a literature graduate, went through ECT about 40 times.

I had panic attacks for ages. It affected my memory greatly - I could no longer remember books, or quote from them, which I used to be able to.

Solicitors are preparing two class actions for ECT survivors who want compensation, and hope to force a ruling on its legality. Butterfield wants ECT banned for those over 65 or under 18 and pregnant women - but most urgently on forcing people to have it.</p> <p>Salter admits that, if people are given it against their will, psychiatrists should have to go to court to get permission. 'But for God's sake, carry on using it when it can save lives. Are we going to just let these depressed people die?'</p>",

One patient was recently given ECT on a fixed table, and when he started vomiting they couldn't remove him quick enough to prevent him choking. He ended up brain damaged and permanently paralysed. Psychiatrists increase voltage until they get a twitching toe - a sign that, despite paralysing drugs, the body's nervous system is in major convulsion. The electrical storm raging through every synapse of the brain is meant to cure patients, although psychiatrists admit they have no idea how. Rebecca Jason (not her real name), a literature graduate, went through ECT about 40 times. 'It was very easy for them to get me to agree to it, because I did not know what I was doing,' she recalled. 'It had a very profound effect on my ability to make decisions. I had panic attacks for ages. It affected my memory greatly - I could no longer remember books, or quote from them, which I used to be able to. There are certain things I've never been able to do since, like sew. I'm shaking all over just thinking about it.' Butterfield claims half those given ECT are harmed by it. Solicitors are preparing two class actions for ECT survivors who want compensation, and hope to force a ruling on its legality. Butterfield wants ECT banned for those over 65 or under 18 and pregnant women - but most urgently on forcing people to have it. Salter admits that, if people are given it against their will, psychiatrists should have to go to court to get permission. 'But for God's sake, carry on using it when it can save lives. Are we going to just let these depressed people die?'",

The Provos reveal exactly how the bodies were buried, in what kind of soil were they interred and even at roughly what time of day the burials took place.</p> <p>The questions were passed to the IRA two months ago and, according to sources close to the Independent Commission for the Disappeared, the Provos have answered 99 per cent of them.</p> <p>Seamus McKendry, spokesman for the Families of the Disappeared group, said last night that the replies were a 'significant breakthrough' in the search for the six remaining victims including his mother-in-law, Jean McConville.</p> <p>The questions included:</p> <p>\u0095 In what direction was the body buried - north, south, east or west?</p> <p>\u0095 What kind of soil was it, and were there rocks in the soil?</p> <p>\u0095 How deep was the body placed?</p> <p>\u0095 Did the burial party know the area, and did they return to it?</p> <p>The last question was particularly important in the case of Mrs McConville, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in Belfast 28 years ago. The IRA told the commission she had been buried at Templetown beach near Carlingford, Co Louth.

      "bodyText": "The secret graves of some of the Disappeared may be pinpointed by answers from the IRA to a detailed questionnaire drawn up by the Irish government. The Provos reveal exactly how the bodies were buried, in what kind of soil were they interred and even at roughly what time of day the burials took place. The questions were passed to the IRA two months ago and, according to sources close to the Independent Commission for the Disappeared, the Provos have answered 99 per cent of them. Seamus McKendry, spokesman for the Families of the Disappeared group, said last night that the replies were a 'significant breakthrough' in the search for the six remaining victims including his mother-in-law, Jean McConville. The questions included: \u0095 In what direction was the body buried - north, south, east or west? \u0095 What kind of soil was it, and were there rocks in the soil? \u0095 How deep was the body placed? \u0095 Did the burial party know the area, and did they return to it? The last question was particularly important in the case of Mrs McConville, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in Belfast 28 years ago. The IRA told the commission she had been buried at Templetown beach near Carlingford, Co Louth. But a 50-day dig by gardai failed to locate her remains. The IRA's answers about her have established that the burial party came from the north Louth area and would have had detailed knowledge of the beach. Digging for all six bodies is now expected to resume next month, using the answers to the questionnaire. 'I have no doubt that the Provos are telling the truth about Templetown beach,' McKendry said. 'These answers sound very detailed and very chilling. But this shows they [the IRA] are serious about locating the bodies. We are more optimistic today than for a very long time.' McKendry defended himself against recent criticism in nationalist newspapers that his campaigning style was counterproductive. 'I think the truth is that public pressure has forced them to return to this issue. Without the campaign these bodies would never have been handed over,' he said. The IRA has vowed to return the bodies of the eight people it has admitted murdering and secretly burying, and has delegated some of its most senior members to hold talks with the Families of the Disappeared. They include Brian Keenan of the Provisional's Army Council, Padraig Wilson, the former leader of the IRA in the Maze prison, and Bobby Storey, who is a close ally of Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.

The accident happened just under a year before our wedding and we continued with our plans and got married. Now, however, I am wondering if I have made a terrible mistake. The damage to his brain has changed his personality. He is moody, unpredictable and his career in marketing has been destroyed. He now works in a boring job with no prospects. I want to leave him but my sense of loyalty and my marriage commitment holds me back. I am still young and feel I cannot live the rest of my life with my husband. How do I leave without destroying him? \u0095 Write to The Observer Review at the usual address or e-mail kim.bunce@observer.co.uk. Views on next week's dilemma to reach us by Wednesday.

      "body": "<p>Dyspraxia. Try saying it. It is like speaking with your mouth full, or eating an egg with the shell still on it. The word is clumsy - like the condition it describes. Twenty years ago, there was no name for it. Ten years ago, it was still hardly known. It is only in the last year or two that it has become, as one mother of a dyspraxic child puts it, a 'popular' disorder. According to her: 'Dyspraxia is sprouting like broccoli...' Parents are rushing to diagnose (and misdiagnose) their children. Every classroom is likely to contain at least one child who suffers from it. Some experts claim that 10 per cent of the population is dyspraxic.</p> <p>It has been known by other names: minimal brain dysfunction; clumsy child syndrome; non-verbal learning disorder; deficits with attention, motor skills and perception (DAMP for short). These discouraging labels have all given way to developmental dyspraxia from the Greek for abnormal and doing. But what exactly is it? The more I heard (from parents at my son's school) the more muddled I felt. It sounded like a holdall into which all kinds of problems could be thrust. Was it exclusively physiological? Or psychological too? A first cousin to dyslexia or unrelated? Was it a scientific diagnosis for a clumsy child? Or a sop to parents whose children were not high achievers? And might I - excuse me while I sweep up that glass I've just dropped - be suffering from it myself? Does dyspraxia exist at all?</p> <p>Madeleine Portwood is author of Developmental Dyspraxia, an educational psychologist and chair of the Dyspraxia Foundation's education committee. She explained that dyspraxia is thought to be a neurological condition, the result of an immaturity in neurone development. 'Dyspraxia results when messages are not transmitted properly in parts of the brain.'</p> <p>Dyspraxic symptoms are usually evident within the first 12 months of a baby's life. Dyspraxic children do not reach their developmental milestones at the right time. As babies, they seldom crawl and walking is often seriously delayed (beyond 18 months). Dyspraxic children might suffer from some or all of the following: poor co-ordination, clumsiness, disorganisation, speech difficulties. According to Portwood, about 50 per cent of children suffering from dyspraxia can't co-ordinate lips, tongue and soft palate to produce the necessary sounds. It's not a problem with understanding, it is a problem with the production of language.</p> <p>Dyspraxic children may also have illegible handwriting, a short concentration span, an inability to follow instructions, a heightened sensitivity to noise. They may be fitful sleepers and prone to temper tantrums. They may avoid construction toys and puzzles, be slow to be toilet-trained and unable to pedal a bike. They may be messy eaters and find dressing difficult. A dyspraxic child might spend so long struggling into his PE kit that he missed PE altogether. And he would not be sorry to miss it: Sport is almost always a problem for dyspraxic children. They can be hyperactive yet physically inefficient - a floundering combination of fast and slow. And they suffer - eventually and inevitably - from low self-esteem.</p> <p>But take care! Madeleine Portwood warns that trying to diagnose dyspraxia by ticking off points from a checklist of symptoms is a bad idea. This is partly, I suspect, because we all resemble the character in Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat who reads a medical textbook and decides that the only thing he is not suffering from is 'Housemaid's Knee'. We tend to recognise ourselves and our children in lists of symptoms.</p> <p>But there is a more serious reason to proceed gingerly. Portwood points out that there is a considerable overlap between four developmental disorders. They are: dyslexia, dyspraxia, hyperactivity and autistic spectrum disorder. It is easy to be fooled by 'masking symptoms'.</p> <p>Portwood says: 'We do children a huge disservice by identifying one disorder and failing to see another.' Dyspraxia can only be accurately diagnosed by neurologists or by clinical psychologists, not by teachers or worried parents. Dyspraxia does not start as an emotional disorder but can easily turn into one. Children with dyspraxia are usually isolated at school. Portwood says that much distress can be be avoided if the dyspraxia is diagnosed early enough (preferably by the time the child is eight). It is a condition that will not get better on its own (nor will it get worse). Many sufferers find ways of masking the condition or circumventing it as they get older.</p> <p>I spoke to Alice Woodeson whose son had behaviour problems from the age of three. He was always having 'horrendous' accidents and was diagnosed as dyspraxic (80 per cent of dyspraxia sufferers are boys). Alice recalls the nightmare of taking him to see one expert after another to get her child's condition officially recognised: 'I was an absolute mess. I couldn't sleep. I'd sit up at night wondering how best to wangle my way through the authorities, to convince them that my son was not a performing monkey.' The dyspraxia diagnosis initially came as a relief. 'A parent wants a label to justify their child's behaviour.'</p> <p>But the child also needs sympathetic teachers. Schools are becoming increasingly conscious of dyspraxia. But many schools are unable to rise to the challenge posed by children with special needs. Alice Woodeson explains: 'Once behavioural problems kick in, you can forget the real problems. All I ever heard from teachers was everything Jamie could not do. It all got so negative.' She battled on, overcoming problems with Jamie which she manages to turn into black comedy in the telling.</p> <p>'Dyspraxic children hate having their heads touched. There were outbreaks of nits at Jamie's school and I used to have to take a torch and a nit comb into his bed while he was asleep. Or else I'd turn it into a game, putting nit-repellent stuff on his head and wrapping it up in Bacofoil. I'd do the same to my head and we would pretend to be aliens together.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she was fighting to make sure that he would not be treated like an alien. She painted a 'big lazy eight' on the bathroom wall so that he could stick his hand out and trace it (dyspraxic children have problems with crossing from the right to left sides of the brain. Many of their perceptual problems seem to be caused by a malfunctioning in the right hemisphere of the brain).</p> <p>Alice is chary now of saying her child is dyspraxic or of labelling him at all. She says: 'Every specialist has a different view depending on where their forte lies. It's a labyrinth. You investigate, you lose faith. And meanwhile your child is starting to fail badly.'</p> <p>There is nothing imaginary about Jamie's problems. But is there, I asked Madeleine Portwood, a danger that parents will be too hasty to label children who are in fact merely unconventional? To her credit (and my surprise) Portwood says: 'Children today are encouraged to fit into a norm. Long gone are the days when children were allowed to be eccentric, gifted... Now they are often wrongly labelled. I am very concerned about young children being put under the microscope...'</p> <p>So it is a delicate business. Diagnosis and misdiagnosis can cause more problems than they solve. And yet children correctly diagnosed with dyspraxia can be helped. Madeleine Portwood has pioneered a scheme for schools involving 20 minutes of physiotherapy a day to help with gross motor skills. Dyspraxic children also need to improve their spacial awareness, often with work involving a sense of direction. This is necessary before a child can progress with fine motor skills - and put pen to paper.</p> <p>Children can improve dramatically. Exercises can reinforce neuro pathways in the brain, help with organisational skills, behaviour and even IQ levels. Marcia Richmond has a nine-year-old daughter who was diagnosed dyspraxic three years ago. Marcia remembers going to a specialist bookshop to find out more. No one had heard of it. There were no books about it. Now dyspraxic literature is booming.</p> <p>Marcia Richmond feels her daughter has been helped by physiotherapy and perceptual training. But she is under no illusions: it is a long slog. The frustration of having a dyspraxic child is being able to 'see that there is a lot going on in your child's head that she cannot put in the right order'. The hardest thing for parents of dyspraxic children, she thinks, is to be 'patient and understanding' and yet 'demanding'. The most important thing is 'to show them they can do it. And not to give up yourself.'</p> <p>Is dyspraxia a modern condition? Portwood says that while it would always have existed, it is much more widespread now. There are social reasons for this. Dyspraxia often affects children who were born prematurely (they would not have survived in the Victorian age). Dyspraxia hardly exists in Scandinavia (the incidence is less than one per cent). Portwood believes that this is because children do not start school until they are six or seven and are more involved in physical activity than children in this country. In British culture children 'spend hours in front of a computer instead of climbing' and this does nothing for their motor skills.</p> <p>Many children are relieved to be described as dyspraxic because they feel they need no longer be branded clumsy or stupid. But this would not reassure Hugh Goodwin. His son reached the developmental milestones late. If Goodwin worries about anything, it is about labelling children. 'Labels damage as much as help. They introduce the divisive idea of healthy and unhealthy, well made and badly made children. These judgments deny our humanity. Everyone is a human being, rather than a successful human machine.'</p> <p>Some of the names in this piece have been changed.

He has been plaguing her for seven years.</p> <p>'All the while he's free, I'm under sentence, because I have to keep looking over my shoulder,' she says flatly. 'In the end, you will them to do something, just to prove you're not paranoid.'</p> <p>Stalking is the crime of our times. Barely a day goes by without newspapers carrying lurid stories of people haunted by crazed individuals. Last week, it was Zo\u00eb Ball, Barbra Streisand and Lynda Bellingham. This week it will be someone else. There is a joke in Hollywood that 'you're no one until you've got your own stalker', and, accordingly, the LAPD has its own 'stalker squad', currently co-operating with Scotland Yard in its search for the killer of TV presenter Jill Dando.</p> <p>The impression is that stalking is on the increase, although it might be argued that, as with rape and child abuse in years gone by, this merely reflects the increased willingness on the part of victims to go to court. What we do know is that in 1998, a year after the introduction of the Protection From Harassment Act, 2,221 were convicted of stalking. Just as alarming is the fact that detectives pursuing Dando's killer turned up 180 men who harboured unnatural fixations with her.</p> <p>In the US, the situation seems clearer. The term 'stalking' is thought to have acquired its present usage after Rebecca Shaeffer, a rising actress and TV presenter, was murdered on her doorstep by an obsessive fan in 1991. By 1994, 48 US states had passed anti-stalking laws and close to 200,000 reports were investigated last year under their provisions, one fifth of which involved celebrities.</p> <p>This time last year, the first case was brought to court under California's new cyberstalking law, after a man posted messages in online chat rooms, giving a young woman's address and attributing to her a violent rape fantasy which drew scores of strangers to her door. For a fee of $12, an online organisation will provide detailed information on anyone who has ever paid tax in the US. A 'stalker page' on the Internet provides a forum for enthusiasts. At a time when our casual invasion of each others' lives is becoming accepted as inevitable, the fascination with this uniquely invasive crime contains many ironies, but few surprises. It is the perfect crime for the twenty-first century.</p> <p>There is nothing new about the range of psychologies behind stalking, however. If you travel to meet Liz Hodgkinson at her immaculate house in west London, you find a smart, articulate woman with two grown-up sons and a successful writing career. Ten years ago, she wrote a book about the desperate obsession she developed with another student during her first year at college in the early 1960s, and whom she took to stalking. Only in the past year, she will tell you, has she freed herself from its grip.</p> <p>Leaning forward in a pastel pink armchair, Hodgkinson describes her first sight of John as if it were a car crash. He was older and more worldly and extremely good-looking, with long, floppy, 'Hugh Grant' hair (though she is amusingly quick to add that he was 'better looking - much better looking' than Grant). She started following him around everywhere, despite his lack of interest in her. She couldn't concentrate on anything else, failed her exams, became friendless and ill. This 'active phase' lasted for six months, but then 'went underground' for 20 years. During that time, she never saw him, but dreamt about him and would sometimes find herself overwhelmed by a sudden surge of emotion, thinking 'If I see that bugger again, I'll kill him'.</p> <p>'That's how strong it was. I actually think it blighted my life,' she says. 'It got in the way of relationships, because I was very frightened that it would happen again. I tried my hardest not to allow myself to go out of control, because I didn't know what would happen if I did.'</p> <p>Two decades on, she underwent a course of psychotherapy, at the end of which she resolved to track John down again, to resolve the issue in her own mind. She found him through an ex-wife. He had become an academic and was about to return to Singapore, where he had lived for some time. She badgered him into meeting her at the airport, now smiling as she confesses that she took along her passport, just in case. He looked old and ill. They chatted about the book she was writing, in which he would loom large. He admitted that he, too, had been marked by their original encounter, then he left. She heard nothing more of him, until last year, when she found his obituary on the Internet and the woman who had written it provided a final twist to the story.</p> <p>'She told me that he had devastated the lives of at least six other women. This kind of relationship was a pattern for him, too. My theory about stalking is that, often, you kind of recognise each other. Stalker and stalkee connect in some strange way.'</p> <p>Organisations such as the National Anti-Stalking and Harassment Campaign (Nash) strongly disagree with this theory. Why does Hodgkinson consider that she, personally, was susceptible? 'I think being very alone in a bleak and frightening place helped encourage the obsession. This is borne out by research into stalking. It becomes like an addiction. You know it's irrational, but you can't stop yourself. All I can say is that, even while it was happening, it felt out of character, as if some alien had taken me over.'</p> <p>The nagging thought occurs that this sounds a lot like falling in love. 'The difference is that you never really feel comfortable with the person you're obsessed by,' says Hodgkinson. 'You never feel able to relax. Even when you're having the most intimate physical, sexual relationship, there's always a level of anxiety there. And I think that's why you want to control them, because you think they're going to slip away from you all the time. That's why you want to know where they are every minute of the day. If you genuinely love someone, you don't need to check up on them all the time. A psychologist has since said to me that at the moment you see the object of your obsession, your whole imagined future life passes before you. But, somewhere deep down, you know that it will never happen, which further fuels the obsession.'</p> <p>The person who suffered most in Liz Hodgkinson's tale is her. Clearly, this is not always the case. Dr Julian Boon, a psychology lecturer at Leicester University, has been collaborating on a book about stalking. He identifies three distinct types of offender. The first consists of jilted lovers who refuse to accept rejection and embark on a cam paign of persuasion or revenge. This may account for roughly four-fifths of stalking cases, according to Nash.</p> <p>The second type suffer from so-called De Cl\u00e9rambault's syndrome, or erotomania, a delusional condition in which they believe their affection to be reciprocated, despite denials.

Finally there is the significant minority who act out of clinical sadism and represent many of the most extreme and disturbing cases.</p> <p>This pathology, according to Boon, is very difficult to 'put back in its box'.

Typically, her problems began when she showed kindness to an isolated, depressed individual at work. Also typically, he has since transferred his isolation, inability to trust in the world and difficulty in conducting relationships of any kind to her. 'It's like walking along the edge of a cliff, not knowing if today is the day that someone's going to push you off the edge,' she explains, quietly. 'He researched my family tree, neighbours and friends, so in the end you don't have any friends, because you don't want to drag them into it, too.'</p> <p>The Protection From Harassment Act has helped, she says, because victims no longer have to present evidence of physical violence in order to get injunctions and restraining orders, but, as Boon suggests, the sadistic stalker shrugs past legal impediment. Diana Lamplugh of the Lamplugh Trust which is involved in research and helping victims, considers that the law is adequate but the authorities have not yet learnt to apply it. Asked what conditions aid the creation of the sadistic stalker's personality, Boon ventures inconsistent and unpredictable parent ing as a decisive factor. 'If a father is going to come home drunk at night, let it be every night, so that the children know what to expect. The damaging thing is for your father to come home and for you to not know whether you're going to get a kiss or a kick. You come not to be able to trust relationships.</p> <p>'From the research we've done, these people tend to have been raised in an environment where they have not been able to trust any relationship and, as a consequence, the only way they can have a relationship is to have one which they can have absolute certainty about. And the only way to have absolute certainty is to have absolute, unwavering control.'</p> <p>A study overseen by psychology researcher Lorraine Sheridan suggests that one in five British women will be stalked at some point. The average duration of the stalking will be seven and a half years and 48 per cent will involve ex-partners, 40 per cent acquaintances, and 12 per cent antagonists who were previously unknown.</p> <p>As I flicked through a thick sheaf of newspaper cuttings on the subject, I found myself again wondering whether the problem is growing, or whether we have merely been blind to its scale in the past. At that moment, a particular image caught my eye. Printed in an mid-market tabloid, it was a full-length photo of an attractive young woman walking along the pavement. She is moving away from the camera, but with her head swivelled round, as if someone has called her name - which the photographer probably has. She looks startled, a little afraid and it took time to work out that I'd seen that precise look before, in voyeuristic slasher movies, and in downmarket porn magazines. Next to her is the headline 'PC forced to quit for stalking while on duty', and an accompanying story that is disturbing, but familiar. For the first time, I saw a chain of trespasses. The PC stalked her. Then the photographer stalked her. Now I am stalking her, reading details from her life that I have no need to know.</p> <p>Perhaps this is what's happening. The information revolution has merely added impetus to the rapid dismantling of the boundaries between public and private experience. When Oprah Winfrey told us we had a right to talk, that it was good to open up and confess, little did we know that this right would gradually come to be seen as an obligation. Add to this the commodification of celebrity and sex, and the idea that some poor souls might have trouble knowing where to back off and recognise the space between their own lives and other peoples' is not so very mysterious. My guess is that we had all better keep watching our backs.</p> <p><b> Victims of stalkers </b></p> <p>Madonna <br> Helena Bonham Carter <br> Jodie Foster <br> Princess Anne <br> John Lennon <br> Steffi Graf <br> Lady Helen Windsor <br> Adam Ant <br> Trevor McDonald <br> Stephen Hendry <br> All Saints <br> General Sir Michael Rose <br> Alice Beer <br> Gloria Hunniford <br> Bill Giles <br> Steven Spielberg <br> Cher <br> George Harrison <br> Julia Somerville <br> Sylvester Stallone <br> Rod Stewart <br> Elizabeth Taylor <br> David Letterman <br> Jill Dando</p>",

      "bodyText": "You can hear Tracey Morgan's distress in the patterns of her speech. Most of the time, there is a cowed, almost apologetic tone of resignation in her voice. Sometimes this gives way to accelerating anger, which she reins in quickly, no longer able to trust that the listener won't be alarmed by it. She was called Tracey Sant before she separated from the husband that her stalker, Anthony Burstow, plotted to kill. And she made headlines when she successfully prosecuted Burstow for causing her grievous bodily harm, despite the fact that there was no direct physical assault. Now he is free, having served only half of a three-year prison term. He recently changed his name by deed poll to that of her ex-boyfriend so as to dodge a restraining order and was discovered to have been keeping a diary of her movements since three weeks after his release. He has been plaguing her for seven years. 'All the while he's free, I'm under sentence, because I have to keep looking over my shoulder,' she says flatly. 'In the end, you will them to do something, just to prove you're not paranoid.' Stalking is the crime of our times. Barely a day goes by without newspapers carrying lurid stories of people haunted by crazed individuals. Last week, it was Zo\u00eb Ball, Barbra Streisand and Lynda Bellingham. This week it will be someone else. There is a joke in Hollywood that 'you're no one until you've got your own stalker', and, accordingly, the LAPD has its own 'stalker squad', currently co-operating with Scotland Yard in its search for the killer of TV presenter Jill Dando. The impression is that stalking is on the increase, although it might be argued that, as with rape and child abuse in years gone by, this merely reflects the increased willingness on the part of victims to go to court. What we do know is that in 1998, a year after the introduction of the Protection From Harassment Act, 2,221 were convicted of stalking. Just as alarming is the fact that detectives pursuing Dando's killer turned up 180 men who harboured unnatural fixations with her. In the US, the situation seems clearer. The term 'stalking' is thought to have acquired its present usage after Rebecca Shaeffer, a rising actress and TV presenter, was murdered on her doorstep by an obsessive fan in 1991. By 1994, 48 US states had passed anti-stalking laws and close to 200,000 reports were investigated last year under their provisions, one fifth of which involved celebrities. This time last year, the first case was brought to court under California's new cyberstalking law, after a man posted messages in online chat rooms, giving a young woman's address and attributing to her a violent rape fantasy which drew scores of strangers to her door. For a fee of $12, an online organisation will provide detailed information on anyone who has ever paid tax in the US. A 'stalker page' on the Internet provides a forum for enthusiasts. At a time when our casual invasion of each others' lives is becoming accepted as inevitable, the fascination with this uniquely invasive crime contains many ironies, but few surprises. It is the perfect crime for the twenty-first century. There is nothing new about the range of psychologies behind stalking, however. If you travel to meet Liz Hodgkinson at her immaculate house in west London, you find a smart, articulate woman with two grown-up sons and a successful writing career. Ten years ago, she wrote a book about the desperate obsession she developed with another student during her first year at college in the early 1960s, and whom she took to stalking. Only in the past year, she will tell you, has she freed herself from its grip. Leaning forward in a pastel pink armchair, Hodgkinson describes her first sight of John as if it were a car crash. He was older and more worldly and extremely good-looking, with long, floppy, 'Hugh Grant' hair (though she is amusingly quick to add that he was 'better looking - much better looking' than Grant). She started following him around everywhere, despite his lack of interest in her. She couldn't concentrate on anything else, failed her exams, became friendless and ill. This 'active phase' lasted for six months, but then 'went underground' for 20 years. During that time, she never saw him, but dreamt about him and would sometimes find herself overwhelmed by a sudden surge of emotion, thinking 'If I see that bugger again, I'll kill him'. 'That's how strong it was. I actually think it blighted my life,' she says. 'It got in the way of relationships, because I was very frightened that it would happen again. I tried my hardest not to allow myself to go out of control, because I didn't know what would happen if I did.' Two decades on, she underwent a course of psychotherapy, at the end of which she resolved to track John down again, to resolve the issue in her own mind. She found him through an ex-wife. He had become an academic and was about to return to Singapore, where he had lived for some time. She badgered him into meeting her at the airport, now smiling as she confesses that she took along her passport, just in case. He looked old and ill. They chatted about the book she was writing, in which he would loom large. He admitted that he, too, had been marked by their original encounter, then he left. She heard nothing more of him, until last year, when she found his obituary on the Internet and the woman who had written it provided a final twist to the story. 'She told me that he had devastated the lives of at least six other women. This kind of relationship was a pattern for him, too. My theory about stalking is that, often, you kind of recognise each other. Stalker and stalkee connect in some strange way.' Organisations such as the National Anti-Stalking and Harassment Campaign (Nash) strongly disagree with this theory. Why does Hodgkinson consider that she, personally, was susceptible? 'I think being very alone in a bleak and frightening place helped encourage the obsession. This is borne out by research into stalking. It becomes like an addiction. You know it's irrational, but you can't stop yourself. All I can say is that, even while it was happening, it felt out of character, as if some alien had taken me over.' The nagging thought occurs that this sounds a lot like falling in love. 'The difference is that you never really feel comfortable with the person you're obsessed by,' says Hodgkinson. 'You never feel able to relax. Even when you're having the most intimate physical, sexual relationship, there's always a level of anxiety there. And I think that's why you want to control them, because you think they're going to slip away from you all the time. That's why you want to know where they are every minute of the day. If you genuinely love someone, you don't need to check up on them all the time. A psychologist has since said to me that at the moment you see the object of your obsession, your whole imagined future life passes before you. But, somewhere deep down, you know that it will never happen, which further fuels the obsession.' The person who suffered most in Liz Hodgkinson's tale is her. Clearly, this is not always the case. Dr Julian Boon, a psychology lecturer at Leicester University, has been collaborating on a book about stalking. He identifies three distinct types of offender. The first consists of jilted lovers who refuse to accept rejection and embark on a cam paign of persuasion or revenge. This may account for roughly four-fifths of stalking cases, according to Nash. The second type suffer from so-called De Cl\u00e9rambault's syndrome, or erotomania, a delusional condition in which they believe their affection to be reciprocated, despite denials. Jed Parry, the stalker in Ian McEwan's novel Enduring Love , fell into this category. So too did the motorcycle courier who was reported to be plaguing Zo\u00eb Ball last week. . Finally there is the significant minority who act out of clinical sadism and represent many of the most extreme and disturbing cases. This pathology, according to Boon, is very difficult to 'put back in its box'. 'You can stop them doing it, but you cannot stop them wanting to do it. And they are incredibly resourceful: the range of techniques one adult might use is very wide and much more difficult to identify than with paedophiles.I promise you that with the range of techniques I am now familiar with, I could make you do anything.' Tracey Morgan is witness to this. Typically, her problems began when she showed kindness to an isolated, depressed individual at work. Also typically, he has since transferred his isolation, inability to trust in the world and difficulty in conducting relationships of any kind to her. 'It's like walking along the edge of a cliff, not knowing if today is the day that someone's going to push you off the edge,' she explains, quietly. 'He researched my family tree, neighbours and friends, so in the end you don't have any friends, because you don't want to drag them into it, too.' The Protection From Harassment Act has helped, she says, because victims no longer have to present evidence of physical violence in order to get injunctions and restraining orders, but, as Boon suggests, the sadistic stalker shrugs past legal impediment. Diana Lamplugh of the Lamplugh Trust which is involved in research and helping victims, considers that the law is adequate but the authorities have not yet learnt to apply it. Asked what conditions aid the creation of the sadistic stalker's personality, Boon ventures inconsistent and unpredictable parent ing as a decisive factor. 'If a father is going to come home drunk at night, let it be every night, so that the children know what to expect. The damaging thing is for your father to come home and for you to not know whether you're going to get a kiss or a kick. You come not to be able to trust relationships. 'From the research we've done, these people tend to have been raised in an environment where they have not been able to trust any relationship and, as a consequence, the only way they can have a relationship is to have one which they can have absolute certainty about. And the only way to have absolute certainty is to have absolute, unwavering control.'

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Kurt Weill Weekend</b> Barbican <br> <b> English Bach Festival </b> Linbury Studio Theatre <p>With grim precision, Kurt Weill's life spanned half of the twentieth century, from birth in Dessau in 1900, then flight from the Nazis in 1933 to death in New York in 1950. Just as we haven't worked out what that half-century of history means, so we still can't decide about Weill. A second-rate composer, or the authentic voice of his time? A radical experimenter, or a populist whose true home was Broadway? </p> <p>Our picture of the composer is fragmentary, not least because so much of his work remains unheard here. Some missing pieces slotted into place during the BBC Symphony Orchestra's Kurt Weill Weekend. In eight concerts over three days, we got one European premiere and two UK premieres. Rightly, the focus was on stage works, but there was no Threepenny Opera, no Mahagonny, no Seven Deadly Sins , although songs from the first two featured in a late-night Weill anthology belted out by Ute Lemper. While Lemper has immense charisma she has been singing her Weill tributes for over a decade, and the show had the high-gloss finish of a greatest hits (hers and Weill's) package. </p> <p>There were surprises elsewhere, however. A version of the operetta Der Kuhhandel (Shady Dealing) flopped in London in 1935 and has not been seen since; here we got Jeremy Sams's new translation of the German original. Sams's verbal legerdemain was well-intentioned, but its cleverness only made the piece sound like Gilbert and Sullivan. The satire, about arms dealers, politicians and the price of love, had some bite, and would have had more in 1935, and Weill's music was efficient, but with only occasional moments of characteristic pungency in a string figure here, a brass fanfare there. </p> <p>It was a coup to include the European premiere of The Firebrand of Florence, which opens with a number of such savage sarcasm that it might be a fragment of Brecht/Weill: a hangman, eager to execute the 'firebrand' Benvenuto Cellini, mournfully informs us that 'one man's death is another man's living'. This, though, is no Brechtian epic but an American musical on a grand scale. If it ended up trapped within generic boundaries, Weill's music being too subservient to Ira Gershwin's lyrics, it was well played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis. </p> <p>It was music from Weill's German period which moved me most. The Brecht settings, Das Berliner Requiem and Der Lindberghflug , proved as corrosive as ever, and the opera-ballet Royal Palace was an unexpected sensation. Iwan Goll's libretto offers a surrealist's take on the Eternal Feminine: the heroine Dejanira rejects men, wisely preferring life as a mermaid, and you couldn't wish for a more alluring mermaid than Janice Watson. Weill gave it the works, right down to the shivery tango that transforms woman into mermaid. Royal Palace was a highlight of a fascinating weekend which confirmed that, whatever the unevenness of the pieces, Weill tells us as much as any composer about the century we've just left. </p> <p>The English Bach Festival (EBF) quotes a eulogy from Stravinsky in its publicity: 'One of the most distinguished and valuable musical organisations in the world today.' Stravinsky died in 1971, so his 'today' is not ours, and nor is the EBF exactly cutting-edge, theatrically or musically. This week it occupied the Royal Opera House's subterranean Linbury Studio Theatre, alternating operatic variants on the Greek myth of Orestes. </p> <p>Handel's Oreste , dating from 1734, was the first of his operas to be premiered at Covent Garden, although it wasn't strictly a new piece: with Ariodante set to open thee weeks later, Handel cobbled most of it from music he had already composed for other operas. That needn't be a problem, but EBF has the quaint notion that the way to make Handel work is to attempt to re-create baroque stagecraft, including choreography. </p> <p>It doesn't work. Tom Hawkes's staging was gauche, Stephen Preston's choreography graceless and Terence Emery's designs tacky. The baroque era lacked the concept of kitsch, but this production had it in spades. The cast I saw was drawn from students from the Royal Academy of Music, and perhaps the main, professional cast might have imposed itself more, but it couldn't have made a silk purse out of this. Although Frances Bourne's Oreste was more than promising, the period-instrument orchestra looked and sounded uninvolved. </p> <p>It was mildly distressing to see elements of the same production serving for Iannis Xenakis's Oresteia , but if Alain Germain's staging was hardly adventurous, the music received a rousing performance under Guy Protheroe. With contrabass clarinet and contrabassoon growling angrily and a vast battery of percussion clattering mightily, energy levels were high, and the cast was clearly convinced that the ancient Greek text made sense. Gratitude, then, to EBF for this rare staging of Xanakis, a composer more respected than performed. When the same was true of Handel's operas, this Oreste might have passed muster, but it won't do now. </p>",

It was music from Weill's German period which moved me most. The Brecht settings, Das Berliner Requiem and Der Lindberghflug , proved as corrosive as ever, and the opera-ballet Royal Palace was an unexpected sensation. Iwan Goll's libretto offers a surrealist's take on the Eternal Feminine: the heroine Dejanira rejects men, wisely preferring life as a mermaid, and you couldn't wish for a more alluring mermaid than Janice Watson. Weill gave it the works, right down to the shivery tango that transforms woman into mermaid. Royal Palace was a highlight of a fascinating weekend which confirmed that, whatever the unevenness of the pieces, Weill tells us as much as any composer about the century we've just left. The English Bach Festival (EBF) quotes a eulogy from Stravinsky in its publicity: 'One of the most distinguished and valuable musical organisations in the world today.' Stravinsky died in 1971, so his 'today' is not ours, and nor is the EBF exactly cutting-edge, theatrically or musically. This week it occupied the Royal Opera House's subterranean Linbury Studio Theatre, alternating operatic variants on the Greek myth of Orestes. Handel's Oreste , dating from 1734, was the first of his operas to be premiered at Covent Garden, although it wasn't strictly a new piece: with Ariodante set to open thee weeks later, Handel cobbled most of it from music he had already composed for other operas. That needn't be a problem, but EBF has the quaint notion that the way to make Handel work is to attempt to re-create baroque stagecraft, including choreography. It doesn't work. Tom Hawkes's staging was gauche, Stephen Preston's choreography graceless and Terence Emery's designs tacky. The baroque era lacked the concept of kitsch, but this production had it in spades. The cast I saw was drawn from students from the Royal Academy of Music, and perhaps the main, professional cast might have imposed itself more, but it couldn't have made a silk purse out of this. Although Frances Bourne's Oreste was more than promising, the period-instrument orchestra looked and sounded uninvolved. It was mildly distressing to see elements of the same production serving for Iannis Xenakis's Oresteia , but if Alain Germain's staging was hardly adventurous, the music received a rousing performance under Guy Protheroe. With contrabass clarinet and contrabassoon growling angrily and a vast battery of percussion clattering mightily, energy levels were high, and the cast was clearly convinced that the ancient Greek text made sense. Gratitude, then, to EBF for this rare staging of Xanakis, a composer more respected than performed. When the same was true of Handel's operas, this Oreste might have passed muster, but it won't do now.",

      "body": "<p>The last time I was in Walsall was two-and-a-half years ago. I'd come to write about a pub. When I mentioned this to friends, they all misheard what I said. Their surprise, when I explained I was off to the West Midlands and not to some vodka-soaked dive in downtown Warsaw, was obvious. Walsall, let's face it, was not a groovy place to hang out.</p> <p>The pub was the first sign, however, that Walsall was changing. The Wharf was not just any old pub. Set on the edge of a newly created canal basin, it was designed by a pair of young architects called Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates, a duo better known for cutting-edge housing and quirky, original interiors than for gritty drinking dens. With its big, low-slung ceiling that caught the light of the sun glancing off the water, the Wharf was the first of a clutch of buildings in Walsall to self-consciously use high-quality design to promote urban regeneration.</p> <p>At the time, it seemed like a long shot. The redbrick warehouses and saw-tooth factories with their proud chimneys - the legacy of Walsall's nineteenth-century industrial prosperity - were derelict for the most part. Great swathes of the main shopping drag were boarded up. The place was dead at night. Right up at the top of the European Union's league table of economic deprivation, Walsall, the largest of the six towns in the metropolitan borough of Walsall, looked like a critical - if not terminal - case.</p> <p>Thirty months on, though, the prognosis is altogether healthier. Walking through the town centre, things have visibly changed. There is a bustle about the place, new shops have opened, trade at the Wharf is growing. There is still no cinema and no mainline train connection but a new bus station designed by architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris is almost finished which may bring some of the day-trippers who currently exit to Merryhill in to Walsall instead.</p> <p>The most obvious sign of change, however, is the huge building that looms up at the end of the canal basin, opposite the Wharf. This is the New Art Gallery, the project that kick-started the whole thing, raising Walsall's ambitions, and it opens to the public in a few weeks' time. The \u00a321 million gallery is one of the largest lottery-funded projects outside London. It owes its existence in large part to the energy and vision of a man called Peter Jenkinson, who arrived in Walsall in the late Eighties to run the town's Garman Ryan art collection.</p> <p>The 350-piece collection is an unexpected gem; a little-known and highly personal assortment of drawings, paintings and sculptures built up by sculptor Jacob Epstein, his wife Kathleen Garman and their friend, the artist Sally Ryan, and given to the town a decade or so after Epstein's death in 1959. Described as an 'A-Z of European art', the collection ranges from Roman busts to Lucian Freud portraits by way of medieval manuscripts and Rembrandt sketches.</p> <p>When Jenkinson turned up, the collection was housed above the municipal library. He quickly drew up a programme of events to attract visitors - children, in particular - which proved so popular that record numbers flocked to the collection's cramped premises and the seed of an idea for a dedicated building was sown.</p> <p>In 1995 he organised an international architecture competition. 'The whole idea,' Jenkinson explains as we look at the finished new gallery, 'was about looking above the horizon, about being aspirational - Walsall should have the very best.' What was surprising - astonishing, even - was the winner: Caruso St John, a small practice that had never built anything costing over \u00a31 million. At the time, both partners were under 40, making them also the youngest architects - by quite some way - to win a lottery-funded project. Ripples of excitement spread through the design world because they were known to be interested in a very different approach to architecture.</p> <p>Canadian-born Adam Caruso and Peter St John, his British partner, describe their work as 'critical' but in some ways it is the reverse. They delight in finding beauty in unlikely places, in ordinary objects. Where many architects seek to tidy the world up, Caruso St John is a loose architecture that takes its cue from its surroundings. 'Architecture,' says Caruso, 'is about amplifying what's there.'</p> <p>'The reason they won the competition,' Jenkinson says, 'is that they didn't mind having to build next to Woolies and BhS; in fact, they seemed to like the idea.'</p> <p>From the outside, the New Art Gallery is a seriously tough building. In profile it really is like a castle (complete with turret), an effect only heightened by its severe grey cladding. How on earth can this be a response to its setting? Caruso St John argue that the building reflects its environment (the cladding is terracotta - albeit grey - a material you see all around Walsall) without aping its surroundings. Just as Victorian buildings sit cheek by jowl with Georgian ones in the loose fabric of most towns and cities, they believe the gallery fits in - that it is different yet harmonious.</p> <p>And yet, if the exterior is severe, the first thing that strikes you when you walk inside the New Art Gallery is how rich it is, how warm and sensuous. Each floor of the building has a different finish. Sure, there is a lot of bare concrete on some levels (although even this is beautifully finished, with the imprint of the wood shuttering just visible) but elsewhere the gallery spaces are wrapped floor to ceiling in a skin of pinkish Douglas fir. Even the handrails thrill to the touch, delicious in a skin of leather. 'Each space is an experience. There's no over-arching rationality that makes it sterile,' St John explains.</p> <p>The spaces wrap around each other and you quickly lose track of where you are. And, weaving my way around, the feeling that comes to mind is from childhood - that sense of excitement tinged with fear that kids get exploring new places. Caruso St John liken the gallery to a house. And it is: like a big rambling country house, it is a mysterious building, a place that invites participation and adventure.</p> <p>Walsall is far from unique in using art as a catalyst for regeneration. Pretty much every major town and city you can think of has put in a lottery bid for a new gallery. Since the Guggenheim turned Bilbao from nowhere-ville to top-notch tourist destination, art has moved centre stage when it comes to urban renewal.</p> <p>In 20 years' time, how many of these buildings will still be around? Who knows, but my guess is not all of them. Visitor attractions like the Dome and Sheffield's Centre for Popular Music are already having problems drawing in the crowds. Besides the fact that it needs relatively few visitors to break even (Jenkinson has calculated a conservative 140,000 a year), what gives me hope about the New Art Gallery is that it is a building that people are likely to go back to - again and again. Entry is free so anyone can drop in as often as they like. With its restaurant, shop, conference room and rolling programme of exhibitions and education it looks set to become part of Walsall life.</p> <p>'The jury's out at the moment,' says Paul Hinton of the Walsall Express &amp; Star . 'Most people are really proud and amazed that such a big project has come to town. Walsall folk are fairly blunt. Most have seen it only from the outside and are not very struck. They are going to be amazed by the inside and the sense of space.'</p> <p>Will the gallery expand Walsall's aspirations as Jenkinson hopes? Certainly it will attract visitors - regionally, even nationally - and that will bring investment. The pub and the bus station were both built on the back of the gallery and both are high-quality buildings.</p> <p>The future is less sure, however. The gallery is certainly proving a catalyst for change: sites on either side of the canal are about to be developed. But, says Hinton, there has never been any consideration of the architecture. A standard retail estate is likely. OK, so it is real investment which isn't to be knocked but is it real investment in Walsall's long-term future? Perhaps if they'd looked above the horizon just that little bit higher, they would really have transformed Walsall into a groovy place to hang out.</p> <p><b>REGENERATION THROUGH ART</b></p> <p>\u0095 The saviour of urban life: today - thanks in large part to the way the Guggenheim museum has turned down-at-heel Bilbao into an international tourist magnet, and the availability of lottery money - art is the new religion.</p> <p>\u0095 In London, Tate Modern - the Tate Gallery's new \u00a3134 million South Bank outpost which opens in May - is transforming Bankside into one of the capital's most sought-after addresses.</p> <p>\u0095 In Newcastle, the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Arts - a \u00a346m redevelopment that will turn a 1940s flour mill into a new art venue - is nearing completion.</p> <p>\u0095 Sheffield is in the throes of building the \u00a313m Millennium Galleries on a site near the town hall.

His critics do not blame the former West Yorkshire Chief Constable for losing the drugs war, an intractable international problem, but they question whether he is right for the job.

The Department for Education also holds a sizeable interest through combating the drugs culture in schools. The Department of Health monitors general drug abuse and funds drug treatment centres. Throw in the probation service and the police, and you have a recipe for chaos. Poor Hellawell, by contrast, is armed with virtually no budget and few powers, save persuasion.</p> <p>The Hellawell critics say that Whitehall,in the current jargon, is all about addressing 'cross-cutting issues', subjects such as drugs or child poverty that span more than one department.</p> <p>This requires someone intimate with Whitehall, such as Moira Wallace, the livewire head of the Social Exclusion Unit, or someone with political clout, such as Mowlam, to stop the Whitehall fiefdoms hoarding their information, budgets and time.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office report, prepared by the Performance and Innovation Unit and smuggled out last month, in effect acknowledged that Hellawell was still not getting the co-operation he had been appointed to secure.</p> <p>The unit, much favoured by Blair, recommended the anti-drugs work of Department of Health and Home Office should be merged and 'as a first and very early step' their separate teams should be put under one roof.</p> <p>It also proposed Hellawell be given his own budget so he could showcase his favoured projects. Hellawell and the Number 10 Policy Unit needed to clarify lines of responsibility, the report said, so local Drug Action Teams, the bodies bringing local agencies together on the ground, did not receive mixed signals from the centre. Ian Robinson, deputy director of the drugs advice centre Release and a former action team worker, echoes this. He says: 'Trying to get co-opera tion at local level is one of the worst jobs in the world. You are hardly likely to get co-ordination if the co-operation at the centre is poor.'</p> <p>The Cabinet Office report also pointed out that some of the performance targets set by Hellawell in his first annual report in May were meaningless. The report pointed out that a key Hellawell target - reducing the level of repeat offending among drug users by 50 per cent by 2008 - was immeasurable since there are no incontestable data on crime committed due to drug taking.</p> <p>One Minister admitted the quality of much data on drugs in Britain was patchy. The Standing Advisory Committee on Drugs, the Government's official body, also admitted the information on treatment centres, NHS, voluntary and private, was poor.

One survey suggested 700 people committed crimes while waiting for treatment.</p> <p>A separate five-year survey for the Department of Health, published last June, found treatment centres were worth every penny. For every \u00a31 spent on drug treatment more than \u00a33 is saved on the costs of crime. Even two years after attendance at a drug treatment centre, the likelihood of a drug user committing a crime is greatly reduced.

Mowlam is being blocked by Straw and Downing Street who see any move in this area as the tip of an iceberg leading to the decriminalisation of cannabis. But the big issue in Whitehall is the debate on how to slow the use of hard drugs and how best to marshall limited resources to break the cycle of drug abuse and crime. Doubts are starting to be raised about whether Keith Hellawell, the so-called drugs tsar, appointed with much fanfare by Tony Blair and now in the second year of his three-year contract, is the man for the job.

The Hellawell critics say that Whitehall,in the current jargon, is all about addressing 'cross-cutting issues', subjects such as drugs or child poverty that span more than one department. This requires someone intimate with Whitehall, such as Moira Wallace, the livewire head of the Social Exclusion Unit, or someone with political clout, such as Mowlam, to stop the Whitehall fiefdoms hoarding their information, budgets and time. A Cabinet Office report, prepared by the Performance and Innovation Unit and smuggled out last month, in effect acknowledged that Hellawell was still not getting the co-operation he had been appointed to secure. The unit, much favoured by Blair, recommended the anti-drugs work of Department of Health and Home Office should be merged and 'as a first and very early step' their separate teams should be put under one roof.

      "body": "<p>A bombshell was dropped during talks at Downing Street 10 days ago between Tony Blair and the Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, interjected to inform the Ulster Unionist leader that the Government would carry out most of Chris Patten's proposed reforms of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p> <p>The RUC's name would be changed; its Crown and Harp cap badge would be replaced; the number of officers would be dramatically cut; and policing would be controlled by a new board that included Sinn Fein politicians.</p> <p>Trimble was stunned, say close aides. He had believed until that moment that the Government would dilute aspects of the Patten Report which Unionists hated.</p> <p>Trimble left the meeting seething with rage over the Government's willingness to implement the former Tory Cabinet Minister's recommendations more or less in full. His fury reached boiling point last Wednesday when the UUP leader launched his most bitter attack to date on the Prime Minister, accusing his Government in the Commons of 'dishonouring itself' over the RUC changes.</p> <p>Close allies say Trimble felt he had been betrayed. The First Minister had placed great faith in Blair and the Northern Ireland Secretary, providing him with some concessions as cover against attacks from the Right within the UUP. With the party meeting in three weeks to review its role in the power-sharing government in Belfast, the acceptance of the Patten Report was bound to undermine Trimble's precarious position as leader of Ulster Unionism.</p> <p>Pro- and anti-agreement unionists condemned the Government's decision; distraught RUC widows denounced the name change as an insult and the Police Federation of Northern Ireland even hinted that its members should reject the offer of the George Medal. His opponents within unionism can rightly argue that Trimble has nothing to complain about, that it was he after all who signed the Good Friday Agreement, a key element of which envisaged changes to the RUC. In short, Trimble, on whom the survival of the agreement and the Executive rests, is more vulnerable than ever.</p> <p>As one close friend of Trimble put it this weekend: 'If the Ulster Unionist Council met tomorrow, the anger over Patten would mean they would vote overwhelmingly in favour of pulling out of the executive now even before we see whether there will be any IRA decommissioning.'</p> <p>The UUP Council is set to meet on 12 February but the fate of Northern Ireland's fragile three-month old power-sharing government may have been sealed by then. General John de Chastelain, the Canadian sol dier in charge of the body overseeing the destruction of terrorist arms, returns to Northern Ireland this weekend following the death of his mother.</p> <p>The next two weeks will be the most critical he has spent in the Province. By the end of this month, de Chastelain must determine whether or not the IRA is making progress towards decommissioning weapons.

      "bodyText": "A bombshell was dropped during talks at Downing Street 10 days ago between Tony Blair and the Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, interjected to inform the Ulster Unionist leader that the Government would carry out most of Chris Patten's proposed reforms of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The RUC's name would be changed; its Crown and Harp cap badge would be replaced; the number of officers would be dramatically cut; and policing would be controlled by a new board that included Sinn Fein politicians. Trimble was stunned, say close aides. He had believed until that moment that the Government would dilute aspects of the Patten Report which Unionists hated. Trimble left the meeting seething with rage over the Government's willingness to implement the former Tory Cabinet Minister's recommendations more or less in full. His fury reached boiling point last Wednesday when the UUP leader launched his most bitter attack to date on the Prime Minister, accusing his Government in the Commons of 'dishonouring itself' over the RUC changes. Close allies say Trimble felt he had been betrayed. The First Minister had placed great faith in Blair and the Northern Ireland Secretary, providing him with some concessions as cover against attacks from the Right within the UUP. With the party meeting in three weeks to review its role in the power-sharing government in Belfast, the acceptance of the Patten Report was bound to undermine Trimble's precarious position as leader of Ulster Unionism. Pro- and anti-agreement unionists condemned the Government's decision; distraught RUC widows denounced the name change as an insult and the Police Federation of Northern Ireland even hinted that its members should reject the offer of the George Medal. His opponents within unionism can rightly argue that Trimble has nothing to complain about, that it was he after all who signed the Good Friday Agreement, a key element of which envisaged changes to the RUC. In short, Trimble, on whom the survival of the agreement and the Executive rests, is more vulnerable than ever. As one close friend of Trimble put it this weekend: 'If the Ulster Unionist Council met tomorrow, the anger over Patten would mean they would vote overwhelmingly in favour of pulling out of the executive now even before we see whether there will be any IRA decommissioning.' The UUP Council is set to meet on 12 February but the fate of Northern Ireland's fragile three-month old power-sharing government may have been sealed by then. General John de Chastelain, the Canadian sol dier in charge of the body overseeing the destruction of terrorist arms, returns to Northern Ireland this weekend following the death of his mother. The next two weeks will be the most critical he has spent in the Province. By the end of this month, de Chastelain must determine whether or not the IRA is making progress towards decommissioning weapons. British Government sources have told The Observer that if the general reports there has been no significant movement in that direction they will suspend the Northern Ireland Executive. The thinking goes that this will give the republican movement further space to sell the idea of decommissioning to the republican grassroots by the absolute final deadline contained in the Agreement, May 2000. 'It will go into suspension if de Chastelaine reports a default. The next step then is to correct that default and start the process again,' one British official said. Trimble, his credibility battered by the criticisms over his handling of the Patten Report and his misreading of the Government's intentions, needed to be sure there would be some sanction if the IRA failed to start the decommissioning process. Speaking at a UUP meeting in East Antrim on Friday night, he made it clear that 31 January was the real deadline for his participation in the government with Sinn Fein. 'We hope that those who are in a position to enable General de Chastelain to make a positive report on or before the end of January do so. If they do not, questions will be asked of their commitment to peace and political stability.' The IRA hates unionist-imposed deadlines. A fortnight ago there was a belief in Dublin and London that the IRA was moving towards making a gesture on guns via the one-off destruction of weapons and the sealing of arms dumps in the Irish Republic. According to senior RUC officers, however, those within the IRA leadership in favour of tactical decommissioning have been taken back by the depth of opposition to disarming anything. The grass-roots opposition to decommissioning was compounded by the impression that Trimble was calling the shots, dictating a deadline he set last November when he agreed to establish the Executive. 'To convince their base about the necessity of decommissioning, the IRA leadership have left themselves a mountain to climb. They have not been marketing decommissioning very well and the leadership don't want to take a gamble that could lead to leakage into dissident groups,' said one senior police officer. Despite the defiance over decommissioning, there is still some political pain for Sinn Fein if their IRA allies fail to deliver before the end of this month. Twenty-four hours after his bruising encounter with Blair in the Commons, Trimble travelled to Dublin for a far more cordial meeting with the Irish Premier Bertie Ahern. Although there were no public warnings from Ahern to republicans over the price they will pay for the IRA's refusal to decommission, Irish officials were making it clear this weekend that Sinn Fein would be blamed for the suspension of the Executive. Today, thousands of republicans will gather in west Belfast in honour of Tom Williams, the young IRA man hanged for the murder of an RUC sergeant in 1942. On the platform at Milltown cemetery, overlooking the republican plot where scores of IRA members are buried, will be Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, Joe Cahill, Pat Doherty and Martin Ferris. Suspension of the Execu tive may give Adams and his allies time to persuade the republican movement that a one-off act of decommissioning can reap great gains for Sinn Fein. But the Sinn Fein President knows that if the IRA decommissions then the sceptics will cry 'sell out'. Some may even try to steal the crown of Irish republicanism from the Provos by taking the ultimate step of re-launching attacks on members of the British Army or the police. The trouble for Adams and his colleagues is that those opposed to the peace process can point to the grave of Tom Williams, a police killer revered in the pantheon of republican martyrdom, as a source of legitimacy for a new phase of 'armed struggle'.",

      "bodyText": "The Government's policy on drugs was in disarray last night after it emerged that Mo Mowlam, the Minister in charge of tackling the problem, was at odds with Tony Blair and Jack Straw over moves to relax cannabis laws. Mowlam, who last week admitted she smoked marijuana in the Sixties, is 'sympathetic' to proposals that those caught for possession of cannabis no longer be jailed. She also believes it should be available for medical use. But in a sign of tensions at the heart of government over the drugs problem, Mowlam is said to be getting 'absolutely nowhere' with Home Secretary Jack Straw and Downing Street, who see any legal change as 'the tip of a dangerous iceberg' leading to full decriminalisation of cannabis. The dispute is part of a wider row across Whitehall about the effectiveness of the Government's anti-drugs policy, launched two years ago. A Cabinet Office study has implicitly accepted that Keith Hellawell, the drugs tsar, has yet to have the impact he hoped in Whitehall. It calls for merging the anti-drugs work of the Department of Health and the Home Office. The recommendation on lifting penal sanctions for possession is set to be made by a prestigious committee set up by the Home Office-funded Police Foundation and chaired by Lady Runciman, a former member of the Government's Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs. Appointed in October, Mowlam is the first senior Labour drugs spokesman to press privately for a change. The Cabinet Office report also admitted conflicting messages from central government on drugs. Some of the targets set out on the drugs tsar's national plan last year, including a commitment to cut reoffending by drug users, are simply immeasurable, the Cabinet Office found. Mowlam, anxious to stop inter-departmental jostling and inertia, is determined to raise the profile of the Government's anti-drugs effort. The campaign to allow cannabis use for medical purposes was given a big boost in November 1998 when the Science and Technology Committee in the Lords recommended that doctors be entitled to prescribe it. The peers said they found enough evidence that the drug was effective against the symptoms of MS, and in the control of pain. The committee, chaired by Lord Perry of Walton, warned: 'Significant numbers of sufferers are taking cannabis at present, in defiance of the law and without medical supervision or quality control.' But the Government rejected that report, despite support by the British Medical Association. Latest Home Office figures, for 1997, show that 45,362 people were cautioned for possession of cannabis, 18,000 fined and about 4,000 put on probation. Just over 500 were jailed.",

      "body": "<p>In the holy town of Bodhgaya, north-east India, the day starts at an ungodly hour. Before the sun has had a chance to burn away the early morning mist, thousands of pilgrims have settled themselves on to a patch of dust and gravel the size of two football pitches. They sit patiently, blowing steam from cups of tea, waiting for their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to begin his teachings.</p> <p>On the left flank, the Tibetan enclosure is a 200m-deep sea of saffron and gold robes and gleaming scalps; the right, the Westerner's side, is a colour-clash of hippy bags, shawls and personal FM radios (the teachings are broadcast in English, Spanish and Hindu). Ninja-style guards with rifles slung over their shoulders pace along the concrete fence perimeters. When a guttural mantra thunders out of the loudspeaker, everyone rises obsequiously and the Dalai Lama emerges from behind an elevated podium. The Tibetan leader climbs on to his gilded throne, eases himself into a lotus posture that somehow suggests both supreme regality and utmost humility, looks up, and, for no apparent reason, bursts into a peal of laughter.</p> <p>Fifteen thousand pilgrims and non-believers alike have made the arduous journey to Bodhgaya, a small, unbecoming town in Bihar, India's poorest and most notoriously lawless state, to listen to the Dalai Lama's teachings. They come from places as far-flung as Finland, Melbourne, Trinidad, Israel, Alaska and Plymouth, and together transform an area no bigger than a small English town into a holier-than-thou version of Woodstock. For two weeks, the streets throng with iron-calved rickshaw drivers, serene-looking monks draped in mala beads and shuffling Westerners mumbling Om mantras under their breath.</p> <p>The sight of doctors, New Age travellers, TV producers and advertising executives mingling with Tibetan monks is startling to behold. Add to this the desperately poor local Indians, the tin-pot beggars and lepers from neighbouring hamlets that besiege Bodhgaya for the duration of the event, not to mention occasional visiting celebrities Richard Gere and the Beastie Boys, and you have the most unlikely gathering of humanity you're ever likely to encounter.</p> <p>Bodhgaya is perhaps the most important pilgrimage site for Buddhists. According to the scriptures, it is where Buddha attained Enlightenment 2,540 years ago, after sitting beneath a Bodhi Tree for a week, meditating on the causes of suffering. Today, a descendant of the original tree is flanked by a majestic temple, the Mahabodhi Stupa, where a never-ending stream of barefooted Buddhists can be seen prostrating around its pyramidal spire.</p> <p>The spiritual charm of the place is captivating, yet, for many Western pilgrims, Bodhgaya feels like the most unenlightened place on earth. 'It may be the centre of the universe for Buddhists,' says Robin Stock, from Seattle, sipping a hot lemon and ginger tea in a bamboo shack called Caf\u00e9 Om. 'But trying to enjoy yourself here is like having a holiday in hell. Bihar is a harsh place in general; it's full of beggars, dust and dirt. Everybody I've spoken to has become ill - there are just too many people in too small a space.'</p> <p>From December through February, when Bodhgaya is overrun with pilgrims, the air quality is reminiscent of a London smog. The oppressive dust and low-hanging cloud is made worse by the stench of dried human faeces and auto-rickshaws spitting out diesel fumes; on arriving - assuming you make it past the infamous dacoit bandits who prowl for tourists on the main road from Gaya station ('In the event of a breakdown, run for your life,' say locals) - the first thing you notice is pilgrims with face masks of the kind worn by Tokyo commuters.</p> <p>There's little doubt that Bodhgaya is ill-equipped to cope with the influx of visitors. In many respects, little has changed here since the time of the Buddha. When the tourist season is over and the pedestrianised centre with its rows of phone booths and stalls selling plastic Buddhas shuts down, you are left with a desperately poor agrarian community. A stone's throw from the international hotels, farmers in threadbare rags steer ox-drawn ploughs, and clusters of women draped in colourful sarongs can be seen carrying water from nearby wells.</p> <p>The harsh conditions make Bodhgaya the ideal pilgrimage site for the pampered Western temperament. 'The teachings are all about how to see through these distractions, how to go through this suffering and keep a good attitude,' says Stock, who came to India with his wife after selling up and quitting his job because he was fed up of being 'crushed under the wheels of mediocrity'.</p> <p>'Every day you have an opportunity to practise what you've been taught,' agrees Coco, a 32-year-old dancer from New York city, who came to Bodhgaya for the teachings of Michael Roach, a former director of a diamond company who is now considered a guru among modern Buddhists. 'It's so easy to lose your temper here, and this whole teaching is about how not to get angry, how not to overreact, how not to feel hatred towards people.'</p> <p>In spite of the irritations and dangers, the number of Westerners coming to Bodhgaya increases every year. The majority are Buddhist sympathisers, who are here to see the Dalai Lama and to give their millennium celebrations a spiritual spin. But, more tellingly, the number of dedicated Western practitioners is rising, too. Most countries with a large Buddhist population have a monastery here in Bodhgaya.</p> <p>This year, all residential retreats and meditation centres are fully booked. Some, like Christopher Titmuss's, are subscribed twice-over: 'Westerners are sitting up and taking notice of Buddhism in ever greater numbers,' says Titmuss, who first came to Bodhgaya as a monk in 1974 and has been teaching here every year since. 'Ethics like non-violence, right livelihood, meditation, questioning of lifestyle, wisdom, loving-kindness, compassion are taking root in the West. Worldwide, there's a growing number of people who have a great commitment to the \"inner work\".'</p> <p>It's a trend that in recent years has coincided with the release of blockbuster movies Seven Years in Tibet, starring Brad Pitt, and Martin Scorsese's Kundun, and has seen the likes of Tina Turner, Courtney Love and Joanna Lumley flirt with the dharma. 'Underlying our modern consumer culture there's a deep sense of spiritual undernourishment,' says Keith O'Neill, a self-confessed dharma-bum from Sydney, who likes nothing more than staying up late in local chai bars sipping sweet Indian tea and debating the scriptures. 'That's why you see people from all walks of life craving greater self-awareness. We are beginning to see Buddhism not as some wacky Eastern religion but as a serious alternative to our waning spiritual beliefs.'</p> <p>The spread of Buddhism in the West does, however, present a challenge to the Buddhist tradition. Just as Buddhism has had to adapt to a series of ongoing struggles - including the Chinese occupation of Tibet, military dictatorship in Burma, rampant consumerism in Thailand, and an imminent power struggle for a successor to the Dalai Lama - it also has to be careful as it interfaces with Western culture, inclined, as it is, more towards profit than purification. 'The gulf can be bridged,' says Renuka Singh, who has edited several Buddhist texts. 'You need a lot of wisdom to synthesise the two, but it's essentially your attitude to materialism that counts, not actually renouncing it.'</p> <p>When it comes to marriages between the East and the West, Bodhgaya plays host to the most spectacular and controversial. Take a bumpy rickshaw ride to a fenced-off enclosure on the outskirts of town and you'll find the HQ of the Maitreya Project, which plans to build a Buddha statue that will cost $150m. At 500ft tall, it will be the largest monument in the world and in terms of engineering, the most challenging. Already, over $2m (mostly from Taiwanese benefactors) has been spent on preparing land, commissioning design consultants, social impact studies and building prototype statues. The founder of the idea, the late Tibetan Lama Thubten Yeshe, took this East/West partnership to the extreme, by apparently choosing a Western rebirth. His reincarnation, a 14-year-old Spanish boy, Lama Tenzin Osel Rinpoche, now gives his full support to this vast scheme.</p> <p>Lord Maitreya is believed to be the future Buddha who stands for loving-kindness and compassion, and who will himself attain Enlightenment in Bodhgaya. Merely glimpsing this statue, according to Maitreya Project director Peter Kedge, will leave a karmic imprint that will have untold positive repercussions in this and future lives. 'All who help build it, and that includes the benefactors, will make enough merit to get a higher rebirth, and maybe become one of Maitreya's disciples,' says Kedge.</p> <p>'By building this monument, we will give people the chance to make a connection with Maitreya Buddha,' says Kedge. 'Understanding more about Maitreya, being inspired by what will be an incredibly beautiful monument, will also help to promote compassion and concern for others.'</p> <p>As you'd expect, few people in Bodhgaya disagree with the spiritual intent behind the construction of a Buddha, which will be so big it'll be the equivalent of an ant looking up at a human. But as the costs of the statue have increased over time, so too have the voices of concern, and in recent weeks Kedge and fellow directors have acted to stave off an unholy row by organising a meeting with local villagers and aid workers. 'We are keen to involve local people at every level in this project,' insists Kedge, who is beginning to sound like a reincarnated Peter Mandelson fielding questions about the millenium Dome.</p> <p>Still, there are those for whom the costs are simply too much, and who feel it is against the original teachings of the Buddha. 'It's the imposition of materialism on the Buddhist tradition,' says Titmuss, who has been protesting against the project since its inception, when it was set to cost a mere $5 million. 'Is it wise and compassionate to build and spend $150m on a huge statue, stuck up there in the clouds half the time, when down at ground level there is such desperate poverty - a poverty, which, by Indian standards, is the worst anywhere?'</p> <p>Kedge answers the Maitreya Project's critics by saying it is committed to social work in the area. It has promised to build an international standard hospital, a conference and training centre, and to develop a school up to university level. Already, Kedge points out, the project has created jobs, and will continue to do so even after completion, when the local infrastructure develops to accommodate tourists.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Bodhgaya resident Vinay Bhai believes it amounts to crass marketing of religion coated in a thin veil of social responsibility. 'The literacy rate in some parts of Bodhgaya is as low as one per cent,' says Bhai, who heads the Forum of Village Republics, which claims to represent local organisations opposed to the plan. 'We'd much rather time, energy and money go into widescale education projects or helping eradicate polio... Our fear is that when our poor farmer and his child gaze at this huge statue he will not see the future Buddha, but will be ashamed of his smallness.'</p> <p>Size, according to the Maitreya Project's promotional brochure, matters, citing a tradition in Buddhism to build large monuments: 'The bigger the statue, the more people will come and see [it]... and the more sentient beings will benefit. While it is extremely important to provide food, medicine, education and shelter for the poor, this is not the main method of ending their suffering...' it goes on to say.</p> <p>Not all Buddhists are convinced. Two kilometres out of town, along a crater-filled path lined with spice-merchants and fruit-sellers, you come to a clay-hut village called Mutcharim. It's here that Rahul Sankrityayan, a Theravada monk, set up the Vajra Bodhi Society to help educate children of the poor. Sankrityayan shows me around the inside of a half-built tenement which passes as a school and somehow manages to double up as an orphanage. Construction work stopped when funds ran dry last year. 'Just 150 children from 10 villages are educated here,' he says. 'When you think it costs $30 a year to educate a child in Bodhgaya, and the cost of this Maitreya Project, think what more could be done.'</p> <p>After dusk, inside the marquee that holds a prototype of the Maitreya statue, it's business as usual for the 500 or so young Tibetan monks and nuns and a scattering of Westerners gathered for a puja (prayer offering). Sitting in perfect lotus position, they unravel long haunting mantras. The front row of monks rocks from side to side as if moving in time to an inaudible beat. Decked out in claret garb, and sporting skinheads and mischievous grins, they could easily pass as West Ham supporters circa 1984. The Indian coach drivers who brought us here stand around impatiently swigging rum, intermittently revving their engines, beeping their horns, or drowning out the monks' chorus with blasts of saccharine Indian pop.</p> <p>Eva, a businesswoman on pilgrimage from Melbourne, rests her prayer book on her lap and looks up at the prototype statue. 'I wish them all the luck in the world for this. Even if people have no faith at all in Buddhism, just to see this thing will help them in future lives,' she says. 'I just wish it was more modest. I agree with the Dalai Lama. He says it's a very courageous undertaking - I read that as a euphemism for saying it's just too ambitious.'</p>",

Add to this the desperately poor local Indians, the tin-pot beggars and lepers from neighbouring hamlets that besiege Bodhgaya for the duration of the event, not to mention occasional visiting celebrities Richard Gere and the Beastie Boys, and you have the most unlikely gathering of humanity you're ever likely to encounter. Bodhgaya is perhaps the most important pilgrimage site for Buddhists. According to the scriptures, it is where Buddha attained Enlightenment 2,540 years ago, after sitting beneath a Bodhi Tree for a week, meditating on the causes of suffering. Today, a descendant of the original tree is flanked by a majestic temple, the Mahabodhi Stupa, where a never-ending stream of barefooted Buddhists can be seen prostrating around its pyramidal spire. The spiritual charm of the place is captivating, yet, for many Western pilgrims, Bodhgaya feels like the most unenlightened place on earth. 'It may be the centre of the universe for Buddhists,' says Robin Stock, from Seattle, sipping a hot lemon and ginger tea in a bamboo shack called Caf\u00e9 Om. 'But trying to enjoy yourself here is like having a holiday in hell. Bihar is a harsh place in general; it's full of beggars, dust and dirt. Everybody I've spoken to has become ill - there are just too many people in too small a space.' From December through February, when Bodhgaya is overrun with pilgrims, the air quality is reminiscent of a London smog. The oppressive dust and low-hanging cloud is made worse by the stench of dried human faeces and auto-rickshaws spitting out diesel fumes; on arriving - assuming you make it past the infamous dacoit bandits who prowl for tourists on the main road from Gaya station ('In the event of a breakdown, run for your life,' say locals) - the first thing you notice is pilgrims with face masks of the kind worn by Tokyo commuters. There's little doubt that Bodhgaya is ill-equipped to cope with the influx of visitors. In many respects, little has changed here since the time of the Buddha. When the tourist season is over and the pedestrianised centre with its rows of phone booths and stalls selling plastic Buddhas shuts down, you are left with a desperately poor agrarian community. A stone's throw from the international hotels, farmers in threadbare rags steer ox-drawn ploughs, and clusters of women draped in colourful sarongs can be seen carrying water from nearby wells. The harsh conditions make Bodhgaya the ideal pilgrimage site for the pampered Western temperament. 'The teachings are all about how to see through these distractions, how to go through this suffering and keep a good attitude,' says Stock, who came to India with his wife after selling up and quitting his job because he was fed up of being 'crushed under the wheels of mediocrity'. 'Every day you have an opportunity to practise what you've been taught,' agrees Coco, a 32-year-old dancer from New York city, who came to Bodhgaya for the teachings of Michael Roach, a former director of a diamond company who is now considered a guru among modern Buddhists. 'It's so easy to lose your temper here, and this whole teaching is about how not to get angry, how not to overreact, how not to feel hatred towards people.' In spite of the irritations and dangers, the number of Westerners coming to Bodhgaya increases every year. The majority are Buddhist sympathisers, who are here to see the Dalai Lama and to give their millennium celebrations a spiritual spin. But, more tellingly, the number of dedicated Western practitioners is rising, too. Most countries with a large Buddhist population have a monastery here in Bodhgaya. This year, all residential retreats and meditation centres are fully booked. Some, like Christopher Titmuss's, are subscribed twice-over: 'Westerners are sitting up and taking notice of Buddhism in ever greater numbers,' says Titmuss, who first came to Bodhgaya as a monk in 1974 and has been teaching here every year since. 'Ethics like non-violence, right livelihood, meditation, questioning of lifestyle, wisdom, loving-kindness, compassion are taking root in the West. Worldwide, there's a growing number of people who have a great commitment to the \"inner work\".' It's a trend that in recent years has coincided with the release of blockbuster movies Seven Years in Tibet, starring Brad Pitt, and Martin Scorsese's Kundun, and has seen the likes of Tina Turner, Courtney Love and Joanna Lumley flirt with the dharma. 'Underlying our modern consumer culture there's a deep sense of spiritual undernourishment,' says Keith O'Neill, a self-confessed dharma-bum from Sydney, who likes nothing more than staying up late in local chai bars sipping sweet Indian tea and debating the scriptures. 'That's why you see people from all walks of life craving greater self-awareness. We are beginning to see Buddhism not as some wacky Eastern religion but as a serious alternative to our waning spiritual beliefs.' The spread of Buddhism in the West does, however, present a challenge to the Buddhist tradition. Just as Buddhism has had to adapt to a series of ongoing struggles - including the Chinese occupation of Tibet, military dictatorship in Burma, rampant consumerism in Thailand, and an imminent power struggle for a successor to the Dalai Lama - it also has to be careful as it interfaces with Western culture, inclined, as it is, more towards profit than purification. 'The gulf can be bridged,' says Renuka Singh, who has edited several Buddhist texts. 'You need a lot of wisdom to synthesise the two, but it's essentially your attitude to materialism that counts, not actually renouncing it.' When it comes to marriages between the East and the West, Bodhgaya plays host to the most spectacular and controversial. Take a bumpy rickshaw ride to a fenced-off enclosure on the outskirts of town and you'll find the HQ of the Maitreya Project, which plans to build a Buddha statue that will cost $150m. At 500ft tall, it will be the largest monument in the world and in terms of engineering, the most challenging. Already, over $2m (mostly from Taiwanese benefactors) has been spent on preparing land, commissioning design consultants, social impact studies and building prototype statues. The founder of the idea, the late Tibetan Lama Thubten Yeshe, took this East/West partnership to the extreme, by apparently choosing a Western rebirth. His reincarnation, a 14-year-old Spanish boy, Lama Tenzin Osel Rinpoche, now gives his full support to this vast scheme. Lord Maitreya is believed to be the future Buddha who stands for loving-kindness and compassion, and who will himself attain Enlightenment in Bodhgaya. Merely glimpsing this statue, according to Maitreya Project director Peter Kedge, will leave a karmic imprint that will have untold positive repercussions in this and future lives. 'All who help build it, and that includes the benefactors, will make enough merit to get a higher rebirth, and maybe become one of Maitreya's disciples,' says Kedge. 'By building this monument, we will give people the chance to make a connection with Maitreya Buddha,' says Kedge. 'Understanding more about Maitreya, being inspired by what will be an incredibly beautiful monument, will also help to promote compassion and concern for others.' As you'd expect, few people in Bodhgaya disagree with the spiritual intent behind the construction of a Buddha, which will be so big it'll be the equivalent of an ant looking up at a human. But as the costs of the statue have increased over time, so too have the voices of concern, and in recent weeks Kedge and fellow directors have acted to stave off an unholy row by organising a meeting with local villagers and aid workers. 'We are keen to involve local people at every level in this project,' insists Kedge, who is beginning to sound like a reincarnated Peter Mandelson fielding questions about the millenium Dome. Still, there are those for whom the costs are simply too much, and who feel it is against the original teachings of the Buddha. 'It's the imposition of materialism on the Buddhist tradition,' says Titmuss, who has been protesting against the project since its inception, when it was set to cost a mere $5 million. 'Is it wise and compassionate to build and spend $150m on a huge statue, stuck up there in the clouds half the time, when down at ground level there is such desperate poverty - a poverty, which, by Indian standards, is the worst anywhere?' Kedge answers the Maitreya Project's critics by saying it is committed to social work in the area. It has promised to build an international standard hospital, a conference and training centre, and to develop a school up to university level. Already, Kedge points out, the project has created jobs, and will continue to do so even after completion, when the local infrastructure develops to accommodate tourists. Nevertheless, Bodhgaya resident Vinay Bhai believes it amounts to crass marketing of religion coated in a thin veil of social responsibility. 'The literacy rate in some parts of Bodhgaya is as low as one per cent,' says Bhai, who heads the Forum of Village Republics, which claims to represent local organisations opposed to the plan. 'We'd much rather time, energy and money go into widescale education projects or helping eradicate polio... Our fear is that when our poor farmer and his child gaze at this huge statue he will not see the future Buddha, but will be ashamed of his smallness.' Size, according to the Maitreya Project's promotional brochure, matters, citing a tradition in Buddhism to build large monuments: 'The bigger the statue, the more people will come and see [it]... and the more sentient beings will benefit. While it is extremely important to provide food, medicine, education and shelter for the poor, this is not the main method of ending their suffering...' it goes on to say. Not all Buddhists are convinced. Two kilometres out of town, along a crater-filled path lined with spice-merchants and fruit-sellers, you come to a clay-hut village called Mutcharim. It's here that Rahul Sankrityayan, a Theravada monk, set up the Vajra Bodhi Society to help educate children of the poor. Sankrityayan shows me around the inside of a half-built tenement which passes as a school and somehow manages to double up as an orphanage. Construction work stopped when funds ran dry last year. 'Just 150 children from 10 villages are educated here,' he says. 'When you think it costs $30 a year to educate a child in Bodhgaya, and the cost of this Maitreya Project, think what more could be done.' After dusk, inside the marquee that holds a prototype of the Maitreya statue, it's business as usual for the 500 or so young Tibetan monks and nuns and a scattering of Westerners gathered for a puja (prayer offering). Sitting in perfect lotus position, they unravel long haunting mantras. The front row of monks rocks from side to side as if moving in time to an inaudible beat. Decked out in claret garb, and sporting skinheads and mischievous grins, they could easily pass as West Ham supporters circa 1984. The Indian coach drivers who brought us here stand around impatiently swigging rum, intermittently revving their engines, beeping their horns, or drowning out the monks' chorus with blasts of saccharine Indian pop. Eva, a businesswoman on pilgrimage from Melbourne, rests her prayer book on her lap and looks up at the prototype statue. 'I wish them all the luck in the world for this. Even if people have no faith at all in Buddhism, just to see this thing will help them in future lives,' she says. 'I just wish it was more modest. I agree with the Dalai Lama. He says it's a very courageous undertaking - I read that as a euphemism for saying it's just too ambitious.'",

A concealer containing a spot treatment will speed up healing on a minor blemish, but it won't cure acne. Lipsticks containing caffeine will not have the same effect as an espresso.

This is the baby. If I had the kind of life and riches I believed I was destined for when I was an optimistic six-year-old, then this is the car I would buy. Sod all those classic autos (I've got one, and it drives me... nuts, round the twist, up the wall, anywhere but from A to B). Bin the cute soft-top baubles. Forget the marques of history and breeding. Go for the FASTEST, the SHOWIEST, the FLASHEST, most OBVIOUS AND EMBARRASSINGLY ANTI-ECOLOGICAL LOOK-AT-MY-WAGE-PACKET BIG FAT NOUVEAU RICHE AND PROUD TO SHOUT ABOUT IT STATUS SYMBOL money can buy. Oh yes. If, when your wife empties your pockets at the end of the day, she comes across a spare \u00a354,000 in a brown envelope, then grab it off her and rush to the nearest Nissan showroom. And buy a Skyline. </p> <p>Imagine if James Bond had been born an Essex Boy. This is his car. Goes like the clappers. Looks like the bollix. Low-slung, shiny, chunky-boy wide, Tonka Toy-wheeled, with a back spoiler like a 1980s coffee table, it turns heads and warps minds wherever you drive it. 'It's the best car I've ever seen,' breathed one friend. 'It looks like the future,' wibbled another. And another sat in the passenger seat for, ooh, about half a minute, before turning pink and murmuring, 'I think I've come.' (Ladies! Forget all that fancy-pants-lacy-bustiers palaver! Just dump him in a Nissan for a few seconds 'til he's hot, then drag him out and tell him to lie back and think of Lada.) </p> <p>The Skyline GT-R is, essentially, a racing car. The splitter and spoiler and scrape-the-snails-off-the-pavement skirts provide enough down-force to keep you pinned to the road as though God's hand was keeping you there. But it's more than that. Cleverly, Nissan have combined genuine racing technology with boy-racer pizzazz. So the paintwork glistens like thick lipgloss - and covers everything, except mirror, lights, wheels and windows. The disc brakes are show-off yellow. The back lights are round and red. The lines are masculine (no over-curvy Ka-work here). And when you get in, you discover enough gizmos to keep you, Eddie 'Git' Irvine and poor old Q happy for hours. After all, if you've spent all this money, you want some look-at-me extras to show for it. </p> <p>Switch on the engine and a screen flickers into life. Set above the central console, it zips between graphs, pie charts and strange Japanese phrases (which only come on when you press a button marked TV, and mean: If you want hardcore porn, you have to pre-pay. Or maybe not.) It registers, among other things: degree of throttle opening; injector opening time; turbocharger pressure; front torque; engine coolant temperature; your height, weight and increased pulling power due to new mode of transport; your overdraft limit; just exactly where your bank manager is so you can go and run him down. </p> <p>Of course, unless you know how to read all the screen stuff, none of this makes sense at all. There's one format that looks like a piece of graph paper with a blob of mercury in the middle. The blob bounces around, it seems, according to whether the Skyline's nose dips below sea level. Or maybe it's according to your passenger's ego-fluctuations: I'm in the most fantastic car in the world (blob goes up). I'm not driving it (down). But I look cool anyway, especially when I put my elbow out of the window dead casual-like (sideways). </p> <p>Anyway, I have to say I let most of my passengers have a drive. You can't get a car like this and not (sorry, Nissan insurers). It's the opportunity of a lifetime. Despite my six-year-old dreams, no one I know is ever going to own this vehicle. So I let 'em at it. And they all had the same initial reaction: which was to laugh out loud. Even in inner-city traffic, the Skyline is so fast it makes you giggle. It's ridiculous. Put your foot on the accelerator and marvel (and brake quickly). Being behind the wheel is like walking a tiger with a piece of string as a leash. </p> <p>So I took it for a proper run. Down the motorway to Brighton, middle of the night, avoiding the speed traps. Lampposts flashed by like your entire life. Corners came and went with barely a flicker. You aimed and fired this remarkable machine towards the future and you almost caught yourself up from behind. It was the greatest fun-fair ride I've ever had. Six gears, by the way. I only ever got into third other than on my nightrider trip. </p> <p>What else is there to say? Just that the Skyline takes on Porsche and beats it at its own game.

If I had the kind of life and riches I believed I was destined for when I was an optimistic six-year-old, then this is the car I would buy. Sod all those classic autos (I've got one, and it drives me... nuts, round the twist, up the wall, anywhere but from A to B). Bin the cute soft-top baubles. Forget the marques of history and breeding. Go for the FASTEST, the SHOWIEST, the FLASHEST, most OBVIOUS AND EMBARRASSINGLY ANTI-ECOLOGICAL LOOK-AT-MY-WAGE-PACKET BIG FAT NOUVEAU RICHE AND PROUD TO SHOUT ABOUT IT STATUS SYMBOL money can buy. Oh yes. If, when your wife empties your pockets at the end of the day, she comes across a spare \u00a354,000 in a brown envelope, then grab it off her and rush to the nearest Nissan showroom. And buy a Skyline. Imagine if James Bond had been born an Essex Boy. This is his car. Goes like the clappers. Looks like the bollix. Low-slung, shiny, chunky-boy wide, Tonka Toy-wheeled, with a back spoiler like a 1980s coffee table, it turns heads and warps minds wherever you drive it. 'It's the best car I've ever seen,' breathed one friend. 'It looks like the future,' wibbled another. And another sat in the passenger seat for, ooh, about half a minute, before turning pink and murmuring, 'I think I've come.' (Ladies! Forget all that fancy-pants-lacy-bustiers palaver! Just dump him in a Nissan for a few seconds 'til he's hot, then drag him out and tell him to lie back and think of Lada.) The Skyline GT-R is, essentially, a racing car. The splitter and spoiler and scrape-the-snails-off-the-pavement skirts provide enough down-force to keep you pinned to the road as though God's hand was keeping you there. But it's more than that. Cleverly, Nissan have combined genuine racing technology with boy-racer pizzazz. So the paintwork glistens like thick lipgloss - and covers everything, except mirror, lights, wheels and windows. The disc brakes are show-off yellow. The back lights are round and red. The lines are masculine (no over-curvy Ka-work here). And when you get in, you discover enough gizmos to keep you, Eddie 'Git' Irvine and poor old Q happy for hours. After all, if you've spent all this money, you want some look-at-me extras to show for it. Switch on the engine and a screen flickers into life. Set above the central console, it zips between graphs, pie charts and strange Japanese phrases (which only come on when you press a button marked TV, and mean: If you want hardcore porn, you have to pre-pay. Or maybe not.) It registers, among other things: degree of throttle opening; injector opening time; turbocharger pressure; front torque; engine coolant temperature; your height, weight and increased pulling power due to new mode of transport; your overdraft limit; just exactly where your bank manager is so you can go and run him down. Of course, unless you know how to read all the screen stuff, none of this makes sense at all. There's one format that looks like a piece of graph paper with a blob of mercury in the middle. The blob bounces around, it seems, according to whether the Skyline's nose dips below sea level. Or maybe it's according to your passenger's ego-fluctuations: I'm in the most fantastic car in the world (blob goes up). I'm not driving it (down). But I look cool anyway, especially when I put my elbow out of the window dead casual-like (sideways). Anyway, I have to say I let most of my passengers have a drive. You can't get a car like this and not (sorry, Nissan insurers). It's the opportunity of a lifetime. Despite my six-year-old dreams, no one I know is ever going to own this vehicle. So I let 'em at it. And they all had the same initial reaction: which was to laugh out loud. Even in inner-city traffic, the Skyline is so fast it makes you giggle. It's ridiculous. Put your foot on the accelerator and marvel (and brake quickly). Being behind the wheel is like walking a tiger with a piece of string as a leash. So I took it for a proper run. Down the motorway to Brighton, middle of the night, avoiding the speed traps. Lampposts flashed by like your entire life. Corners came and went with barely a flicker. You aimed and fired this remarkable machine towards the future and you almost caught yourself up from behind. It was the greatest fun-fair ride I've ever had. Six gears, by the way. I only ever got into third other than on my nightrider trip. What else is there to say? Just that the Skyline takes on Porsche and beats it at its own game. The Boxster is the only other car I've tested that can compete for driving good times. And I like the Skyline more. It hasn't the pedigree, of course, but there's room for passengers, plus the dashboard's better designed, and it's comfier in town. Also: the Skyline satisfies the new money in me. I like it because it's a show-off, because it looks customised and brand shiny new, because when you're driving it you see young, unmoneyed men stop to point it out to their small sons and tell them that one day, when they're rich and famous, they'll have a car like the Nissan Skyline.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>David Marks:</b> We met as 19-year-old architecture students, in London in the early Seventies. We were living on opposite sides of the same street in Stockwell. We still live there, but on the same side now. Then we went to South America for 13 months. I got hepatitis, so Julia ended up working and looking after me. When we came back, we completed our course at the Architects' Association. <p>We didn't decide to get married until seven years later, on a trip to Mexico and Guatemala. It must have been the beautiful atmosphere: we swam with barracudas, and caught fresh lobster and cooked it on the beach. It was very romantic. </p> <p> After leaving AA, we weren't making long-term plans. But we had to earn some money. At the time, there wasn't a lot of work in architects' offices. So we set up a model-making business. We worked for most of the big architects in London for a couple of years. It was very successful. </p> <p>We both took alternate leadership roles. When Julia was doing models for one architect, she would be the person in charge of that client, handling all the accounts, the programming, the costings, making sure the resources were there to complete the models on time. And making them, working all hours. But we really wanted to be architects. We were both making models for Richard Rogers, and managed to switch roles to do architecture. </p> <p>Julia worked at Richard Rogers' for two or three years, and then moved to work for Norman Foster. I stayed and worked on the Lloyds building. But when Lloyds came to an end, we discussed going it on our own. I left and tried to generate the work for our own business. I got in a few potential projects and persuaded Julia to give in her notice. It was difficult, because working at Foster's is a very clear career path. She was project leader for a new gallery at the Royal Academy of Arts and had the makings of a great future. Then one day, she came back and said, 'I've done it, I've handed in my notice.' I said, 'Great. We've got no work.' </p> <p>But it was OK. Julia's greatest quality is her spirit of generosity, and she is a natural adventurist. I'm more of a dreamer. </p> <p>She is more practical, more realistic. I'm the sort of person who would say, 'Come on, let's go to the moon,' and Julia would be the one to say, 'Where's the rocket?' And I'd say, 'Don't worry, I'll find one.' </p> <p> It has never occurred to me whether I would be as successful without Julia. The strength of what we do is in doing it together. Our career has been a joint thing. </p> <p><b> Julia Barfield:</b> The day I gave in my notice at Foster's, all the potential projects that David had lined up disappeared. By that time we had our first child. So we had a young family and a young business growing at the same time. Generally, I always believe David. The belief is absolutely key - it is 150 per cent.

We managed to get the office and everything in it on the basis of our projected cash flow, we had signed all the leases, and within six weeks, this client said, 'The project's not going ahead.'

      "bodyText": "David Marks: We met as 19-year-old architecture students, in London in the early Seventies. We were living on opposite sides of the same street in Stockwell. We still live there, but on the same side now. Then we went to South America for 13 months. I got hepatitis, so Julia ended up working and looking after me. When we came back, we completed our course at the Architects' Association. We didn't decide to get married until seven years later, on a trip to Mexico and Guatemala. It must have been the beautiful atmosphere: we swam with barracudas, and caught fresh lobster and cooked it on the beach. It was very romantic. After leaving AA, we weren't making long-term plans. But we had to earn some money. At the time, there wasn't a lot of work in architects' offices. So we set up a model-making business. We worked for most of the big architects in London for a couple of years. It was very successful. We both took alternate leadership roles. When Julia was doing models for one architect, she would be the person in charge of that client, handling all the accounts, the programming, the costings, making sure the resources were there to complete the models on time. And making them, working all hours. But we really wanted to be architects. We were both making models for Richard Rogers, and managed to switch roles to do architecture. Julia worked at Richard Rogers' for two or three years, and then moved to work for Norman Foster. I stayed and worked on the Lloyds building. But when Lloyds came to an end, we discussed going it on our own. I left and tried to generate the work for our own business. I got in a few potential projects and persuaded Julia to give in her notice. It was difficult, because working at Foster's is a very clear career path. She was project leader for a new gallery at the Royal Academy of Arts and had the makings of a great future. Then one day, she came back and said, 'I've done it, I've handed in my notice.' I said, 'Great. We've got no work.' But it was OK. Julia's greatest quality is her spirit of generosity, and she is a natural adventurist. I'm more of a dreamer. She is more practical, more realistic. I'm the sort of person who would say, 'Come on, let's go to the moon,' and Julia would be the one to say, 'Where's the rocket?' And I'd say, 'Don't worry, I'll find one.' It has never occurred to me whether I would be as successful without Julia. The strength of what we do is in doing it together. Our career has been a joint thing. Julia Barfield: The day I gave in my notice at Foster's, all the potential projects that David had lined up disappeared. By that time we had our first child. So we had a young family and a young business growing at the same time. Generally, I always believe David. The belief is absolutely key - it is 150 per cent. And so far, it has paid off. In 1989, we entered an ideas competition for a Bridge of the Future and won. It generated a lot of publicity and was a good springboard for new work. We were working from home, and we had 14 people working in the living room. Then we won a huge project costing \u00a340 million. But the client insisted that we have a proper office.

In it she holds up an advertisement I wrote for Brook Street as an example of today's harsh, anti-family work climate. She quotes the line 'Waiting for home time? You're one your way out', but fails to mention that the ad goes on to say 'You choose the working life that suits your life.' This I think is Nigella's point. To be fair, Ms Lawson does suggest the advertisement could be used in favour of watching the quality of your work not the clock. It is. I'm proud of my work.

      "trailText": "<p>Bobby Gillespie's Primal Scream barely survived their Nineties period of excess. Their new album, though, is a deeper exploration of the rock'n'roll myth, fuelled not by drugs but by righteous anger</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The singer, Bobby Gillespie, arrives first. His newly shorn hair accentuates his thin, pale face, his darkly shadowed eyes, but it also, perversely, makes him look 10 years younger. He is edgy and animated. He orders mineral water - 'I hate alcohol, it's too messy' - and, despite his slight frame and pale skin, appears relatively fit and healthy, at least by the rock'n'roll standards his group have, in the past, done their utmost to uphold. Almost immediately, he starts talking about music, enthusing about a Royal Trux show a few nights before, about a recent Iggy Pop gig that blew him away. His enthusiasm for all things rock'n'roll - 'not rock, mind, but rock'n'roll; there's a big difference' - is evangelical, undimmed by time and experience. More than anyone, Bobby Gillespie epitomises the spirit, the essence of Primal Scream. </p> <p>Close on his heels comes Gary Mounfield, better known as Mani, late of the Stone Roses, Brit-rock's greatest underachievers. Mani still sports a Madchester floppy fringe, grins a lot, and seems Zen happy for a bass player, an occupation that, in my experience, seems to attract individuals of a more stoical, long-suffering bent. He orders beer and takes over when Bobby's eulogy to Iggy finally winds down - 'It were awesome. The best rock'n'roll show I've seen since Mot\u00f6rhead seven years ago.' High praise indeed. Missing in action is Andrew Innes, guitarist, engineer and, it would seem, anchorman of the occasionally anarchic but remarkably durable organism that is Primal Scream. Something to do with the previous night's excesses which apparently culminated earlier around midday. 'Someone,' says Gillespie, only half-jokingly, 'is always carrying the flag.' </p> <p>These days, the Primal Scream flag is not the rallying symbol it was around the time of 1991's Screamadelica album, when the groups dance-rock anthems - 'Higher than the Sun' and 'Movin' On Up' - perfectly caught the wild and heady tenor of those Ecstasy-fuelled times. Nor, though, is it the ragged and tattered thing that flew at half-mast from about 1992 until 1995, when the band almost self-immolated on bad drugs and trad-rock, looking and sounding like a ghostly pastiche of the Rolling Stones circa 1973. No, these days Primal Scream, despite the welter of recognisable influences apparent on their fired-up, wired-up new album, Exterminator, are very much a law unto themselves, flying an almost lone flag for passion and politics, making a music that manages to merge their undimmed punk attitude with a techno-heavy, post-rock sturm und drang. Not quite zeitgeist music, but utterly, unapologetically modern all the same. </p> <p> Exterminator could be viewed as a natural progression from 1997's Vanishing Point but only insofar as it manages, in some places, to sound even more malevolent and, in others, even more experimental. Buoyed by mixes from the likes of the Chemical Brothers and David Holmes, and featuring guest appearances by Kevin Shields (late of My Bloody Valentine) on the scorching 'Accelerator' and erstwhile Can drummer Jaki Liebezeit, it crackles with pent-up energy and focused aggression. </p> <p> The album is, unsurprisingly, a heady brew, wide-ranging and intense; difficult to absorb in one sitting. 'I think both this album and the last one are the results of the stock taking we did back in 1995,' Gillespie elaborates between sips of mineral water in a Soho bar, 'when we took a year and a half off just to refocus. We all listened to loads of different music, from country to punk to glam to disco, just reigniting the flame. I suppose that has spilled into our own stuff, but I think there's a purity about the new stuff, too. It's direct. It's righteous.' </p> <p>It is also, it can't be overstated, as angry as hell. Hence the album title, which, though it might sit more easily on a Metallica or Mot\u00f6rhead release, does, in its brutal nihilistic way, speak volumes about some of the subject matter of the songs - though outbursts might be a better description - therein. Songs like 'Kill All Hippies', or 'Swastika Eyes', or 'Shoot Speed Kill Light', or, my own personal favourite, 'Insect Royalty'. In places, the record seems shot through with the spirit of Seventies punk, the kind of raw, gut-level frustration and disgust at the world that Rotten and Strummer fed off and spat out. 'We still think of ourselves as a punk band because that's where we started from,' Gillespie tells me, calmly, 'but the anger is more to do with writing about what we see, and what we see is people being betrayed, being dumped on by a government that was meant to be an alternative to Toryism but is simply a continuation of it. If there's a lot of anger on this record, it's the anger of the betrayed.' </p> <p>On more than one level, then, Primal Scream are the last of the true believers. They believe, in no particular order, in the transformative power of rock'n'roll, in the core principles of punk - passion, energy, polemic - and in the politics of protest and dissent. Any one of those beliefs is enough to make them seem old-fashioned in a world where both politics and pop are caught in a dull consensus of uniformity and overt careerism, but, to their credit, they seem unconcerned by the fact that they are out of step with the culture that produced them. 'We're a working-class band,' Mani tells me touchingly at one point. 'We might live in nice houses, but in here (slaps his heart), the fire still burns.' </p> <p>Primal Scream make little sense outside the context of the myth of rock'n'roll - the redemptive power of three chords and a fistful of attitude. And yet that myth seems, at the beginning of this new century, to be, if not dead on its feet, at least staggering under the weight of its unfulfilled promise. </p> <p>I ask Gillespie if it has ever crossed his mind that rock'n'roll is no longer the redemptive force it once was, that, in fact, it is tired and old and worn out. A few years ago, this question would have unleashed a flurry of passionate defences, but his answer, when it comes, is more realistic than I expected. 'I think it's still a great medium for ideas. The big problem is not the medium, but the people who use it. Music seems to attract mundane tradesmen now, not magicians. If you see Iggy live, you can't help but wonder what energies he's drawing on, what secrets he carries around inside him. He's like a shaman, a Red Indian warrior, a minotaur and Nijinksky all rolled into one. It's like being hit by lightning. Now, personally, I think rock'n'roll should be peopled with misfits, outcasts, freaks and magicians, not careerists and conservatives with no opinions. Plus, nobody can play the guitar any more. Have you noticed that? They're passable or they're technicians, but nobody's hitting those strings like Keef or Jimmy Page. There's no attitude, no magic.' </p> <p>Though they are forever tied in the public eye to the early Nineties' loved-up culture that Screamadelica caught so well, Primal Scream were born and baptised in the white-hot afterburn of punk, children of Johnny Rotten and Margaret Thatcher respectively. Their politics, though, predate that desperate, but creatively iconoclastic, era. Gillespie hails from a strong Scottish socialist tradition: his father was a union activist and anti-racist campaigner on Clydeside in the Sixties, a Protestant who had pictures of the Black Panthers on his wall rather than King Billy or the Queen. In the early Seventies, living in the shadow of Hampden Park, he met and befriended another football-mad teenager called Alan McGee. Together, they went to see their first gig: Thin Lizzy, Glasgow Barrowlands, 1975. </p> <p>Then came punk. Like many others who came of age at that time, the world shifted slightly off its axis and has never really righted itself since. 'The Clash said it all, really.' Gillespie elaborates, a certain wistfulness detectable in his voice, 'They were the template - emotion, passion, pure feeling. They were adventurous. They took chances. I love them. They were as good as it gets.' Mani nods in agreement. 'I were only a kid, but the Clash saved my bacon. For real. They put me on the path to knowledge and consciousness at 14 years old. They changed my life.' </p> <p>Primal Scream were formed at some indeterminate moment in the early Eighties, and, for a long time, were an unfocused entity, in thrall not just to the spirit of '77 but to the proto-punk garage-band scene of the late Sixties. Gillespie, at this time, was moonlighting as a drummer for Glasgow's other great Eighties group, the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, who were causing mayhem with their short, explosive, feedback-laced sets and still startling Phil-Spector-meets-the-Velvet-Underground sound. ('I was speeding out of my head one night and the drummer didn't turn up, so I went on stage, stood behind the drum kit and did my Mo Tucker bit. Never drummed before in my life, but it worked.') The Eighties passed with Primal Scream signing to McGee's fledgling Creation label and maintaining a profile as one of those perennial groups that the music press worship but the record-buying public studiously ignore. </p> <p> Then came acid house. 'It was the strangest thing,' says Gillespie, seemingly still slightly puzzled by the cross-cultural dynamic that sent his group spinning out of the indie-rock ghetto into the Ecstasy-fuelled stratosphere of crossover success. 'We had been recording off and on for a year, and then the record company told us we had to release an album, so we put some tracks together in the best sequence possible, did the sleeve in a day and rushed it out. Then, bam!' </p> <p>Released in 1991, Screamadelica, like the Stone Roses' eponymous debut album and the Happy Mondays' Pills, Thrills and Bellyaches, captured the gestalt of the early Nineties. I remember hearing the single 'Movin' On Up' on the radio and thinking that, finally, someone had successfully welded the swagger of great rock'n'roll with the anthemic, uplifting sway of E-inspired dance culture. The single and the album pitched Primal Scream into the mainstream, while the culture that produced their new rock-dance sound seemed to energise and focus a group that had been meandering for too long. Before Oasis, Primal Scream were briefly and gloriously Creation's biggest stars. It was a short-lived ascendancy. 'At the time, it was great,' Gillespie remembers, 'but that kind of fame is always a bit destabilising. We were just being ourselves but we were in the thick of it, too. Everybody wants to hang out with you - the parties were mad anyway, but they were getting madder. Even by our standards, we were right out there.' </p> <p>A feature in the music magazine Select described a post-gig bash where cocaine, Ecstasy, amphetamines, magic mushrooms and crystal methedrine were in ready supply alongside the cannabis and Jack Daniels. Stories circulated, too, about their wilfully dissolute rock'n'roll lifestyle: Andrew Innes thrown out of Gracelands in Memphis for, as a press release succinctly put it, 'vomiting copiously on the lawn'; Innes calling the late River Phoenix, who had died from a multiple drug overdose, 'a lightweight'. In 1993, in New York, Martin Duffy, their gifted pianist, was stabbed by an unknown assailant in a downtown bar and lay slumped over a table until the barman noticed the pool of blood at his feet. The blade missed his kidney by a fraction of an inch. </p> <p>As omens go, it was a salutary one: things were going badly awry, the energy that had characterised Screamadelica now dissipated by increasingly hard drug use and a musical retreat into traditionalism. The follow-up, 1994's Give Out But Don't Give Up, was the best Rolling Stones record in ages. Recorded in Memphis with the cream of the city's older musicians in attendance, it was, though, too close to pastiche to be truly powerful. Primal Scream had lost their way. </p> <p>When I met the band in New York in the winter of 1994, they were in bad shape, physically and psychologically, and I would not have bet on them staying together for longer than six months. 'You caught us at a bad time, but it got a whole lot worse before it got better,' the ever-candid Gillespie explains. 'Halfway through '92, the rot set in. Cocaine and speed. Then, by Christmas, it was heroin. In '93, we tried to record Give Out..., but it was a disaster. Too many hangers-on in the studio, everybody waiting for the man to come. We were strung out, or smacked out. There was alcohol and speed, too.' </p> <p>How bad did it get, exactly? Mani says nowt; Gillespie looks at the floor. 'Pretty bad. Three of the band were addicted to heroin; the management, assistant management, crew, mates were all involved. I'd say 20 people in all. It was a collective thing, and that's the messiest scene of all.' </p> <p>And how did you dig your way out? 'Me and Innes wised up at the same time. We just got sick of the shit, and decided to walk away from it. The music was coming second to the drug-taking. We did a 22-week tour of the States. It was debilitating, too one-dimensional. I remember thinking, \"I don't want to do this any more. We have to change or die.\" Basically, we took a year and a half off, deconstructed Primal Scream, got the man here on board, and started again.' Mani grins his big grin and nods his agreement. </p> <p>It suddenly strikes me that, following the Stone Roses' messy split, it must have been a bit of a risk to jump on board the mystery train that is Primal Scream, particularly when, like his previous group, they had helped define a time, then utterly lost the plot. 'It were a bit funny at the start, but I'm a big believer in karma. You end up where you're meant to be. With the Roses, it was like we had the world at our feet but it didn't happen. You know why? Cos we couldn't get out of bed at the same time. That's what happens if you let things slide. This lot aren't letting things slide any more.' He looks at Bobby, punches the air, and shouts: 'The spark's been relit!' </p> <p>The energy and adventurousness of Exterminator would seem to bear out the Mancunian survivor's ever-positive overview, but barely a week before the interview took place, news leaked out that Alan McGee was jettisoning Creation, the label he made in his image to house the likes of Oasis, the Primals and a host of other increasingly eccentric signings. In the music press, the news was reported as an end-of-an-era story, which, in many ways, it is. Oasis are doing a Beatles and setting up their own label; Primal Scream, with two albums still owed to Sony, Creation's mother label, are waiting nervously to see what happens next. </p> <p>'We could always communicate our ideas to Alan and Dick Green at Creation,' says Gillespie. 'Dick even re-mortgaged his house to help put Screamadelica out, but who knows what will happen with the suits at Sony. We're going to wait and see. It might work out and it might be total war. Whatever, we're ready and fightin' fit! We have our own studio, and we'll make music whatever happens. I mean, look at us,' he adds, laughing. 'I mean, what else could we do?' </p> <p>Outsiders, misfits, malcontents, magicians: Primal Scream are all of these, and more; would that there were more like them right now in that otherwise wretched place called rock'n'roll.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The singer, Bobby Gillespie, arrives first. His newly shorn hair accentuates his thin, pale face, his darkly shadowed eyes, but it also, perversely, makes him look 10 years younger. He is edgy and animated. He orders mineral water - 'I hate alcohol, it's too messy' - and, despite his slight frame and pale skin, appears relatively fit and healthy, at least by the rock'n'roll standards his group have, in the past, done their utmost to uphold. Almost immediately, he starts talking about music, enthusing about a Royal Trux show a few nights before, about a recent Iggy Pop gig that blew him away. His enthusiasm for all things rock'n'roll - 'not rock, mind, but rock'n'roll; there's a big difference' - is evangelical, undimmed by time and experience. More than anyone, Bobby Gillespie epitomises the spirit, the essence of Primal Scream. Close on his heels comes Gary Mounfield, better known as Mani, late of the Stone Roses, Brit-rock's greatest underachievers. Mani still sports a Madchester floppy fringe, grins a lot, and seems Zen happy for a bass player, an occupation that, in my experience, seems to attract individuals of a more stoical, long-suffering bent. He orders beer and takes over when Bobby's eulogy to Iggy finally winds down - 'It were awesome. The best rock'n'roll show I've seen since Mot\u00f6rhead seven years ago.' High praise indeed. Missing in action is Andrew Innes, guitarist, engineer and, it would seem, anchorman of the occasionally anarchic but remarkably durable organism that is Primal Scream. Something to do with the previous night's excesses which apparently culminated earlier around midday. 'Someone,' says Gillespie, only half-jokingly, 'is always carrying the flag.' These days, the Primal Scream flag is not the rallying symbol it was around the time of 1991's Screamadelica album, when the groups dance-rock anthems - 'Higher than the Sun' and 'Movin' On Up' - perfectly caught the wild and heady tenor of those Ecstasy-fuelled times. Nor, though, is it the ragged and tattered thing that flew at half-mast from about 1992 until 1995, when the band almost self-immolated on bad drugs and trad-rock, looking and sounding like a ghostly pastiche of the Rolling Stones circa 1973. No, these days Primal Scream, despite the welter of recognisable influences apparent on their fired-up, wired-up new album, Exterminator, are very much a law unto themselves, flying an almost lone flag for passion and politics, making a music that manages to merge their undimmed punk attitude with a techno-heavy, post-rock sturm und drang. Not quite zeitgeist music, but utterly, unapologetically modern all the same. Exterminator could be viewed as a natural progression from 1997's Vanishing Point but only insofar as it manages, in some places, to sound even more malevolent and, in others, even more experimental. Buoyed by mixes from the likes of the Chemical Brothers and David Holmes, and featuring guest appearances by Kevin Shields (late of My Bloody Valentine) on the scorching 'Accelerator' and erstwhile Can drummer Jaki Liebezeit, it crackles with pent-up energy and focused aggression. The album is, unsurprisingly, a heady brew, wide-ranging and intense; difficult to absorb in one sitting. 'I think both this album and the last one are the results of the stock taking we did back in 1995,' Gillespie elaborates between sips of mineral water in a Soho bar, 'when we took a year and a half off just to refocus. We all listened to loads of different music, from country to punk to glam to disco, just reigniting the flame. I suppose that has spilled into our own stuff, but I think there's a purity about the new stuff, too. It's direct. It's righteous.' It is also, it can't be overstated, as angry as hell. Hence the album title, which, though it might sit more easily on a Metallica or Mot\u00f6rhead release, does, in its brutal nihilistic way, speak volumes about some of the subject matter of the songs - though outbursts might be a better description - therein. Songs like 'Kill All Hippies', or 'Swastika Eyes', or 'Shoot Speed Kill Light', or, my own personal favourite, 'Insect Royalty'. In places, the record seems shot through with the spirit of Seventies punk, the kind of raw, gut-level frustration and disgust at the world that Rotten and Strummer fed off and spat out. 'We still think of ourselves as a punk band because that's where we started from,' Gillespie tells me, calmly, 'but the anger is more to do with writing about what we see, and what we see is people being betrayed, being dumped on by a government that was meant to be an alternative to Toryism but is simply a continuation of it. If there's a lot of anger on this record, it's the anger of the betrayed.' On more than one level, then, Primal Scream are the last of the true believers. They believe, in no particular order, in the transformative power of rock'n'roll, in the core principles of punk - passion, energy, polemic - and in the politics of protest and dissent. Any one of those beliefs is enough to make them seem old-fashioned in a world where both politics and pop are caught in a dull consensus of uniformity and overt careerism, but, to their credit, they seem unconcerned by the fact that they are out of step with the culture that produced them. 'We're a working-class band,' Mani tells me touchingly at one point. 'We might live in nice houses, but in here (slaps his heart), the fire still burns.' Primal Scream make little sense outside the context of the myth of rock'n'roll - the redemptive power of three chords and a fistful of attitude. And yet that myth seems, at the beginning of this new century, to be, if not dead on its feet, at least staggering under the weight of its unfulfilled promise. I ask Gillespie if it has ever crossed his mind that rock'n'roll is no longer the redemptive force it once was, that, in fact, it is tired and old and worn out. A few years ago, this question would have unleashed a flurry of passionate defences, but his answer, when it comes, is more realistic than I expected. 'I think it's still a great medium for ideas. The big problem is not the medium, but the people who use it. Music seems to attract mundane tradesmen now, not magicians. If you see Iggy live, you can't help but wonder what energies he's drawing on, what secrets he carries around inside him. He's like a shaman, a Red Indian warrior, a minotaur and Nijinksky all rolled into one. It's like being hit by lightning. Now, personally, I think rock'n'roll should be peopled with misfits, outcasts, freaks and magicians, not careerists and conservatives with no opinions. Plus, nobody can play the guitar any more. Have you noticed that? They're passable or they're technicians, but nobody's hitting those strings like Keef or Jimmy Page. There's no attitude, no magic.' Though they are forever tied in the public eye to the early Nineties' loved-up culture that Screamadelica caught so well, Primal Scream were born and baptised in the white-hot afterburn of punk, children of Johnny Rotten and Margaret Thatcher respectively. Their politics, though, predate that desperate, but creatively iconoclastic, era. Gillespie hails from a strong Scottish socialist tradition: his father was a union activist and anti-racist campaigner on Clydeside in the Sixties, a Protestant who had pictures of the Black Panthers on his wall rather than King Billy or the Queen.

As usual, the outbursts of intolerance were blamed by some commentators on the hang-ups of a largely presbyterian past and so it was with genuine pleasure that I read on Wednesday that the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had spoken uncompromisingly in favour of the Executive's plan for repeal.</p> <p>The Rt Rev John Cairns asked if it was seriously being proposed that sex education should omit all mention of homosexuality. If so, he rightly said, 'that seems to be a ludicrous situation.' Mr Cairns immediately encountered some criticism from members of his own church. But that is fine; the moderator is primus inter pares and speaks in his own name.</p> <p>But the Church of Scotland has often suffered because the moderator is in office only for a year and has no time to make any kind of impact. Mr Cairns has reversed that trend and has expressed what seems a more Christian and compassionate view of homosexuality.</p> <p>The affair, of course, marks a further stage in the slow rupture between the Catholic Church and the Labour Party. Other things which once seemed inviolable are going too. Dewar faces huge opposition to the promise to introduce PR for council elections but seems determined to press ahead.</p> <p>The Scottish Parliament, by its very existence, has increased the vigour of our national conversation. But I hope it keeps its nerve and has the courage to repeal a statute which is as offensive as it is useless. In France more than 12,000 people, mainly gay couples, have signed up for the new civil pacts since they became available by law last October. This doesn't seems to have caused the end of civilisation. Rather these is an act of social and political generosity which may have made many people happier.</p>",

My impression is that the liberal consensus, involving Labour, Lib Dems and most of the SNP, is holding firm. As usual, the outbursts of intolerance were blamed by some commentators on the hang-ups of a largely presbyterian past and so it was with genuine pleasure that I read on Wednesday that the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had spoken uncompromisingly in favour of the Executive's plan for repeal. The Rt Rev John Cairns asked if it was seriously being proposed that sex education should omit all mention of homosexuality. If so, he rightly said, 'that seems to be a ludicrous situation.' Mr Cairns immediately encountered some criticism from members of his own church. But that is fine; the moderator is primus inter pares and speaks in his own name. But the Church of Scotland has often suffered because the moderator is in office only for a year and has no time to make any kind of impact. Mr Cairns has reversed that trend and has expressed what seems a more Christian and compassionate view of homosexuality. The affair, of course, marks a further stage in the slow rupture between the Catholic Church and the Labour Party. Other things which once seemed inviolable are going too. Dewar faces huge opposition to the promise to introduce PR for council elections but seems determined to press ahead. The Scottish Parliament, by its very existence, has increased the vigour of our national conversation. But I hope it keeps its nerve and has the courage to repeal a statute which is as offensive as it is useless. In France more than 12,000 people, mainly gay couples, have signed up for the new civil pacts since they became available by law last October. This doesn't seems to have caused the end of civilisation. Rather these is an act of social and political generosity which may have made many people happier.",

      "bodyText": "When one of Faith Doherty's kidnappers slammed a custom-made revolver down on the table in front of her, the British environmentalist thought she was about to be shot. Her Indonesian colleague Ruwi was already covered in blood, having been punched until he collapsed and then repeatedly kicked in the head. Doherty was in agony, a finger having been dislocated in an assault. The posse of screaming and shouting thugs was becoming increasingly violent. 'I thought we were going to die,' said the 39-year-old researcher with the British and US-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). 'I really thought they were going to kill us.' The gun was not fired, but a terrifying 48-hour hostage drama in the wilds of the jungle in Indonesian Borneo was only just beginning. It had all the hallmarks of a thriller: two environmental groups were taking on a baddie worthy of a James Bond film who has been ruthlessly riding roughshod over the local authorities to tear down thousands of square miles of rainforest. In cameo roles are an Indonesian government minister, the World Bank, the British ambassador, a handful of concerned detectives and dozens of hired thugs. 'We were kidnapped, we were assaulted, we were held hostage, we were constantly terrorised and intimidated,' Doherty told The Observer in an exclusive interview yesterday as she and Ruwi enjoyed their freedom again, in Banjarmasin, a large city on the island's south coast. The story began last June when the EIA and Telapak, an Indonesian environmental group published The Final Cut , a report into illegal logging in two of Indonesia's national parks that are home to the majority of the world's orangutans. Among those singled out was Abdul Rasyid, an illegal logger in central Kalimantan (the Indonesian half of Borneo) with an air of false respectability earned by getting himself elected to the parliament in Jakarta. Through his network of sawmills, plywood and mouldings factories, palm oil plantations, barges, tugboats and cargo ships, Rasyid has turned thousands of square miles into his personal fiefdom called Tanjung Lingga. As the report and this week's hostage crisis show, the local authorities are helpless in the face of his overt bullying tactics backed by enormous financial wealth. Concerned about the huge depletion of Indonesia's rainforests - illegal logging outstrips legal felling according to one recent study - the World Bank is holding a forestry seminar next week, in advance of crucial talks between the Indonesian gov ernment and international aid donors. Ruwi, Telepak's executive director, was invited to give a presentation and wanted to update his data. So he and Faith returned to Tanjung Putting National Park in central Kalimantan last Monday. Making no attempt to hide their identities, the two entered Rasyid's sawmill to assess the level of theft from the park. 'The security guards asked us what we were doing and we explained we wanted to see Mr Rasyid,' Doherty said. Doherty and Ruwi were collected by three large men from their hotel.

      "body": "<p>Consider the tomato - so much a part of everyday life that we hardly notice it. Yet it has a murky past, and it is one that scientists should note carefully. </p> <p>In the nineteenth century, the tomato was known as the wolf's peach, and Europeans and Americans believed it was deadly poisonous. In 1820, New York forbade its consumption and only relented when Colonel Robert Johnston announced that he would eat an entire bag of them outside the courthouse in Salem, New Jersey. Two thousand people turned up to watch him die, while a band played a funeral march. But Johnston ate the lot and announced: 'This luscious, scarlet apple will form the foundation of a great garden industry.' </p> <p>For such prescience, Johnson deserves canonisation as the patron saint of hothouses, though his story has far more than historical importance, for it shows there is nothing new in misplaced hysteria about food. </p> <p>As David Aaron, US Under-Secretary for Commerce, warned a conference on 'Biotechnology: The Science and the Impact' in The Hague last week: 'Last century it was the tomato, this time it is biotech food.' </p> <p>But there is a crucial difference today. We no longer have the time to indulge in fantasies and misconceptions about food, and in particular about gene foods. One billion people - more than the combined population of the United States and Europe - now survive on $1 or less a day, and are starving. </p> <p>The UN has pledged to halve that number by 2015, a startlingly ambitious goal - for it means farmers will have to match mankind's entire food production of the past 10,000 years in the next one and a half decades. </p> <p>There is only one way to achieve this dramatic goal, experts warned delegates, and that is by exploiting biotechnology, the science of manipulating the genes of living organisms. </p> <p>However, this route is now being seriously hindered by Western consumers who, with increasing vehemence, are rejecting biotechnological products, mainly GM foods, and blocking their testing and funding. </p> <p>These are the killer tomatoes of today, they claim. 'Unfortunately, consumers think products like genetically modified foods pose risks and offer no benefits,' said Sir Robert May, the Cabinet's chief scientific adviser. 'It is the attitude of a privileged \u00e9lite who think there will be no problem feeding tomorrow's growing population.' </p> <p>Such prejudices form the background for this week's international talks in Montreal when nations will discuss imposing limits on the safe handling, transfer and use of genetically modified organisms that could have an adverse effect on the environment. At issue is the fear that the US and its partners are trying to monopolise trade in GM crops, a bid that has made many other countries, includ ing Third World nations, suspicious of such products. </p> <p>The irony is that without biotechnology, there will be no salvation for developing nations, delegates heard. To save 500 million people from starvation, they will have to increase meat production by an estimated 114 per cent, and milk output by 133 per cent. </p> <p>For mighty conglomerates, that would be a tall order. For poor smallholders, the main providers of Third World crops, it would be impossible without the geneticist. </p> <p>The aim is to develop techniques best suited to the Third World, ideas that include modifying crops so that their stems, used as animal feed in developing nations, are more nutritious, thus boosting livestock quality, or adding genes that will improve the vitamin content of maize or rice. </p> <p>A perfect example of this type of technology was provided by Tony Irvin, of the International Livestock Research Institute, who has discovered a breed of sheep called the Red Masai, herded by East African nomads. </p> <p>'These animals have developed a unique resistance to parasitic worms,' he said. Such parasites take a terrible toll of sheep in farms throughout the world, and Irvin and his colleagues believe they can develop techniques to transfer resistance to other breeds. </p> <p>But this raises other headaches. How can politicians ensure the Masai people will benefit? Will they not suffer the fate of other indigenous peoples whose products have been pilfered and exploited without financial return? </p> <p>Consider another fruit: the Chinese gooseberry, grown for centuries by Chinese farmers. Then a group of wily New Zealanders adopted, marketed and renamed it: the Kiwi fruit. They made a fortune. Chinese farmers got nothing. </p> <p>There are scores of other examples, with developing countries accusing Western corporations of trying to patent the genetic codes of dozens of their native plants, including basmati rice, turmeric, black pepper, cotton - even the 'sacred' neem tree. </p> <p>And such cases worried Irvin, as well as the World Bank vice-president Ismail Serageldin. 'We have got to make sure this does not happen with the Red Masai,' said Serageldin. 'Perhaps we will have to license the gene and use the proceeds to set up a trust fund for the Masai. Whatever else, we have a moral obligation to these people. </p> <p>'Essentially, we are seeing a scientific apartheid being established between the Northern and Southern nations. It is not the science that divides them but the intellectual property rights that underpin products. We have got to find ways to make these available - perhaps by shortening the lifetime of patents from 17 to five years, or only asking for low, flat fees for access to technologies. </p> <p>But there were encouraging signs, the delegates heard. Pharmaceutical giant Merck recently gave away its river blindness drug to the Third World, as did Novartis with its leprosy medicine. </p> <p>Far more important for the question of feeding the world, however, has been the development of 'golden rice', a genetically modified strain that can impart doses of vitamin A, which standard rice lacks. 'Four hundred million people suffer from serious vitamin A deficiency, of whom one million die every year,' geneticist Chris Somerville of Stanford University told delegates. 'However by using genes from the daffodil, we have created rice that is not only yellow, but contains vitamin A. That crop was created with Rockefeller Foundation cash and will be distributed throughout the Third World in the next couple of years.' </p> <p>But Somerville added that it took 12 years to develop golden rice. In that time, the world's population increased by another billion to its current six billion. </p> <p>'In other words, if we want to make breakthroughs we are going to have to develop a lot more products like golden rice and do it a lot more quickly than we are doing at present.' </p> <p>Yet the West, and in particular Europe, is now dragging its heels more and more in the face of intense customer hos tility to genetically modified foods, the continent's killer tomatoes. </p> <p>'I think Europeans are going to have to carry a very heavy moral burden over their attitude to biotechnology,' Somerville added. </p> <p>In the end, what is needed is a glamorous GM product that would change the image of biotechnology, May concluded. 'We need a GM apple that will make you thin and wicked. I suspect that would do the trick.'</p>",

There is only one way to achieve this dramatic goal, experts warned delegates, and that is by exploiting biotechnology, the science of manipulating the genes of living organisms. However, this route is now being seriously hindered by Western consumers who, with increasing vehemence, are rejecting biotechnological products, mainly GM foods, and blocking their testing and funding. These are the killer tomatoes of today, they claim. 'Unfortunately, consumers think products like genetically modified foods pose risks and offer no benefits,' said Sir Robert May, the Cabinet's chief scientific adviser. 'It is the attitude of a privileged \u00e9lite who think there will be no problem feeding tomorrow's growing population.' Such prejudices form the background for this week's international talks in Montreal when nations will discuss imposing limits on the safe handling, transfer and use of genetically modified organisms that could have an adverse effect on the environment. At issue is the fear that the US and its partners are trying to monopolise trade in GM crops, a bid that has made many other countries, includ ing Third World nations, suspicious of such products. The irony is that without biotechnology, there will be no salvation for developing nations, delegates heard. To save 500 million people from starvation, they will have to increase meat production by an estimated 114 per cent, and milk output by 133 per cent. For mighty conglomerates, that would be a tall order. For poor smallholders, the main providers of Third World crops, it would be impossible without the geneticist. The aim is to develop techniques best suited to the Third World, ideas that include modifying crops so that their stems, used as animal feed in developing nations, are more nutritious, thus boosting livestock quality, or adding genes that will improve the vitamin content of maize or rice. A perfect example of this type of technology was provided by Tony Irvin, of the International Livestock Research Institute, who has discovered a breed of sheep called the Red Masai, herded by East African nomads. 'These animals have developed a unique resistance to parasitic worms,' he said. Such parasites take a terrible toll of sheep in farms throughout the world, and Irvin and his colleagues believe they can develop techniques to transfer resistance to other breeds. But this raises other headaches. How can politicians ensure the Masai people will benefit? Will they not suffer the fate of other indigenous peoples whose products have been pilfered and exploited without financial return? Consider another fruit: the Chinese gooseberry, grown for centuries by Chinese farmers. Then a group of wily New Zealanders adopted, marketed and renamed it: the Kiwi fruit. They made a fortune. Chinese farmers got nothing. There are scores of other examples, with developing countries accusing Western corporations of trying to patent the genetic codes of dozens of their native plants, including basmati rice, turmeric, black pepper, cotton - even the 'sacred' neem tree. And such cases worried Irvin, as well as the World Bank vice-president Ismail Serageldin. 'We have got to make sure this does not happen with the Red Masai,' said Serageldin. 'Perhaps we will have to license the gene and use the proceeds to set up a trust fund for the Masai. Whatever else, we have a moral obligation to these people. 'Essentially, we are seeing a scientific apartheid being established between the Northern and Southern nations. It is not the science that divides them but the intellectual property rights that underpin products. We have got to find ways to make these available - perhaps by shortening the lifetime of patents from 17 to five years, or only asking for low, flat fees for access to technologies. But there were encouraging signs, the delegates heard. Pharmaceutical giant Merck recently gave away its river blindness drug to the Third World, as did Novartis with its leprosy medicine. Far more important for the question of feeding the world, however, has been the development of 'golden rice', a genetically modified strain that can impart doses of vitamin A, which standard rice lacks. 'Four hundred million people suffer from serious vitamin A deficiency, of whom one million die every year,' geneticist Chris Somerville of Stanford University told delegates. 'However by using genes from the daffodil, we have created rice that is not only yellow, but contains vitamin A. That crop was created with Rockefeller Foundation cash and will be distributed throughout the Third World in the next couple of years.' But Somerville added that it took 12 years to develop golden rice. In that time, the world's population increased by another billion to its current six billion. 'In other words, if we want to make breakthroughs we are going to have to develop a lot more products like golden rice and do it a lot more quickly than we are doing at present.' Yet the West, and in particular Europe, is now dragging its heels more and more in the face of intense customer hos tility to genetically modified foods, the continent's killer tomatoes. 'I think Europeans are going to have to carry a very heavy moral burden over their attitude to biotechnology,' Somerville added. In the end, what is needed is a glamorous GM product that would change the image of biotechnology, May concluded. 'We need a GM apple that will make you thin and wicked. I suspect that would do the trick.'",

Now, just as their airmen are heading home from UK bases after 'winning' the Cold War, battalions more of our US cousins are arriving, taking over historic institutions, businesses and neighbourhoods.</p> <p>There are 200,000 US citizens living in the UK, twice the number of 10 years ago, despite a sharp drop in military personnel. Counter-colonisation is in progress. US luminaries who have been parachuted in include Michael Kaiser, head of the Royal Opera House; George Mitchell, harbinger of peace in Northern Ireland; and Barbara Cassani, head of British Airways' cheap fares offshoot, Go</p> <p>When we are in trouble it seems we can't help looking west. When the Jubilee Line extension hit the rocks, in rode Cliff Mumm, a South Dakotan from Bechtel Corp, who took over and finished the job.</p> <p>The image of the American is someone who will Get the Job Done, while we Brits just fiddle about. 'The British take on every project like a game of chess,' says Mumm. 'They worry endlessly about rules and procedure. But when we got this job we put together an Anglo-American team and said \"Let's do what it takes\".'</p> <p>George Mitchell, one of the world's smoothest diplomats, tells a similar story. 'I don't want to take anything away from the British and the Irish,' he has said. 'They are warm and wise and articulate. But sometimes you get the feeling these guys are so articulate they could go on talking for ever. Americans are more likely to say \"Enough already, let's get the thing done\".'</p> <p>It is difficult to argue with success. The US economy is in the longest expansion of its history. It is the richest nation there has ever been. Its stock market is propping up the global currency exchange market. America dominates in sport, economics, military power. A survey conducted by BT shows senior British business people agreed that a 'can do' attitude was the most important determinant of commercial success. Sixty per cent thought American business culture exemplified this attitude. Only 10 per cent thought it applied to home-grown companies.</p> <p>There are some jobs Americans are likely to be better suited to in any case, simply because the US is further ahead. Raising money, for example, is virtually a US monopoly. Trained in a nation which gives more money to charity than the rest of the world put together, and where universities, schools and arts companies have rarely been state-funded, money-getters from across the pond are in huge demand. Alice Gosling, the Illinois-born and raised fundraiser for Lincoln College, Oxford, says British institutions are adapting to a new, harsher financial world. 'In the US, colleges have been aggressively fundraising for 25 years. Here, development is fairly new in lots of areas - higher education, museums, the ballet. The industry is simply more developed in the US.'</p> <p>Some are worried about the influx of Americans into the British cultural world. Scottish Ballet has an American artistic director, Robert North. The principal guest conductor to the Royal Scottish National Orchestra is New Yorker Marin Alsop. The South Bank is being recast by Oregon architect Rick Mather for \u00a370 million. And - most shocking - the BBC Symphony Orchestra has appointed American conductor Leonard Slatkin. Which means the Last Night of the Proms is to be led by a native of a nation which fought us for its independence.</p> <p>For years, the Brits have been able to cede most other areas of superiority to the Americans, confident at least in our greater culture and knowledge: let them eat their McDonalds, we sneered, at least we understand Mahler. What now?</p> <p>Even if we can accept the expertise Americans bring to areas such as fundraising, and the diversity of the international arts scene, the Americanisation of other areas can cause the hackles of the British bulldog to rise. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England - which sets our mortgage rates - includes a US economist, DeAnne Julius. She insists the trend we are seeing is less Americanisation, more internationalisation. 'There has been a globalisation of human capability. There are more Americans and more people of other nationalities too,' Julius says. 'All fields are now more global - business, the arts, sports.'</p> <p>Two of the most powerful magnets for Americans are the City of London and the English language. London is a major financial centre, US finance firms are powerful, so it is inevitable that the Square Mile will be filled with New York twangs. Half of all US investment in Europe is in the UK. London is a bridgehead for many American companies which also operate on the Continent.</p> <p>But the traffic isn't one way. While we fret about Americans taking over our august institutions, they are watching Brits fill up their faculties as part of the well-publicised 'brain drain' across the Atlantic. And though Jaguar is now owned by the American company Ford and Wal-Mart has swallowed Asda, at least Burger King is owned by a British firm.</p> <p>None the less, our tendency to reach for the transatlantic hotline may reflect a feeling of national inferiority, warns Richard Hoggart, author of First and Last Things . 'We are in the middle of a serious period of self doubt, of doing ourselves down. So people come over the pond to help us out. Whether they are actually more successful or not remains to be seen.'</p> <p>Some imports have been high-profile disasters: Michael O'Neill resigned on his first day as chief executive and 'saviour' of Barclays Bank, citing ill-health before getting the plane back to California. The Bank of Scotland ended its dealings with Pat Robertson, a right-wing evangelical Christian, after he shared his views on the evils of homosexuality.</p> <p>Even some of the Americans think our Yankophilia is overdone. 'Brits can be quite romantic about how efficient we are and about our business practices,' says Mather.</p> <p>And American directness can cause problems, says Gosling. 'In the US, enthusiasm is seen as a good thing; here it seems like you are trying too hard. If you prepare for a meeting, people seem to think you are pushy.' She also says fundraising can be challenging in a country where discussion on money 'leaves people's fingers dirty. The British don't like talking about money.'</p> <p>Mather is glad to be in Scotland, where the locals have their own brand of brash. 'In England you are never supposed to say what you think, but everyone is supposed to know what you think. In Scotland, like America, you can actually say it.'</p> <p>Even our language is under attack as never before. US spellings are gaining ground, helped by the hegemony of West Coast software firms and computer spell-checkers. Color will surely be in the Oxford English Dictionary soon.</p> <p>The outposts of US culture - huge bookshops, coffee shop chains, long working hours, fast talking, high divorce rates, 'dress down' Fridays - are everywhere. The number of coffee shops has increased tenfold in five years. Friends and Frasier are ubiquitous. And US policies and phrases have been adopted wholesale by the Blair Government.</p> <p>Can we stem the invasion? And do we really want to? Perhaps we rather like economic success, people who talk to strangers and good coffee after all.</p> <p>One American director of the UK branch of a US company captured the fears - or hopes? - of many.</p> <p>'Everybody says it is not like America yet,' he said. 'But it will be. It will be.'</p> <p><b>One Yank and it works...</b></p> <p>\u0095 When British Airways was feeling the heat from its budget-fare rivals, what did it do/ It invented its own cheapo offshoot, Go, and then had to call on an American, Barbara Cassani, to take charge of the enterprise.</p> <p>\u0095 Michael Kaiser's appointment as head of the Royal opera House is only one of many US inroads into the British culture.

      "bodyText": "Overpaid, oversexed and over here: the Brits have seen the arrival of Yanks as a mixed blessing ever since the friendly GI invasion of the Second World War. Now, just as their airmen are heading home from UK bases after 'winning' the Cold War, battalions more of our US cousins are arriving, taking over historic institutions, businesses and neighbourhoods. There are 200,000 US citizens living in the UK, twice the number of 10 years ago, despite a sharp drop in military personnel. Counter-colonisation is in progress. US luminaries who have been parachuted in include Michael Kaiser, head of the Royal Opera House; George Mitchell, harbinger of peace in Northern Ireland; and Barbara Cassani, head of British Airways' cheap fares offshoot, Go When we are in trouble it seems we can't help looking west. When the Jubilee Line extension hit the rocks, in rode Cliff Mumm, a South Dakotan from Bechtel Corp, who took over and finished the job. The image of the American is someone who will Get the Job Done, while we Brits just fiddle about. 'The British take on every project like a game of chess,' says Mumm. 'They worry endlessly about rules and procedure. But when we got this job we put together an Anglo-American team and said \"Let's do what it takes\".' George Mitchell, one of the world's smoothest diplomats, tells a similar story. 'I don't want to take anything away from the British and the Irish,' he has said. 'They are warm and wise and articulate. But sometimes you get the feeling these guys are so articulate they could go on talking for ever. Americans are more likely to say \"Enough already, let's get the thing done\".' It is difficult to argue with success. The US economy is in the longest expansion of its history. It is the richest nation there has ever been. Its stock market is propping up the global currency exchange market. America dominates in sport, economics, military power. A survey conducted by BT shows senior British business people agreed that a 'can do' attitude was the most important determinant of commercial success. Sixty per cent thought American business culture exemplified this attitude. Only 10 per cent thought it applied to home-grown companies. There are some jobs Americans are likely to be better suited to in any case, simply because the US is further ahead. Raising money, for example, is virtually a US monopoly. Trained in a nation which gives more money to charity than the rest of the world put together, and where universities, schools and arts companies have rarely been state-funded, money-getters from across the pond are in huge demand. Alice Gosling, the Illinois-born and raised fundraiser for Lincoln College, Oxford, says British institutions are adapting to a new, harsher financial world. 'In the US, colleges have been aggressively fundraising for 25 years. Here, development is fairly new in lots of areas - higher education, museums, the ballet. The industry is simply more developed in the US.' Some are worried about the influx of Americans into the British cultural world. Scottish Ballet has an American artistic director, Robert North. The principal guest conductor to the Royal Scottish National Orchestra is New Yorker Marin Alsop. The South Bank is being recast by Oregon architect Rick Mather for \u00a370 million. And - most shocking - the BBC Symphony Orchestra has appointed American conductor Leonard Slatkin. Which means the Last Night of the Proms is to be led by a native of a nation which fought us for its independence. For years, the Brits have been able to cede most other areas of superiority to the Americans, confident at least in our greater culture and knowledge: let them eat their McDonalds, we sneered, at least we understand Mahler. What now? Even if we can accept the expertise Americans bring to areas such as fundraising, and the diversity of the international arts scene, the Americanisation of other areas can cause the hackles of the British bulldog to rise. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England - which sets our mortgage rates - includes a US economist, DeAnne Julius. She insists the trend we are seeing is less Americanisation, more internationalisation. 'There has been a globalisation of human capability. There are more Americans and more people of other nationalities too,' Julius says. 'All fields are now more global - business, the arts, sports.' Two of the most powerful magnets for Americans are the City of London and the English language. London is a major financial centre, US finance firms are powerful, so it is inevitable that the Square Mile will be filled with New York twangs. Half of all US investment in Europe is in the UK. London is a bridgehead for many American companies which also operate on the Continent. But the traffic isn't one way. While we fret about Americans taking over our august institutions, they are watching Brits fill up their faculties as part of the well-publicised 'brain drain' across the Atlantic. And though Jaguar is now owned by the American company Ford and Wal-Mart has swallowed Asda, at least Burger King is owned by a British firm. None the less, our tendency to reach for the transatlantic hotline may reflect a feeling of national inferiority, warns Richard Hoggart, author of First and Last Things . 'We are in the middle of a serious period of self doubt, of doing ourselves down. So people come over the pond to help us out. Whether they are actually more successful or not remains to be seen.' Some imports have been high-profile disasters: Michael O'Neill resigned on his first day as chief executive and 'saviour' of Barclays Bank, citing ill-health before getting the plane back to California. The Bank of Scotland ended its dealings with Pat Robertson, a right-wing evangelical Christian, after he shared his views on the evils of homosexuality. Even some of the Americans think our Yankophilia is overdone. 'Brits can be quite romantic about how efficient we are and about our business practices,' says Mather. And American directness can cause problems, says Gosling. 'In the US, enthusiasm is seen as a good thing; here it seems like you are trying too hard. If you prepare for a meeting, people seem to think you are pushy.' She also says fundraising can be challenging in a country where discussion on money 'leaves people's fingers dirty. The British don't like talking about money.' Mather is glad to be in Scotland, where the locals have their own brand of brash. 'In England you are never supposed to say what you think, but everyone is supposed to know what you think. In Scotland, like America, you can actually say it.' Even our language is under attack as never before. US spellings are gaining ground, helped by the hegemony of West Coast software firms and computer spell-checkers. Color will surely be in the Oxford English Dictionary soon. The outposts of US culture - huge bookshops, coffee shop chains, long working hours, fast talking, high divorce rates, 'dress down' Fridays - are everywhere. The number of coffee shops has increased tenfold in five years. Friends and Frasier are ubiquitous. And US policies and phrases have been adopted wholesale by the Blair Government. Can we stem the invasion? And do we really want to? Perhaps we rather like economic success, people who talk to strangers and good coffee after all. One American director of the UK branch of a US company captured the fears - or hopes? - of many. 'Everybody says it is not like America yet,' he said. 'But it will be. It will be.' One Yank and it works... \u0095 When British Airways was feeling the heat from its budget-fare rivals, what did it do/ It invented its own cheapo offshoot, Go, and then had to call on an American, Barbara Cassani, to take charge of the enterprise. \u0095 Michael Kaiser's appointment as head of the Royal opera House is only one of many US inroads into the British culture. Dictionaries contain ever more Americanisations, and even the Last Night of the Proms is now to be led by an American. \u0095 The strong points of British culture are rapidly falling to the transatlantic invader. London's South Bank, a hub of the artisitc world, is to be recast at a cost of \u00a370 million. And the man for the job, architect Rick Mather, comes all the way from Oregon.

      "body": "<p> <strong>1: Making or recieving cash-in-hand payments</strong><br> You may do this for building work, child-minding, cleaning or gardening. Many of these payments will be quite above board - your gardener, for instance, may be registered self-employed and declaring those payments. But there appears to be widespread tax evasion over the payment of nannies. Only 23,000 people are on the Simplified Deduction Scheme for paying domestics, even though 50 per cent of mothers of pre-school children go out to work. Many parents say they pay their nanny about \u00a380 a week, producing a salary just below the \u00a34,335 personal allowance for income tax. But if mother and nanny fall out, the parents can end up getting a knock on the door from the Inland Revenue later on. </p> <p> Another difficult area is the payment of cleaners. Although the Inland Revenue is hot on the tail of office cleaners, domestic cleaners have largely been ignored. Most cleaners bear the hallmarks of being employees - they work in your house, you fix their hours, you pay them a fixed hourly rate, and they use your equipment. There is a way round it if you want to suggest they are self-employed (and therefore that sorting out tax is their responsibility). If you accept that Mrs Mopp could send round her daughter instead, you would be agreeing that you are buying the service rather than employing the individual. But, for the time being, most people do not have to worry too much. Many of the 'ladies that do' earn less than the personal allowance - and the Revenue has bigger fish to fry. </p> <p>You can theoretically get into big trouble with Customs &amp; Excise by making a payment to, say, a builder, when you know that he is not declaring that payment for VAT, but Customs rarely goes after the person who paid the money. </p> <p> <strong>2: Breaking the customs rules on tobacco, drink and perfumes</strong><br> If you are buying for your own consumption, there is no duty to pay on alcohol bought in other EU countries. If you are selling it on to others, you should pay UK excise duty. So keep your daughter's wedding invitation to hand as proof, if you are shopping in Calais for the drinks you will offer guests on the happy day. </p> <p> <strong>3: Understating your taxable income</strong><br> The Inland Revenue is constantly on the look-out for self-employed workers who exaggerate their expenses or understate their earnings in order to pay less tax. It can levy penalties equal to 100 per cent of the tax you tried to evade if it feels you were deliberately trying to cheat. In very rare cases of fraud it brings a criminal prosecution on the charge of 'cheating'. In 1998/99, it launched 52 criminal prosecutions. 'The vast majority of self-employed people are incredibly fair,' says Richard Murphy, of accountant Murphy Deeks Nolan. 'But the Inland Revenue does not like the self-employed and doesn't understand self-employment.' </p> <p>In 1998/99, the Revenue launched nearly 250,000 'inquiries' into information put on to tax returns. Completely innocent people find themselves under suspicion. Murphy adds: 'Some people who choose to be self-employed don't want to make a lots of money. But the Inland Revenue staff are taught the economic view that people are profit-maximisers.' </p> <p> <strong>4: Doing undeclared work:</strong><br> Many is the time that someone drifts into becoming self-employed and does not get round to sorting out their tax for several years. Accountants regularly find that a new client went freelance six or seven years ago but has not paid a penny in tax during that time. The Inland Revenue has used the 1996 introduction of self-assessment to get tougher with people who do declare themselves as taxpayers - but it has not done a great deal to tackle people who stay outside the system. </p> <p>In most sectors of the economy, you can remain undetected for quite a long time. The toughest areas are, arguably, journalism and the media. Newspapers, for instance, have to give lists of their freelance contributors to the Revenue - but if you are a self-employed therapist, garden designer, Yoga teacher or computer consultant, the Revenue may have very little information about you. </p> <p><strong>5: Giving away your home to avoid paying for residential care</strong><br> The country is being turned into a nation of 'cheating grannies', according to former Minister of Welfare Reform Frank Field. Most people resent the possibility that the home they spent their life struggling to pay for has to be sold to pay for nursing home fees. So there is widespread activity among the elderly to avoid this possibility. If you share your home with others, you are less likely to be forced to sell it. You certainly cannot be required to sell if your spouse or partner lives there. If you gave your house to your daughter years before going into a home, you are probably in the clear. But sooner or later, local authorities will start pursuing the elderly in bigger numbers to recover a house that was given away only to avoid paying nursing home fees. </p> <p> <strong>6: Fiddling expenses at work</strong><br> Most people will consider cheating in one form or another. Even Hillary Clinton has been accused of inflating bills to clients when she was an attorney in Arkansas. Many accountants, solicitors and other professionals who charge by the hour are encouraged to overstate their hours so that their firms' bills are higher. This may not be the mainstream of the black economy - but it is yet more proof that education and being middle-class do not preclude you from cheating. </p> <p> Many of the 2 million company car users go on mad dashes in March to get their mileage above the crucial thresholds for reducing the taxable 'benefit in kind'. This practice is a culturally accepted form of fraud usually practised by middle managers. You should keep a log of your business travel to ensure you have proof. The Revenue can pick up irregularities in this area when it performs its audits of employers' records. It aims to visit each employer once in every five-year period. If it finds that there are not enough driving logs or receipts for meals, taxis, hotels or other expenses, it might charge the employer 'back tax'. In most cases, the employer does not ask the employees to pay. </p> <p><strong>7: Exploiting charitable status</strong><br> Another favourite of middle-class scam is to get charitable status for a business activity and so remove the need to pay income tax. The trick is to convince the Charity Commissioners that you are involved in a recognised charitable purpose such as the alleviation of poverty or promotion of education. Accountancy firms often advise clients on how they can describe their trading activities in terms of which sound pious enough to apparently meet the criteria. 'The Charity Commissioners do not do a very good job in checking,' says Murphy. 'The accounting regulations on charities are horrible. Most charities cannot comply with them. And only one in six church accounts complies with the law. This area could be abused.'</p> <p> <strong>8: Milking Government grants</strong><br> The Government is increasingly trying to encourage local communities to develop their own regeneration plans. Millions of pounds of government, European Union and other money has been provided to help people in deprived areas - in Liverpool, depressed parts of London and bombed-out areas of Belfast, remote rural locations and other areas of need. Much of this money has been either deliberately or negligently used. In many cases, people have appointed themselves project directors with large expense accounts - but, at the end of the day, little of any lasting value has emerged. </p> <p> <strong> 9: Not declaring your assets when making a benefits claim </strong><br> If you have more than \u00a33,000 in savings or other assets, your ability to claim JobSeekers' Allowance, income support and other means-tested benefits will be reduced. (People getting residential care have the higher threshold of \u00a310,000). So you will be asked what your savings are. The truth is that the Benefits Agency or local authority officials may never discover the facts if you do not tell them. They are very unlikely to find out about the \u00a31,000 you have stashed away in a building society. Many claimants may find themselves 'forgetting' some details when they apply for benefit. Some people find themselves being caught out, however, after they fall out with a partner, relative or someone else who knows that they have been cheating. People are often shopped to the Department of Social Security. </p> <p> <strong> 10: Working while claiming benefits</strong> <br> This is much easier to do than you might think - especially if you are doing little bits of freelance to get yourself back to work or if your income fluctuates. If you lost your job a few months ago and are now being offered an evening's work in a bar, you will probably dislike the idea that you should declare all to the Benefits Agency and lose benefit as a result. This type of 'poverty trap' encourages people to break the rules. Since April last year, the Revenue and the Benefits Agency have had new powers to share information on individuals with each other. </p> <p><strong>The cleaner claiming benefit</strong></p> <p>'She was the best cleaning lady I ever had,' says Cathy, an executive in a publishing house. 'I paid her cash - but we never broached the subject of tax and National Insurance. I felt uncomfortable - but I also felt she would be uncomfortable if I asked too many questions. </p> <p>'I used to hear tales of her life. She had a son whose relationship fell apart. She discovered that his child, her grandchild, was being abused by his ex-wife's new partner. So she took him in to look after him. But her former daughter-in-law reported her to the DSS. Then my cleaning lady had to admit to me that she had been claiming disability benefit for a bad back. She was very matter-of-fact and honest about it. </p> <p>'I didn't begrudge her. She and her family lived in a council house and there was no way they were wealthy people. I think the extra money made a big difference to them. I really liked her; she was a force for good. She also cared for her neighbour's child, the child of a teenage mother. If those children hadn't been looked after by her, presumably someone would have had to be paid to do it. </p> <p>'I certainly didn't see her as a leach on society.'</p>",

Much of this money has been either deliberately or negligently used. In many cases, people have appointed themselves project directors with large expense accounts - but, at the end of the day, little of any lasting value has emerged. 9: Not declaring your assets when making a benefits claim If you have more than \u00a33,000 in savings or other assets, your ability to claim JobSeekers' Allowance, income support and other means-tested benefits will be reduced. (People getting residential care have the higher threshold of \u00a310,000). So you will be asked what your savings are. The truth is that the Benefits Agency or local authority officials may never discover the facts if you do not tell them. They are very unlikely to find out about the \u00a31,000 you have stashed away in a building society. Many claimants may find themselves 'forgetting' some details when they apply for benefit. Some people find themselves being caught out, however, after they fall out with a partner, relative or someone else who knows that they have been cheating. People are often shopped to the Department of Social Security. 10: Working while claiming benefits This is much easier to do than you might think - especially if you are doing little bits of freelance to get yourself back to work or if your income fluctuates. If you lost your job a few months ago and are now being offered an evening's work in a bar, you will probably dislike the idea that you should declare all to the Benefits Agency and lose benefit as a result. This type of 'poverty trap' encourages people to break the rules. Since April last year, the Revenue and the Benefits Agency have had new powers to share information on individuals with each other. The cleaner claiming benefit 'She was the best cleaning lady I ever had,' says Cathy, an executive in a publishing house. 'I paid her cash - but we never broached the subject of tax and National Insurance. I felt uncomfortable - but I also felt she would be uncomfortable if I asked too many questions. 'I used to hear tales of her life. She had a son whose relationship fell apart. She discovered that his child, her grandchild, was being abused by his ex-wife's new partner. So she took him in to look after him. But her former daughter-in-law reported her to the DSS. Then my cleaning lady had to admit to me that she had been claiming disability benefit for a bad back. She was very matter-of-fact and honest about it. 'I didn't begrudge her. She and her family lived in a council house and there was no way they were wealthy people. I think the extra money made a big difference to them. I really liked her; she was a force for good. She also cared for her neighbour's child, the child of a teenage mother. If those children hadn't been looked after by her, presumably someone would have had to be paid to do it. 'I certainly didn't see her as a leach on society.'",

She shares offices in London's Portabello Road with two other architects and, since having Joe, works a four-day week. This means her earnings have dropped. She and her husband would like to have another child but she is not sure how she would manage financially if they did. </p> <p>As she is self-employed, she gets only the minimum maternity benefits so, over the past year, she says, she has used up quite a lot of her savings. She now has \u00a312,000 left in an instant access account with HSBC. The only other money that she is putting aside is her child benefit which goes into a savings account in her son's name. This is for his university education. When she returns to full-time working, her income will improve but she is aware that architects are vulnerable to recession so cannot be confident that she will always earn a good salary.</p> <p>She is now starting to worry about a pension as she has made no provision for her retirement. She says: 'I looked into it about two years ago but I didn't get any further.' She had been attracted by the idea that, rather than contributing to a pension, she would buy a house to renovate and rent out. She explains: 'I wanted to think about an alternative approach.' As an architect, she felt she could use her skills to advantage. And, knowing she would have more time at home with a child, she thought she might be able to invest her time usefully refurbishing a property. But then the baby arrived and she did nothing about it. She has not even had the chance to get to grips with her own home which still needs a lot of work. The plan is that her husband's salary pays the mortgage and bills and only he has a credit card. Victoria pays for the cr\u00e8che and half the food bill. Any left over is put into a fund to restore their own home.</p> <p> But it is the lack of a pension that worries her most. 'That is my main concern,' she says. She is still interested in the idea of funding her retirement by buying an investment property to do up and rent out, but she is not sure if this is the best way. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Julia Lord, certified financial planner and managing director of Cavendish Financial Management in Cardiff.</strong></p> <p>Victoria should forget the investment property idea until she has considered basic financial planning and ensured she will be financially independent. She seems particularly vulnerable, with little savings, no pension, children and a hazy idea of what she wants. </p> <p>I believe it is a big mistake to consider investment property as a replacement for a basic pension as there are too many problems. The rent will be taxed at her highest rate. She appears to have a major job in restoring her own home so how can she practically utilise her time refurbishing another property as well? And she would need more than \u00a312,000 to get a reasonable property worth renting out in London. She should start a pension of at least \u00a3250 per month - she is late in starting a pension at 33. She needs a flexible pension that does not penalise her for stopping or starting her contributions and one with a waiver of premium benefit to maintain her contributions if she is ill. There is no mention of life insurance, serious illness insurance or any kind of income replacement and I regard family protection as essential. For income replacement she needs to work out the minimum income required if she could not earn, to pay for Joe's creche and her other outgoings. </p> <p> She should discuss finances with her husband and calculate their requirements for life assurance and critical illness cover based on their current and desired lifestyles. For the longer-term, they should invest the child benefit, and for themselves, in stock market-related areas. It seems that, as things appear disorganised, there is no will in place and I suggest that this is done as a matter of urgency. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Ian Millward, investment marketing manager of Bath-based Chase de Vere</strong></p> <p>As money is needed for work on their home and maybe more children, Victoria really needs a 'rainy day' fund. Ideally, she could save \u00a33,000 in a Mini Cash ISA with Smile Internet Bank (smile.co.uk), paying 6.75% tax-free on \u00a31 or more. If Internet access is hard she could use Coventry Building Society which pays 6.55%.</p> <p>The remaining \u00a39,000 could be with Bristol &amp; West which is paying 6.80% gross from 1 February.</p> <p>For Joe's university education they should consider stocks and shares, probabaly through regular savings. They could start a tracker fund such as L&amp;G UK Index although, as the timescale is more than 15 years, she could consider the spicier Framlington NetNet fund.</p> <p>Pension plans must be flexible. Stakeholder pensions - the government's new low cost and flexible scheme - won't be introduced until April 2001 but she must start a pension now. Suggestions are Scottish Mutual and Scottish Equitable. If she has a lump sum she could also 'carry forward' and 'carry back' for past years' unused contributions, as this may be abolished. Victoria really should consider life assurance. For around \u00a317 a month she could be insured for \u00a3200,000 for the next 25 years. Try L&amp;G and Scottish Provident.</p> <p>Victoria needs to decide if critical illness or health insurance is affordable. To add critical illness on to the life cover increases the premiums to around \u00a362 a month and suggestions are BUPA Health or CGU Health.

      "body": "<p>Anybody who is about to buy or sell a property in London deserves as much sympathy as they can get. They are about to plunge into the estate agent-infested waters of bidding wars, gazumping and over-your-head mortgages. </p> <p>I am now well away from all that - buying a place in a remote area of France, and my dealings with a French estate agent have (so far) been a walk in the park compared with the angst-ridden wranglings I suffered at the hands of their London counterparts when selling my flat in Battersea six months ago. </p> <p>The first major difference between British and French property purchasing is, obviously, the price. It sounds absurd, but for approximately two-thirds of the price of the aforementioned flat, I am about to become the proud owner of an isolated but nonetheless entire hamlet in sunnier climes. The property consists of five buildings (admittedly, some are in need of substantial repair) and 60 acres of land (though on the side of a mountain and of little use to anybody apart from the Forestry Commission). And no, it's probably not quite as well served as Battersea in terms of commuting, general transport and local facilities. There is no electricity or gas, the water comes from a spring and getting to the nearest town involves 7km of 'off-roading' or a good day's walk with emergency rations. Curiously, there seems to be a telephone line, but at this stage we are not sure how. Piffling details aside, however, I do feel we are getting rather more for our money. </p> <p>We viewed the hamlet with all the suspicions of those jaded by the horror stories of back home. Before we even allowed ourselves to feel interested, let alone excited, we wanted to know whether anyone else had made an offer on the property, resigned to the fact that we would walk away if anybody had so much as sniffed around. Fran\u00e7oise, the estate agent, was horrified by our attitude. In France, once an offer has been made and accepted, both sides are contractually bound to complete the sale. The very fact that we were being shown the property meant that nobody else had put in an official offer. </p> <p>In London, it's a very different story. Rumours abound of people being asked to make an offer on a property before they could even make an appointment to see it. As a recent vendor, it seemed normal practice to wait until several people had made firm offers before eventually closing the doors to further viewers. There are no scruples, and gazumping is perfectly acceptable behaviour. Indeed, the initial valuation on my flat was made in the confident expectation that, once an adrenaline-fuelled bidding war was in full swing, it would increase by at least \u00a35,000. </p> <p>The most significant difference appears to be that once an offer is made in France, both estate agent and vendor regard this as tantamount to a done deal. Furthermore, an initial signing of the contract can be done by fax (accompanied by a 10 per cent deposit to the notaire). These formalities need take only two or three days, as they did in our case. </p> <p>A secondary reason for long, tense delays in the UK is the time it takes for a surveyor to give a property his seal of approval.

      "bodyText": "Anybody who is about to buy or sell a property in London deserves as much sympathy as they can get. They are about to plunge into the estate agent-infested waters of bidding wars, gazumping and over-your-head mortgages. I am now well away from all that - buying a place in a remote area of France, and my dealings with a French estate agent have (so far) been a walk in the park compared with the angst-ridden wranglings I suffered at the hands of their London counterparts when selling my flat in Battersea six months ago. The first major difference between British and French property purchasing is, obviously, the price. It sounds absurd, but for approximately two-thirds of the price of the aforementioned flat, I am about to become the proud owner of an isolated but nonetheless entire hamlet in sunnier climes. The property consists of five buildings (admittedly, some are in need of substantial repair) and 60 acres of land (though on the side of a mountain and of little use to anybody apart from the Forestry Commission). And no, it's probably not quite as well served as Battersea in terms of commuting, general transport and local facilities. There is no electricity or gas, the water comes from a spring and getting to the nearest town involves 7km of 'off-roading' or a good day's walk with emergency rations. Curiously, there seems to be a telephone line, but at this stage we are not sure how. Piffling details aside, however, I do feel we are getting rather more for our money. We viewed the hamlet with all the suspicions of those jaded by the horror stories of back home. Before we even allowed ourselves to feel interested, let alone excited, we wanted to know whether anyone else had made an offer on the property, resigned to the fact that we would walk away if anybody had so much as sniffed around. Fran\u00e7oise, the estate agent, was horrified by our attitude. In France, once an offer has been made and accepted, both sides are contractually bound to complete the sale. The very fact that we were being shown the property meant that nobody else had put in an official offer. In London, it's a very different story. Rumours abound of people being asked to make an offer on a property before they could even make an appointment to see it. As a recent vendor, it seemed normal practice to wait until several people had made firm offers before eventually closing the doors to further viewers. There are no scruples, and gazumping is perfectly acceptable behaviour. Indeed, the initial valuation on my flat was made in the confident expectation that, once an adrenaline-fuelled bidding war was in full swing, it would increase by at least \u00a35,000. The most significant difference appears to be that once an offer is made in France, both estate agent and vendor regard this as tantamount to a done deal. Furthermore, an initial signing of the contract can be done by fax (accompanied by a 10 per cent deposit to the notaire). These formalities need take only two or three days, as they did in our case. A secondary reason for long, tense delays in the UK is the time it takes for a surveyor to give a property his seal of approval. Mortgage lenders will insist on a valuation by a surveyor and it seems common practice to get the property checked out by an independent one, even if no money lending is involved. In France, it seems common practice to accept the judgment of the estate agent and your own eye. Should that prove too great a leap of faith, you can have a mason or a 'maitre d'oeuvres' look at the property. The 'expert immobilier' exists mostly for commercial sites and is rarely called in for residential property, although an 'expertise' or full structural survey could provide complete peace of mind if added cost is not an issue. In either case, approximately three weeks' waiting time is removed from the process. We decided that there was no need for a survey which we may, of course, live to regret.

If you cashed in now, you would get \u00a310,680; if you cashed it when your first son goes to university, say in 2005, you might get \u00a319,000 if it performs well; on maturity five years later, you could get more than \u00a330,000. </p> <p>The problem is that you bought the policy for a 25-year commitment and now need to use it for a shorter one. </p> <p>You could borrow from Standard Life against the policy when your sons go to university. Today, you could have \u00a38,434 at base rate plus 2.5 per cent, making the interest rate 8.25 per cent. You repay the loan when the policy matures. Alternatively, your sons could fund their education with student loans, which you could repay when the policy matured. </p> <p><strong> Making up for lost years</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Is there any point in my son paying three missing years of National Insurance contributions, amounting to \u00a3861, when, at 52, his state pension so far stands at \u00a325. I think he should pay but he says</strong></p> <p><strong>not worth </strong></p> <p>&lt;</p> <p><strong> is right?</strong></p> <p><strong> MJ, Rottingdean </strong> </p> <p>It depends how long he lives after starting the State pension at 65. Everyone is allowed to miss about five years' contributions and still earn the full state pension. Your son needs to have made National Insurance contributions or earned credits (perhaps his earnings were below the threshold for contributions, or he was on a state benefit) for 90 per cent of his working life. </p> <p>If he works from 18 to 65, his working life is 47 years and, to meet the 90 per cent rule, needs contributions for 42 years. So, if your son is three years short because he worked for only 44 years, he still gets the full pension. But if he will be three years short of 42, he will get 93 per cent of the state pension. </p> <p>On today's rates, this gives him \u00a33,228 instead of \u00a33,471 a year, a difference of \u00a3243. If restoring this shortfall costs \u00a3861, it will take him 3.5 years to earn it back, so it will have been worth paying if he is still alive at the age of 68 years and six months. </p> <p><strong> One mortgage too many</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> In May 1995, I took out a \u00a354,000 mortgage jointly with my wife to buy a house in Manchester costing \u00a360,000. It is now worth about \u00a373,000. In June 1997, we separated and my ex-wife has paid the mortgage since August 1998.

But I am hindered by the outstanding joint mortgage with my wife. Who can I ask for help?</strong></p> <p><strong> AE, Harlow </strong> </p> <p>Ask your brother if he would take his money in instalments. Under the government Rent-A-Room scheme, you can earn \u00a34,250 a year tax-free from a lodger. You could pay your brother his \u00a329,000 within seven years. </p> <p>Or perhaps you could mortgage the bungalow for \u00a345,000; give your brother \u00a329,000 and your wife \u00a316,000 to reduce her debt to \u00a338,000, with an agreement on eventually splitting the equity. On her earnings plus maintenance, she could just afford a mortgage in her own name, releasing you to take out the new mortgage. </p> <p>Discuss this with several lenders directly or talk to a few mortgage brokers. Brokers are listed in telephone directories but pick those that have taken mortgage exams. </p> <p><strong> Share sale lost me money</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Recently I instructed Dresdner RCM Investment Trusts to transfer a number of shares in its Charter European Trust into an Isa in my wife's name.

This timescale is the number of days demanded by Stock Exchange rules and financial regulation: selling shares takes five days before the cash is available; a cheque is then sent to the Isa administrator, who waits three days for the cheque to clear; when the cheque has cleared, the administrator leaves a four-day cooling-off period before buying new investment trust shares for the Isa. </p> <p>For the whole period, you are at the mercy of share price movements which could, of course, go as easily in your favour as against. A financial adviser, if you had used one, should have alerted you to the danger, although it may be some consolation that the shares now stand at 656p. </p> <p><em> Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

If he works from 18 to 65, his working life is 47 years and, to meet the 90 per cent rule, needs contributions for 42 years. So, if your son is three years short because he worked for only 44 years, he still gets the full pension. But if he will be three years short of 42, he will get 93 per cent of the state pension. On today's rates, this gives him \u00a33,228 instead of \u00a33,471 a year, a difference of \u00a3243. If restoring this shortfall costs \u00a3861, it will take him 3.5 years to earn it back, so it will have been worth paying if he is still alive at the age of 68 years and six months. One mortgage too many In May 1995, I took out a \u00a354,000 mortgage jointly with my wife to buy a house in Manchester costing \u00a360,000. It is now worth about \u00a373,000. In June 1997, we separated and my ex-wife has paid the mortgage since August 1998. I moved b my mother' &lt; low and still live there. My mother died last March, leaving this three-bedroom home, worth \u00a358,000, to my brother and me; my brother wants the cash from his half share, so I need to remortgage to buy him out. But I am hindered by the outstanding joint mortgage with my wife. Who can I ask for help? AE, Harlow Ask your brother if he would take his money in instalments. Under the government Rent-A-Room scheme, you can earn \u00a34,250 a year tax-free from a lodger. You could pay your brother his \u00a329,000 within seven years. Or perhaps you could mortgage the bungalow for \u00a345,000; give your brother \u00a329,000 and your wife \u00a316,000 to reduce her debt to \u00a338,000, with an agreement on eventually splitting the equity. On her earnings plus maintenance, she could just afford a mortgage in her own name, releasing you to take out the new mortgage. Discuss this with several lenders directly or talk to a few mortgage brokers. Brokers are listed in telephone directories but pick those that have taken mortgage exams. Share sale lost me money Recently I instructed Dresdner RCM Investment Trusts to transfer a number of shares in its Charter European Trust into an Isa in my wife's name. The shares were sold on 11 November at 553p each but it was not until nine days later, when they were worth 588p, that they ought back &lt; e Isa, thus incurring a loss of \u00a3440. How can such a delay be justified when dealing with a product which we are told can be bought and sold quickly? EC, Sunderland You may have regarded this as a family tidying-up exercise but you still get caught in the technicalities of share-dealing. This timescale is the number of days demanded by Stock Exchange rules and financial regulation: selling shares takes five days before the cash is available; a cheque is then sent to the Isa administrator, who waits three days for the cheque to clear; when the cheque has cleared, the administrator leaves a four-day cooling-off period before buying new investment trust shares for the Isa. For the whole period, you are at the mercy of share price movements which could, of course, go as easily in your favour as against. A financial adviser, if you had used one, should have alerted you to the danger, although it may be some consolation that the shares now stand at 656p.

Help the Aged's helpline is constantly bombarded by callers who suddenly have \u00a350,000 to \u00a3100,000 to invest - perhaps after selling the family home. </p> <p>The first calamity to avoid is trouble with the Benefits Agency. In most cases the elderly person is assessed by Social Services to agree a care package and 'means-test' their resources. If you are managing their assets, you are responsible for declaring all their income and capital. But, says Sam Harney of the Reading Community Welfare Rights Unit, people who get 'power of attorney' - taking over responsibility for the person's property - often face problems: 'They get into terrible trouble with the Benefits Agency because they didn't realise that the person had a works pension, for instance. They then become liable for an overpayment of welfare benefits. We have had a fair amount of success in winning appeals against this, but it is difficult.' Appeals are usually won if there are extenuating circumstances, such as difficulty in obtaining information. </p> <p>An alternative is being made an 'appointee'. Appointees have the power to manage the assets, but the final responsibility still lies with the old person. The Benefits Agency has fewer rights to pursue appointees. </p> <p>When investing for an old person, you need to make sure some of the money is easily accessible to pay monthly care fees. You will also want the investment to grow. A place in a nursing home often costs \u00a320,000 a year, and a place in a residential home can easily cost \u00a315,000. So the proceeds of the house sale can be swallowed up in three or four years. Philip Spiers, of the Nursing Home Fees Agency (NHFA), which runs Help the Aged's helpline, says: 'The people with the power of attorney often just don't take advice and leave the money on deposit. When it runs out, they find that Social Services caps the amount it pays a week, that there is a shortfall and that the home owner will not reduce the fee.' He says that in the home counties, for instance, local authorities typically pay a maximum of \u00a3320 a week for nursing home fees, although the actual cost is likely to be \u00a380 more. </p> <p>So, how should you invest that \u00a350,000 to \u00a3100,000? Justin Modray of financial adviser Chase de Vere says the shorter the life expectancy, the less you will want to be exposed to risk. The most cautious response is to put most of it on deposit, where the capital is guaranteed but the return is likely to be low. Even for cautious people, some of the money could go into a cash-Isa: up to \u00a33,000 can be put into cash before 6 April under the individual savings account rules. This ruse is worth taking advantage of before the end of the financial year, since next year's limit will be just \u00a31,000. (See the best buy tables on page 14 for the best rates). Modray suggests that even cautious investors 'should put some of the investment into the stock markets'. </p> <p>For people with a longer life expectancy, Modray says: 'You will want to make the money work for you, so you will take a bit of risk.' He suggests with-profits bonds as a fairly cautious way of investing in the stock markets, as well as corporate bond Isas. But he suggests that 'the first two or three years' money could be kept aside in cash'. </p> <p>Spiers, of the NHFA, suggests another element to the investment plan - the purchase of a long-term care insurance policy - so that fees are definitely covered. Costs vary depending on the terms of the policy, but Spiers says expect about \u00a325,000 to \u00a330,000 in most cases. 'Always leave a bit on deposit for little extras,' he says. Home residents are often expected to pay for their own television set, telephone and other routine expenses. As people get older, there are likely to be more medical costs too. </p> <p>Some financial advisers offer a free initial meeting. Help the Aged, through the NHFA, offers a free 'personal report' outlining how you might invest the sum. It hopes that people will then buy the products through them so that the commission can be split between the NHFA and the charity. But people can ask for the report and then buy the products themselves or through someone who will rebate the commission if they wish. </p> <p> Age Concern: 0800 009966; Help the Aged's Care Fees Advisory Services helpline: 0500 767476; NHFA website: <a href=\"http://www.nhfa.co.uk.\">www.nhfa.co.uk.</a> </p> <p><strong>Investments for older people's funds</strong></p> <p><strong> Low-risk investments</strong> </p> <p><strong> Instant access accounts: </strong> from building societies and banks <br> <strong> Internet/postal accounts:</strong> often offer slightly better rates <br> <strong> Notice accounts:</strong> rates are higher to reflect notice period <br> <strong> Period accounts and bonds: </strong> usually fixed for 1,2 or 3 years <br> <strong> National Savings:</strong> range of products, many low-risk <br> <strong> Cash Isas:</strong> tax-free accounts, some very attractive rates </p> <p><strong> Medium-risk investments</strong></p> <p><strong>With-profits policies:</strong> look for hidden high charges <br> <strong> Guaranteed income bonds:</strong> fixed return, main risk is that inflation rises while you are locked in <br> <strong> Guaranteed equity bond</strong> : no risk to capital usually; often hidden high charges; inflation risk <br> <strong> Corporate bond Isa: </strong> tax-free plan based on fixed-interest products; inflation risk </p> <p><strong> High-risk investments</strong> </p> <p><strong> Index-tracking unit trusts:</strong> a relatively cautious way to start stock market investments <br> <strong> Equity Isas:</strong> tax-free stock market investments; start with unit trusts </p> <p><em>Note: Be wary of risky equity investments - such as direct shareholdings in companies or investments in emerging markets.

You have \u00a370,000 to invest for him</strong></p> <p>Fred has raised \u00a370,000 from the sale of his home in Kent. He is a widower and lived alone - so the proceeds are mainly to be used to cover his residential home care fees. He suffers from dementia, so cannot manage his own affairs. But he is in good physical health and could need to live off this money for many years. You are his closest relative. How do you invest the money for him? This is what Help the Aged's Care Fees Advisory Service said: </p> <p><strong> 1 Assumed financial position</strong> </p> <p>Basic state pension <strong> \u00a367.00 </strong> per week </p> <p>Higher rate attendance allowance <strong> \u00a352.95</strong> per week </p> <p>Occupational pensions <strong> \u00a360.00</strong> net a week </p> <p>Total income <strong> \u00a3179.95</strong> </p> <p>Care fees <strong> \u00a3300.00</strong> </p> <p>Shortfall <strong> \u00a3120.05</strong> per week </p> <p><strong> 2 Recommendation</strong> </p> <p>Assume client has lucid moments so that you can establish an enduring power of attorney under which his family can manage his financial affairs. Assuming that the objectives with the money are to create certainty of income for life, and protecting some of his capital, the monies should be invested as follows: </p> <p>- A specialist care fees payment plan (cost circa \u00a333,000 from an insurance company) to produce income equivalent to \u00a3120.05 per week. Payment tax-free is then made by the insurer direct to the care provider. </p> <p>- Balance of capital to be invested between monies on deposit for any special items and personal expenditure: \u00a37,000 in a growth Isa, with the remainder of \u00a330,000 in an equity-based investment with capital guaranteed on death. </p> <p><strong> 3 Outcome</strong> </p> <p>Monthly fees matched by additional income without imposing extra income tax liability. Preserving part of assets, which could be allowed to grow over time. If nursing home care were needed at a later date, income could then be generated from other investments and/or the purchase of a further care plan. </p> <p>This also avoids problems of relying on Social Services and possibly having to move to a cheaper home. </p> <p>Key objective is peace of mind to meet residential care costs for life, as well as ensuring inheritance for estate beneficiaries.</p>",

Since the offices do not monitor the time envelopes are posted throughout the night, tax officials assume that all correspondence which is on the mat in the morning came through the letterbox before midnight. </p> <p>Anyone who is sent a tax return is legally obliged to complete it and send it back. About 3 million people are thought to be struggling to reach the January/February deadline. If you have mislaid your tax return, you can download a new one from the Revenue's website at (<a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a>) or call the helpline on 0845 9000 444. </p> <p><strong> Costly car cover</strong><br> </p> <p> Car insurance premiums are continuing to soar but there may be light at the end of the tunnel. AA Insurance's premium index shows that premiums for comprehensive cover have gone up by more than \u00a328 in the past three months, and by \u00a368 since last January. </p> <p>The average comprehensive policy now costs more than \u00a3507. Motorists who shop around should be able to reduce their premiums by 36 per cent; the AA's shoparound premium, the average of the three lowest quotes obtained, worked out at \u00a3325. 36. Though 36 per cent lower than the average premium, this best-buy rate increased by 6.5 per cent during the final quarter of 1999. </p> <p>Insurers continue to blame a combination of factors for the increases. The market is competitive and premiums are too low, they say, to cover the cost of claims. </p> <p>Insurers are paying \u00a31.15 in claims for each \u00a31 taken in premiums. Hospitals are now claiming from insurers for the cost of care for road accident victims. </p> <p>Actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow says that insurers made heavier losses on motor cover than ever before in 1998. But recent increases in premiums should mean a return to profitability this year. </p> <p>Motorists cannot necessarily expect a fall in premiums next year, however. Large companies are becoming more dominant in the market, which means that there will be less competition for customers. </p> <p><strong> Roving rates</strong><br> </p> <p> Mortgage lenders continued to announce rate rises last week following the previous week's increase in bank base rate. The standard variable mortgage rate among banks is now hovering around 7.49 per cent, although many building societies are charging less. </p> <p>Most savers are still in the dark about the next move in their rates although there have been rises on a small number of accounts. Banks and building societies are expected to cherry-pick their flagship accounts for the most favourable rises, while many accounts will see increases well under the 0.25 per cent rise in base rates. </p> <p>Banks and societies have, however, been launching fixed-rate deposit bonds. Northern Rock has three bonds, with rates fixed over one to three years. The top rate of 7.3 per cent is paid on the three-year bond and the minimum investment on each is \u00a31,000 (0845 600 4466). Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is paying 7 per cent on a minimum of \u00a3500 over two years (0800 717505); Abbey National is paying 7 per cent until April 2002 on a minimum of \u00a31,000 (0800 174 635); and Bradford &amp; Bingley is paying 7 per cent on a minimum of \u00a31,000 over three years (0800 570800). See databank, page 14 </p> <p><strong> Bonds that free </strong><br> </p> <p> Rates on guaranteed income bonds are also ris ing, to levels that make them attractive investments for taxpayers, according to Baronworth Investment Services. </p> <p>For sums of \u00a350,000 or more the three- and four- year bonds offer 6.25 per cent, net of basic-rate tax. This is equivalent to 7.81 per cent gross. </p> <p>Tax cannot be reclaimed on the bonds, however, so they are not suitable for non-taxpayers.</p>",

Anyone who is sent a tax return is legally obliged to complete it and send it back. About 3 million people are thought to be struggling to reach the January/February deadline. If you have mislaid your tax return, you can download a new one from the Revenue's website at (www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk) or call the helpline on 0845 9000 444. Costly car cover Car insurance premiums are continuing to soar but there may be light at the end of the tunnel. AA Insurance's premium index shows that premiums for comprehensive cover have gone up by more than \u00a328 in the past three months, and by \u00a368 since last January. The average comprehensive policy now costs more than \u00a3507. Motorists who shop around should be able to reduce their premiums by 36 per cent; the AA's shoparound premium, the average of the three lowest quotes obtained, worked out at \u00a3325. 36. Though 36 per cent lower than the average premium, this best-buy rate increased by 6.5 per cent during the final quarter of 1999. Insurers continue to blame a combination of factors for the increases. The market is competitive and premiums are too low, they say, to cover the cost of claims. Insurers are paying \u00a31.15 in claims for each \u00a31 taken in premiums. Hospitals are now claiming from insurers for the cost of care for road accident victims. Actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow says that insurers made heavier losses on motor cover than ever before in 1998. But recent increases in premiums should mean a return to profitability this year. Motorists cannot necessarily expect a fall in premiums next year, however. Large companies are becoming more dominant in the market, which means that there will be less competition for customers. Roving rates Mortgage lenders continued to announce rate rises last week following the previous week's increase in bank base rate. The standard variable mortgage rate among banks is now hovering around 7.49 per cent, although many building societies are charging less. Most savers are still in the dark about the next move in their rates although there have been rises on a small number of accounts. Banks and building societies are expected to cherry-pick their flagship accounts for the most favourable rises, while many accounts will see increases well under the 0.25 per cent rise in base rates. Banks and societies have, however, been launching fixed-rate deposit bonds. Northern Rock has three bonds, with rates fixed over one to three years. The top rate of 7.3 per cent is paid on the three-year bond and the minimum investment on each is \u00a31,000 (0845 600 4466). Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is paying 7 per cent on a minimum of \u00a3500 over two years (0800 717505); Abbey National is paying 7 per cent until April 2002 on a minimum of \u00a31,000 (0800 174 635); and Bradford &amp; Bingley is paying 7 per cent on a minimum of \u00a31,000 over three years (0800 570800). See databank, page 14 Bonds that free Rates on guaranteed income bonds are also ris ing, to levels that make them attractive investments for taxpayers, according to Baronworth Investment Services. For sums of \u00a350,000 or more the three- and four- year bonds offer 6.25 per cent, net of basic-rate tax. This is equivalent to 7.81 per cent gross. Tax cannot be reclaimed on the bonds, however, so they are not suitable for non-taxpayers.",

      "body": "<p>'We see ourselves unabashedly as a science-based, R&amp;D-driven company.' Which FTSE 100 executive said this? Gerald Corbett, head of Railtrack? Obviously not. Robin Saxby, head of ARM? Warmer. Dr James Niedel, head of science and technology at Glaxo Wellcome? Correct. </p> <p>But the question is not so much who said it, but when. It was said not last Monday, when Glaxo announced its \u00a3114 billion merger with SmithKline Beecham, to become the world's biggest drugs company, with 7.3 per cent of the global market for pharmaceuticals, but back in November 1995. He said this after Glaxo had paid \u00a39.1bn for Wellcome, and when the new drugs colossus unveiled what was billed as the most vital plank of its integration - its R&amp;D strategy. </p> <p> The company had spent the time since the March deal reviewing its R&amp;D projects. The aim was simple - to bring three financially important products to market each year from 2000. Has it worked? </p> <p>Analysts are sceptical. Lehman Brothers' Ian Smith expresses a common view. 'You can easily make a case that it has not delivered on its R&amp;D promises,' he says. This is galling for the R&amp;D staff who lost their jobs when the group's R&amp;D workforce fell from 11,500 to 9,700 - 1,800 out of the total of 7,500 jobs lost. </p> <p>The brunt of the cuts were borne by Wellcome staff at the company's research HQ in Beckenham, which lost most of its 1,600 employees. </p> <p>Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing Science and Finance union, says: 'Glaxo effectively finished Wellcome. This was supposed to be an R&amp;D-driven company, yet they finished off the Beckenham site, which had been the centre of great research and important discoveries.' </p> <p>The scars of what MSF calls the 'gutting' of Wellcome remain. Last year, when Glaxo announced a further 1,700 job cuts, they were focused on another former Wellcome site, at Dartford.</p> <p> Few would argue about Glaxo Wellcome - which accounts for a fifth of total UK R&amp;D expenditure - being the UK's primary research-based company. But Smith and others suggest its record over the past five years is mixed.</p> <p> He points to good results, such as the Aids combination therapy Combivir, released in 1997, with annual sales of $750 million. Asthma drug Seretide, approved in Europe last year, has done well and promises $1bn sales if it gains US approval this year. </p> <p>But there have been outright flops - Ultiva, an anaesthetic, and Pylorid, a Zantac replacement on which Glaxo set much store, disappointed. </p> <p>This year, hopes centre on a treatment for irritable bowel called Lotronex which, if approved, analysts have slated in at $1bn a year. But the 2000 target looks shaky. There has been nothing to replace Zantac or products such as Astra Zeneca's Losec or Eli Lilley's Prozac, says Smith. Even flu treatment Relenza made only $75m in its first eight months.</p> <p>Smith says: 'Some people say Glaxo is following the Star Trek syndrome of R&amp;D - boldly going to areas where no one has gone before. It's instinctive, but it is risky.' </p> <p>Some believe the Smith- Kline marriage - which allows Glaxo to fill its own R&amp;D desert with products such as SB's diabetes drug Avandia - reflects this failure. Sir John Robb, Wellcome chief executive until the 1995 deal, says: 'I don't think big is necessarily beautiful in R&amp;D terms. These mega-mergers are driven more by financial benefits - this must have been the case with Glaxo Wellcome because Glaxo's Zantac patent was expiring and Wellcome was losing Zovirax. What that merger has not delivered is a strong pipeline. So . . . the next move is another merger.' </p> <p>While productivity was intended to rise from 1995, spending did not. It was to be held at around \u00a31.2bn, but in fact the 1995 R&amp;D budget of \u00a31.2bn went down 3 per cent (\u00a339m) in 1996 and fell a further 1 per cent in 1997, before recovering 1 per cent in 1998. </p> <p>Restraining R&amp;D for earnings caused problems. Merril Lynch's James Culverell says: 'They promised stable earnings in 1998 which they just about achieved. The reality was it would probably have been better not to have delivered on that and spent more on R&amp;D.' </p> <p> Last year things got worse. Glaxo chairman Sir Richard Sykes had promised a return to double-digit growth. In July he told investors that this would not happen. It did not go down well. </p> <p> The twin disappointments make an important point, which will be the acid test of the next mega-merger. In the words of one analyst: 'Pharmaceuticals is a long-term game, and much of the far-off stuff can only be understood by people with strong scientific backgrounds. The City, on the other hand, thinks after lunch is a long time away.'</p> <p> When Glaxo SmithKline set out its stall last week, it said: 'This combination will help Glaxo SmithKline to become the most productive research organisation in the pharmaceuticals industry.' Of the \u00a31bn savings it is looking for from the merger, \u00a3250m will be ploughed into R&amp;D. The key R&amp;D sites, at Stevenage and Harlow, will remain. </p> <p> 'The merger is good news,' says Richard Ley, spokesman for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. 'It takes an average of \u00a3350m to bring a drug to market. And it is good news for the UK, which already spends more of its wealth on R&amp;D than Germany or France.' </p> <p> The stakes are high. The Government has placed R&amp;D at the centre of its drive to create a knowledge-based economy. In last year's Budget, Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a \u00a3150m package of tax credits for R&amp;D which would cut research costs. Supporters of the policy say it will give a fillip to small businesses. But sceptics say the scope of the initiative is too small to have much impact.</p> <p> Unsurprisingly, there are doubts about the implications of the Glaxo merger for R&amp;D in the UK. MSF's Lyons says: 'What happened last time does not fill us with hope. They may not close Stevenage and Harlow tomorrow, but this company is being run from the US. Will investment go into the UK or the \"research triangle\" facilities in the US?'</p> <p> One industry insider says: 'The Glaxo Wellcome deal as a forerunner to Glaxo Smith- Kline is not great - it was essentially little more than a cost-saving operation.' Dr Michael Clark, chairman of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, agrees: 'This could lead to a fall in spending in the short term, and less competition and possible innovation in R&amp;D.' However, he believes the combined group in the long term would make sense.</p> <p>The question is, is it different this time? Smith says: 'It is. The way the industry does its R&amp;D has changed dramatically in the past five years.' </p> <p>The change involves advances in 'genomics'.

      "bodyText": "'We see ourselves unabashedly as a science-based, R&amp;D-driven company.' Which FTSE 100 executive said this? Gerald Corbett, head of Railtrack? Obviously not. Robin Saxby, head of ARM? Warmer. Dr James Niedel, head of science and technology at Glaxo Wellcome? Correct. But the question is not so much who said it, but when. It was said not last Monday, when Glaxo announced its \u00a3114 billion merger with SmithKline Beecham, to become the world's biggest drugs company, with 7.3 per cent of the global market for pharmaceuticals, but back in November 1995. He said this after Glaxo had paid \u00a39.1bn for Wellcome, and when the new drugs colossus unveiled what was billed as the most vital plank of its integration - its R&amp;D strategy. The company had spent the time since the March deal reviewing its R&amp;D projects. The aim was simple - to bring three financially important products to market each year from 2000. Has it worked? Analysts are sceptical. Lehman Brothers' Ian Smith expresses a common view. 'You can easily make a case that it has not delivered on its R&amp;D promises,' he says. This is galling for the R&amp;D staff who lost their jobs when the group's R&amp;D workforce fell from 11,500 to 9,700 - 1,800 out of the total of 7,500 jobs lost. The brunt of the cuts were borne by Wellcome staff at the company's research HQ in Beckenham, which lost most of its 1,600 employees. Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing Science and Finance union, says: 'Glaxo effectively finished Wellcome. This was supposed to be an R&amp;D-driven company, yet they finished off the Beckenham site, which had been the centre of great research and important discoveries.' The scars of what MSF calls the 'gutting' of Wellcome remain. Last year, when Glaxo announced a further 1,700 job cuts, they were focused on another former Wellcome site, at Dartford. Few would argue about Glaxo Wellcome - which accounts for a fifth of total UK R&amp;D expenditure - being the UK's primary research-based company. But Smith and others suggest its record over the past five years is mixed. He points to good results, such as the Aids combination therapy Combivir, released in 1997, with annual sales of $750 million. Asthma drug Seretide, approved in Europe last year, has done well and promises $1bn sales if it gains US approval this year. But there have been outright flops - Ultiva, an anaesthetic, and Pylorid, a Zantac replacement on which Glaxo set much store, disappointed. This year, hopes centre on a treatment for irritable bowel called Lotronex which, if approved, analysts have slated in at $1bn a year. But the 2000 target looks shaky. There has been nothing to replace Zantac or products such as Astra Zeneca's Losec or Eli Lilley's Prozac, says Smith. Even flu treatment Relenza made only $75m in its first eight months. Smith says: 'Some people say Glaxo is following the Star Trek syndrome of R&amp;D - boldly going to areas where no one has gone before. It's instinctive, but it is risky.' Some believe the Smith- Kline marriage - which allows Glaxo to fill its own R&amp;D desert with products such as SB's diabetes drug Avandia - reflects this failure. Sir John Robb, Wellcome chief executive until the 1995 deal, says: 'I don't think big is necessarily beautiful in R&amp;D terms. These mega-mergers are driven more by financial benefits - this must have been the case with Glaxo Wellcome because Glaxo's Zantac patent was expiring and Wellcome was losing Zovirax. What that merger has not delivered is a strong pipeline. So . . . the next move is another merger.' While productivity was intended to rise from 1995, spending did not. It was to be held at around \u00a31.2bn, but in fact the 1995 R&amp;D budget of \u00a31.2bn went down 3 per cent (\u00a339m) in 1996 and fell a further 1 per cent in 1997, before recovering 1 per cent in 1998. Restraining R&amp;D for earnings caused problems. Merril Lynch's James Culverell says: 'They promised stable earnings in 1998 which they just about achieved. The reality was it would probably have been better not to have delivered on that and spent more on R&amp;D.' Last year things got worse. Glaxo chairman Sir Richard Sykes had promised a return to double-digit growth. In July he told investors that this would not happen. It did not go down well. The twin disappointments make an important point, which will be the acid test of the next mega-merger. In the words of one analyst: 'Pharmaceuticals is a long-term game, and much of the far-off stuff can only be understood by people with strong scientific backgrounds. The City, on the other hand, thinks after lunch is a long time away.' When Glaxo SmithKline set out its stall last week, it said: 'This combination will help Glaxo SmithKline to become the most productive research organisation in the pharmaceuticals industry.' Of the \u00a31bn savings it is looking for from the merger, \u00a3250m will be ploughed into R&amp;D. The key R&amp;D sites, at Stevenage and Harlow, will remain. 'The merger is good news,' says Richard Ley, spokesman for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. 'It takes an average of \u00a3350m to bring a drug to market. And it is good news for the UK, which already spends more of its wealth on R&amp;D than Germany or France.' The stakes are high. The Government has placed R&amp;D at the centre of its drive to create a knowledge-based economy. In last year's Budget, Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a \u00a3150m package of tax credits for R&amp;D which would cut research costs. Supporters of the policy say it will give a fillip to small businesses. But sceptics say the scope of the initiative is too small to have much impact. Unsurprisingly, there are doubts about the implications of the Glaxo merger for R&amp;D in the UK. MSF's Lyons says: 'What happened last time does not fill us with hope. They may not close Stevenage and Harlow tomorrow, but this company is being run from the US. Will investment go into the UK or the \"research triangle\" facilities in the US?' One industry insider says: 'The Glaxo Wellcome deal as a forerunner to Glaxo Smith- Kline is not great - it was essentially little more than a cost-saving operation.' Dr Michael Clark, chairman of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, agrees: 'This could lead to a fall in spending in the short term, and less competition and possible innovation in R&amp;D.' However, he believes the combined group in the long term would make sense. The question is, is it different this time? Smith says: 'It is. The way the industry does its R&amp;D has changed dramatically in the past five years.' The change involves advances in 'genomics'. Drug 'targets' - the estimated 5,000 possible treatable conditions to be discovered through genetic analysis - will be identified by isolating the genes that cause diseases and aiming treatments at them. This requires a list of genes, knowing which ones cause which problems, the ability to access them and finding a chemical combination to treat them. Industry analysts say SmithKline Beecham is the expert in genomics while Glaxo, through its Affymax subsidiary, acquired in 1995, is one of the world leaders in 'combinational chemistry' - the ability to process huge amounts of chemical data to find answers to genomic questions quickly. Smith says: 'Those who get ahead in the next five years while there is the scramble to answer these questions will reap the rewards.' But two years ago - before the personality clash between Sykes and SB head Jan Leschly sank the previous merger - might have been better timing. US genomics firm Celera, for example, saw its shares rise 28 per cent this month when it announced it had decoded 90 per cent of the human genome and is expected to finish mid-year. The company has seen its value quintuple since October. It has partnerships with giants including Pfizer and Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn. Concern within the company and the scientific community will focus on whether the new GlaxoSB can beat the gold rush.",

Buy. </p> <p><strong> No regrets</strong><br> Did we predict 'euphoria' last week when the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and Smith-Kline Beecham was finally unveiled? Well, immediately at least, we couldn't have been more wrong. Shares in Glaxo and SmithKline fell 4.7 and 6.9 per cent respectively after Monday's announcement, giving up all the previous week's gains. With Glaxo ending at 1625p on Friday, and SmithKline at 736p, the slide just continued. </p> <p>Disappointment at the level of cost savings did much of the damage. With analysts expecting \u00a31.5 billion or more, the \u00a31bn announced seemed miserly. That estimate is likely to be conservative. Why, with all the sensitivities involved and intense US scrutiny likely, should chief executive-elect Jean Pierre Garnier make a rod for his own back from the outset? </p> <p>Broker Commerzbank for one is expecting Glaxo SmithKline to restore its rating. To put Britain's drugs duo on a par with their international peers, the broker has set a target of 2,150p for Glaxo and 975p for SmithKline before the deal is completed. So keep on holding on. </p> <p><strong> High-tech magic</strong><br> One broker looking decidedly clever in high-tech last week was Granville's information technology analyst, Roger Phillips. His latest note, days before FI Group's \u00a3670m bid for IT consultancy Druid, recommended holding on to Druid shares despite the firm's recent profit warning.

At Axon, definitely not, says Phillips. Once out, it's difficult to get back in. The firm is sure the stock will hit \u00a310 by the year-end. </p> <p>Diagonal, too, remains a long-term buy.

What started as the bright idea of a Scandinavian publishing company in 1995 has now become the most fiercely and acrimoniously contested newspaper battle seen in Britain since Rupert Murdoch lowered the price of the Sun and the Times more than five years ago. Given the warnings of plummeting newspaper circulation - and, as one regional press executive put it last year, '10 years of the industry having the last rites read over it' - the frenzied rush to stuff every railway carriage, every Tube train and every bus with free morning newspapers looks not only curiously anachronistic but commercially suicidal.

Performances everywhere were stunning. In Britain, insurance and investment sales rose by 53 per cent. Even excluding the \u00a3583 million contribution from M&amp;G, the US posted a 43 per cent rise, and Asia staged a dramatic recovery. </p> <p>Sir Peter cannot take all the credit - the industry is enjoying a boom sparked by low interest rates, booming stock markets and a campaign by everyone from the Government down to persuade us to save. But he can take credit for the dramatic changes at the Pru which underlie this performance, and have made it one of the industry's frontrunners. </p> <p>Five years ago, Prudential was embroiled in a bitter, debilitating battle with regulators. Davis realised he could not win, and switched his focus to positioning the business for the future. </p> <p>The most dramatic change has been in the sources of its business. Five years ago, three-quarters came from the so-called industrial branch - its army of 6,000 door-to-door salesmen. Now 75 per cent comes through independent financial advisers (IFAs). The process of reducing the importance of the industrial branch was started by Davis's predecessor, Mick Newmarch. Sir Peter's skill was in ensuring that shrinking the direct salesforce did not mean shrinking the business. </p> <p>He made the salesforce more productive by targeting more affluent customers, and introduced better training and better service. The result is that a third as many sales staff now produce the same revenue as four years ago. Premiums generated per head have risen from \u00a342,000 a year to \u00a392,000. The target of \u00a3100,000-plus is well in sight. </p> <p>But the real success has been in expanding the other parts of the business. The biggest step was through the acquisition of Scottish Amicable, with its respected brand name and network of IFAs. The Pru has used this to push its own products, such as the spectacularly successful Prudence bond, out through the IFA network. The results are demonstrated in the new business figures. </p> <p>The second acquisition, M&amp;G, has been with the group only 10 months, so it is too early to say how successful it will be. To justify the price, it will have to make Scottish Amicable look pedestrian. </p> <p>Now there is a proposed deal with the Bank of Scotland, but the business really exciting the City is not an acquisition but home-grown - Egg, the runaway Internet success. Opinions are divided over whether Davis can take the credit for this, or whether it was a happy accident. What is clear, however, is that he has been prepared to support it while it absorbed far more investment - and suffered far more glitches - than anyone had expected. The result is that its position as the Internet financial services brand will be hard for rivals such as Halifax, only now entering this market, to emulate. </p> <p>Jonathan Bloomer, Sir Peter's deputy and former finance director, who is stepping up to the top job, will set out his strategy when the group announces its results next month. There is unlikely to be any significant change - the two were a very close team and Bloomer is widely respected. If there is a shift, it will be in emphasis, perhaps a greater focus on consolidating changes already made. </p> <p>The shares have enjoyed a dramatic rerating, having almost doubled in value in little over a year, although its status as a quasi-Internet stock means it has been jittery this month. They could have further to go. As one analyst put it, they offer real assets, real profits, real growth - and the kicker of an attractive virtual business. </p> <p><strong> Don't Photo-Me</strong><br> In the Sixties, it was possible to go into a kiosk like a photo booth and make your own record. The lack of a decent backing band, not to mention the horror of hearing your own voice on scratchy plastic, meant the idea never really caught on. Thirty years and a technological revolution later, Photo-Me International has decided that offering other people's music is a better bet. </p> <p>Its plans to build up to 5,000 kiosks offering to download CDs is just one initiative which is set to transform the business, and has already transformed the share price. </p> <p>The other is PhotoPlanet, a joint venture with BT to build a new generation of booths offering Internet access, customised postcards, fun stickers and identity cards in addition to the traditional passport photographs. </p> <p>Both ideas are interesting. Offering Internet access to people on the move is undoubtedly attractive - mobile phone companies have already woken up to the idea, and mighty Microsoft is developing a kind of miniature handset. The risk is that anyone so desperate to get their email that they would consider a booth will surely have one of these, or an account at an Internet caf\u00e9. </p> <p>The appeal of downloading music is similarly difficult to gauge, and trials due to have started this month in the US and next in Europe have been delayed, albeit by 'a couple of weeks'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, having ruled out being acquired, Photo-Me has decided it wants to be the acquirer and is searching for content to push through its booths. BT is paying for the substantial extra investment required to make the booths Internet-friendly, and Photo-Me is rolling out new ones twice as fast as its normal openings programme. </p> <p>This could pay off dramatically, but until the booths are up and running it is impossible to tell. The soaring share price has made it as risky as any dot.com stock. Buy at your periI. </p> <p><strong> Exit Eidos</strong><br> Eidos, the computer games company, is a clear demonstration that even a technology stock can have feet of clay. Investors seemed willing to forgive the profits warning last autumn, convinced that the Internet still offered staggering potential.

A senior Irish source said yesterday: 'Trimble took a leap of faith last November and if the republican movement fails to reciprocate then the fingers will point at them, saying they are the ones to blame.' British sources believe they have offered the IRA a string of concessions including reform of the RUC, but the IRA will not move in the face of what is seen as a Unionist-imposed deadline of February. In one slim hope of a compromise, Ministers are still hoping that the sealing of arms dumps south of the border might be regarded as an acceptable form of decommis sioning. However, the Unionists believe this would require a change in the law. Trimble warned yesterday: 'If things don't work out as we had hoped and if it proves impossible to sustain the administration in its present form, the only immediate recourse is direct rule.' The IRA's intentions have become increasingly hard to read given the appointment of three interlocutors to General de Chastelain's International Body on Decommissioning. They include Padraig Wilson, the former IRA leader in the Maze Prison who hinted in a recent interview that the Provisionals might carry out a voluntary act of disarmament, and Joe Cahill, the republican veteran and former IRA chief-of-staff. Both men are seen to be close to Gerry Adams and the Sinn Fein leadership. However the third member of the triumvirate is Brian Keenan, a Marxist hardliner on the IRA's Army Council. Opposition to decommissioning is greatest in areas such as South Armagh. Jim McAllister, a former Sinn Fein member from Crossmaglen, said decommissioning was a 'bridge too far for many republicans'. John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist deputy leader, said yesterday he was convinced that the British Government would wind up the Executive in the absence of genuine progress on decommissioning.",

Just two weeks into January, two new megadeals - AOL's $183 billion agreed bid for Time-Warner, and the \u00a3110bn drugs tie-up between Glaxo Wellcome and Smith-Kline - put the first year of the millennium well on target to match or beat 1999's record total of $3 trillion-worth of mergers. </p> <p>Nothing like this merger orgy has been seen before, in either size and quantity. For many companies, it seems, mergers have become a substitute for management. As for quality - well, that may be a different matter. In a recent study, consultancy KPMG found that, one year after the deal, 83 per cent of a sample of large mergers had created no shareholder value, and more than half had actually destroyed it. </p> <p>The KPMG study is only the latest in a long line which underline the same thing: mergers are hard to carry off and, at least in shareholder value terms, many fail. So what's the attraction - and where does it end? </p> <p>Deals seem to promise to remedy several sets of problems. Laggards and companies in mature industries like them for the opportunities they provide for stripping out cost - witness the BP strategy. For others (Glaxo-Smith-Kline) the logic is one of scale, in this case for expensive R&amp;D.

      "bodyText": "Every time you thought it was impossible for deals to get bigger, they double in size. Just two weeks into January, two new megadeals - AOL's $183 billion agreed bid for Time-Warner, and the \u00a3110bn drugs tie-up between Glaxo Wellcome and Smith-Kline - put the first year of the millennium well on target to match or beat 1999's record total of $3 trillion-worth of mergers. Nothing like this merger orgy has been seen before, in either size and quantity. For many companies, it seems, mergers have become a substitute for management. As for quality - well, that may be a different matter. In a recent study, consultancy KPMG found that, one year after the deal, 83 per cent of a sample of large mergers had created no shareholder value, and more than half had actually destroyed it. The KPMG study is only the latest in a long line which underline the same thing: mergers are hard to carry off and, at least in shareholder value terms, many fail. So what's the attraction - and where does it end? Deals seem to promise to remedy several sets of problems. Laggards and companies in mature industries like them for the opportunities they provide for stripping out cost - witness the BP strategy. For others (Glaxo-Smith-Kline) the logic is one of scale, in this case for expensive R&amp;D. In other cases again, a huge spike of change across whole industries (pharmaceuticals, telecoms, the Internet) provides opportunities for strategic realignments of the AOL-Time Warner type. 'The more change there is around, the less chance com panies think they have of surviving by doing nothing,' says KPMG partner Colin Cook, one of the report's authors.

And the Postgraduate Study and Training Fair in London next week provides an unusual opportunity to see what is on offer. </p> <p>When evaluating a course, says Wilkinson, basic questions should include what subjects are covered, who does the teaching, how the course is assessed, the quality of library and computer facilities and - most importantly for long-term career moves - what previous graduates from that course do now. </p> <p>It helps, she says, if prospective students 'have a clear idea of what they want to do in the long term'. And if they're taking a postgraduate degree mainly to improve their career prospects, they are 'most likely to do so if the subject is closely related to their area of employment, if the academic department has good links with employers, and the students strengthen their CVs with relevant activities and experience'. </p> <p>This is all sound advice about choosing a course and perhaps entering a rewarding career at the end of it. But what about the initial motivation? Why are an increasing number of students choosing to continue to postgraduate level? </p> <p>When the graduate job market is difficult, Wilkinson notes that more students see 'prolonged study as a constructive alternative to taking a low level job'. But that is hardly the case right now, especially in the South East. 'Around here employment markets are buoyant,' says the University of Reading's Stephen Wallis, 'but there is still strong demand for postgrad courses - such as land management, which enables people looking for a career change to go off and qualify as chartered surveyors.' </p> <p>Greater career flexibility - and the need to retrain or acquire new skills - may be one factor that is fuelling the postgraduate element in the explosion of 'lifelong learning'. So, too, is competitive pressure in the workplace. With far more graduates in the UK jobs market, there is a strong incentive to go one better and get a postgraduate degree. 'It's a way of distin guishing themselves, of gaining a competitive advantage,' says Dr Pat Rickwood of the Open University. </p> <p>But what about more personal, less utilitarian motives? Adrian Furnham, professor of psychology at University College, London, says that with some recent graduates the desire to stay in higher education is 'a postponement of adulthood' - the university offering 'a cosy environment which might seem preferable to going out into the real world'. </p> <p>They may be encouraged in this by their teachers. But, Furnham adds: 'There are also those clearly set on a research or academic career, and those in professions such as chemistry, where postgraduate study is needed for full qualification'. </p> <p>As for more mature postgraduates - those who return to higher education from their thirties onwards - Furnham discerns four main types of motivation. 'Some who are, to use Charles Handy's term, \"portfolio workers\", see taking a higher degree as means of expanding their portfolio of skills, and want to take their career in a new direction. Others may have been made redundant, or can see the writing on the wall. They are retraining.' </p> <p>But there are also 'empty nesters', who see a further degree as filling a gap in their lives. Finally, there are people who have spent years in high-earning jobs which, appear to them to have 'low intrinsic value', says Furnham. 'They are looking for something more meaningful, whether it is writing a dissertation on philosophy or fine art, or taking a course which will qualify them to be social workers.' </p> <p>Careers advisers and psychologists tend to label people, and this doesn't necessarily work when trying to discover why intelligent and articulate people who already have one degree want to become students again. That much was apparent from talking to three mature postgrad students of modern languages, literature and culture at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London. </p> <p>Kathryn Michael returned to study aged 50 after a successful career in advertising, ending up as a director of one of the larger agencies.

      "body": "<p>There are 118 business schools in the UK offering MBA courses. The number of options - full-time, part-time, broad-based or niche - continues to grow exponentially. For aspiring managers intent on finding the right course, it may seem as though it's an MBA jungle out there - which is why many will be attending the MBA Fair 2000 in London next week. </p> <p>MBA courses aimed at particular sectors have mushroomed. It began with courses for those working (or planning to work) in the public sector, in banking/finance, or in marketing. But now it is possible to take niche courses adapted to business sectors from oil and gas exploration to football management. </p> <p>It is perhaps fitting that Liverpool should be the first university in the world to offer an MBA in football-related industries (soccer, not American football, in which some US colleges offer PhD courses). Sam Johnstone, lecturer at the Football Research Unit, says: 'This is the third year we have run this programme, and from the outset there was tremendous interest. </p> <p>'In our first year we had 1,500 enquiries and took 20 students. Our last intake was 40, with students from the UK, Brazil, Japan, China and all over Europe. They mostly come to work out what careers they want within the game.' </p> <p>The one-year course is split into three equal parts: a normal MBA's content; a research dissertation which could involve a placement with a club or one of the marketing companies associated with the industry; and a taught course on the business of football and its relationship with the City and the media. </p> <p>Even within such a specialised sphere, motivations are very different. 'Some people arrive thinking they'll make a lot of money out of football and switch to trying to help lower-league clubs survive,' says Johnstone. </p> <p>Football is just one of many niche MBAs on offer. Churchmen can take an MBA in church management at Bishop Grosseteste College in Lincoln. Leicester University offers 11 specialised MBAs, including maritime management. </p> <p>Dundee provides the specialist input to MBAs aimed at people in oil and gas, mineral resources and water industries, with the general MBA content coming from Heriot-Watt's Edinburgh Business School. </p> <p>Niche MBAs may be attractive to people already working within a particular sector who want to build their management skills. But do they offer the same learning experience as the classic, generalist MBA? Probably not, though if you plan to continue working in the same place and the same sector they may suit you. </p> <p>But if your game plan includes changing jobs, upping your earnings potential and moving around, the classic MBA is still the best bet. Most employers look first at where you gained your MBA, not its content. This is particularly true of the high-earning finance and consulting industries, which are generally unimpressed by sector-specific qualifications - though they may value work experience. </p> <p>The directors of classic MBA programmes also value their intake's previous experience as managers. Mark Oakley, of the Aston Business School, says its students' average age is around 30, and they learn a great deal from each other's experience. </p> <p>Richard Kerley, director of the full-time MBA course at Edinburgh University, concurs: 'We believe the MBA should be a generalist course where people already have the management experience to help each other learn.' </p> <p>A growing number of MBA courses accept students who have just graduated, with the result that there are effectively two streams: the older managers, who have something to contribute in seminars, and the 21-year-olds who - no matter how bright - just don't have that experience. This can lead to friction between the two age groups. </p> <p>Rather than dilute the experience of their MBA programmes, both Aston and Edinburgh encourage recent graduates to take an MSc in Business Studies - the emphasis being more on teaching and the dissertation than on the interactive learning typical of the classic MBA. If MSc graduates later want to do an MBA, Aston exempts them from the parts they have already completed. </p> <p>Kerley agrees that the MSc is best for younger students, but argues that management knowledge is evolving so rapidly that it is best for MBA students to start afresh. The classic MBA is, he insists, a very different type of qualification - both in content and in what it says to the marketplace. Like many others in leading business schools, he is worried that the proliferation of courses styled as MBAs will lead to it being devalued. </p> <p>Guidance is available through the accreditation scheme run by the UK- based Association of MBAs (AMBA). Of the 118 universities and colleges in the UK, only 35 have received accreditation. </p> <p>Equis is a Europe-wide accreditation programme run by the Brussels-based European Foundation for Management Development. So far, only four British business schools have been accredited; a whole raft of similar institutions in France have accreditation. </p> <p>If an MBA is only as good as the school or university it came from, it is worth choosing very carefully. Accreditation offers guidance. But it is worth going to see for yourself at the MBA fair in London next week. </p> <p> <em>The MBA 2000 Fair is at the Business Design Centre, Islington, Wednesday 26 January from 12.30 to 8.30 pm, and Thursday 27 January from noon to 7 pm. </em></p>",

For aspiring managers intent on finding the right course, it may seem as though it's an MBA jungle out there - which is why many will be attending the MBA Fair 2000 in London next week. MBA courses aimed at particular sectors have mushroomed. It began with courses for those working (or planning to work) in the public sector, in banking/finance, or in marketing. But now it is possible to take niche courses adapted to business sectors from oil and gas exploration to football management. It is perhaps fitting that Liverpool should be the first university in the world to offer an MBA in football-related industries (soccer, not American football, in which some US colleges offer PhD courses). Sam Johnstone, lecturer at the Football Research Unit, says: 'This is the third year we have run this programme, and from the outset there was tremendous interest. 'In our first year we had 1,500 enquiries and took 20 students. Our last intake was 40, with students from the UK, Brazil, Japan, China and all over Europe. They mostly come to work out what careers they want within the game.' The one-year course is split into three equal parts: a normal MBA's content; a research dissertation which could involve a placement with a club or one of the marketing companies associated with the industry; and a taught course on the business of football and its relationship with the City and the media. Even within such a specialised sphere, motivations are very different. 'Some people arrive thinking they'll make a lot of money out of football and switch to trying to help lower-league clubs survive,' says Johnstone. Football is just one of many niche MBAs on offer. Churchmen can take an MBA in church management at Bishop Grosseteste College in Lincoln. Leicester University offers 11 specialised MBAs, including maritime management. Dundee provides the specialist input to MBAs aimed at people in oil and gas, mineral resources and water industries, with the general MBA content coming from Heriot-Watt's Edinburgh Business School. Niche MBAs may be attractive to people already working within a particular sector who want to build their management skills. But do they offer the same learning experience as the classic, generalist MBA? Probably not, though if you plan to continue working in the same place and the same sector they may suit you. But if your game plan includes changing jobs, upping your earnings potential and moving around, the classic MBA is still the best bet. Most employers look first at where you gained your MBA, not its content. This is particularly true of the high-earning finance and consulting industries, which are generally unimpressed by sector-specific qualifications - though they may value work experience. The directors of classic MBA programmes also value their intake's previous experience as managers. Mark Oakley, of the Aston Business School, says its students' average age is around 30, and they learn a great deal from each other's experience. Richard Kerley, director of the full-time MBA course at Edinburgh University, concurs: 'We believe the MBA should be a generalist course where people already have the management experience to help each other learn.' A growing number of MBA courses accept students who have just graduated, with the result that there are effectively two streams: the older managers, who have something to contribute in seminars, and the 21-year-olds who - no matter how bright - just don't have that experience. This can lead to friction between the two age groups. Rather than dilute the experience of their MBA programmes, both Aston and Edinburgh encourage recent graduates to take an MSc in Business Studies - the emphasis being more on teaching and the dissertation than on the interactive learning typical of the classic MBA. If MSc graduates later want to do an MBA, Aston exempts them from the parts they have already completed. Kerley agrees that the MSc is best for younger students, but argues that management knowledge is evolving so rapidly that it is best for MBA students to start afresh. The classic MBA is, he insists, a very different type of qualification - both in content and in what it says to the marketplace. Like many others in leading business schools, he is worried that the proliferation of courses styled as MBAs will lead to it being devalued. Guidance is available through the accreditation scheme run by the UK- based Association of MBAs (AMBA). Of the 118 universities and colleges in the UK, only 35 have received accreditation. Equis is a Europe-wide accreditation programme run by the Brussels-based European Foundation for Management Development. So far, only four British business schools have been accredited; a whole raft of similar institutions in France have accreditation. If an MBA is only as good as the school or university it came from, it is worth choosing very carefully. Accreditation offers guidance. But it is worth going to see for yourself at the MBA fair in London next week. The MBA 2000 Fair is at the Business Design Centre, Islington, Wednesday 26 January from 12.30 to 8.30 pm, and Thursday 27 January from noon to 7 pm.",

      "trailText": "<p>Jamie Doward  looks for something solid to justify the leap in value of new Internet company Jellyworks</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If ever there was an illustration of how Internet companies can seemingly suck money out of thin air it is to be found at the plush London offices of Jellyworks. The paint has yet to dry on some of the walls in the Internet investment firm's Westminster HQ. Its website is still under construction. In the boardroom, which overlooks St James's Park, roller blinds lie on the floor, waiting to be put up. </p> <p>Through the window looms the Treasury. What Iron Chancellor Gordon Brown would make of Jellyworks can only be imagined, but the prudent Scot is unlikely to find any evidence of neo-classical endogenous growth in the month-old company's brief history. Floated just before Christmas, Jellyworks has seen its market value soar from \u00a310 million to more than \u00a3240m. </p> <p>The reason for this gravity-defying leap is that the City is betting on a hunch. Investors in Jellyworks believe the company has the expertise and access to capital that will allow it to invest in those fledgling technology businesses which may become the Microsofts of the future. </p> <p>Much of the euphoria surrounding the company's share price stems from a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The company's chief executive is 24-year-old Jonathan David Rowland, who left Bedales after his GCSEs, tried his hand at a number of jobs, and now finds himself under the Square Mile's spotlight. The putative investment guru is the son of David Rowland, the property magnate and legendary fixer who reputedly made his first million by the age of 23, earning himself a place in City folklore and the sobriquet 'Spotty' to boot. </p> <p>Rowland senior's later business dealings were not so coruscating. Williams Hudson, a Rowland-controlled conglomerate, went under in the 1970s. A Rowland-backed takeover of Hibernian football club ended up in receivership. </p> <p>Now it is up to Rowland junior to prove he has his father's precocious alchemic touch. The story goes that Rowland senior gave his son \u00a38m to set up Jellyworks. The money came from a firm called Easton Investments, a Guernsey-based company owned by the Rowland family's trusts. A family friend, Edward Guinan (Rowland senior was his best man), invested \u00a31m and is now the company's chairman. </p> <p>The two older men are adamant that it will be Rowland junior who calls the shots. One obvious reason is that, as a tax exile, Rowland senior could attract the attentions of the Inland Revenue if he were seen taking a part in the company's activities. </p> <p>'I respect what my father's done. He's a clever guy,' says Jonathan Rowland. 'He has left us alone and he's not involved day to day. If I see him for dinner, we chat and that's about it. He trusts my judgment and trusts Ed.' Never the less, the links to the Rowland family seem extremely strong. Even the Jellyworks HQ is rented from the family. </p> <p>The idea of floating an Internet investment vehicle seems to have been Rowland senior's as well. Says Jonathan: 'I got married in October, and when I got home I spoke to my father who said \"you should put together a public company which will be investing in Internet stuff\". I spoke to Ed. He'd been having the same thoughts for six months.' </p> <p>The company's name came from a brainstorming session between chairman and chief executive. 'We sat around trying to dream up something whimsical but unforgettable which had a .com still available,' Guinan recalls. </p> <p>Guinan, a former Wall Street trader, claims Jellyworks has huge resources. 'We are unique in that we are not restricted by access to capital. If we saw an opportunity we wanted to deploy serious amounts of money to, we could do it. We have serious firepower. We're looking at larger transactions now. If we saw a \u00a3100m deal today we could do it.' </p> <p>So far, Jellyworks has done little to earn its stellar value. The company has made, or has options to make, investments in a number of Internet firms including EPO.com, a Swedish online investment bank; Antfactory, a US incubator for early-stage technology companies; and Orchestream, a software company specialising in solving Internet congestion problems. Orchestream's chief executive, Ashley Ward, is JellyWorks' sole non-executive director. </p> <p>Guinan is 52. Rowland insist theirs is a partnership of equals. Guinan is an expert in corporate finance while Rowland, who once worked in the family's property business as a trainee surveyor, is strong on identifying investment targets. </p> <p>Guinan says: 'This was a lucky relationship. We were old friends anyway. It's a very powerful situation. We have some deep brainstorming sessions. Jonathan and I could go and have a beer in a pub and create a new company, literally.' </p> <p>Rowland got the thirst for seeking out investment targets after working for his father. 'I decided 18 months ago the best thing to do was work with the old man, who had a proven track record. I'd resisted it for five or six years. I sat under his guidance, listened and learned.' </p> <p>He then started to identify Internet investment targets. 'I understood it better than he did.

      "bodyText": "If ever there was an illustration of how Internet companies can seemingly suck money out of thin air it is to be found at the plush London offices of Jellyworks. The paint has yet to dry on some of the walls in the Internet investment firm's Westminster HQ. Its website is still under construction. In the boardroom, which overlooks St James's Park, roller blinds lie on the floor, waiting to be put up. Through the window looms the Treasury. What Iron Chancellor Gordon Brown would make of Jellyworks can only be imagined, but the prudent Scot is unlikely to find any evidence of neo-classical endogenous growth in the month-old company's brief history. Floated just before Christmas, Jellyworks has seen its market value soar from \u00a310 million to more than \u00a3240m. The reason for this gravity-defying leap is that the City is betting on a hunch. Investors in Jellyworks believe the company has the expertise and access to capital that will allow it to invest in those fledgling technology businesses which may become the Microsofts of the future. Much of the euphoria surrounding the company's share price stems from a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The company's chief executive is 24-year-old Jonathan David Rowland, who left Bedales after his GCSEs, tried his hand at a number of jobs, and now finds himself under the Square Mile's spotlight. The putative investment guru is the son of David Rowland, the property magnate and legendary fixer who reputedly made his first million by the age of 23, earning himself a place in City folklore and the sobriquet 'Spotty' to boot. Rowland senior's later business dealings were not so coruscating. Williams Hudson, a Rowland-controlled conglomerate, went under in the 1970s. A Rowland-backed takeover of Hibernian football club ended up in receivership. Now it is up to Rowland junior to prove he has his father's precocious alchemic touch. The story goes that Rowland senior gave his son \u00a38m to set up Jellyworks. The money came from a firm called Easton Investments, a Guernsey-based company owned by the Rowland family's trusts. A family friend, Edward Guinan (Rowland senior was his best man), invested \u00a31m and is now the company's chairman. The two older men are adamant that it will be Rowland junior who calls the shots. One obvious reason is that, as a tax exile, Rowland senior could attract the attentions of the Inland Revenue if he were seen taking a part in the company's activities. 'I respect what my father's done. He's a clever guy,' says Jonathan Rowland. 'He has left us alone and he's not involved day to day. If I see him for dinner, we chat and that's about it. He trusts my judgment and trusts Ed.' Never the less, the links to the Rowland family seem extremely strong. Even the Jellyworks HQ is rented from the family. The idea of floating an Internet investment vehicle seems to have been Rowland senior's as well. Says Jonathan: 'I got married in October, and when I got home I spoke to my father who said \"you should put together a public company which will be investing in Internet stuff\". I spoke to Ed. He'd been having the same thoughts for six months.' The company's name came from a brainstorming session between chairman and chief executive. 'We sat around trying to dream up something whimsical but unforgettable which had a .com still available,' Guinan recalls. Guinan, a former Wall Street trader, claims Jellyworks has huge resources. 'We are unique in that we are not restricted by access to capital. If we saw an opportunity we wanted to deploy serious amounts of money to, we could do it. We have serious firepower. We're looking at larger transactions now. If we saw a \u00a3100m deal today we could do it.' So far, Jellyworks has done little to earn its stellar value. The company has made, or has options to make, investments in a number of Internet firms including EPO.com, a Swedish online investment bank; Antfactory, a US incubator for early-stage technology companies; and Orchestream, a software company specialising in solving Internet congestion problems. Orchestream's chief executive, Ashley Ward, is JellyWorks' sole non-executive director. Guinan is 52. Rowland insist theirs is a partnership of equals. Guinan is an expert in corporate finance while Rowland, who once worked in the family's property business as a trainee surveyor, is strong on identifying investment targets. Guinan says: 'This was a lucky relationship. We were old friends anyway. It's a very powerful situation. We have some deep brainstorming sessions. Jonathan and I could go and have a beer in a pub and create a new company, literally.' Rowland got the thirst for seeking out investment targets after working for his father. 'I decided 18 months ago the best thing to do was work with the old man, who had a proven track record. I'd resisted it for five or six years. I sat under his guidance, listened and learned.' He then started to identify Internet investment targets. 'I understood it better than he did. I started to source deals, ring people up, meet people.' Some of Rowland's earliest investments included Autonomy (an Internet software company) and Demon, an Internet Service Provider. Now things have changed. Answering to shareholders rather than to the Rowland family creates new pressures to deliver returns - either through selling Jellyworks' investments at a premium to trade or through Initial Public Offerings. This hybrid firm - a blend of venture capital outfit and shell company - may be a strange beast to UK investors, but it is not without successful precedents. Rowland cites as the company's role model CMGI, the US investment powerhouse which started out as a direct mailing firm and has now made billions by investing in technology stocks, notably Internet search engine Lycos. Of course, such success can be sustained only if the value of Jellyworks shares remains buoyant. If sentiment turns against the firm, chances are its boasts of being able to secure access to capital will wear thin. Guinan is dismissive about this possibility: 'We were asked \"is your company money for old rope?\". I'm not entirely sure what that comment meant. We see ourselves as building a billion-pound company.' Jonathan Rowland has even greater designs: 'I respect what Richard Branson's done with Virgin. I think we can make Jellyworks a similar sort of brand in the future.' The Internet - it's a wibbly, wobbly world.

      "body": "<p><strong>What is life coaching?</strong></p> <p>Life coaching is the newest, fastest and most effective way to reassess and rework any area of your life. What a personal trainer does for your body, a life coach does for the rest of your life. Your coach will meet you, get to know you, discover what areas of your life you feel dissatisfied or confused about, then help you develop a strategy for improving them. After an initial meeting, most coaching is done by telephone, with your coach pushing you, encouraging you and generally watching over you, making sure that you turn your plans into action. Coaching is not therapy. \"Coaching is more pragmatic and goal orientated,\" says Eileen Mulligan, our life coach for this series. \"We don't focus on the roots of problems, but on their solutions.\"</p> <p>Whatever your problems, the techniques of life coaching can help you become your own life coach, and give you new and effective ways to deal with them. </p> <p><strong>Creating the perfect job</strong></p> <p>I'm not going to tell you that you can do any job you want to - there may be good reasons why you can't. But I believe there may be less stopping you going after the career you really want than you think. </p> <p>Some of us know what our perfect job would be - but not how to get it. For others, even deciding what their perfect job would be is difficult. If this is your problem, it can be useful to revisit the personal core values list from lesson one. This is a list of the ten values (in order) that are most important to you. Common examples include love, security, respect, money, health, friendship, freedom, achievement, family, travel, etc. Creating your core values list can be hard - you may need to rework it before it really reflects how you think and feel. </p> <p>Once it's done, look at the list. If money, achievement and success are high on your list, work is obviously a priority. You can think big, but you need to ask yourself what else you are prepared to give up to achieve the things you want. If your core values are headed by things like family, relationships, independence, these are the clues you need to read in thinking up your perfect job.</p> <p>Working against your core values will never really make you happy, and will always feel harder and more stressful than doing work that reflects them. Try this simple exercise:</p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Imagine your ideal job. Write it down in as much detail as possible: what exactly does your work entail, what will you be doing, what kind of hours will you work, what are the salary and benefits like?</p> <p><strong> B:</strong> Imagine that you are interviewing somebody for that job. Prepare a detailed questionnaire and application form, and specify relevant qualifications. What sort of experience would the candidate require? What sort of person are you looking for?</p> <p><strong> C:</strong> Fill in the questionnaire and application form. Include your CV.</p> <p><strong> D: </strong> Did you give yourself the job? If not, how could you get it next time? What skills, training, or information do you need?</p> <p><strong>Means and ends goals</strong></p> <p>Throughout this life-coaching course, we have stressed the importance of setting goals. Of course, we all have different requirements from our work. Your goal may be to have a job with the ultimate aim of making lots of money. The bit in the middle - the work you do - may be less important, and job satisfaction may not be the goal you have set. But because work accounts for so much of our time, you need to be sure about what your means and ends goals are. Can you contend with a boring job? Will the pay be enough compensation? Are the demands on your time affecting your wellbeing? Is the end really enough to justify the means? Give this careful thought when you set your work and career goals. The end goal - such as making lots of money - may look attractive, but as you're carrying the bit in the middle, are you sure you've made the right choice?</p> <p><strong>The list</strong></p> <p>If you've been following this series from week one, you'll know that this list is the template for all the life coaching lessons. On paper, write down these five headings: goals, personal strengths, immediate challenges/ blocks/problems, development skills, achievements. Keep your work issues in mind. Do you want to change career? Improve your performance at work? Get promoted? Feel less stressed? Begin to fill in your list.</p> <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Remember to keep these positive, so: \"I want to get promoted in the next six months\" rather than \"I don't want to feel so undervalued\", and make them relate directly to you and your issues. So \"I want to improve my relationship with my boss\" rather than \"I want my boss to stop bullying me\". Bear in mind your means and ends goals - think very carefully before deciding what you really want to achieve, and what you might have to do to achieve it. Some examples of your work goals might be: improve my performance, build better relationships with clients and colleagues, find a better-paid job, work fewer hours.</p> <p><strong>Personal strengths:</strong> Here, you should list your personal strengths at work. Focus on the strengths you have that can help you achieve your goals. So if your goal is to be promoted, a strength that might support that would be \"I am determined\", or \"I am hardworking\". If your goal is to change career, your strengths might include \"I am a fast learner\" or \"I'm very motivated\". Other strengths could be: \"I'm a self-starter\", \"I'm highly organised\", \"I'm flexible\", \"I have the right skills\", \"I'm a good team player\", etc.</p> <p><strong>Immediate challenges/blocks/problems:</strong> Go back to your goals. They tell you what you want to achieve. Now think about what is standing in your way. Again, I must stress that you should keep the focus on yourself and the way the problems or blocks directly affect you. Blaming others: \"My boss undervalues me\", or \"my team don't give me enough support\" takes away your power to solve the problem. So instead of saying that your boss undervalues you, you can turn your problem around to \"I allow myself to be undervalued\". If the problem lies with you and your behaviour, you have the power to change it. Other problems and challenges might be \"I'm not very good at organising myself\", \"I take on too much\", \"I'm feeling bored and stuck\".</p> <p><strong>Development skills:</strong> Your development skills are areas where you can begin to change and improve and take yourself forward. Again, you should focus on the skills that will be most useful in achieving your goals. Some good examples could be: \"Learn to relax and switch off\", \"improve my sales skills\",\"become better organised\", \"take some additional courses or training programmes\", \"work on having a more positive attitude\".</p> <p><strong>Achievements:</strong> This is where you list all the achievements you have made at work. It's important to see what you've achieved at work, and to remind yourself how much you are capable of. This is a list you should be adding to daily. For example: \"I had good sales figures last month\", \"I was recently promoted\", \"I can get excellent references\".</p> <p><strong>Developing positive thinking</strong></p> <p>Keeping a positive mental attitude can help you with any problems or issues in your life. Putting a positive 'spin' on issues can powerfully affect your thinking and behaviour, and the way that other people react to you. Try these simple techniques.</p> <p>Police your thoughts. Remain conscious of what and how you think. For example, a colleague makes a silly mistake and you think: \"What an idiot\". When you make a mistake, and think you're the idiot, you'll understand why a better alternative is: \"We all make mistakes\". If you know that you're inclined to think and speak negatively about other people, you'll become your own victim.</p> <p>Convert a negative to a positive. Every time you find yourself thinking negatively - stop. Make a conscious decision to change that thought to a positive one. At first, you have to be very conscious of this, but, as time passes, thinking positively becomes a habit.</p> <p>Handling problems. If problems are blocking you, write them down. They look less threatening that way. Once they're on paper, treat them like a puzzle - it's a fundamental of life coaching that a puzzle requires only a solution or a formula, whereas a problem calls for an answer.</p> <p>Ask the right questions. Your brain will always try to find an answer when you ask it a question, so it's better to ask the right question, which means a positive one. </p> <p>Ask yourself: \"Why can't I solve this?\" Are you getting any useful answers? Now try this: \"How can I crack this problem?\" Do you see the difference? Asking \"why is this happening\" is counter-productive, whereas \"how can I make it work for me?\" pushes you into solution mode.</p> <p>Use affirmations. Affirmations are great for boosting your self-esteem and confidence, because although they may sound contrived at first, your subconscious mind will accept them. Set some affirmations specific to your situation, eg: \"I am committed to changing my situation\", \"I will set goals and achieve them\". As soon as you think \"I can't do this\", replace it with \"I can, and I will\".</p> <p><strong>Jane's story</strong></p> <p><strong>Eileen (the coach):</strong> Jane had been in her job as a manager for 10 years. Her problem was that she was dissatisfied with her work, but didn\u00cdt know what else she wanted to do. Her situation was complicated by the fact that her boss was also a close friend, which had both advantages and disadvantages. Jane felt taken for granted and undervalued - \"like part of the furniture\". On the surface, Jane seemed poised, confident and assertive, yet her consultation revealed a much lower self-esteem and a sensitive nature. Her colleagues may have taken her at face value and assumed she didn't need as much support as she actually does.</p> <p>When Jane produced her list of core values, she listed things like friendship, honesty, integrity and understanding. These are very people-orientated values, and it suggested that Jane's core problem with work lay not in the work itself, but in her work relationships. She was feeling bored and stuck after being in the same place for so long. I did not think Jane really needed or wanted to leave her job. She's very good at what she does, and that aspect of her working life is satisfactory. She is also security conscious, and had some fear about leaving a job she's done for so long. I felt it was more important for her to build up her self-esteem where she is before thinking of moving on. I suggested that she work on her current work relationships, including setting some boundaries with her boss and improving communication. It can be very empowering for clients to see how they can improve their situation by simply adopting a different attitude. If problems like these aren't worked out, they can follow an employee into their next job.</p> <p><strong>Jane (the client):</strong> I've never been wildly ambitious, but I felt that I should be - I've seen how satisfying work can be for some of my friends, and thought that if I could just discover the right kind of work, I'd feel the same. Discussing why I felt unhappy with my job, and then producing my core values, made me see my situation differently.</p> <p>It's very important to me to respect and like the people I work with - and the company I work for. That's a far bigger issue than the work I do, which I quite like and know I do well. I realise now that work just isn't my number one priority in life - but that I need to restructure my life, and adjust my attitude and way of working so that I don't feel so taken for granted. The best thing about life coaching is that you suddenly see your issues quite clearly and as puzzles to solve, rather than this rather depressing cloud that they'd felt like before. I've learnt some techniques for dealing with my boss, and I'm considering keeping my job but going part-time as a freelance and taking on another client. This would give me some variety and rejuvenate me. I know it won't be easy to do these things all at once, but my situation seems a lot clearer and more positive.</p> <p><strong>Final checklist</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Information is your ally. If you want to change jobs, find out as much as possible about the area you want to move into.</p> <p>\u0095 Develop a clear, positive attitude. </p> <p>\u0095 Be clear about your means-and-ends goals.</p> <p>\u0095 Create your perfect job.</p> <p>\u0095 Review your list, and make sure you have a clear time-frame and plan of action.</p>",

Jane felt taken for granted and undervalued - \"like part of the furniture\". On the surface, Jane seemed poised, confident and assertive, yet her consultation revealed a much lower self-esteem and a sensitive nature. Her colleagues may have taken her at face value and assumed she didn't need as much support as she actually does. When Jane produced her list of core values, she listed things like friendship, honesty, integrity and understanding. These are very people-orientated values, and it suggested that Jane's core problem with work lay not in the work itself, but in her work relationships. She was feeling bored and stuck after being in the same place for so long. I did not think Jane really needed or wanted to leave her job. She's very good at what she does, and that aspect of her working life is satisfactory. She is also security conscious, and had some fear about leaving a job she's done for so long. I felt it was more important for her to build up her self-esteem where she is before thinking of moving on. I suggested that she work on her current work relationships, including setting some boundaries with her boss and improving communication. It can be very empowering for clients to see how they can improve their situation by simply adopting a different attitude. If problems like these aren't worked out, they can follow an employee into their next job. Jane (the client): I've never been wildly ambitious, but I felt that I should be - I've seen how satisfying work can be for some of my friends, and thought that if I could just discover the right kind of work, I'd feel the same. Discussing why I felt unhappy with my job, and then producing my core values, made me see my situation differently. It's very important to me to respect and like the people I work with - and the company I work for. That's a far bigger issue than the work I do, which I quite like and know I do well. I realise now that work just isn't my number one priority in life - but that I need to restructure my life, and adjust my attitude and way of working so that I don't feel so taken for granted. The best thing about life coaching is that you suddenly see your issues quite clearly and as puzzles to solve, rather than this rather depressing cloud that they'd felt like before. I've learnt some techniques for dealing with my boss, and I'm considering keeping my job but going part-time as a freelance and taking on another client. This would give me some variety and rejuvenate me. I know it won't be easy to do these things all at once, but my situation seems a lot clearer and more positive. Final checklist \u0095 Information is your ally. If you want to change jobs, find out as much as possible about the area you want to move into. \u0095 Develop a clear, positive attitude. \u0095 Be clear about your means-and-ends goals. \u0095 Create your perfect job. \u0095 Review your list, and make sure you have a clear time-frame and plan of action.",
