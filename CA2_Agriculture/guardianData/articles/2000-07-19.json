      "bodyText": "The latest leaked memo, from Labour's pollster Philip Gould yesterday reinforced the impression that Tony Blair runs the country with a tiny band of advisers. And that band can easily be spooked. A few successful campaigns by the Conservative leader, William Hague, have created an unjustified sense of panic in Mr Blair's team. Mr Gould, in his memo, warned ominously that the Labour \"brand\"' had been \"badly contaminated\" and the party faced dramatic losses at the general election. Collectively, the memos leaked so far - and Downing Street and Labour headquarters at Millbank are braced for more - point to rule by kitchen cabinet. Accelerating the trend of previous prime ministers, Mr Blair has become increasingly presidential, largely ignoring the cabinet, parliament and his own party, both MPs and the grassroots. The danger in the confined space of a bunker is that when one member takes fright, as Mr Gould has done, the sense of panic spreads quickly to the other members. A sense of proportion can be more easily maintained by the prime minister speaking widely, especially to cabinet colleagues. Tellingly, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, claimed yesterday that even he was not part of the inner circle on Mr Gould's mailing list. One ex-permanent secretary recently told Peter Hennessy, a constitutional expert: \"There used to be something called cabinet government. It was declining when I was there in the 1980s, but now it seems almost to have died.\" At the core of Mr Blair's government are: his press secretary, Alastair Campbell, powerful because he sees him almost every day; Mr Brown (even if he is not on Mr Gould's mailing list); and Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary who, along with Mr Brown, will run Labour's election campaign. In spite of their personal differences, Mr Blair and Mr Brown speak regularly, just as they did when they had offices side by side in opposition. They often dispense with notetakers at their meetings, to the annoyance of their officials. There is a cluster of others round this inner core, most unknown to the public: Anji Hunter, who has been Mr Blair's personal assistant since his days in opposition; Jonathan Powell, the Downing Street chief of staff; David Miliband, from the Downing Street policy unit; and Sally Morgan, also from the policy unit and main link with the party. Ms Morgan, for instance, will have a huge say in cabinet reshuffles. After that, it depends on the policy under discussion: the big-hitting ministers, Jack Straw, David Blunkett, John Prescott and Robin Cook, are regular visitors. Many of the other ministers are largely ignored, as too are backbenchers and the Labour party at large. Labour headquarters in the run-up to the 1997 general election had been a centre of power but has been neutralised, with Mr Blair unhappy with the performance of the general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, and other staff members. They have been blamed for various election embarrassments, though most of these can be traced to Mr Blair's centralising tendency, attempting to block Ken Livingstone in London and Rhodri Morgan in Wales. One minister yesterday expressed sympathy with the prime minister for ignoring the cabinet, saying many had failed to perform. He added that even when a reshuffle comes - Mr Blair has told colleagues he will not reshuffle the cabinet this year - there is not exactly a pool of talent waiting to get in. Downing Street will not tell reporters or historians how the prime minister spends his day. But cabinet meetings last usually less than an hour these days - a brief series of reports by senior ministers, an occasional round-the-table discussion on policy (poverty or Kosovo), sometimes on the overall political situation. But most business is done via cabinet committee or sub-committee, or between a minister and Mr Blair on the prime minister's white sofa just off the cabinet room in No 10. A Labour insider who has worked in both Downing Street and Millbank yesterday attempted to dispel the idea that Mr Blair had fallen into the trap of listening only to a few trusted people. \"The idea that he is stuck in the bunker is untrue,\" he said. \"The modern political leader has to have lots of communications and meetings for them to be effective.\" He claimed that Mr Gould's memos should be seen in perspective. His job was to offer advice on political strategy - and to give Mr Blair views that at times might seem bleak - but not on health, education, transport or other policy issues, which were the domain of cabinet ministers. Mr Gould's memos are a mix of views from focus groups and his own opinions, and those of other members of the inner circle, such as his friend Mr Mandelson. He quotes in the memo Mr Mandelson saying: \"How did we get here? Something has gone seriously wrong. But what is it?\" They should not be spooked so easily. After three years of having most of his speeches almost ignored, William Hague made the front pages this year over crime and, as Mr Gould's memo points out, has again positioned the Conservatives as the patriotic party. But the economy, the determining factor in most elections, is in relatively good shape, as Mr Brown demonstrated on Wednesday. And Mr Hague, in spite of his successes, remains largely unpopular. There would be less panic in Downing Street if Mr Blair expanded rather than narrowed those he listens to. But that is unlikely to happen, at least this side of the general election.

People who have been through a near-death experience sometimes report that they are in a long dark tunnel, but the end is a brightly lit scene, filled with happy folk.</p> <p>Some say it looks like a picnic in a summer meadow, and claim to have seen smiling friends beckoning. Not surprisingly, many people who later recover believe they have had a glimpse of the afterlife, though this can be spoiled by the fact that several say they saw people who were still alive. New research suggests the phenomenon may be chemical, possibly associated with oxygen leaving the brain.</p> <p>Anyhow, that's how Mr Blair must have felt yesterday. He left behind all the woes and tribulations of this vale of tears, climbed into the long thin tube, and in the distance he could see all his friends - Bill Clinton, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, whoever is prime minister of Japan this week - all calling to him in soothing voices, saying \"welcome, welcome, Tony, have a harp\".</p> <p>To join the choir invisible must be bliss after Mr Blair's multitudinous sufferings this week on earth. Yesterday William Hague attacked him over the various leaked memos. \"Even Napoleon didn't commission memos talking about the right place in history,\" he said sarcastically, as if Napoleon were a man beyond caring what the vulgar herd thought of him.</p> <p>Then he spoiled the effect.

      "bodyText": "The moment prime minister's questions finished, Tony Blair was off to the plane for Tokyo and the G8 summit. People who have been through a near-death experience sometimes report that they are in a long dark tunnel, but the end is a brightly lit scene, filled with happy folk. Some say it looks like a picnic in a summer meadow, and claim to have seen smiling friends beckoning. Not surprisingly, many people who later recover believe they have had a glimpse of the afterlife, though this can be spoiled by the fact that several say they saw people who were still alive. New research suggests the phenomenon may be chemical, possibly associated with oxygen leaving the brain. Anyhow, that's how Mr Blair must have felt yesterday. He left behind all the woes and tribulations of this vale of tears, climbed into the long thin tube, and in the distance he could see all his friends - Bill Clinton, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, whoever is prime minister of Japan this week - all calling to him in soothing voices, saying \"welcome, welcome, Tony, have a harp\". To join the choir invisible must be bliss after Mr Blair's multitudinous sufferings this week on earth. Yesterday William Hague attacked him over the various leaked memos. \"Even Napoleon didn't commission memos talking about the right place in history,\" he said sarcastically, as if Napoleon were a man beyond caring what the vulgar herd thought of him. Then he spoiled the effect. It was, he said \"pathetic\" that after three years in government the prime minister was going round Whitehall asking for \"eye-catching initiatives\". Winston Churchill \"did not ask for blood, sweat... \" but Mr Hague got no further, for the entire Labour side, sensing that for once their leader might just come out on top in these exchanges, erupted in loud fake derision. Was it because evoking Churchill is such a cliche? Or because Mr Hague seemed implicitly to be comparing himself to that other round-faced baldy? \"Or sweat...\" he tried again. The barrage of noise grew louder. \"He didn't ask for...\" \"Order, order, AWDER!\" yelled Betty Boothroyd. \"Oh yes, oh yes, there's plenty more where that came from,\" said the Tory leader. \"Plenty more,\" he added against the wall of sound that threatened at times to overwhelm him. \"He didn't ask for blood, sweat and... he didn't ask for blood, sweat... and eye-catching initiatives,\" he finally finished. As he sank back gratefully into his seat, I reflected that there can have been few politicians in history who could spot an eye-catching initiative faster than Winston Churchill. A hack himself (\"hissing spears answered the scratch of my quill pen\" he possibly wrote during the Boer war), he turned up in a silly hat at the siege of Sydney Street, posed with tommy guns, sent the troops into the south Wales coalfields (\"tough on grime, tough on the causes of grime\") and surrounded himself with more props than Paul Daniels - the V-sign, the hat, the siren suit and the cigars. The man was a sultan of spin, a whirling dervish of photo-opportunities. You might as easily hold him up as a model of sobriety. So Mr Hague and Mr Blair had another foolish spat. Mr Blair intends to say that the Tories will take \u00a324m from every constituency in the land, which is nonsense, and the Tories are going to abuse Alastair Campbell, as if any sane person cared.

      "body": "<p>You could almost feel the waves of relief surging from the squat sprawl of the Microsoft campus at Redmond, Washington. Good news hasn't been plentiful there in recent months, but one day last month it started arriving in bucketfuls. </p> <p>Larry Ellison, the charismatic, Armani-clad chief of the software giant Oracle and a bitter foe of Bill Gates, had been forced into a humiliating admission: he had hired private detectives who had been caught sifting through the rubbish of organisations he believed to be linked to Microsoft. (Ellison denies having authorised anyone to break the law). </p> <p>Ellison claimed to have uncovered a network of \"Microsoft front groups\" who were misrepresenting themselves as independent pressure groups opposed to the US government's anti-monopoly action against the firm. But all that was easily dismissed as the ramblings of a man who has never made a secret of his envy of Bill Gates. The resignation two weeks ago of Oracle's president, Ray Lane, though officially unconnected, cemented Microsoft's glee. If this grubby episode ever comes to court, it doesn't look like the sort of thing to detain a jury for long. </p> <p>But then very little is ever as it seems in the spite-fuelled upper echelons of Silicon Valley, and \"Larrygate\" has proved no exception. Ellison may be renowned as a brash playboy with a taste for ostentatious displays of wealth but it is by no means so certain that he is a delusional conspiracy theorist as well. Look more closely at the pro-Microsoft groups he targeted - and others like them - and things start to get bizarre indeed. Welcome to the strange, disorienting world of Microsoft's public relations campaign, where appearances are frequently deceptive, and where apparent groundswells of public support turn out to have been heavily financed by the company itself. </p> <p>One point of entry to this hall of mirrors is to be found on Eye Street, in the Foggy Bottom district of central Washington DC. Number 1225 is the home of the Association for Competitive Technology (Act), and it was here, last year, that a woman reportedly working for Investigative Group International, the firm hired by Ellison, tried unsuccessfully to persuade two cleaners to accept $1,200 in exchange for the contents of its wastepaper baskets. Act's president - an ebullient software developer named Jonathan Zuck - was a regular fixture at the Microsoft trial, briefing the media on the lunacy of the government's case. This much is undisputed. After that, things start to get complicated. </p> <p>Act - which says it represents \"mostly small-and mid-sized companies\" - lists Microsoft as one of several founder members. It is not so obvious from its literature that Microsoft is also one of its major funders - the major funder by a long chalk, according to US press reports, though Zuck won't reveal the exact figure. Some might say that from the single-mindedness with which it argues Microsoft's case, it looks a lot like it was established at the Redmond giant's behest. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Microsoft points out, there are other groups that feel the same way - groups such as Americans for Technology Leadership (ATL), which describes itself as \"a broad-based coalition of technology professionals, consumers and organisations dedicated to limiting government regulation of technology\". Established shortly after the antitrust case began, ATL also turns out to be heavily funded by Microsoft, though again the amount is unknown. Should you wish to track down ATL, you won't have to go far, because its offices are also at 1225 Eye Street: on the very same floor. And if you want to talk to its founder, you won't have to go anywhere at all - because it's Jonathan Zuck. </p> <p>\"They're definitely one of our biggest contributors - we've been open about that from day one [and] it's the wrong issue to be focusing on,\" says Zuck. He insists that Oracle indulges in many of the very lobbying practices it criticises: \"All this horseshit that [Ellison] was spewing . . . bears very little resemblance to his own business practices.\" </p> <p>But there are still more mirrors, more wheels within corporate wheels. ATL's current chief executive, Josh Mathis, benefits from Microsoft money in another way. When he isn't leading the anti-monopoly uprising from Eye Street, Mathis is an employee of DCI/New Media, an Arizona-based company that \"specialises in using cutting-edge technology to move public opinion\" - setting up large-scale phone-bank operations to stoke indignation among voters and persuading them to lobby their elected representatives.

      "bodyText": "You could almost feel the waves of relief surging from the squat sprawl of the Microsoft campus at Redmond, Washington. Good news hasn't been plentiful there in recent months, but one day last month it started arriving in bucketfuls. Larry Ellison, the charismatic, Armani-clad chief of the software giant Oracle and a bitter foe of Bill Gates, had been forced into a humiliating admission: he had hired private detectives who had been caught sifting through the rubbish of organisations he believed to be linked to Microsoft. (Ellison denies having authorised anyone to break the law). Ellison claimed to have uncovered a network of \"Microsoft front groups\" who were misrepresenting themselves as independent pressure groups opposed to the US government's anti-monopoly action against the firm. But all that was easily dismissed as the ramblings of a man who has never made a secret of his envy of Bill Gates. The resignation two weeks ago of Oracle's president, Ray Lane, though officially unconnected, cemented Microsoft's glee. If this grubby episode ever comes to court, it doesn't look like the sort of thing to detain a jury for long. But then very little is ever as it seems in the spite-fuelled upper echelons of Silicon Valley, and \"Larrygate\" has proved no exception. Ellison may be renowned as a brash playboy with a taste for ostentatious displays of wealth but it is by no means so certain that he is a delusional conspiracy theorist as well. Look more closely at the pro-Microsoft groups he targeted - and others like them - and things start to get bizarre indeed. Welcome to the strange, disorienting world of Microsoft's public relations campaign, where appearances are frequently deceptive, and where apparent groundswells of public support turn out to have been heavily financed by the company itself. One point of entry to this hall of mirrors is to be found on Eye Street, in the Foggy Bottom district of central Washington DC. Number 1225 is the home of the Association for Competitive Technology (Act), and it was here, last year, that a woman reportedly working for Investigative Group International, the firm hired by Ellison, tried unsuccessfully to persuade two cleaners to accept $1,200 in exchange for the contents of its wastepaper baskets. Act's president - an ebullient software developer named Jonathan Zuck - was a regular fixture at the Microsoft trial, briefing the media on the lunacy of the government's case. This much is undisputed. After that, things start to get complicated. Act - which says it represents \"mostly small-and mid-sized companies\" - lists Microsoft as one of several founder members. It is not so obvious from its literature that Microsoft is also one of its major funders - the major funder by a long chalk, according to US press reports, though Zuck won't reveal the exact figure. Some might say that from the single-mindedness with which it argues Microsoft's case, it looks a lot like it was established at the Redmond giant's behest. Nevertheless, Microsoft points out, there are other groups that feel the same way - groups such as Americans for Technology Leadership (ATL), which describes itself as \"a broad-based coalition of technology professionals, consumers and organisations dedicated to limiting government regulation of technology\". Established shortly after the antitrust case began, ATL also turns out to be heavily funded by Microsoft, though again the amount is unknown. Should you wish to track down ATL, you won't have to go far, because its offices are also at 1225 Eye Street: on the very same floor. And if you want to talk to its founder, you won't have to go anywhere at all - because it's Jonathan Zuck. \"They're definitely one of our biggest contributors - we've been open about that from day one [and] it's the wrong issue to be focusing on,\" says Zuck. He insists that Oracle indulges in many of the very lobbying practices it criticises: \"All this horseshit that [Ellison] was spewing . . . bears very little resemblance to his own business practices.\" But there are still more mirrors, more wheels within corporate wheels. ATL's current chief executive, Josh Mathis, benefits from Microsoft money in another way. When he isn't leading the anti-monopoly uprising from Eye Street, Mathis is an employee of DCI/New Media, an Arizona-based company that \"specialises in using cutting-edge technology to move public opinion\" - setting up large-scale phone-bank operations to stoke indignation among voters and persuading them to lobby their elected representatives. Clients include the tobacco lobby, the National Rifle Association - and Microsoft. They have a word in Washington for the corporate-sponsored outcry, the grassroots movement that isn't: AstroTurf. By far the most comical example of this is to be found at the Freedom to Innovate Network (Fin), a \"non-partisan, grassroots network of citizens and businesses who have a stake in the success of Microsoft and the high-tech industry\". Fin doesn't try particularly hard to appear independent - its website, after all, is housed on Microsoft's own - but it has as its online centrepiece a lengthy collection of testimonials from activist groups with vaguely alarming names: the Centre for the Moral Defence of Capitalism, Frontiers of Freedom, Defenders of Property Rights.

Having sat for nearly 90 minutes through a ceremony that overran by 20, she stood up and in a firm voice - not unlike her daughter's - gave a model of a brief speech of thanks. It comprised about 70 words including \"joy\", \"heartfelt\", \"wonderful\" and \"lovely\", concluding: \"I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did. God bless you all and thank you.\"</p> <p>It was an extraordinary occasion (on an actuarial basis, literally so) which, in true British fashion, mixed the impressive and the ludicrous about equally. A hundred white doves were released: they wheeled towards Trafalgar Square then, perhaps seeing their common cousins, turned south. A million rose petals were released, rather pointlessly. A huge birthday card and cake were produced. Overall, it did fair justice to the Queen Mother's indomitability, inscrutability and sheer ecleticism.</p> <p>She arrived, dressed in pink, in an open coach with the Prince of Wales and settled down to watch what began as a bog standard, if scaled-down, military display. Representatives of service units with which she is most closely connected - from the Black Watch to the Witwatersrand Rifles - marched past briskly. The RAF were particularly brisk: they were reduced to four men with one sword and two bayonets between them, suggesting defence cuts Gordon Brown has yet to announce.</p> <p>Then the mood changed quite dramatically. There was a parade giving a brief but bowdlerised history of the 20th century, an idea that was perhaps considered too naff even for the Dome. You could tell we had reached the war when the air raid siren went.</p> <p>\"The 1950s,\" declared the announcer. \"The first package holiday. The Mouse Trap. The Belisha Beacon.\" (And the death of my husband, Her Majesty might have thought). Four Beatles lookalikes passed by, then the 1970s: \"Decimalisation! Punk! And the Braemar Games!\" The 1980s apparently had \"emails!, the Wombles! And of course Del Boy and Rodney!\" The 1990s had the Channel Tunnel, the Dome and oil prospecting at Windsor Castle. (Diana? Diana Who?)</p> <p>After Sir Norman Wisdom had gone by on a rickety trailer marked \"The British Film Industry\", we got the Queen Mother's corgis Rush and Minnie, who looked overweight.</p> <p>But then came the centrepiece of it all: the 179 organisations of which the Queen Mother is honorary fellow, honorary freeman, honorary member, patron or president entered the arena to join the others. It was like the old line about watching the population of China go by: the line never ended. There was the Mothers' Union and the Girls' Brigade (whose signs when they relaxed said PPY THD Y), the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management followed by the Bembridge Lifeboat and the Poultry Club of Great Britain.</p> <p>The Worshipful Company of Grocers came in on camelback and one of the camels, showing an exaggerated sense of deference, dropped to its knees as it passed the dais. There was the Grand Antiquity Society of Glasgow and the Hastings Winkle Club.</p> <p>And our grandest antiquity never wilted. On and on they came: 50 men dressed as chefs from the Cookery and Food Association and a lone flag bearer from the London Library, the West Ham Central Mission, the Tidy Britain Group, even for obscure reasons a British Gas lorry. One was left amazed not only at her stamina as a 99-year-old watching all this but her stamina of a lifetime. Whether or not she really has much inkling who many of these people are, they believe profoundly that she does and that in itself is a piece of royal magic.</p>",

The putative centenarian marked the occasion by doing something most of her audience could probably never recall happening before: she spoke. Having sat for nearly 90 minutes through a ceremony that overran by 20, she stood up and in a firm voice - not unlike her daughter's - gave a model of a brief speech of thanks. It comprised about 70 words including \"joy\", \"heartfelt\", \"wonderful\" and \"lovely\", concluding: \"I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did. God bless you all and thank you.\" It was an extraordinary occasion (on an actuarial basis, literally so) which, in true British fashion, mixed the impressive and the ludicrous about equally. A hundred white doves were released: they wheeled towards Trafalgar Square then, perhaps seeing their common cousins, turned south. A million rose petals were released, rather pointlessly. A huge birthday card and cake were produced. Overall, it did fair justice to the Queen Mother's indomitability, inscrutability and sheer ecleticism. She arrived, dressed in pink, in an open coach with the Prince of Wales and settled down to watch what began as a bog standard, if scaled-down, military display. Representatives of service units with which she is most closely connected - from the Black Watch to the Witwatersrand Rifles - marched past briskly. The RAF were particularly brisk: they were reduced to four men with one sword and two bayonets between them, suggesting defence cuts Gordon Brown has yet to announce. Then the mood changed quite dramatically. There was a parade giving a brief but bowdlerised history of the 20th century, an idea that was perhaps considered too naff even for the Dome. You could tell we had reached the war when the air raid siren went. \"The 1950s,\" declared the announcer. \"The first package holiday. The Mouse Trap. The Belisha Beacon.\" (And the death of my husband, Her Majesty might have thought). Four Beatles lookalikes passed by, then the 1970s: \"Decimalisation! Punk! And the Braemar Games!\" The 1980s apparently had \"emails!, the Wombles! And of course Del Boy and Rodney!\" The 1990s had the Channel Tunnel, the Dome and oil prospecting at Windsor Castle. (Diana? Diana Who?) After Sir Norman Wisdom had gone by on a rickety trailer marked \"The British Film Industry\", we got the Queen Mother's corgis Rush and Minnie, who looked overweight. But then came the centrepiece of it all: the 179 organisations of which the Queen Mother is honorary fellow, honorary freeman, honorary member, patron or president entered the arena to join the others. It was like the old line about watching the population of China go by: the line never ended. There was the Mothers' Union and the Girls' Brigade (whose signs when they relaxed said PPY THD Y), the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management followed by the Bembridge Lifeboat and the Poultry Club of Great Britain. The Worshipful Company of Grocers came in on camelback and one of the camels, showing an exaggerated sense of deference, dropped to its knees as it passed the dais. There was the Grand Antiquity Society of Glasgow and the Hastings Winkle Club. And our grandest antiquity never wilted. On and on they came: 50 men dressed as chefs from the Cookery and Food Association and a lone flag bearer from the London Library, the West Ham Central Mission, the Tidy Britain Group, even for obscure reasons a British Gas lorry. One was left amazed not only at her stamina as a 99-year-old watching all this but her stamina of a lifetime. Whether or not she really has much inkling who many of these people are, they believe profoundly that she does and that in itself is a piece of royal magic.",

Labour's lead plummeted to 10 points, while the Guardian's ICM pitched it at seven. We should doubtless pay tribute to the seer's judgment. Perhaps his anxieties were spot on. Maybe he was at the edge of the future curve, where all prophets like to be. Certainly, since the lead once stood at 30, there's no denying that a downward momentum has brought the government in sight of earth.</p> <p>But there's another way of looking at the shift between May and July. Starting in April, this was the period in which the Gould messages bore down on Mr Blair. The two we know about conveyed a sense of total panic. Everything is going wrong, said Gould. \"TB is not believed to be real.\" \"TB is out of touch - he does not really care.\" \"We are outflanked on patriotism and crime.\" On hearing this, TB immediately jumped to it. We see this in his own leaked memo from the same time, itemising worries about crime, patriotism and his personal image. He was desperately seeking initiatives to meet the Gould perceptions.</p> <p>Mr Gould's first role, therefore, is as an agent of exaggerated terror. The two months that followed his sepulchral commentaries on a 16-point lead have seen the government looking ever more unstable, lurching about in response to what we now know was his advice. It hadn't been exactly calm before. But the leaks show us a collective state of mind we may have been only half aware of. No wonder, with all that stuff pouring into his head, the prime minister got rattled.

He explains this ideology of exposure in his book about the 1997 victory, The Unfinished Revolution. \"If a strategy is not in writing, it does not exist,\" a Clinton adviser had told him. So these springtime memos virtuously offered Blair the \"complete understanding of your weaknesses\" which Gould thinks leaders should get from people like him. \"The odd leak,\" his book goes on, \"is small change compared with that and, in any event, the leaked truth can not only help prod an organisation in the right direction, but also tell the world that it is still listening, it still cares.\"</p> <p>To a talent for hysteria, therefore, the Gould approach to politics adds arrogant naivety. He's probably changed his mind about the therapy of leaks. But assertions about what the public really thinks remain the basis of his business. His interpretation of the focus groups he assembles, whose wisdom he passionately believes in, carried huge influence with Mr Blair in 1996-97. This remains so. We approach the heart of the matter. What I get from the latest leak is not the confessional brilliance of Gould's insights but the part these have played in the very problem that's making him and the Labour leadership despair.</p> <p>He says, on the one hand, that Labour is seen as lacking conviction.

Successful campaigns, he writes, are built \"on the synthesis of contrasting ideas and contrasting policies\".</p> <p>Could there be a better recipe for disconnection? As for spin, it's the essence of what this guru of scientific populism brought to the Labour high command. In both his book and his memos, appearance is what dominates. The politics of perception is all. What people think is what matters. It should be your guide, both on what to do and on whether your actions are effective. In Gould's world, perception, far from being at odds with reality, is reality. And that is exactly Labour's problem. Its substance is not apparent. Its manipulation is too obvious. \"We are not believed\" (quote: P Gould).</p> <p>This, then, is a chief apostle of what is going wrong. He recommended a draining of much of the conviction which, he now observes, Labour is seen as lacking.

      "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton has received support from an unlikely quarter in her attempt to fight off claims that she used an ethnic insult against a campaign aide 26 years ago. New York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, said he did not believe that she had called the aide a \"fucking Jew bastard\" and, even if she had, the events of 1974 no longer mattered. But as Mr Giuliani defended Mrs Clinton, further evidence emerged to suggest that the incident - if it happened - was not isolated. \"I'm willing to accept her at her word that she didn't, and basically say it's irrelevant what she said and did 26 years ago,\" said Mr Giuliani, who was Mrs Clinton's opponent in the race for a New York Senate seat until he withdrew in the spring after health and marital problems. \"It seems to me that she has a long public career since 26 years ago that people can agree on, disagree on. Ultimately, I can't imagine that a single voter is going to care what she said or did 26 years ago when she has a long record now of her relationships with the Jewish people, on a personal basis, which appear to be perfectly normal and fine.\" But Larry Patterson, a former state trooper who was assigned to protect Bill and Hillary Clinton when Mr Clinton was governor of Arkansas, said: \"I heard the first lady, Hillary Clinton, and Bill Clinton both use anti-semitic and racial slurs. The words - this is the verbiage they used - either Jew bastard or Jew boy or Jew MF [motherfucker]. \"Four, five, six times. I do not remember the exact amount of times that she used this kind of verbiage, but she certainly used it on a number of occasions. When she would be upset with some of the black leaders in the state or detractors of the governor she would use the N word. \"If we could offer immunity, there would be 10 or 15 people that are still working Arkansas state policemen who heard statements like this being made by both Bill and Hillary Clinton. I'm retired, but what these people would want is some assurances that they would not, you know, be terminated from their employment.\" The ethnic jibe claim was made in a book published this week. Jerry Oppenheimer, a former reporter on the National Enquirer tabloid, claims that Mrs Clinton directed the insult at a campaign manager, Paul Fray, on the night that Mr Clinton lost an election for a seat in Congress. Mr Fray has said he would like to bury the hatchet. \"This matter will go away,\" he said. \"I don't want to adversely affect her race.\" Mrs Clinton is level in the polls with Rick Lazio, a Long Island congressman who took Mr Giuliani's place when the mayor stepped down. It has since emerged that Mr Fray surrendered his law licence 20 years ago after being paid to alter a court document. In addition, he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage that led to seizures, addiction to pain killers, erratic behaviour and memory loss, according to court records. The Jewish electorate accounts for about 14% of the vote in New York state. Polls show that Mrs Clinton had just over 50% of that figure before the Oppenheimer story broke but most observers believe she must capture 60% if she is to win the Senate seat. Three Jewish Democratic members of Congress representing New York state rallied to Mrs Clinton's side with a letter to Mr Lazio which said: \"Your political use of this ridiculous allegation will only hurt our efforts to combat true anti-semitism whenever it rears its ugly head.\" Further backing came from the Nobel peace prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who said: \"All these stories about her anti-semitism are wrong.

The announcement was made as Home Office figures showed that police numbers in England and Wales had fallen by a further 1,678 in the last year to 124,418 - a total drop of 2,740 since Labour came to power in May 1997. Police forces, who are losing thousands of experienced officers each year, are facing an uphill struggle to attract recruits and the 7,000 a year training capacity for new officers is already fully stretched to meet Mr Straw's Labour party conference pledge last October. Nevertheless the Home Office estimates that the extra 9,000 recruits - who are to be taken on at 3,000 a year over the next three years - will boost police numbers to 128,300 by March 2002 - a level last seen in 1993. Mr Straw said yesterday there would be record number of police officers by March 2003. At the same time that Mr Straw was promising extra police to answer criticism that Labour was being seen as \"soft on crime\", the House of Lords staged a revolt on the government's plan to take welfare benefits away from convicted offenders who repeatedly breached their community penalties, such as probation. Ministers accepted amendments from Lady Kennedy and Lord Windlesham which restored to the courts from the probation service, the right to deny someone welfare benefits. The amendments effectively make the scheme unworkable. The promise of more police recruits came as Mr Straw detailed to the Commons the impact on the home office of the chancellor's comprehensive spending review.

In the wake of the Tony Martin case, which was highlighted by Tony Blair as badly handled by Labour, the Home Office also announced a \u00a3600,000 boost for policing in the Fenlands part of East Anglia. Simon Hughes, for the Liberal Democrats welcomed the extra recruits but said three years of sticking to Tory spending plans had guaranteed that there would be fewer police officers at the next election than there were at the last. For the Conservatives, Ann Widdecombe claimed that after the rising crime figures published this week the home secretary's announcements \"had as much credibility as Billy Bunter's postal orders.\" For his part, Mr Straw claimed that police numbers had been falling since the Major government in 1992. Conscious that his previous announcement ran into flak amidst accusations of double counting, Mr Straw told MPs yesterday that the additional funding was \"for a further 4,000 recruits over and above those already planned, taking the total to an additional 9,000 recruits by 2003-04. \"Since 1994 the Home Office has had no direct control over officer numbers.

A new London allowance of \u00a33,329 for those who joined after 1994 has also been announced to try to meet the particular difficulties of recruiting in the high house price areas of greater London.

      "body": "<p>The 1990s may have been a good decade for the economy, but they were terrible for public spending. When Gordon Brown said yesterday that he had to take difficult decisions on public spending when he arrived at the Treasury in May 1997, he did not spell out that equally difficult decisions had been taken by his Conservative predecessors. </p> <p>According to the Treasury's own figures, public spending was lower in real terms in the 1999-2000 financial year than in the mid-1990s and barely higher than in 1992-93, when Britain began to emerge from the ERM-induced recession. </p> <p>After the five-year drought the rainy season has arrived. In fact, this year sees a monsoon of money hitting the public sector, with real spending up by almost 7%. Over the next three years, Mr Brown has pencilled in further real rises averaging 3.2% a year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said yesterday. </p> <p>In real terms, spending by Whitehall departments will rise by 5.3% on average over the next three years. But not all Mr Brown's cabinet colleagues shared equally in the bounty. </p> <p>The biggest winner was John Prescott at the department of environment, transport and the regions, with a 15.6% increase. Transport is top of the list because Mr Brown has skewed spending towards infrastructure projects, where investment will rise by 35% a year - and transport is the one department where more than half the budget is capital. </p> <p>David Blunkett at education and employment is the next biggest beneficiary, with an 8% settlement, followed by Alan Milburn at health (6.6%), Jack Straw at the Home Office (6.4%), Nick Brown at agriculture (6.4%), and Clare Short at international development (6.2%). </p> <p>The losers - with annual increases below the average of 5.3% - are Chris Smith at culture, media and sport (4.1%), local government (3.2%), Robin Cook at the Foreign Office (2.7%), Stephen Byers at trade and industry (1.8%) and Geoff Hoon at defence (0.3%). </p> <p>As far as education is concerned the scale of the increases marks a break with the past. The IFS said that spending under the Conservatives had risen by 1.5% a year in real terms, while in Labour's first two years it increased by 0.2%. In the five years from 1999 to 2004, education spending will rise 5.9% a year. </p> <p>Labour's record on health, despite the spending freeze, was better. Over the duration of the present parliament money was pumped in at the rate of 4.7% a year, compared to 3.1% during the Conservative years and 3.4% since Nye Bevan became the first health secretary in 1948. The 6.2% a year real increase from 1999 to 2004 has been surpassed in only one previous five-year period, from 1971 to 1976. </p> <p>The IFS shares Mr Brown's confidence that the increases can be afforded. Even at the end of the period covered by the plans, spending will still be lower as a proportion of output than it was in the early 1990s. Higher allocations for Whitehall departments have already been paid for through the higher taxes imposed since 1997. </p> <p>But affordability is not everything. One of the motivations for three-year spending periods is to allow departments to plan over longer periods - but this is not happening. The IFS said yesterday that only 0.8% of departmental expenditure limits would be unchanged in the third year of the first spending plan, and in almost every case the limit had been raised rather than lowered. </p> <p>Two other questions remain: has Mr Brown left it all too late and is it possible to manage the public sector through a form of central planning? </p> <p>There is some evidence that even in areas where Mr Brown has already made more money available - capital spending, for example - departments have forgotten how to spend, or lack the expertise to turn ideas into reality. In some areas, as the IMF pointed out yesterday, even the whopping increases on offer will not make up for the deep cuts seen over the past 10 years. DETR spending will still only account for around 1.5% of GDP after the investment on public transport, compared to 2% in the early 1990s. This is the last chance for the government to get it right. If the public sees no improvement after these increases, Labour will have run out of excuses. </p> <p>Mr Brown's goal of improving public services by tying Whitehall departments to performance targets is laudable, but the IFS cast doubt on its practicality. The Treasury sets goals which can be quantified; but they are not necessarily the goals that matter.</p> <p> <strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sr2000/report/index.html\">Spending review: full text</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/csr/story/0,2763,344690,00.html\">Full text of chancellor's speech</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,344654,00.html\">The issue explained</a></p>",

Over the duration of the present parliament money was pumped in at the rate of 4.7% a year, compared to 3.1% during the Conservative years and 3.4% since Nye Bevan became the first health secretary in 1948. The 6.2% a year real increase from 1999 to 2004 has been surpassed in only one previous five-year period, from 1971 to 1976. The IFS shares Mr Brown's confidence that the increases can be afforded. Even at the end of the period covered by the plans, spending will still be lower as a proportion of output than it was in the early 1990s. Higher allocations for Whitehall departments have already been paid for through the higher taxes imposed since 1997. But affordability is not everything. One of the motivations for three-year spending periods is to allow departments to plan over longer periods - but this is not happening. The IFS said yesterday that only 0.8% of departmental expenditure limits would be unchanged in the third year of the first spending plan, and in almost every case the limit had been raised rather than lowered. Two other questions remain: has Mr Brown left it all too late and is it possible to manage the public sector through a form of central planning? There is some evidence that even in areas where Mr Brown has already made more money available - capital spending, for example - departments have forgotten how to spend, or lack the expertise to turn ideas into reality. In some areas, as the IMF pointed out yesterday, even the whopping increases on offer will not make up for the deep cuts seen over the past 10 years. DETR spending will still only account for around 1.5% of GDP after the investment on public transport, compared to 2% in the early 1990s. This is the last chance for the government to get it right. If the public sees no improvement after these increases, Labour will have run out of excuses. Mr Brown's goal of improving public services by tying Whitehall departments to performance targets is laudable, but the IFS cast doubt on its practicality. The Treasury sets goals which can be quantified; but they are not necessarily the goals that matter. Useful links Spending review: full text Full text of chancellor's speech The issue explained",

      "body": "<p>The government is coming under increasing pressure to give more help to hi-tech industries in Britain after the loss of a \u00a3250m investment project that would have created 2,000 jobs. </p> <p>Veritas, the world's fourth largest software company, said yesterday that it had halved its plan to invest \u00a3500m in Britain. </p> <p>Its decision comes days after Nokia, Yahoo! and Sun Microsystems warned that hi-tech companies would leave Britain unless the government took a more positive attitude towards the sector. The industry believes that the government's actions are at odds with the prime minister's goal of making Britain the best country for e-commerce. </p> <p>Despite its reservations, Veritas will still be creating 2,000 jobs with a \u00a3250m project to build a new European headquarters at Reading and a research facility at Watford. </p> <p>Philip Bousfield, its vice-president for worldwide operations, said the group would have doubled its investment had it been more confident of the government's policy on hi-tech industries. </p> <p>Veritas's confidence in the government had been undermined by last year's Budget decision to introduce national insurance contributions on stock option gains. </p> <p>\"At a stroke, this has left hi- tech companies open to uncapped liabilities,\" he said. Veritas' liabilities in Britain had risen from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a38m. \"Luckily we are a big company, but for a small hi-tech company this would have been disastrous.\" </p> <p>He said the government was stifling the potential of the country's hi-tech sector by implementing \"inappropriate US-style measures\" on issues such as business taxation. </p> <p>He argued that copying the US would not work in Britain because the country lacked \"an established and booming hi-tech economy, greater venture capital funding and a business culture which is happier to take risks\". </p> <p>Mr Bousfield, who has already raised the issue with Treasury ministers, said Veritas was committed to investing a further \u00a3250m in Europe and that a decision would be made in about a year's time. </p> <p>But the further investment would only be made in Britain if there were signs that the government was providing more support for the technology sector. </p> <p>He said the government, while offering much-needed support for small hi-tech firms, failed to understand what was needed to create big companies in the sector. </p> <p>\"I am English and would like to see the way to build a company the size of Veritas in the UK,\" he said, \"Veritas is worth $40bn at the moment.\" </p> <p>He called on the government to set up a high-powered independent committee to identify what action needed to be taken to accelerate the growth of the technology sector in Britain. </p> <p>The Treasury said in response to Mr Bousfield that the country had a very good record in attracting inward investment. The government was already taking action to remove the kinds of weaknesses suggested by him. </p> <p>This included cuts in capital gains tax to encourage entrepreneurs, reward risk-taking and promote wider share ownership among employees. </p> <p>The government had also made an extra \u00a3100m available to stimulate the early venture capital market, and had commissioned an outside investigation into institutional investors' reluctance to invest in venture capital. </p> <p>Veritas, which is based in Mountain View in California's Silicon Valley, is a market leader in \"crash-proof\" data storage software.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is coming under increasing pressure to give more help to hi-tech industries in Britain after the loss of a \u00a3250m investment project that would have created 2,000 jobs. Veritas, the world's fourth largest software company, said yesterday that it had halved its plan to invest \u00a3500m in Britain. Its decision comes days after Nokia, Yahoo! and Sun Microsystems warned that hi-tech companies would leave Britain unless the government took a more positive attitude towards the sector. The industry believes that the government's actions are at odds with the prime minister's goal of making Britain the best country for e-commerce. Despite its reservations, Veritas will still be creating 2,000 jobs with a \u00a3250m project to build a new European headquarters at Reading and a research facility at Watford. Philip Bousfield, its vice-president for worldwide operations, said the group would have doubled its investment had it been more confident of the government's policy on hi-tech industries. Veritas's confidence in the government had been undermined by last year's Budget decision to introduce national insurance contributions on stock option gains. \"At a stroke, this has left hi- tech companies open to uncapped liabilities,\" he said. Veritas' liabilities in Britain had risen from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a38m. \"Luckily we are a big company, but for a small hi-tech company this would have been disastrous.\" He said the government was stifling the potential of the country's hi-tech sector by implementing \"inappropriate US-style measures\" on issues such as business taxation. He argued that copying the US would not work in Britain because the country lacked \"an established and booming hi-tech economy, greater venture capital funding and a business culture which is happier to take risks\". Mr Bousfield, who has already raised the issue with Treasury ministers, said Veritas was committed to investing a further \u00a3250m in Europe and that a decision would be made in about a year's time. But the further investment would only be made in Britain if there were signs that the government was providing more support for the technology sector. He said the government, while offering much-needed support for small hi-tech firms, failed to understand what was needed to create big companies in the sector. \"I am English and would like to see the way to build a company the size of Veritas in the UK,\" he said, \"Veritas is worth $40bn at the moment.\" He called on the government to set up a high-powered independent committee to identify what action needed to be taken to accelerate the growth of the technology sector in Britain. The Treasury said in response to Mr Bousfield that the country had a very good record in attracting inward investment. The government was already taking action to remove the kinds of weaknesses suggested by him. This included cuts in capital gains tax to encourage entrepreneurs, reward risk-taking and promote wider share ownership among employees. The government had also made an extra \u00a3100m available to stimulate the early venture capital market, and had commissioned an outside investigation into institutional investors' reluctance to invest in venture capital. Veritas, which is based in Mountain View in California's Silicon Valley, is a market leader in \"crash-proof\" data storage software.",

A letter from Mr Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union, to John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, demanded that Mr Edmonds should give assurances that he did not believe the allegations to be true. Today 134 MSF members - in a letter to the Guardian - call for an independent inquiry into the union's finances in the light of disclosures that came after the whistleblower Marcia Solomon won a case for unfair dismissal against the union. In a further letter in the Guardian today, Mr Lyons attacks the paper for \"fabricating\" stories about his expenses. He says the receipt on his union credit card for the 25p bun followed original expenses of \u00a312.75 when he was recruiting people to the union. Mr Lyons's letter to Mr Edmonds - leaked to the Guardian after he had posted it to the GMB and the TUC - revealed that John Monks, the TUC general secretary, has been trying to prevent the row from spilling over into an inter-union dispute. Ms Solomon was a GMB shop steward at the MSF union, and her case was taken up by the GMB. The case, which cost the MSF \u00a3140,000, revealed shortcomings in the union's accounts and called into question whether its accountants, HW Fisher, had properly investigated the alleged fraud and expenses of the general secretary and Nelson Mendes, head of finance. Altogether, the MSF has spent \u00a3750,000 paying off three former officers involved in the allegations. Mr Lyons said in the letter to Mr Edmonds: \"When we met informally at the TUC on 19th May I indicated the concerns felt by MSF and its NEC at the unsubstantiated allegations of fraud and theft being supported by the GMB.\" He listed why he believed he was cleared - even though Ms Solomon won her case - concluding: \"I would therefore ask you and your union to stop supporting completely unsubstantiated allegations of fraud and theft and to confirm this to me and John Monks. \"The TUC general secretary did ask us to avoid airing any industrial relations problems between us in the media, and I thought we both agreed to this, in the interests of our members and the wider movement.\" Last night both the TUC and the GMB seemed mystified by the Mr Lyons's outburst.

His report, based on hundreds of interviews, concludes that some members of Glover's unit held anti-gay attitudes. The company's senior sergeant, who was aware of incidents of anti-gay behaviour, is criticised because he failed to intervene. Nevertheless, the report concludes that officers did not permit a climate in which anti-gay harassment was tolerated, and says that the 101st Airborne - which has played a key combat role in conflicts from D-Day to the Gulf war - harbours no unusual degree of hatred towards homosexuals. \"There were a lot of times when the problem never surfaced up the chain of command,\" a Pentagon official told US newspapers this week. \"But when the leadership discovered the problem, action was taken.\" The report's conclusions are not due to be officially unveiled until tomorrow, but key details were leaked on CBS television news on Tuesday night and confirmed in unattributable briefings to US news organisations. \"I'm not saying no harassment occurred,\" an official told reporters, \"but it is an exaggeration to think that every gay on the base is being harassed.\" Relatives and supporters reacted angrily to the news. \"We're appalled at what we're hearing. We're very disappointed,\" said Winchell's mother, Patricia Kutteles. \"To me it seems as if the Pentagon brass and the Fort Campbell command are more concerned about protecting themselves than the safety of our soldiers,\" she added.",

Around 700 spectators watched a Greek tragedy at sunset, performed on a new stage built over the labyrinth where gladiators and wild animals were once caged. Shows will be held over the summer to celebrate an eight-year restoration scheme that has led to the opening of the Colosseum's arena, making it the jewel of Rome's archaeological renaissance.

John Reid, Elton John's erstwhile manager, recalled his first encounter with cocaine with all the misty-eyed nostalgia of an old lover. At its best it got very Valley Of The Dolls, and Davidson's unorthodox recipe for tequila sunrise (vodka and orange plus a heavy nosebleed) will be hard to forget. </p> <p>Even more atrocious was the behaviour of three demonic children in <strong> Little Angels </strong> (BBC1), a chilling insight into the hell of parenthood. Beautiful blonde Jade (three) had tantrums in the supermarket, attacked her mother and, when she'd been particularly rotten, gave a truly evil smile. Ellie, also three, was the bad seed in a family of five; her twin sister was as good as gold, while Ellie flung her toast on the floor. Nick (four) was hyperactive, zoomed around the house like a dynamo and flicked Vs at the cameras. Child behaviour specialists descended on the three families and tried to calm things down, with a certain amount of success, but one longed for the simpler remedies of Struwwelpeter, which should furnish these children's bedtime reading. </p> <p>Concealed cameras provided documentary evidence of the miscreants at their worst, but the parents' faces said it all. Drawn and haggard, they watched their little charges with barely contained despair, wondering what they'd done wrong. One could only begin to guess at their misery, although after 50 minutes spent listening to screaming infants it wasn't so very hard to imagine. </p> <p> <strong> The Lipstick Years </strong> (BBC2) was an inconsequential trot through the history of the air hostess, presented by Lowri Turner. Feminist trailblazer or flying mattress? The answers were not here, but there were some entertaining reminiscences from former airline employees about life in the aisles. Hostesses from the 40s and 50s had a better class of passenger, including Marlene Dietrich (\"a boring lot\") and Cary Grant, who helped dry the dishes. Girls in the 60s got mile-high marriage offers and wore paper dresses, which seemed to bring out the arsonist in most men.

They are the people he grew up among in the south London suburbs of the 1950s and further out in Woking, Surrey, who live \"lives of struggle and hard work\" - and have not been given the life chances or the public services they deserved in postwar Britain. That is Gould's vision, set out in his much-praised, much-criticised book The Unfinished Revolution, published as a defence of the modernisers - led by Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson, Alastair Campbell (and Gould) - a year after that intoxicating night when they won a 179-seat landslide in 1997. In the same raw language he deployed in his latest over-candid and leaked memo to Blair's inner circle, Gould's book also reveals his personal credo, what makes him the driven, shambolic talent which friends and foes both recognise.

He's only really played cameo roles since, but his profile - both acting and facial - is ideal for this role. \"He's good looking,\" says Ed, \"but has one of those faces that makes you ask 'Where have I seen him before?' - and that must appeal to the producers as they need to find an actor who is known, but not famous.\" Bruce Campbell recently been in the King of Thieves character, Autolycus, in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess. \"They say it's not what you know, it's who you know. Bruce Campbell counts influential director Sam Raimi as a friend. He appeared as the bookstore manager in Ellen, and the absolute cruncher is that he's appeared in an episode of The X-Files. He has the contacts.\" Big outsider must be Lou Diamond Philips. \"Some critics have questioned his basic acting skills, but he's apparently in the running. His most recent film, Supernova, got a slating, but he would certainly become a shooting star if he were to become Mulder.\"",

      "body": "<p>Relatives in India told yesterday how a British doctor and his two children had a miraculous escape in Monday's airliner crash in Patna.</p> <p>Pramod Rajgarhia, 45, an orthopedic surgeon at Glasgow Victoria infirmary, his daughter Prachi, 19, and son Ketan, 13, were thrown clear when their Boeing 737 hit a housing estate a mile away from Patna airport in the northern state of Bihar. The three were last night seriously ill in a Delhi hospital, but expected to recover.</p> <p>Dr Rajgarhia's wife, Kirin, 44, was not injured in the crash but died apparently of a heart attack. She was among 44 of the 51 passengers and crew on board who died, along with five people on the ground who died when the plane hit a housing estate.</p> <p>The three surviving members of the family were airlifted to hospital in Delhi, where the daughter, a medical student at Edinburgh University, was yesterday recovering but unaware that her mother was dead.</p> <p>\"She keeps on saying 'I don't know why my mum's not here',\" her aunt, Pooja Gupta said.</p> <p>Surgeons at the Delhi hospital operated on her father yesterday, and were due to operate on the son today.</p> <p>Dr Rajgarhia was initially conscious after the crash, and he was able to phone relatives from hospital in Patna. \"He was telling the doctors what to do with him, because he is an orthopedic surgeon himself,\" Mrs Gupta said.</p> <p>Dr Rajgarhia moved to Newton Mearns in Glasgow from India eight years ago, and has been a senior house officer in the orthopedic department at Victoria infirmary since 1994, where he is known as Dr Kumar.</p> <p>The family had been on the final leg of a month's holiday in India. They only survived because they were sitting at the back of the Alliance Air aircraft that was en route from Calcutta to Delhi, via Patna and Lucknow. A mass of smouldering, twisted metal was all that remained of the jet yesterday.</p> <p>Telling her relatives of the final moments before the crash, Ms Rajgarhia said she had started praying when she realised something had gone wrong.</p> <p>\"She was saying her gods,\" Mrs Gupta said. \"She said that the flight nosedived and started rattling, and after that she lost consciousness. She got thrown out of the plane with her seat intact.</p> <p>\"A local resident helped her survive. Because she is very fair he thought she was a foreigner. There was an aircrew member burning in the wreckage next to her. He didn't have time to get them both out. He chose Prachi - she was in a better state, she was young, and it was easier for him to carry her.\"</p> <p>Mrs Gupta said that it had been destiny that the three survived: \"There were also air hostesses at the back of the plane, but they were not saved.\"</p> <p>Mrs Rajgarhia had not been injured but died nevertheless, said her nephew, Vrithesh Agarwal: \"The most amazing thing is she suffered no external injuries, no burns, no scars. There was not a scratch on her.\"</p> <p>Mrs Gupta added: \"My sister was very chirpy, very enthusiastic about life. My father is shattered.\"</p> <p>Mrs Rajgarhia was cremated at a family ceremony in Patna on Tuesday, before the surviving members of the family were transferred to Delhi by air ambulance. All three were last night in a stable condition in intensive care. Dr Rajgarhia was being treated for spinal injuries and fractures to his ribs after collapsing yesterday.</p> <p>His daughter also has spinal injuries and may have surgery today. The son, the most seriously injured of the three, is suffering from head injuries, but is expected to recover, doctors said. The family was likely to remain in hospital for several weeks.</p> <p>Staff at Parkhouse Manor nursing home in Barrhead, Renfrewshire, where Mrs Rajgarhia worked part time as a secretary, yesterday said they were devastated by her death. One, Sharda Poddar, said: \"I have lost my best friend, but I am praying that her family will survive.\"</p> <p>A neighbour in Glasgow said the community was shocked by what had happened. \"It is amazing that the three of them made it out alive. Kirin was a very energetic, very pleasant and well organised woman,\" said Carol Meldrum, who had been looking after the family's home while they were away in India.</p> <p>Ketan was just about to enter his third year at Eastwood high school on the outskirts of Glasgow, where his sister had also been a pupil. \"Both are very bright, and popular with staff and pupils,\" said the headteacher, Bob Gibson. \"We will offer all the support the school can at this difficult time.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Edinburgh University, where Prachi has finished her first year as a medical student, said the university was relieved she had survived but expressed condolences for her mother's loss.</p> <p>The Rajgarhias only boarded the 6.50am flight CD-7412 after deciding to cut short their stay in Calcutta, where Mrs Rajgarhia's parents live.</p> <p>They had planned to spend a couple of days in Patna, visiting Dr Rajgarhia's father and mother, before returning to Delhi for a family reunion. They had been due to fly back to the UK on July 30. \"They tried to come to India once a year. They were last here in December,\" Mrs Gupta said.</p> <p>Investigators were yesterday beginning an official inquiry into why the 20-year-old Boeing 737 had crashed - it was reported to have spent the three days before the doomed flight grounded because of technical problems. As the first step in a possible criminal case, the two pilots who died in the crash were charged with violating criminal and aviation law, although a trial against the dead is unlikely.</p> <p>A fortnight ago, British diplomats were told by the Foreign Office not to use Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Indian Airlines, after Rolls Royce withdrew a service contract for its engines on safety grounds.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Relatives in India told yesterday how a British doctor and his two children had a miraculous escape in Monday's airliner crash in Patna. Pramod Rajgarhia, 45, an orthopedic surgeon at Glasgow Victoria infirmary, his daughter Prachi, 19, and son Ketan, 13, were thrown clear when their Boeing 737 hit a housing estate a mile away from Patna airport in the northern state of Bihar. The three were last night seriously ill in a Delhi hospital, but expected to recover. Dr Rajgarhia's wife, Kirin, 44, was not injured in the crash but died apparently of a heart attack. She was among 44 of the 51 passengers and crew on board who died, along with five people on the ground who died when the plane hit a housing estate. The three surviving members of the family were airlifted to hospital in Delhi, where the daughter, a medical student at Edinburgh University, was yesterday recovering but unaware that her mother was dead. \"She keeps on saying 'I don't know why my mum's not here',\" her aunt, Pooja Gupta said. Surgeons at the Delhi hospital operated on her father yesterday, and were due to operate on the son today. Dr Rajgarhia was initially conscious after the crash, and he was able to phone relatives from hospital in Patna. \"He was telling the doctors what to do with him, because he is an orthopedic surgeon himself,\" Mrs Gupta said. Dr Rajgarhia moved to Newton Mearns in Glasgow from India eight years ago, and has been a senior house officer in the orthopedic department at Victoria infirmary since 1994, where he is known as Dr Kumar. The family had been on the final leg of a month's holiday in India. They only survived because they were sitting at the back of the Alliance Air aircraft that was en route from Calcutta to Delhi, via Patna and Lucknow. A mass of smouldering, twisted metal was all that remained of the jet yesterday. Telling her relatives of the final moments before the crash, Ms Rajgarhia said she had started praying when she realised something had gone wrong. \"She was saying her gods,\" Mrs Gupta said. \"She said that the flight nosedived and started rattling, and after that she lost consciousness. She got thrown out of the plane with her seat intact. \"A local resident helped her survive. Because she is very fair he thought she was a foreigner. There was an aircrew member burning in the wreckage next to her. He didn't have time to get them both out. He chose Prachi - she was in a better state, she was young, and it was easier for him to carry her.\" Mrs Gupta said that it had been destiny that the three survived: \"There were also air hostesses at the back of the plane, but they were not saved.\" Mrs Rajgarhia had not been injured but died nevertheless, said her nephew, Vrithesh Agarwal: \"The most amazing thing is she suffered no external injuries, no burns, no scars. There was not a scratch on her.\" Mrs Gupta added: \"My sister was very chirpy, very enthusiastic about life. My father is shattered.\" Mrs Rajgarhia was cremated at a family ceremony in Patna on Tuesday, before the surviving members of the family were transferred to Delhi by air ambulance. All three were last night in a stable condition in intensive care. Dr Rajgarhia was being treated for spinal injuries and fractures to his ribs after collapsing yesterday. His daughter also has spinal injuries and may have surgery today. The son, the most seriously injured of the three, is suffering from head injuries, but is expected to recover, doctors said. The family was likely to remain in hospital for several weeks. Staff at Parkhouse Manor nursing home in Barrhead, Renfrewshire, where Mrs Rajgarhia worked part time as a secretary, yesterday said they were devastated by her death. One, Sharda Poddar, said: \"I have lost my best friend, but I am praying that her family will survive.\" A neighbour in Glasgow said the community was shocked by what had happened. \"It is amazing that the three of them made it out alive. Kirin was a very energetic, very pleasant and well organised woman,\" said Carol Meldrum, who had been looking after the family's home while they were away in India. Ketan was just about to enter his third year at Eastwood high school on the outskirts of Glasgow, where his sister had also been a pupil. \"Both are very bright, and popular with staff and pupils,\" said the headteacher, Bob Gibson. \"We will offer all the support the school can at this difficult time.\" A spokesman for Edinburgh University, where Prachi has finished her first year as a medical student, said the university was relieved she had survived but expressed condolences for her mother's loss. The Rajgarhias only boarded the 6.50am flight CD-7412 after deciding to cut short their stay in Calcutta, where Mrs Rajgarhia's parents live. They had planned to spend a couple of days in Patna, visiting Dr Rajgarhia's father and mother, before returning to Delhi for a family reunion. They had been due to fly back to the UK on July 30. \"They tried to come to India once a year. They were last here in December,\" Mrs Gupta said. Investigators were yesterday beginning an official inquiry into why the 20-year-old Boeing 737 had crashed - it was reported to have spent the three days before the doomed flight grounded because of technical problems. As the first step in a possible criminal case, the two pilots who died in the crash were charged with violating criminal and aviation law, although a trial against the dead is unlikely. A fortnight ago, British diplomats were told by the Foreign Office not to use Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Indian Airlines, after Rolls Royce withdrew a service contract for its engines on safety grounds.",

      "bodyText": "Your front-page headline calls Gordon Brown's spending review plans a \"spree\" (Brown's \u00a343bn spree, July 19). My dictionary defines spree as: \"A session of considerable over-indulgence, esp in drinking, squandering money, etc.\" Your leader announces, on the same day, that: \"This package is necessary and affordable.\" Not a spree then. John Butt Exeter, Devon Johngbutt@btinternet.com \u0095 The extra money promised by the chancellor for science and universities for the period 2002 to 2005 is welcome. Older, well established members of the scientific community as well as PhD students, whose stipends will rise, will be grateful. But there is nothing in the spending plans (which do almost nothing for the immediate problems) to encourage first-class teachers and researchers who are just beginning their academic careers, after probably six years of financial struggle, to stay in the UK. Why should they when they can work in the US for twice the salary, and where the research infrastructure is already developed to a level the Treasury aspire to after 10 years? Without extra money to pay university teachers and researchers at the levels recommended by the independent Bett report, which echoed the earlier official Dearing report, the new money will not be used in the most effective way because the best people will be gone. Prof Michael Rennie University of Dundee m.j.rennie@dundee.ac.uk \u0095 The decision by David Blunkett to award extra money to schools which have done well in assessment procedures and to deny such extra resources to failing schools is clear proof of how far New Labour has moved from its old Labour origins. Success in education is largely down to resources: good teachers, parental support, adequate books, computer facilities and modern premises. By and large these occur where incomes are above the national average. To those that have shall be given and those that don't have will have to make do. Is this the best New Labour can offer failing schools? John Turley Wrexham turleyjt@netscapeonline.co.uk \u0095 Yet again the Guardian front page has shown itself to be out of touch, more preoccupied with middle-aged, male angst than the brutal murder of an eight-year-old girl. On 18 July, no photo of the innocent Sarah Payne, nor on 19 July, where we have a larger-than-life image of Gordon Brown. Is this really necessary? Prof June Purvis Portsmouth",

We have all been in this together right from the start,\" said Mrs Payne. Her husband added: \"It's not over until the man or the persons are in court.\"</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Alan Ladley, who has been leading the inquiry, said the response to the appeals for help so far had been \"tremendous\". There have been more than 28,000 calls since the beginning of the inquiry. About 80 officers are now on the inquiry team with the same number continuing to search for clues and look for the clothing Sarah was wearing when she disappeared.</p> <p>Det Sup Ladley revealed that the postmortem had not uncovered any violent external injuries. It was possible she had been strangled or suffocated by other means. The police have said they cannot be certain the dead child, who was discovered naked, had not been first sexually assaulted. He said: \"Why else would a little girl be taken? That has to be a possibility.\"</p> <p>Mr Ladley also referred to an incident on Tuesday night when 20 or 30 youths gathered outside a house in Crawley which they thought held a man who had been questioned then released by police earlier in the inquiry. The youths hurled abuse and threw stones at the building.</p> <p>Mr Ladley insisted that \"vigilante attacks\" would not be tolerated by the police.</p>",

Mrs Payne said: \"On Saturday night and Sunday morning if you saw something - a car, a van, whatever made you suspicious, made you look twice, then think about it and ring us up.\" The family also spoke of their feelings towards the killer. Mrs Payne said: \"They must never ever be allowed to put another family through this. They've watched us for the last two weeks. It has torn our children apart. They could have done something about it by picking up the phone. \"We don't believe that anyone should be allowed to do that to anyone. We believe in justice and death is too good for this person. Help us find him, her, them, whoever.\" Addressing the killer directly, she continued: \"To watch us go through this, I feel no pity for you at all.\" Her husband added: \"They have watched us suffer. They have watched our family go through something [we] should not go through. The whole thing is just senseless. To take a little girl like that, for what reason would you do this to someone? Whoever it is has got to be caught.\" Speaking of the decision not to see Sarah's body, Mrs Payne said: \"We can't even see our daughter because it's too hard. It's not Sarah. We haven't been able to say goodbye - it's so unfair.\" The family has been staying away from their home and are still torn about returning. Mrs Payne said: \"We will be going home, so will Sarah.\" The family made another appeal for further witnesses to contact the police. \"If you haven't come forward yet please come forward. We have all been in this together right from the start,\" said Mrs Payne. Her husband added: \"It's not over until the man or the persons are in court.\" Detective Superintendent Alan Ladley, who has been leading the inquiry, said the response to the appeals for help so far had been \"tremendous\". There have been more than 28,000 calls since the beginning of the inquiry. About 80 officers are now on the inquiry team with the same number continuing to search for clues and look for the clothing Sarah was wearing when she disappeared. Det Sup Ladley revealed that the postmortem had not uncovered any violent external injuries. It was possible she had been strangled or suffocated by other means. The police have said they cannot be certain the dead child, who was discovered naked, had not been first sexually assaulted. He said: \"Why else would a little girl be taken? That has to be a possibility.\" Mr Ladley also referred to an incident on Tuesday night when 20 or 30 youths gathered outside a house in Crawley which they thought held a man who had been questioned then released by police earlier in the inquiry. The youths hurled abuse and threw stones at the building. Mr Ladley insisted that \"vigilante attacks\" would not be tolerated by the police.",

      "bodyText": "Mobile phone manufacturers have responded to a public safety inquiry by announcing they are to issue advice regarding the radiation levels consumers can expect to absorb from their handsets. The Stewart inquiry in the UK published the findings of its year-long investigation in May, concluding there was no evidence of danger from mobile phone radiation but that a \"precautionary approach\" was recommended. Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola yesterday confirmed they are working together on warnings to be printed on packaging, about the radiation levels mobile telephones emit. It is considered to be a move which may protect manufacturers from future litigation, even though there is no link yet proved between mobile phone usage and cancer or other risks to human health. David Stoneham, Nokia UK's senior communications manager, said he expected labels detailing the specific absorption rate (SAR), a measure of radiation from mobile phone usage, would appear by the end of the year. He said a final wording had been delayed following disagreements between the phone manufacturers, operators and governments on a standard measure of SAR. The next hurdle was consensus on how SAR could be explained simply to consumers. \"There has been dialogue since May on that,\" Mr Stoneham said. \"We don't see why information on SAR values couldn't be given to consumers this year.\" Phone radiation levels are at present disclosed to various bodies including the US federal communications commission in order to comply with national safety requirements. In the US, the American trade body, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, has recommended that all mobile phone manufacturers should disclose their radiation levels by August 1. Jan Ahrenbring, vice-president of marketing and communication at Ericsson Mobile, said from that date it would provide information on its handset in the US, and globally \"shortly afterwards\". While the Stewart report concluded there was no scientific evidence suggesting that mobile handsets or base stations gave out harmful levels of radiation, it still recommended introducing tough controls.

      "body": "<p><strong> EU queries bids for MoD ferries</strong><br> The European Commission is querying whether bidding for six roll-on-roll-off ferries by Britain's Ministry of Defence is in line with EU public procurement directives, a commission source said. </p> <p>Industry sources said there are four bidders - AP Moeller's British unit Maersk Co; the BAe Systems-led Sealion consortium; a consortium including Britain's Andrew Weir Shipping; and Belgium's Cobelfret. </p> <p>The commission source said it is looking at an MoD request for the four to make restructured bids and wants to make sure this change is to ensure value for money and not to support a British shipyard. </p> <p><strong> Yorkshire plan doused by EA</strong></p> <p>The Environment Agency yesterday doused plans by Kelda to turn Yorkshire Water into a mutual. The EA said Kelda's proposals to demerge Yorkshire Water's assets were primarily concerned with creating shareholder value. \"There is less emphasis on the interests of customers and nothing in the proposals on environmental issues.\" Its chairman, Sir John Harman, said: \"The public needs to be confident that if Kelda - and potentially other water companies - go down the mutualisation route, this will not lead to any deterioration in environmental standards.\" </p> <p><strong>Share option rules to change</strong><br> Accounting rules over share option schemes are to be tightened up under new proposals by the Accounting Standards Board that would force companies to put a value on the share options they issue to hire employees. </p> <p>The proposed move, which is likely to put the accounting board at loggerheads with start-up internet companies and other entrepreneurial business, would mean that options issued by a company would have to be recognised on its profit and loss account. Under present rules no such requirement is necessary, which means that the cost of hiring employees is not made clear.</p> <p><strong> Investment banker leaves</strong><br> Jim Boshart, one of the City's best known investment bankers, is to leave the newly created Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. In a memo to staff, also signed by co-chief executive Will Samuel, he told employees that the second half would be tougher than the first when mergers and acquisitions business boomed. </p> <p>Under management changes yesterday, the bank, which is part of Citigroup of US, also gave greater emphasis to London by naming London-based Michael Klein as co-head of global investment banking. </p> <p><strong> Ford posts $577m loss</strong><br> Ford, the world's second largest car maker, yesterday reported a second-quarter net loss of $577m (\u00a3356m) after $3.3bn of one-off charges related to restructuring of its European operations and the demerger of its Visteon components business. </p> <p>It was the first time Ford has dipped into the red since 1992.

      "bodyText": "EU queries bids for MoD ferries The European Commission is querying whether bidding for six roll-on-roll-off ferries by Britain's Ministry of Defence is in line with EU public procurement directives, a commission source said. Industry sources said there are four bidders - AP Moeller's British unit Maersk Co; the BAe Systems-led Sealion consortium; a consortium including Britain's Andrew Weir Shipping; and Belgium's Cobelfret. The commission source said it is looking at an MoD request for the four to make restructured bids and wants to make sure this change is to ensure value for money and not to support a British shipyard. Yorkshire plan doused by EA The Environment Agency yesterday doused plans by Kelda to turn Yorkshire Water into a mutual. The EA said Kelda's proposals to demerge Yorkshire Water's assets were primarily concerned with creating shareholder value. \"There is less emphasis on the interests of customers and nothing in the proposals on environmental issues.\" Its chairman, Sir John Harman, said: \"The public needs to be confident that if Kelda - and potentially other water companies - go down the mutualisation route, this will not lead to any deterioration in environmental standards.\" Share option rules to change Accounting rules over share option schemes are to be tightened up under new proposals by the Accounting Standards Board that would force companies to put a value on the share options they issue to hire employees. The proposed move, which is likely to put the accounting board at loggerheads with start-up internet companies and other entrepreneurial business, would mean that options issued by a company would have to be recognised on its profit and loss account. Under present rules no such requirement is necessary, which means that the cost of hiring employees is not made clear. Investment banker leaves Jim Boshart, one of the City's best known investment bankers, is to leave the newly created Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. In a memo to staff, also signed by co-chief executive Will Samuel, he told employees that the second half would be tougher than the first when mergers and acquisitions business boomed. Under management changes yesterday, the bank, which is part of Citigroup of US, also gave greater emphasis to London by naming London-based Michael Klein as co-head of global investment banking. Ford posts $577m loss Ford, the world's second largest car maker, yesterday reported a second-quarter net loss of $577m (\u00a3356m) after $3.3bn of one-off charges related to restructuring of its European operations and the demerger of its Visteon components business. It was the first time Ford has dipped into the red since 1992. At the operating level, profits for the quarter rose 10% to a record $2.7bn, with worldwide vehicle sales rising to a record 1,928,000 units.",

Alterian, which has raised around \u00a337.5m via the placement of shares at 200p, has developed a database platform and software tools that help companies analyse customer information. Alterian claims the speed and volume capabilities of its technology means it can be used in a wide variety of fields - from healthcare to financial markets. And for once it does not appear to be all hype. Alterian's products have won recognition from Microsoft and it made a gross profit of \u00a3749,000 on sales \u00a31m in the last financial year.

John Maynard Keynes, who led the British delegation, foresaw that unless international trade was radically overhauled, debt would become self-perpetuating. He proposed an \"International Clearing Union\" and a new currency, the bancor, in which international transactions would be conducted.

Its delegation proposed that nations could borrow from an international bank which would penalise debtors, but not creditors. It insisted that gold, valued in dollars, be used to set exchange rates, ensuring that the dollar became the international banking standard. Having threatened to withhold its forthcoming war loan to Britain, the US won. It established, through the World Bank and the IMF, a global trading system which secured both a lasting US economic hegemony and the irredeemable indebtedness of poorer nations.</p> <p>The problem has been compounded by the growth in \"fractional reserve banking\": the process by which banks create money out of nothing by lending far more than they possess. As governments have all but ceased to issue real notes and coins, this magic money now accounts for some 95% of total money supply in most developed nations. Indebtedness, in other words, has become the necessary concomitant of money creation. This means that the total debt the people of a nation owe can never be repaid. This is why, despite Gordon Brown's brave efforts on Tuesday, our massive national debt repayments will only dent the cumulative total. This is why our great \"property-owning democracy\" has become mortgaged to the hilt.</p> <p>It also explains why Third world debt has become unpayable. Forced to take loans from commercial banks, the debtor nations create the money which enables first world countries to sell them their surplus goods and services. The debt, Rowbotham argues, is the result not of corruption, incompetence or economic failure on the part of developing nations.

I got the idea for the book during the mid-to-late 60s but wasn't compelled to write it until the early 70s. By \"wasn't compelled\", I mean nobody offered me any money. After the fact, I learned the movie had a troubled shoot, but I witnessed no problems during the four weeks I was on set. I guess they kept me shielded from any unpleasantness. Now I have no interest in Hollywood, though my time there was quite enjoyable. </p> <p>I don't think my book has anything to do with sharks' bad reputation: they've had bad press since presses were invented. Sharks are no longer the villain of the sea - that \"honour\" falls to man. Due to the demand for shark's fin soup some species have declined by as much as 80 per cent. The method by which fins are obtained is barbaric to the extreme: the sharks are pulled up on deck and the fins cut off. The poor creature is then dumped back into the sea, very often still alive. They can take at least a day to die in this condition. This method is as pointless as it is grotesque, since the fin has no actual taste and is just used to provide a gelatinous mass to the soup. I'm currently touring the world to draw attention to this. After I leave Britain I'm heading for Australia and then to Japan, the main culprit in this situation. </p> <p>Encouragingly, the young seem very concerned about this. </p> <p>We're still learning plenty about sharks - for instance, that fatalities attributed to them are very few. When a shark bites on something it makes a split-second calorific judgement on its food value. We're not worth the effort to eat. To them we don't taste too good. </p> <p> Interview by Phelim O'Neill </p> <p>Jaws: 25th Anniversary Edition is available on DVD from July 24 through Columbia Tristar at \u00a319.99.

      "bodyText": "Jaws, the movie, is now celebrating its 25th anniversary, but for me the story goes back a little further. I got the idea for the book during the mid-to-late 60s but wasn't compelled to write it until the early 70s. By \"wasn't compelled\", I mean nobody offered me any money. After the fact, I learned the movie had a troubled shoot, but I witnessed no problems during the four weeks I was on set. I guess they kept me shielded from any unpleasantness. Now I have no interest in Hollywood, though my time there was quite enjoyable. I don't think my book has anything to do with sharks' bad reputation: they've had bad press since presses were invented. Sharks are no longer the villain of the sea - that \"honour\" falls to man. Due to the demand for shark's fin soup some species have declined by as much as 80 per cent. The method by which fins are obtained is barbaric to the extreme: the sharks are pulled up on deck and the fins cut off. The poor creature is then dumped back into the sea, very often still alive. They can take at least a day to die in this condition. This method is as pointless as it is grotesque, since the fin has no actual taste and is just used to provide a gelatinous mass to the soup. I'm currently touring the world to draw attention to this. After I leave Britain I'm heading for Australia and then to Japan, the main culprit in this situation. Encouragingly, the young seem very concerned about this. We're still learning plenty about sharks - for instance, that fatalities attributed to them are very few. When a shark bites on something it makes a split-second calorific judgement on its food value. We're not worth the effort to eat. To them we don't taste too good. Interview by Phelim O'Neill Jaws: 25th Anniversary Edition is available on DVD from July 24 through Columbia Tristar at \u00a319.99.

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 1957, the Tennessee singer Johnny Duncan, who has died of cancer in Australia aged 67, achieved a one-off hit, Last Train To San Fernando.</p> <p>It epitomised the spirit of the British skiffle boom, remained in the top 20 for weeks and featured an irritating, compulsive catchline that reverberated down the rest of the century.</p> <p>Duncan had not wanted to record the song - he was a hillbilly country singer with one eye on rock 'n' roll - and he was to pay a price for his association with skiffle. But he had a good voice, a talent for the guitar and mandolin, and, in an era when inept imitation of transatlantic rock 'n' roll plagued British pop, he was, at least, a real American.</p> <p>It was a time when Musicians Union restrictions limiting the entry of American stars increased the exoticism of those few transatlantic imports. And Duncan was the first in a line of US pop singers - Geno Washington, the Walker Brothers, PJ Proby et al - whose careers blossomed in Britain.</p> <p>Duncan was a miner's son, born in Oliver Springs, Tennessee. He sang with his local church choir and later with a gospel quartet before heading for Texas in his mid-teens. There he learned guitar and performed with a hillbilly trio. Then came the draft. He arrived as a serviceman in England in 1952. A year later he married a Cambridgeshire girl, Betty. After a brief return to the US, her illness and homesickness brought them back, and he briefly worked on her father's market clothes stall.</p> <p>It was while performing at the American Club in Bushey Park that Duncan attracted the attention of Dickie Bishop, banjoist with the then hugely successful Chris Barber jazz band. The band had been the launchpad for the \"king of skiffle\", Lonnie Donegan, who had quit Barber following the phenomenal success of Rock Island Line. Bishop recalls inviting Duncan to the White Hart in Southall to meet Barber - and he was taken on for \u00a310 a week. The American stayed with the band - or with the Chris Barber Skiffle Group, within it - for a year, performing live, recording and broadcasting.</p> <p>By early 1957, alongside the impact of American rock 'n' roll, skiffle, that \"peculiar mixture of country, gospel, folk and blues\" as Duncan's sometime recording manager Keith Glass labelled it, had emerged as a British phenomenon, and indeed the seedbed of domestic rock 'n' roll, with Donegan and others enjoying a string of hits.</p> <p>Thus did Duncan leave Barber and, guided by producer Dennis Preston, recruited the Blue Grass Boys, Lennie Hastings, Denny Wright, Jack Fallon and Danny Levan. Their first single, Hank Williams's Kaw Liga in April 1957, flopped. Then, two months later, came Last Train To San Fernando. The Duke Of Iron had recorded the song as a calypso, and Preston's Caribbean wife had drawn the song to her husband's attention. \"I'd have chucked it in the trash can,\" Duncan said subsequently, an observation which may have led later to suggestions that he was a redneck racist.</p> <p>But Preston would not have recorded him if he had been; Fallon refutes the charge, and so do those - like me - who played on the same circuit as he did. Duncan just didn't like the song. It was fortunate that Wright did. With Duncan's bassist and manager Jack Fallon, Wright worked up an arrangement - and provided the sparkling guitar - that, together with Duncan's singing, made it a best seller.</p> <p>It was Paul Anka's multi-million selling Diana that blocked it from number one. Duncan the Tennessee hillbilly singer briefly became a British star. He sounded authentic. When he sang of \"blowing down that old dusty road\", listeners believed he had been there, rather than - as with his English contemporaries - confined hard travelling to the number nine bus route.</p> <p>He headlined over visiting Americans singers like Marvin Rainwater, starred on BBC television's first teen slot, The 6.5 Special, had his own BBC radio series, Tennessee Songbag, and toured variety halls with the likes of Wee Willie Harris and the new sensation, Cliff Richard. No other Duncan record achieved Last Train's success, but a few other tracks, like Footsteps In The Snow, crept into the charts.</p> <p>In the 1960s he returned to the US before settling in Sunderland, where he recorded two albums in the early 1970s. He toured Australia in 1972, and subsequently emigrated to New South Wales. Later he met his new partner, Heather Walls, and slipped back contentedly into country life.

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 1957, the Tennessee singer Johnny Duncan, who has died of cancer in Australia aged 67, achieved a one-off hit, Last Train To San Fernando. It epitomised the spirit of the British skiffle boom, remained in the top 20 for weeks and featured an irritating, compulsive catchline that reverberated down the rest of the century. Duncan had not wanted to record the song - he was a hillbilly country singer with one eye on rock 'n' roll - and he was to pay a price for his association with skiffle. But he had a good voice, a talent for the guitar and mandolin, and, in an era when inept imitation of transatlantic rock 'n' roll plagued British pop, he was, at least, a real American. It was a time when Musicians Union restrictions limiting the entry of American stars increased the exoticism of those few transatlantic imports. And Duncan was the first in a line of US pop singers - Geno Washington, the Walker Brothers, PJ Proby et al - whose careers blossomed in Britain. Duncan was a miner's son, born in Oliver Springs, Tennessee. He sang with his local church choir and later with a gospel quartet before heading for Texas in his mid-teens. There he learned guitar and performed with a hillbilly trio. Then came the draft. He arrived as a serviceman in England in 1952. A year later he married a Cambridgeshire girl, Betty. After a brief return to the US, her illness and homesickness brought them back, and he briefly worked on her father's market clothes stall. It was while performing at the American Club in Bushey Park that Duncan attracted the attention of Dickie Bishop, banjoist with the then hugely successful Chris Barber jazz band. The band had been the launchpad for the \"king of skiffle\", Lonnie Donegan, who had quit Barber following the phenomenal success of Rock Island Line. Bishop recalls inviting Duncan to the White Hart in Southall to meet Barber - and he was taken on for \u00a310 a week. The American stayed with the band - or with the Chris Barber Skiffle Group, within it - for a year, performing live, recording and broadcasting. By early 1957, alongside the impact of American rock 'n' roll, skiffle, that \"peculiar mixture of country, gospel, folk and blues\" as Duncan's sometime recording manager Keith Glass labelled it, had emerged as a British phenomenon, and indeed the seedbed of domestic rock 'n' roll, with Donegan and others enjoying a string of hits. Thus did Duncan leave Barber and, guided by producer Dennis Preston, recruited the Blue Grass Boys, Lennie Hastings, Denny Wright, Jack Fallon and Danny Levan. Their first single, Hank Williams's Kaw Liga in April 1957, flopped. Then, two months later, came Last Train To San Fernando. The Duke Of Iron had recorded the song as a calypso, and Preston's Caribbean wife had drawn the song to her husband's attention. \"I'd have chucked it in the trash can,\" Duncan said subsequently, an observation which may have led later to suggestions that he was a redneck racist. But Preston would not have recorded him if he had been; Fallon refutes the charge, and so do those - like me - who played on the same circuit as he did. Duncan just didn't like the song. It was fortunate that Wright did. With Duncan's bassist and manager Jack Fallon, Wright worked up an arrangement - and provided the sparkling guitar - that, together with Duncan's singing, made it a best seller. It was Paul Anka's multi-million selling Diana that blocked it from number one. Duncan the Tennessee hillbilly singer briefly became a British star. He sounded authentic. When he sang of \"blowing down that old dusty road\", listeners believed he had been there, rather than - as with his English contemporaries - confined hard travelling to the number nine bus route. He headlined over visiting Americans singers like Marvin Rainwater, starred on BBC television's first teen slot, The 6.5 Special, had his own BBC radio series, Tennessee Songbag, and toured variety halls with the likes of Wee Willie Harris and the new sensation, Cliff Richard. No other Duncan record achieved Last Train's success, but a few other tracks, like Footsteps In The Snow, crept into the charts. In the 1960s he returned to the US before settling in Sunderland, where he recorded two albums in the early 1970s. He toured Australia in 1972, and subsequently emigrated to New South Wales. Later he met his new partner, Heather Walls, and slipped back contentedly into country life. In the last decade, a reassessment of skiffle renewed interest in his work. Some of his recordings were re-released, and Duncan, enthusiasm rekindled, recorded a few more sides. He is survived by Heather, four daughters and a son. \u0095 John Franklin Duncan, musician, born September 7 1932; died July 15 2000",

To be precise, it looks like Turner. At the heart of NGC253, a ball of yellow fire reddens the clouds like a Turner sun. Colossal wisps of gas part to reveal the blue light of newly born stars. The entire structure arcs and wheels with a vast, turbulent grandeur. </p> <p>When John Ruskin, the champion of Turner, started to go mad he saw a new kind of cloud, \"the storm cloud of the 19th century\", in the sky above his home in the Lake District. For Ruskin, the object of art was to reveal the divine hand in nature. That was what he meant by beauty. What would he have said now, looking at the pictures taken by Hubble? </p> <p>Hubble was put into orbit by Nasa's Discovery space shuttle in 1990. This unmanned, ground-controlled telescope orbiting outside Earth's atmosphere is like an eye with a cataract removed: it sees into deep space with a hard, bright precision that is almost uncomfortable. These pictures have totally transformed public perceptions of astronomy (and have done wonders for Nasa's image). Since the telescope - which had been sent into space with an inaccurately ground lens - was repaired by shuttle astronauts in 1993 it has relayed astonishing pictures to us. </p> <p>There has never been a more gratuitous addition to our store of beauty. Ultimately, when we call a work of art beautiful we are comparing it to nature. The underlying structures of nature were imitated by artists from ancient Greece until the middle of the 20th century because nature was perceived as beautiful. If we don't talk much about \"beauty\" in contemporary art, that is because art is no longer concerned with the representation of nature. </p> <p>The photographs taken by the Hubble space telescope are the most flamboyantly beautiful artworks of our time. They are aesthetically devastating, and that visual power comes from the revelation of natural phenomena we have never seen before. </p> <p>\"On the one hand there is this emotional response,\" says Mario Livio, head of science at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which runs the Hubble research programme for Nasa. \"You look at those images and they are astoundingly beautiful. But then there is this hidden beauty in the physics, namely that underneath all this richness and complexity there is a relatively simple truth which allows these phenomena to occur.\" </p> <p>The things Livio has seen. He was there, for example, when scientists at the institute got their first glimpse of the Hubble Deep Field. In 1995 the institute decided to train the telescope for several days on a single patch of blank black sky, selected for its apparent emptiness. What this meant was that there were no foreground objects - no near stars - to get in the way of the phenomena that this long, hard look revealed. You can see the Hubble Deep Field in colour photographs. It is studded with glowing objects, some of which you might mistake for stars but which are all galaxies - so far away that we are seeing them millions, even billions, of years ago. The light from the most distant galaxy photographed in the Hubble Deep Field took 13bn years to reach us. It is a red, blurry glimpse of a galaxy in the process of formation, in the early years of the universe. </p> <p>You can see how looking at this stuff regularly might get the most hard-headed scientist thinking about beauty. And that is what Livio has done in his new book The Accelerated Universe, an accessible account of the latest discoveries in cosmology (the study of the structure of the universe) that is also a plea for scientists to admit what they are really engaged in: the pursuit of the beautiful. Physicists, argues Livio, are not cold, objective calculators. They are aesthetes, trying to see behind the apparent chaos of nature a beautiful underlying order. </p> <p>\"I call this a cosmological aesthetic principle,\" explains Livio. \"In physics, things that are difficult to prove we tend to call principles. I can't say why it is that a theory of the universe should be beautiful. All I can say is that history has taught us they are.\" </p> <p>This is surprising because beauty is a shunned word in current thinking about art. It's back there in history with Greek temples and Ruskin. Livio, a self-confessed \"art fanatic\", who compares looking at distant stars to contemplating his \"all-time favourite painting\", Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, is happy not just to discuss beauty but to define it. </p> <p>He argues that what makes a description of the universe succeed or fail - what scientists are looking for - is beauty. Beauty in a theory of physics consists of reducing the apparent complexity and chaos of the universe to a simple set of propositions. If the theory is correct, this beautiful order is a property of the universe itself; we exist because of beauty. The object of physics is therefore to prove that the universe is beautiful. He quotes his fellow cosmologist Steve Weinberg: \"We believe that, if we ask why the world is and then ask why that answer is the way it is, at the end of this chain of explanations we shall find a few simple principles of compelling beauty.\" </p> <p>Livio's three criteria for beauty in a theory of the universe are \"symmetry, simplicity and Copernican humility\". By \"Copernican humility\" he means sticking to the tradition of Copernicus, who pointed out that the earth revolves around the sun; we are not the centre of the universe. This is a polemical point by Livio. Among the brain-warping ideas of contemporary physics is the \"anthropic principle\", that because there are multiple universes and our universe may be the only one that can support life, it effectively exists solely for us; we are at the centre of our universe after all, even if it is only one of an infinite number of universes. </p> <p>Livio rejects this idea as \"ugly\" because, he says, it abandons the search for a beautiful explanation for everything and instead says things are the way they are because we need them to be that way. </p> <p>Yet his book is actually about a crisis of beauty. The new information from deep space collected by Hubble - the same telescope that generates those gorgeous images - defies any simple (\"beautiful\") explanation. By observing to new degrees of accuracy the velocity at which supernovae (exploding stars which release tremendous bursts of energy) are receding from us, Hubble has apparently confirmed what had been tentatively suggested from telescopes on earth: that the universe is expanding much faster than anyone imagined, and without end. It is getting faster and faster. There is no explanation for this that is \"beautiful\". </p> <p>Livio thinks this current ugliness of the universe is an aberration. It is because we don't understand enough. He finds the alternative (the \"anthropic\" reasoning that says the weirdness of our universe is as it is because that is what human life requires) lacking in humility. \"Maybe this simply represents a misunderstanding on our part of what is truly fundamental. History of science has shown that whenever something ugly appeared, this represented a misunderstanding of the entire picture. I think most physicists would agree that when all is said and done, the emerging picture was a beautiful one.\" </p> <p>Livio is very careful about not applying his cosmological aesthetic principle to art. But what if we did? Richard Bright, who runs the Interalia Centre in Bristol, an organisation that tries to foster links between artists and scientists, thinks scientists have a lot to learn from art as well as the other way round. He is working with cosmologist John Barrow and art historian Martin Kemp to find ways to represent the multi-dimensional spaces hypothesised by contemporary physics - but he agrees that most efforts by artists to engage with the new physics are poor. There is a lot of art that explicitly talks about things like quantum theory but doesn't seem to go beyond a rhetorical use of it. The worst example of this is Antony Gormley's sculpture Quantum Cloud, which is outside the Millennium Dome - a colossal figure of a man glimpsed through a matrix of metal tubes. \"It's got nothing to do with quantum physics,\" says Bright. </p> <p>This is a hideously ugly work of art, like the worst efforts of the second-rate Cubists who tried to combine Picasso's discoveries with a more traditional art. A truly quantum view of things would not resolve itself into a traditional human figure. Indeed, the ugliness of this piece could be seen as confirmation of what Livio says about the anthropic principle - that a human-centred universe is an ugly, messy, arrogant idea. </p> <p>The emerging picture from Hubble - which has only a few more years to observe far-flung realms of space and time before being replaced by the even more powerful Next Generation Space Telescope - may not be beautiful in the underlying, orderly sense demanded by Livio, but it certainly beats most contemporary art. Meanwhile we are all in the gutter while Hubble is looking at the stars. </p> <p>Next week: Jonathan Jones examines beauty and horror in contemporary art.</p>",

      "body": "<p>New British music featured in all the main orchestral concerts at Cheltenham this year. I don't know whether festival director Michael Berkeley told his chosen composers to keep it short and sweet, but that's more or less what we got. There was nothing hard-edged and difficult - nothing anywhere near as challenging as the Saariaho and Stockhausen pieces featured by the London Sinfonietta in its late-evening concert at the town hall on July 4. But on Tuesday 11, violinist Rebecca Hirsch and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales introduced something that would certainly stand repetition: Ian Wilson's compact, one-movement Violin Concerto, An Angel Serves a Small Breakfast. The title comes from a painting by Paul Klee. </p> <p>Perhaps comparison with Klee's whimsical imagery might add new dimensions of meaning; perhaps not. But this exquisitely lyrical and remarkably single-minded piece came over well enough on its own terms.

      "bodyText": "New British music featured in all the main orchestral concerts at Cheltenham this year. I don't know whether festival director Michael Berkeley told his chosen composers to keep it short and sweet, but that's more or less what we got. There was nothing hard-edged and difficult - nothing anywhere near as challenging as the Saariaho and Stockhausen pieces featured by the London Sinfonietta in its late-evening concert at the town hall on July 4. But on Tuesday 11, violinist Rebecca Hirsch and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales introduced something that would certainly stand repetition: Ian Wilson's compact, one-movement Violin Concerto, An Angel Serves a Small Breakfast. The title comes from a painting by Paul Klee. Perhaps comparison with Klee's whimsical imagery might add new dimensions of meaning; perhaps not. But this exquisitely lyrical and remarkably single-minded piece came over well enough on its own terms. Troubled, yet at the same time beguiling, Wilson's concerto occasionally echoed the long-breathed, sweet-and-sour melodic writing of Berg, and perhaps Szymanowski, but it never sounded derivative or unsure of itself. Wilson's concerto compared favourably with Joseph Phibbs's Dreams of a Summer Night, sandwiched between popular fail-safes by Mozart and Tchaikovsky in the BBC Symphony Orchestra concert on Saturday July 8. At about half the length of the Wilson, Phibbs's piece felt a good deal longer. It started well: a dreamy, exotically coloured modern impressionism, which could have continued very nicely. But the faster, more turbulent music that followed it lacked conviction and focus. Was that entirely Phibbs's fault?

The opening downward run for cellos, basses and bassoons was messy, and there were other unsteady moments. A conductor with a firmer, tauter beat might have made more sense of Phibbs's denser, more active textures. Wolfgang Rihm's failure to complete his promised new work for the Takacs Quartet (July 15) was a big disappointment, though that superb ensemble's polished but grippingly intense reading of Janacek's First Quartet was more than compensation - extraordinary how challenging and contemporary Janacek can sound three-quarters of a century after his death. But a concert earlier that day by members of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain included thought-provoking works by two of this country's most individual modern composers: Diana Burrell and Judith Weir. One of the most refreshing things about Burrell is her lack of inhibition. Unlike many younger British composers, she doesn't write as though she had an elderly, over-fastidious, donnish critic peering over her shoulder.

      "body": "<p>A light drizzle bathes the Galway Quays, but in bare feet, hemp shirt and cut-off baggies, Woody Harrelson doesn't seem to notice. He pads across the cobbles with a languorous cowboy amble, instantly at home in the bustling quayside. In West Ireland's legendary epicentre of the \"craich\" and sleepless partying, the perfect tan and healthy glow emanating from the Texan vegan make him almost luminous. \"It's yer man from Cheers,\" a couple of elderly women whisper. Although Harrelson has been A List Hollywood for almost a decade, he is still known for his eight-year stint behind that mythical Boston bar as the dumb barman savant, Woody Boyd. </p> <p>The guest of honour at the 12th Galway Film Fleadh, once a ramshackle footnote on the festival circuit but now the country's leading event, Harrelson has to be steered back to his hotel. Still shoeless, he stands on a low window sill staring at the damp trees, like a prisoner yearning to be outside. He is much lighter and leaner than the muscle-popping sports grunt magnified by the big screen. But the slow Texas drawl is genuine and calming as he asks: \"Want some tea?\" </p> <p>While the kettle boils, Harrelson takes a teabag out of his pocket and explains: \"I got a little blend here, it's herbs and roots from a rainforest in South America. It can get you off coffee.\" For 10 years, the 38-year-old Harrelson has been vegan, banishing coffee, sugar and all additives. Also aware that he is at the festival as the narrator of Ron Mann's docu-history of marijuana, I hesitantly take a sip, for herbal tea from Hollywood's hemp-advocating zen cowboy may be suffused with something more than just camomile. Like the man himself, it seems harmless, if fuzzy, and I ask how he got into the business. </p> <p>\"Elvis and girls,\" he drawls. \"1978, Elvis Presley died and I was in high school in the dining hall. I was a pretty sensitive kid and I was ridiculed a lot. I was unusual, some would call me weird. So these guys asked me to do my Elvis impersonation; I got on the table and started singing All Shook Up, really getting into it, and one of the prettiest girls in school asked me to join the drama class. That's what did it.\" </p> <p>While in Galway, he will also take an actors' masterclass for 25 local thesps. Although he is one of the very few to successfully cross the divide from TV screen to movie theatres, he is also one of the most underrated American actors since his idol, Sean Penn. Like Penn, he has acquired a reputation as a troublesome party animal that will no doubt be enhanced by Grass, which premiered at the Fleadh, a serio-comic documentary collage of archive footage about the use and prohibition of marijuana that Harrelson, as a self-proclaimed \"grass activist,\" agreed to narrate. </p> <p>\"In the US, the government is very partial to telling you that you are living in the land of the free and the home of the brave - well, it sure ain't free,\" says Harrelson. \"I believe that, in a truly free country, you should be able to choose the drug you want, as long as you are not harming anybody else. Now, everybody's a drug-addict, children are addicted to sugar, caffeine and pharmaceuticals, every one of those kids who shot up the schools in the US were on some kind of pills. My best friend, Danny Platner, died from the use of alcohol, pills and tobacco, all extremely addictive drugs. All legalised and freely available. Put him in the grave at age 32.\" </p> <p>The delivery may be slow, but the sudden Harrelson diatribe is passionate and surprising, as if he had shifted emotional zones, as he puts it, \"into the moment\". But I am to find out that 24 hours with Woody is like veering between ashram purity and bacchanalian excess. He has been speaking out in support of cannabis for a long time, facing trial for planting hemp seeds in his Kentucky home in 1996, bailing out other marijuana activists and criticising American agricultural policy. He sees a deep government conspiracy which was, he says, historically based on \"racism against Mexican and black workers\" who brought marijuana into the US at the start of the century. </p> <p>\"The most destructive drugs are all condoned by the government,\" he continues, \"yet they criminalise marijuana, a lot of my friends are in jail for smoking pot (and the prison system is one of the fastest-growing industries, by the way), which has no proven side-effects apart from making you feel euphoric. So what's wrong with that? Every year hundreds of thousands die from tobacco, alcohol and pharmaceutical use - I'm sorry, I get emotional about this. But to my knowledge, nobody's ever died from smoking marijuana. And, believe me, some nights I've tried and you can't do it.\" </p> <p>Although Grass was the highest-grossing independent film on its release in the US, it was banned by the Canadian Film Censors soon after. A retrospective of Harrelson's work contains some of the most controversial studio films of the past decade; later he is to introduce a special Galway Fleadh screening of Natural Born Killers, starring Harrelson as the chilled psychotic, Mickey, which remains banned from public screening in the Republic. </p> <p>\"People think I'm some kind of trouble-maker, but I don't like trouble, it just seems to find me a lot,\" he says. \"I have the unworthy distinction of having three of my films boycotted in the US. Money Train was supposed to have caused copycat violence, but that was proved wrong; Natural Born Killers was attacked by Bob Dole when he was running for president, and The People vs Larry Flynt was torn apart by a lot of the critics. I mean, I love comedies, I think good slapstick is rare and the Farrelly brothers are the best. But I also like movies that stir something in you and I've tried to go with that.\" </p> <p>There is a strange, boyish innocence about him, but it seems that, beyond the controversial fiction of some of his films, a troubled reality dogs Harrelson, whose personal history is tabloid manna. His father, allegedly a contract killer, has been in jail since 1979 serving two life sentences for murder. He's now married with two daughters to his long-term partner Laura Louie, but American Rhapsody, a book by Basic Instinct screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, is due out this month in the US, and among its salacious tales from Hollywood it alleges a long clandestine affair between Harrelson and Glenn Close. </p> <p>Harrelson admits that \"early on I sold my soul a couple of times, but I haven't done it since,\" and that he \"made a big mistake with Money Train\" despite co-starring with his friend Wesley Snipes, from his 1992 breakthrough basketball film, White Men Can't Jump. \"Luck has a lot to do with it. If Keanu Reeves had been able to play basketball, I'd never have got the part,\" he says. \"I've been offered a ton of mindless action movies for huge amounts of money, but I turned them down.\" Many thought he could have been the next Bruce Willis, but he chose to pass on the megabucks and torn T-shirts. </p> <p>In 1993, it looked like he had gone into the glossy mainstream as Demi Moore's husband in Indecent Proposal (a year later he turned his image on its head with Natural Born Killers). Lets face it, though, he never stood a chance against Robert Redford, even though he was the most believable thing in that film. The muscly jaw gives him a look like he's gunning for a fight or eternally chewing tobacco and the thin mouth occasionally slides open to reveal a gap-toothed grin and a slight lisp. He's always going to be more good-ol'-boy than romantic lead, the grunt in Malick's Thin Red Line, the cowboy in Frear's Hi-Lo Country, or - his finest hour - the mumbling, wounded and wounding mountain boy turned porn iconoclast in Milos Forman's The People vs Larry Flynt. </p> <p>\"Milos Forman probably said: \"Get me the most white trash actor in Hollywood,\" laughs Harrelson, \"but the beauty of that story, like a lot of roles I've done, is looking beyond what's in front of you. I mean the guy was a porn king and his partner [played by Courtney Love] was a drug-addict, but you got to the point where you felt compassion for them. It was also about freedom and the hypocrisy of the government.\" </p> <p> Two years before that, he was \"still trying to establish some distance from Cheers\" with the stylised violence of Natural Born Killers, which proved too much for some fans and critics. Oliver Stone's film remains threatened by a lawsuit filed by writer John Grisham, who is suing on the grounds that it inspired violence against friends of his. </p> <p>\"Now there's a perfect example of a hypocrite,\" says Harrelson. \"I was supposed to be in A Time to Kill [the film of Grisham's novel]. But after Natural Born Killers he said I could not be in his movie, which is fine. But he took money from Regency, who made Natural Born Killers, to make A Time to Kill. If he gets anywhere with this case it would be very scary for making films or any kind of art, because we'd all be held accountable to hypocrites like Grisham.\" </p> <p>With Harrelson, what you see is what you get, and he says, almost uniquely for a Hollywood actor, exactly what he thinks. \"It may not be the expedient thing to do for me personally or my career, but I don't sit muddling over reasons to be cautious, I have to do and say what feels right in my heart. And that includes the fact that marijuana is the most maligned plant on the planet, and the most loved,\" he says. </p> <p>Later on, in one of the long Festival nights at the Galway Rowing Club, which yearly becomes the Fleadh Club, Harrelson mingles until 6am, wearing down the zen purity of his body, sharing Guinness, spliffs and jokes with the throng. Galway is his kind of town. I catch up with him by the river's edge. \"I'm an environmental activist more than anything else,\" he says. Then a slow smile spreads. \"And I'll always fight for the right to party.\"</p>",

Everyone started saying I was a slag, but a man would have got away with it and that's not fair. I'd always been in relationships so it really winds me up when I get called a man-eater.\" Melanie Sykes on the double standard she encountered following the end of her last relationship, The Sun \"What happens when a female shopper enters the shopping environment is that she offers herself up to a process of seduction . . . Success in this seduction, as in sexual seduction, will be facilitated by the woman's longing for admiration, approval, affection, comfort and intimacy, and her readiness to deceive herself and make believe that she has found them in a stranger. As she succumbs and spends \u00a350 on a cream with which she may caress her lonely skin, she tells herself, as L'Or\u00e9al so brazenly says: 'I'm worth it'.\" Germaine Greer on women's ambivalent relationship with shopping, Express \"It might not be like that in fucking Middle England, but in Margate it's only a matter of time. It's not called rape. It is called losing your virginity. You got broke into. Germaine Greer got into terrible trouble for saying this, but someone who is 18, who's been walking you home, that's been snogging you, then pushed you to the ground and forcibly puts themselves inside you and you cry and you didn't want it to happen and it's the first person you've had in your life, and you keep quiet about it - it's still actually somewhat different from, well, I'm not going to go into any violent scenarios, but you can imagine.\" Tracey Emin, London Evening Standard \"On the outside it seems like everyone in England is uptight, but actually they're not, they're a bunch of dirty wankers. My God, all you have is naked people in newspapers here! I can't get used to the naked Page Three girl, no matter how hard I try ... You know, I'm having my cup of coffee and I'm opening a newspaper and ... Uh! I mean, tits are everywhere here ... but really!\" Madonna on living in Britain, The Face",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners against the illicit trade in \"conflict diamonds\" - which is known to be funding at least three African wars - were yesterday celebrating after the diamond industry signed up to a radical plan to tackle the problem. The plan was endorsed by the world's two largest diamond trade groups and should see a global certification system for parcels of rough diamonds put in place by the end of the year. The move is likely to cut off one of the biggest sources of funding for rebels such as the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone and Unita in Angola. Once the plan is implemented every package of rough diamonds will have to be shipped in a sealed bag and its contents entered into an international database. This will allow a new body, provisionally named the International Diamond Council, to ensure that only diamonds from legitimate sources are traded. The plan, which won the backing of the International Diamond Manufacturers' Association (IDMA) and the World Federation of Diamond Bourses, has real teeth. Any trader or country found to be knowingly dealing in \"blood diamonds\" will face expulsion from the trade and criminal sanctions. A joint statement claimed that the scheme \"will immediately close off all the legal loopholes by which conflict diamonds may currently be entering the trade\", and declared that it needed to be put in place \"sooner rather than later\". The scheme will be funded by charging a minimal levy on the import and export of all rough diamonds. \"We don't want these people and we don't need them,\" Peter Meeus, general manager of Antwerp's Diamond High Council, which oversees the world's biggest trading centre, said. \"Anyone who breaks the embargo will be banned from the trade.\" The issue of conflict diamonds has dominated the three-day meeting of this most secretive of industries which has, until now, been singularly reluctant to admit that there is a problem. But intense, behind-the-scenes pressure from the US and British governments, which say they are determined to put an end to savage African wars fuelled by diamonds, has finally yielded results. Earlier this week Robert Fowler, the Canadian ambassador to the UN, issued a stark warning to the industry and predicted that it would face commercial catastrophe unless it cleaned up its act. The human rights group Global Witness which has campaigned along with other non-governmental organisations to stamp out the trade, was yesterday in buoyant mood. \"This is very, very important, since we've got the two main industry bodies working on the problem. The industry has been dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century and has taken a real leap of imagination,\" a spokesman, Alex Yearsley, said. \"We are optimistically upbeat and believe that this is a step in the right direction.\" The ground-breaking resolution, which was adopted at the industry's congress in Antwerp, was also welcomed by a broad coalition of non-governmental organisations which said they were confident that it would go a long way to breaking the illicit trade. They were at pains to stress, however, that the scheme would need to be independently monitored, and that there should be solid progress on implementing the plan by mid-September. Sean Cohen, IDMA's president and a key figure in drafting the plan, said that individual governments needed to enact legislation stipulating that they would only accept diamonds officially sealed and registered in the exporting country. Crucially, the scheme also has the backing of De Beers, the South African diamond giant which controls 60% of the world's diamond supply. The industry produces \u00a34.5bn worth of diamonds each year, which feeds into a jewellery market worth some \u00a337bn.",

Four years later, at 1pm on July 19 1900, without fanfare or speechmaking, the first carriage transported one lone passenger from Porte Maillot to Porte de Vincennes - but by the end of that year the number of journeys had reached 17m. And celebrating its 100th birthday yesterday, the Paris underground - for many foreigners as much a part of the French experience as baguettes, bidets and Bordeaux wine - could make a fair claim to being the world's most loved, most efficient and least expensive city transport system. Asked why visitors from London in particular tend to cite the metro as one of their abiding memories of the French capital, one senior city transport official, Vincent Relave, said bluntly: \"Because it works.\" But the metro is also cheap. A book of 10 tickets costs \u00a35.50, while a monthly pass costs \u00a326.90.

The project was placed in the capable hand of the city's one-armed chief engineer, Fulgence Bienvenue, who oversaw the network's rapid expansion until 1932, when he retired aged 80. When challenged to build the first line under the Seine, he came up with the novel idea of freezing the ground to allow tunnelling. The early metro's other leading light was Hector Guimard, one of the creators of Art Nouveau, who designed the curvaceous, cast-iron \"dragonfly wing\" entrances to scores of the new metro stations. As part of its centenary celebrations, the Paris transport authority, RATP, is restoring 86 of his remaining masterpieces. Other projects include a new exhibition of slides, videos and old rolling stock at the RATP's headquarters near the Gare de Lyon. Nine stations are also mounting special displays on great themes of the century. The station of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e8s is to be turned into a literary fair featuring the work of Left Bank luminaries like Sartre and de Beauvoir, while sports will be celebrated at Villejuif L\u00e9o Lagrange, the French film industry at Bonne Nouvelle, and the countries of the EU at Europe. All summer, the RATP will run nostalgia trips for underground buffs, using the network's legendary Sprague rolling stock which served from 1908 to 1983. And in a special gesture to Parisians, more than 1,000 of the capital's inhabitants who were born on July 19 were invited yesterday to a birthday party at Montparnasse-Bienvenue station. Proving either the metro's enduring popularity or Parisians' love of champagne, 2,500 turned up.

The move comes in response to sustained international criticism that African countries battling the epidemic are unable to acquire Aids-suppressing medicines developed in the US because of their excessive cost. The new programme was due to be announced in Washington yesterday by James Harmon, the president of the congressionally funded US Export-Import Bank. It involves five-year loans to 24 eligible countries at interest rates of about 7% a year. \"This is at least a first step in showing the world that Africa is important to the United States and that we can make a dent in this terrible problem,\" Mr Harmon told the New York Times before the official announcement. The European Union and Japan are likely to match the US announcement, Mr Harmon said, with the issue expected to be addressed at this weekend's G8 economic summit of the world's wealthiest countries in Okinawa. International loans of up to $3bn - the annual target set by the United Nations - could become available to African countries soon, he said. The Clinton administration is reportedly divided about the wisdom of the move; some officials are apparently opposed to making fresh loans to Africa at a time when the White House is pressing a reluctant Republican-controlled Congress to write off up to $100bn in past lending to the world's most heavily indebted countries. The move comes two months after five major multinational drugs companies agreed to cut the prices that they charge for drugs to combat Aids and the HIV virus in Africa. \"I think what the US is doing is laudable,\" the Ghanaian ambassador to Washington, Koby Koomson, said yesterday. \"But the pharmaceutical companies need to come around and see that the only way to fight this pandemic is to donate whatever is necessary.\"",

Eritrea is one of six countries in the Horn of Africa where the UN says 13m people are at risk of starvation as the result of this year's drought, part of a widespread famine which has remained largely invisible. Only in Ethiopia, where international aid was speeded up after the UN raised the alarm earlier in the year, has rain fallen in some regions. Last week the UN's food and agriculture organisation reported \"starvation-related deaths, especially among children\" in Kenya's arid north. Fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea began on May 12, forcing more than a million Eritreans to flee their homes and sending nearly 100,000 people into refugee camps in neighbouring Sudan, Djibouti and Yemen. \"The total impact has been enormous - they've had a two-year war, some people have been displaced two, or even three, times,\" one UN official said yesterday. A massive displacement of the population, particularly in Eritrea's western lowlands, disrupted farming just as the planting season was beginning. \"The first planting season will be a year from now, and the harvest then some months down the line,\" said Ivo Freijsen of the UN's humanitarian affairs office . \"Eritrea is facing a potentially catastrophic situation, with large-scale population displacement and increasing impoverishment,\" said the UN humanitarian coordinator, Simon Nhongo. \"This humanitarian appeal will help to meet the country's most critical humanitarian needs through [to] the end of the year, but the disruption to agriculture and to the country's coping mechanisms means that Eritrea will need humanitarian assistance well into 2001.\" The UN earlier in the year requested $42m for more than half a million Eritreans affected by war and drought, but the potentially disastrous humanitarian situation since the fighting in May forced the organisation's relief agencies to call for a doubling of the funds. However, only 39% of the earlier appeal was met by the donor community, despite praise from the UN for the Eritrean government for hav ing done \"an outstanding job\" in trying to meet its people's needs. \"It is rare to see a government so much involved and trying so hard,\" said Mr Freijsen. People are beginning to return home from refugee camps, but they still face problems including demolished houses and a ruined infrastructure, as well as difficulties with food supplies. Under the new $87m appeal, which covers several UN agencies, the world food programme (WFP) is focusing on some 750,000 Eritreans who will need more than 63,000 tonnes of food aid until the end of the year. The WFP is requesting more than $40m for food, logistic requirements and improvements to the port of Massawa to ensure that food supplies move smoothly into Eritrea. Other agencies involved in the appeal include the UN development programme, which needs $15.4m to provide tents, blankets and other household items. The UN high commissioner for refugees needs $13.3m to stabilise displaced populations and help them to return home. Unicef needs $10.7m to provide water and sanitation, health, immunisation, nutrition, education and awareness programmes to the million-plus affected by the war. The UN population fund's $3.9m programme will provide maternal health care and aid general reproductive health. Some $1.2m is needed by the world health organisation.

      "body": "<p>In the last four years I've realised that the net to me is an incredibly useful phone book. I've been amazed at some of the people I've been able to track down via the net. People like Yma Sumac the legendary mock Inca performer, and Severed Heads, an Australian proto-techno band. </p> <p><strong> How do you use the net?</strong> I use it to buy records, find artists and as a way of accessing hard to find information. Recently I traced some obscure Luis Bunuel films through American video sites ( http://members.xoom.com/scatt/bunuel.html ). It took about three clicks to get there. I think I spend more money on the internet now than I do in shops! </p> <p><strong> Is e-commerce taking over the net?</strong> </p> <p>One of the things that really annoys me is the junk email. The amount of stuff I filter out now is ridiculous - Lastminute.com I save a special place in hell for. </p> <p><strong> Are you in favour of regulation of the net in general? </strong> I am always reluctant to go down on the side of regulation of any kind. I wouldn't ever advocate any kind of censorship but I do still want to punch the guy that writes the Lastminute.com copy. </p> <p><strong> How vital has the net become to your lifestyle? </strong> Email is now the primary point of communication between myself and the people I work with. I hardly ever send faxes and I'll avoid picking up the phone whenever possible. I've put gigs on at the Festival Hall where the entire negotiation, technical and contract process has taken place via email. </p> <p><strong> Any favourite places on the net? </strong> Finding Severed Heads' homepage at <a href=\"http://www.sevcom.com\">www.sevcom.com</a> was a joy. There's a great Simpsons site <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Workshop/3255\">www.geocities.com/SoHo/Workshop/3255 </a> where some guy's drawn his versions and scanned them in. I also like the work of John Kricfalusi at <a href=\"http://www.spumco.com\">www.spumco.com</a> who did Ren &amp; Stimpy but gave it up because he felt he had more freedom for a cartoon site on the net. Credit where it's due, I'm a big fan of the <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/Fiver/\" target=\"_NEW\">Guardian Fiver newsletter</a>.

      "bodyText": "In the last four years I've realised that the net to me is an incredibly useful phone book. I've been amazed at some of the people I've been able to track down via the net. People like Yma Sumac the legendary mock Inca performer, and Severed Heads, an Australian proto-techno band. How do you use the net? I use it to buy records, find artists and as a way of accessing hard to find information. Recently I traced some obscure Luis Bunuel films through American video sites ( http://members.xoom.com/scatt/bunuel.html ). It took about three clicks to get there. I think I spend more money on the internet now than I do in shops! Is e-commerce taking over the net? One of the things that really annoys me is the junk email. The amount of stuff I filter out now is ridiculous - Lastminute.com I save a special place in hell for. Are you in favour of regulation of the net in general? I am always reluctant to go down on the side of regulation of any kind. I wouldn't ever advocate any kind of censorship but I do still want to punch the guy that writes the Lastminute.com copy. How vital has the net become to your lifestyle? Email is now the primary point of communication between myself and the people I work with. I hardly ever send faxes and I'll avoid picking up the phone whenever possible. I've put gigs on at the Festival Hall where the entire negotiation, technical and contract process has taken place via email. Any favourite places on the net? Finding Severed Heads' homepage at www.sevcom.com was a joy. There's a great Simpsons site www.geocities.com/SoHo/Workshop/3255 where some guy's drawn his versions and scanned them in. I also like the work of John Kricfalusi at www.spumco.com who did Ren &amp; Stimpy but gave it up because he felt he had more freedom for a cartoon site on the net. Credit where it's due, I'm a big fan of the Guardian Fiver newsletter. I think the NME is very good but I wonder why anyone buys the NME anymore as all the information is there two days before it comes out. Where do you see the net going? This idea of the internet being the death of recorded and live music is similar to what people said about cinema when video came along. I actually think it will encourage more interest in the music. I've been very keen to welcome people in to do web casting and recently iGig ( www.igig.com filmed Blur for their site.

But when UN troops tried to move into the RUF's diamond-rich areas this spring, the hostage-taking began. The United States and Britain want an international tribunal to try Mr Sankoh and other RUF leaders for war crimes because the rebels raped and maimed thousands of civilians between 1991 and 1999.

KPN Mobile is 15% owned by Japanese mobile phone firm NTT DoCoMo. </p> <p>The listing of KPN Mobile was delayed after merger talks between KPN and Spain's Telefonica began in May. Those talks collapsed after Telefonica raised concerns about the Dutch government's 43.5% stake in KPN. </p> <p>However, yesterday's announcement of a share issue, that may also include convertible bonds, should cut that government holding. </p> <p>Dutch finance ministry spokesman Stephan Schrover said it was impossible to say immediately what percentage of the government's holding would be sold in the issue. </p> <p>\"We are going to participate in the offering because we have said in the long-term we would get rid of our stake,\" he said. </p> <p>Further details of the share issue will be released on August 30. But analysts believe that the Dutch government would have to relinquish at least half of its 43.5% stake in the telecoms company. </p> <p>The Netherlands has said it would sell its entire KPN stake by 2004 - but has so far refused to set a timetable for the disposal. The proposed share sale brought some speculation among analysts that it may reignite talks between KPN and Telefonica. </p> <p>KPN has said it remains open to a deal with Telefonica. Yet the alliance KPN struck last week with NTT DoCoMo and Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa may complicate a future merger. </p> <p>The alliance is aimed at pursuing and acquiring third generation mobile phone licences across Europe. </p> <p>KPN shares tumbled on the share sales news yesterday. The stock fell 7.2% to 42.87 euros as investors feared an overhang of shares in the market that would depress the price. </p> <p>The share issue will be aimed at institutional investors around the world and at private investors in the Netherlands, Germany and the US. ABN Amro Rothschild, Goldman Sachs International and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney will act as joint global coordinators.</p>",

France Telecom inherited the 50% stake in KPN Orange, when it bought British mobile phone company Orange. Regulatory requirements insist that France Telecom divest that half share because it owns a competing Belgian mobile phone operator. KPN is also planning to splash out at least 4bn euros for a clutch of third generation mobile licences in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The group said it would also list its mobile telephone arm by next year. KPN Mobile is 15% owned by Japanese mobile phone firm NTT DoCoMo. The listing of KPN Mobile was delayed after merger talks between KPN and Spain's Telefonica began in May. Those talks collapsed after Telefonica raised concerns about the Dutch government's 43.5% stake in KPN. However, yesterday's announcement of a share issue, that may also include convertible bonds, should cut that government holding. Dutch finance ministry spokesman Stephan Schrover said it was impossible to say immediately what percentage of the government's holding would be sold in the issue. \"We are going to participate in the offering because we have said in the long-term we would get rid of our stake,\" he said. Further details of the share issue will be released on August 30. But analysts believe that the Dutch government would have to relinquish at least half of its 43.5% stake in the telecoms company. The Netherlands has said it would sell its entire KPN stake by 2004 - but has so far refused to set a timetable for the disposal. The proposed share sale brought some speculation among analysts that it may reignite talks between KPN and Telefonica. KPN has said it remains open to a deal with Telefonica. Yet the alliance KPN struck last week with NTT DoCoMo and Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa may complicate a future merger. The alliance is aimed at pursuing and acquiring third generation mobile phone licences across Europe. KPN shares tumbled on the share sales news yesterday. The stock fell 7.2% to 42.87 euros as investors feared an overhang of shares in the market that would depress the price. The share issue will be aimed at institutional investors around the world and at private investors in the Netherlands, Germany and the US. ABN Amro Rothschild, Goldman Sachs International and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney will act as joint global coordinators.",

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England yesterday issued a veiled warning to the chancellor, Gordon Brown, that after Tuesday's bumper boost to public spending any pre-election tax giveaways would be met with higher interest rates. </p> <p>Threadneedle Street's rate-setting committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold earlier this month. </p> <p>However, the minutes of the monetary policy committee's meeting, published yesterday, revealed that the committee believes that private sector spending will have to slow down to offset the large increase in public spending if the Bank is to meet its 2.5% target inflation. </p> <p>The nine-member panel had been given a sneak preview of the chancellor's public spending plans, and the minutes of its meeting revealed that some members feared higher government spending could increase inflationary pressures. </p> <p>\"Looking forward, given the likely increases in public spending over the next two years, private sector spending needed to slow further if the inflation target were to be met,\" the minutes noted. </p> <p>Opposition parties said this was a signal that the MPC would respond to any demand boosting tax cuts with higher borrowing costs. </p> <p>\"Their comments make it clear that any budget tax cuts before the election on top of the existing spending plans would force up interest rates and hit jobs,\" said Matthew Taylor, economics spokesman for the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>But the Treasury denied the minutes amounted to a warning, noting that the MPC had pencilled in a slowdown in its forecasts when it was already aware of the overall impact of Mr Brown's spending plans. </p> <p>\"The MPC recorded their view in the last quarterly inflation report that the macro-economic effect of the Budget was unlikely to be large,\" a Treasury spokesman said. </p> <p>Interest rates could also be forced up by rising spending. Yesterday's retail sales figures for June, released by the Office for National Statistics, showed that sales jumped by 0.7% during the month - a far higher level than City analysts had been expecting. </p> <p>\"These data provide ammunition for those MPC members who felt further increases in the repo rate would ultimately be necessary to press for another policy tightening at the August MPC meeting,\" said James Carrick at ABN-Amro. </p> <p>But the ONS said underlying growth in retail sales was \"much the same\" as that recorded in May. </p> <p>Sales were up 0.3% in the three months to June compared with the previous three - a figure which smoothes erratic monthly movements. That was only slightly higher than the 0.2% trend rate recorded in May. </p> <p>But some City economists thought rates might be cut - thanks to the MPC's doves. </p> <p>\"For the first time we are getting suggestions that interest rates should perhaps be coming down,\" said Ciaran Barr at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. </p> <p>Signs that the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, has jumped the gun and started leaking some of the production increase of 500,000 barrels that the oil producers' club Opec has promised the west should also help ease the fears of the monetary policy committee's hawks. </p> <p>Higher petrol prices have a been a major factor pushing up inflation in recent months. </p> <p>The news pushed down oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic. In late trading yesterday the September contract for Brent Crude was off 30 cents at $29.02 a barrel, while August Nymex crude was down 44 cents at $31.50. </p> <p>Industry sources said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia was making good on its unilateral pledge to lift oil output by 500,000 barrels per day by already opening the taps by half that amount. </p> <p>\"The extra 250,000 are available for customers right now,\" said an industry source familiar with Saudi oil policy. </p> <p> <strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sr2000/report/index.html\">Spending review: full text</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/csr/story/0,2763,344690,00.html\">Full text of chancellor's speech</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,344654,00.html\">The issue explained</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England yesterday issued a veiled warning to the chancellor, Gordon Brown, that after Tuesday's bumper boost to public spending any pre-election tax giveaways would be met with higher interest rates. Threadneedle Street's rate-setting committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold earlier this month. However, the minutes of the monetary policy committee's meeting, published yesterday, revealed that the committee believes that private sector spending will have to slow down to offset the large increase in public spending if the Bank is to meet its 2.5% target inflation. The nine-member panel had been given a sneak preview of the chancellor's public spending plans, and the minutes of its meeting revealed that some members feared higher government spending could increase inflationary pressures. \"Looking forward, given the likely increases in public spending over the next two years, private sector spending needed to slow further if the inflation target were to be met,\" the minutes noted. Opposition parties said this was a signal that the MPC would respond to any demand boosting tax cuts with higher borrowing costs. \"Their comments make it clear that any budget tax cuts before the election on top of the existing spending plans would force up interest rates and hit jobs,\" said Matthew Taylor, economics spokesman for the Liberal Democrats. But the Treasury denied the minutes amounted to a warning, noting that the MPC had pencilled in a slowdown in its forecasts when it was already aware of the overall impact of Mr Brown's spending plans. \"The MPC recorded their view in the last quarterly inflation report that the macro-economic effect of the Budget was unlikely to be large,\" a Treasury spokesman said. Interest rates could also be forced up by rising spending. Yesterday's retail sales figures for June, released by the Office for National Statistics, showed that sales jumped by 0.7% during the month - a far higher level than City analysts had been expecting. \"These data provide ammunition for those MPC members who felt further increases in the repo rate would ultimately be necessary to press for another policy tightening at the August MPC meeting,\" said James Carrick at ABN-Amro. But the ONS said underlying growth in retail sales was \"much the same\" as that recorded in May. Sales were up 0.3% in the three months to June compared with the previous three - a figure which smoothes erratic monthly movements. That was only slightly higher than the 0.2% trend rate recorded in May. But some City economists thought rates might be cut - thanks to the MPC's doves. \"For the first time we are getting suggestions that interest rates should perhaps be coming down,\" said Ciaran Barr at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Signs that the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, has jumped the gun and started leaking some of the production increase of 500,000 barrels that the oil producers' club Opec has promised the west should also help ease the fears of the monetary policy committee's hawks. Higher petrol prices have a been a major factor pushing up inflation in recent months. The news pushed down oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic. In late trading yesterday the September contract for Brent Crude was off 30 cents at $29.02 a barrel, while August Nymex crude was down 44 cents at $31.50. Industry sources said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia was making good on its unilateral pledge to lift oil output by 500,000 barrels per day by already opening the taps by half that amount. \"The extra 250,000 are available for customers right now,\" said an industry source familiar with Saudi oil policy.

But, at their best, Dempsey's book and lyrics have a nice snap and crackle that evoke the lost art of musical comedy. \"Jennifer Gabriel is a virgin,\" one of the Eastwick wives remarks of a local goody-goody. \"I imagine her mother is too,\" comes the retort. </p> <p>It may not be Oscar Wilde but it is a hundred times better than the verbal Polyfilla we have lately had to endure in musicals.

      "body": "<p><strong>Chapter one: Nantucket (part one)</strong></p> <p>It was, he later remembered, \"the most pleasing moment of my life\" - the moment he stepped aboard the whaleship Essex for the first time. He was fourteen years old, with a broad nose and an open, eager face, and like every other Nantucket boy, he'd been taught to \"idolize the form of a ship.\" The Essex might not look like much, stripped of her rigging and chained to the wharf, but for Thomas Nickerson she was a vessel of opportunity. Finally, after what had seemed an endless wait, Nickerson was going to sea. <br> The hot July sun beat down on her old, oil-soaked timbers until the temperature below was infernal, but Nickerson explored every cranny, from the brick altar of the tryworks being assembled on deck to the lightless depths of the empty hold. In between was a creaking, compartmentalized world, a living thing of oak and pine that reeked of oil, blood, tobacco juice, food, salt, mildew, tar, and smoke. \"[B]lack and ugly as she was,\" Nickerson wrote, \"I would not have exchanged her for a palace.\" <br> In July of 1819 the Essex was one of a fleet of more than seventy Nantucket whaleships in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. With whale-oil prices steadily climbing and the rest of the world's economy sunk in depression, the village of Nantucket was on its way to becoming one of the richest towns in America. <br> The community of about seven thousand people lived on a gently sloping hill crowded with houses and topped by windmills and church towers. It resembled, some said, the elegant and established port of Salem-a remarkable compliment for an island more than twenty miles out into the Atlantic, below Cape Cod. But if the town, high on its hill, radiated an almost ethereal quality of calm, the waterfront below bustled with activity. Sprouting from among the long, low warehouses and ropewalks, four solid-fill wharves reached out more than a hundred yards into the harbor. Tethered to the wharves or anchored in the harbor were, typically, fifteen to twenty whaleships, along with dozens of smaller vessels, mainly sloops and schooners, that brought trade goods to and from the island. Each wharf, a labyrinth of anchors, try-pots, spars, and oil casks, was thronged with sailors, stevedores, and artisans. Two-wheeled, horse-drawn carts known as calashes continually came and went. <br> It was a scene already familiar to Thomas Nickerson. The children of Nantucket had long used the waterfront as their playground. They rowed decrepit whaleboats up and down the harbor and clambered up into the rigging of the ships. To off-islanders it was clear that these children were a \"distinctive class of juveniles, accustomed to consider themselves as predestined mariners.... They climbed ratlines like monkeys-little fellows of ten or twelve years-and laid out on the yardarms with the most perfect nonchalance.\" The Essex might be Nickerson's first ship, but he had been preparing for the voyage almost his entire life. <br> He wasn't going alone. His friends Barzillai Ray, Owen Coffin, and Charles Ramsdell, all between the ages of fifteen and eighteen, were also sailing on the Essex. Owen Coffin was the cousin of the Essex's new captain and probably steered his three friends to his kinsman's ship. Nickerson was the youngest of the group. <br> The Essex was old and, at 87 feet long and 238 tons displacement, quite small, but she had a reputation on Nantucket as a lucky ship. Over the last decade and a half, she had done well by her Quaker owners, regularly returning at two-year intervals with enough oil to make them wealthy men. Daniel Russell, her previous captain, had been successful enough over the course of four voyages to be given command of a new and larger ship, the Aurora. Russell's promotion allowed the former first mate, George Pollard, Jr., to take over command of the Essex, and one of the boatsteerers (or harpooners), Owen Chase, to move up to first mate. Three other crew members were elevated to the rank of boatsteerer. Not only a lucky but apparently a happy vessel, the Essex was, according to Nickerson, \"on the whole rather a desirable ship than otherwise.\" <br> Since Nantucket was, like any seafaring town of the period, a community obsessed with omens and signs, such a reputation counted for much. Still, there was talk among the men on the wharves when earlier that July, as the Essex was being repaired and outfitted, a comet appeared in the night sky. Nantucket was a town of roof dwellers. Nearly every house, its shingles painted red or left to weather into gray, had a roof-mounted platform known as a walk. While its intended use was to facilitate putting out chimney fires with buckets of sand, the walk was also an excellent place to look out to sea with a spyglass, to search for the sails of returning ships. At night, the spyglasses of Nantucket were often directed toward the heavens, and in July of 1819, islanders were looking toward the northwest sky. The Quaker merchant Obed Macy, who kept meticulous records of what he determined were the \"most extraordinary events\" in the life of his island, watched the night sky from his house on Pleasant Street. \"The comet (which appears every clear night) is thought to be very large from its uncommonly long tail,\" he wrote, \"which extends upward in opposition to the sun in an almost perpendicular direction and heaves off to the eastward and nearly points for the North Star.\" <br> From earliest times, the appearance of a comet was interpreted as a sign that something unusual was about to happen. The New Bedford Mercury, the newspaper Nantucketers read for lack of one of their own, commented, \"True it is, that the appearance of these eccentric visitors have always preceded some remarkable event.\" But Macy resisted such speculation: \"[T]he philosophical reasoning we leave to the scientific part of the community, still it is beyond a doubt that the most learned is possessed of very little undoubted knowledge of the subject of cometicks.\" <br> At the wharves and shipping offices there was much speculation, and not just about the comet. All spring and summer there had been sightings up and down the New England coast of what the Mercury described as \"an extraordinary sea animal\"-a serpent with black, horselike eyes and a fifty-foot body resembling a string of barrels floating on the water. Any sailor, especially if he was young and impressionable like Thomas Nickerson, must have wondered, if only fleetingly, if this was, in fact, the best time to be heading out on a voyage around Cape Horn. <br> Nantucketers had good reason to be superstitious. Their lives were governed by a force of terrifying unpredictability-the sea. Due to a constantly shifting network of shoals, including the Nantucket Bar just off the harbor mouth, the simple act of coming to and from the island was an often harrowing and sometimes catastrophic lesson in seamanship. Particularly in winter, when storms were the most violent, wrecks occurred almost weekly. Buried throughout the island were the corpses of anonymous seamen who had washed up on its wave-thrashed shores. Nantucket, which means \"faraway land\" in the language of the island's native inhabitants, the Wampanoag, was a mound of sand eroding into an inexorable ocean, and all its residents, even if they had never left the island, were all too aware of the inhumanity of the sea. <br> Nantucket's English settlers, who began arriving in 1659, had been mindful of the sea's dangers. They had hoped to support themselves not as fishermen but as farmers and sheepherders on this grassy, pond-speckled crescent without wolves. But as the increasing size of the livestock herds, combined with the growing number of farms, threatened to transform the island into a wind-blown wasteland, Nantucketers inevitably looked seaward. <br> Every fall, hundreds of \"right whales\" appeared to the south of the island and remained until the early spring. So named because they were \"the right whale to kill,\" right whales grazed the waters off Nantucket much like seagoing cattle, straining the nutrient-rich surface of the ocean through the bushy plates of baleen in their perpetually grinning mouths. While English settlers at Cape Cod and eastern Long Island had already been hunting right whales for decades, no one on Nantucket had had the courage to pursue the whales in boats. Instead they left the harvesting of whales that washed up onto the shore (known as drift whales) to the Wampanoag. <br> Around 1690, a group of Nantucketers was standing on a hill overlooking the ocean where some whales were spouting and playing with one another. One of the onlookers nodded toward the whales and the ocean beyond. \"There,\" he asserted, \"is a green pasture where our children's grandchildren will go for bread.\" In fulfillment of his prophecy, a Cape Codder by the name of Ichabod Paddock was soon thereafter lured across Nantucket Sound to instruct the islanders in the art of killing whales. <br> Their first boats were only twenty feet long, and they launched them from the beaches along the island's south shore. Typically a whaleboat's crew was comprised of five Wampanoag oarsmen, with a single white Nantucketer at the steering oar. Once they'd killed the whale, they towed it back to the beach, where they removed the blubber and boiled it into oil. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, English Nantucketers had instituted a system of debt servitude that provided them with a steady supply of Wampanoag labor. Without the island's native inhabitants, who outnumbered Nantucket's white population well into the 1720s, the island would never have become a successful whaling port. <br> In the year 1712, a Captain Hussey, cruising in his little boat for right whales along Nantucket's south shore, was blown out to sea in a fierce northerly gale. Many miles out, he glimpsed several whales of a type he had never seen before. Unlike a right whale's vertical spout, this whale's spout arched forward. In spite of the high winds and rough seas, Hussey managed to harpoon and kill one of the whales, its blood and oil stilling the waves in an almost biblical fashion. This creature, Hussey quickly realized, was a sperm whale, one of which had washed up on the island's southwest shore only a few years before. Not only was the oil derived from the sperm whale's blubber far superior to that of the right whale, providing a brighter and cleaner-burning light, but its block-shaped head contained a vast reservoir of even better oil, called spermaceti, that could be simply ladled into an awaiting cask. (It was spermaceti's resemblance to seminal fluid that gave rise to the sperm whale's name.) The sperm whale might be faster and more aggressive than the right whale, but it was far more enriching. With no other means of support, Nantucketers dedicated themselves to the single-minded pursuit of the sperm whale, and they soon outstripped their whaling rivals on the mainland and Long Island. <br> By 1760, the Nantucketers had practically wiped out the local whale population. But no matter-by that point they had enlarged their whaling sloops and equipped them with brick tryworks capable of processing the oil on the open ocean. Now, since it would not need to return to port as often to deliver bulky blubber, their fleet had a far greater range. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, Nantucketers had made it to the verge of the Arctic Circle, to the west coast of Africa, the east coast of South America, and as far south as the Falkland Islands. <br> In a speech before Parliament in 1775, the British statesman Edmund Burke looked to the island's inhabitants as the leaders of a new American breed-a \"recent people\" whose success in whaling had exceeded the collective might of all of Europe. Living on an island that was almost the same distance from the mainland as England was from France, Nantucketers developed a British sense of themselves as a distinct and superior people, privileged citizens of what Ralph Waldo Emerson called the \"Nation of Nantucket.\" <br> The Revolution and the War of 1812, when the British navy marauded offshore shipping, proved disastrous to the whale fishery. Fortunately, Nantucketers possessed enough capital and inherent whaling expertise to survive these trials. By 1819, Nantucket was well on its way to reclaiming and, as the whalers ventured into the Pacific, even surpassing its former glory. But the rise of the Pacific sperm-whale fishery had an unfortunate side effect. Instead of voyages that had once averaged about nine months, two- and three-year voyages had become the norm. Never before had the division between Nantucket's whalemen and their people been so great. Long gone were the days when Nantucketers could watch from shore as the men and boys of the island pursued the whale. Nantucket was now the whaling capital of the world, but there were more than a few islanders who had never even seen a whale. <br> In the summer of 1819 people were still talking about the time when, nine years earlier, a pod of right whales was spotted to the north of the island. Whaleboats were quickly dispatched. A crowd gathered on shore to watch in fascination as two whales were killed and towed back into the harbor. For the people of Nantucket, it was an epiphany. Here at last were two of the creatures they had heard so much about, creatures upon which their livelihood depended. One of the whales was pulled up onto the wharf, and before the day was out, thousands of people-including, perhaps, the five-year-old Thomas Nickerson-had come to see it. One can only imagine the intensity of the Nantucketers' curiosity as they peered at the giant creature, and poked and prodded it, and said to themselves, \"So this is it.\" <br> Nantucket had created an economic system that no longer depended on the island's natural resources. The island's soil had long since been exhausted by overfarming. Nantucket's large Wampanoag population had been reduced to a handful by epidemics, forcing shipowners to look to the mainland for crew. Whales had almost completely disappeared from local waters. And still the Nantucketers prospered. As one visitor observed, the island had become a \"barren sandbank, fertilized with whale-oil only.\" <br> Throughout the seventeenth century, English Nantucketers resisted all attempts to establish a church on the island, partly because a woman by the name of Mary Coffin Starbuck forbade it. It was said that nothing of consequence was done on Nantucket without Mary's approval. Mary Coffin and Nathaniel Starbuck had been the first English couple to be married on the island, in 1662, and had established a lucrative outpost for trading with the Wampanoag. Whenever an itinerant minister came to Nantucket looking to establish a congregation, he was firmly rebuffed by Mary Starbuck. Then, in 1702, Mary succumbed to a charismatic Quaker minister named John Richardson. Speaking before a group assembled in the Starbucks' living room, Richardson succeeded in moving Mary to tears. It was Mary Starbuck's conversion to Quakerism that established the unique fusion of spirituality and covetousness that would make possible Nantucket's rise as a whaling port. <br> Quakers or, more properly, members of the Society of Friends, depended on their own experience of God's presence, the \"Inner Light,\" for guidance rather than relying on a Puritan minister's interpretation of scripture. But Nantucket's ever growing number of Quakers were hardly free-thinking individuals. Friends were expected to conform to rules of behavior determined during yearly meetings, encouraging a sense of community that was as carefully controlled as that of any New England society. If there was a difference, it was the Quaker belief in pacifism and a conscious spurning of worldly ostentation-two principles that were not intended to interfere, in any way, with a person's ability to make money. Instead of building fancy houses or buying fashionable clothes, Nantucket's Quakers reinvested their profits in the whale fishery. As a result, they were able to weather the downturns that laid to waste so many mainland whaling merchants, and Mary Starbuck's children, along with their Macy and Coffin cousins, quickly established a Quaker whaling dynasty. <br> Nantucketers saw no contradiction between their livelihood and their religion. God Himself had granted them dominion over the fishes of the sea. Peleg Folger, a Nantucket whaleman turned Quaker elder, expressed it in verse: </p> <p>Thou didst, O Lord, create the mighty whale,<br> That wondrous monster of a mighty length;<br> Vast is his head and body, vast his tail,<br> Beyond conception his unmeasured strength.<br></p> <p>But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain<br> That we, poor feeble mortals should engage<br> (Ourselves, our wives and children to maintain),<br> This dreadful monster with a martial rage.</p> <p> Even if Nantucket's Quakers dominated the island economically and culturally, room was made for others, and by the early nineteenth century there were two Congregational church towers bracketing the town north and south. Yet all shared in a common, spiritually infused mission-to maintain a peaceful life on land while raising bloody havoc at sea. Pacifist killers, plain-dressed millionaires, the whalemen of Nantucket were simply fulfilling the Lord's will.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,345068,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Chapter one: Nantucket (part one) It was, he later remembered, \"the most pleasing moment of my life\" - the moment he stepped aboard the whaleship Essex for the first time. He was fourteen years old, with a broad nose and an open, eager face, and like every other Nantucket boy, he'd been taught to \"idolize the form of a ship.\" The Essex might not look like much, stripped of her rigging and chained to the wharf, but for Thomas Nickerson she was a vessel of opportunity. Finally, after what had seemed an endless wait, Nickerson was going to sea. The hot July sun beat down on her old, oil-soaked timbers until the temperature below was infernal, but Nickerson explored every cranny, from the brick altar of the tryworks being assembled on deck to the lightless depths of the empty hold. In between was a creaking, compartmentalized world, a living thing of oak and pine that reeked of oil, blood, tobacco juice, food, salt, mildew, tar, and smoke. \"[B]lack and ugly as she was,\" Nickerson wrote, \"I would not have exchanged her for a palace.\" In July of 1819 the Essex was one of a fleet of more than seventy Nantucket whaleships in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. With whale-oil prices steadily climbing and the rest of the world's economy sunk in depression, the village of Nantucket was on its way to becoming one of the richest towns in America. The community of about seven thousand people lived on a gently sloping hill crowded with houses and topped by windmills and church towers. It resembled, some said, the elegant and established port of Salem-a remarkable compliment for an island more than twenty miles out into the Atlantic, below Cape Cod. But if the town, high on its hill, radiated an almost ethereal quality of calm, the waterfront below bustled with activity. Sprouting from among the long, low warehouses and ropewalks, four solid-fill wharves reached out more than a hundred yards into the harbor. Tethered to the wharves or anchored in the harbor were, typically, fifteen to twenty whaleships, along with dozens of smaller vessels, mainly sloops and schooners, that brought trade goods to and from the island. Each wharf, a labyrinth of anchors, try-pots, spars, and oil casks, was thronged with sailors, stevedores, and artisans. Two-wheeled, horse-drawn carts known as calashes continually came and went. It was a scene already familiar to Thomas Nickerson. The children of Nantucket had long used the waterfront as their playground. They rowed decrepit whaleboats up and down the harbor and clambered up into the rigging of the ships. To off-islanders it was clear that these children were a \"distinctive class of juveniles, accustomed to consider themselves as predestined mariners.... They climbed ratlines like monkeys-little fellows of ten or twelve years-and laid out on the yardarms with the most perfect nonchalance.\" The Essex might be Nickerson's first ship, but he had been preparing for the voyage almost his entire life. He wasn't going alone. His friends Barzillai Ray, Owen Coffin, and Charles Ramsdell, all between the ages of fifteen and eighteen, were also sailing on the Essex. Owen Coffin was the cousin of the Essex's new captain and probably steered his three friends to his kinsman's ship. Nickerson was the youngest of the group. The Essex was old and, at 87 feet long and 238 tons displacement, quite small, but she had a reputation on Nantucket as a lucky ship. Over the last decade and a half, she had done well by her Quaker owners, regularly returning at two-year intervals with enough oil to make them wealthy men. Daniel Russell, her previous captain, had been successful enough over the course of four voyages to be given command of a new and larger ship, the Aurora. Russell's promotion allowed the former first mate, George Pollard, Jr., to take over command of the Essex, and one of the boatsteerers (or harpooners), Owen Chase, to move up to first mate. Three other crew members were elevated to the rank of boatsteerer. Not only a lucky but apparently a happy vessel, the Essex was, according to Nickerson, \"on the whole rather a desirable ship than otherwise.\" Since Nantucket was, like any seafaring town of the period, a community obsessed with omens and signs, such a reputation counted for much. Still, there was talk among the men on the wharves when earlier that July, as the Essex was being repaired and outfitted, a comet appeared in the night sky. Nantucket was a town of roof dwellers.

      "body": "<p> Students with top A-level grades should be selected for Oxbridge by lottery to improve the intake from state schools, an expert in education assessment has told MPs. </p> <p>Researchers into university admissions also told the House of Commons education committee that the Oxbridge interview system should be abandoned to reduce bias. </p> <p>The radical proposals came yesterday as the government unveiled \u00a320m for university access initiatives as part of the comprehensive spending review. </p> <p>The funds will pay for university summer schools for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, better links between academics and teachers, new recruitment officers and improvements to admissions programmes. </p> <p>Universities which submit plans for annual improvements in accessibility will get more cash from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. </p> <p>The new money for access and the MPs' inquiry into admissions have emerged in the wake of the Laura Spence controversy, when Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, accused Oxford University of elitism after it turned down the state school sixth-former. </p> <p>Yesterday, head of the education school at King's College, London, Professor Dylan Wiliam, told the MPs that unless universities could show that admissions procedures were fair, they should pick well-qualified students at random. Professor Wiliam said that entrants would be chosen from a pool of students with high grades but state school students would not need to show such high grades - a reflection of their propensity to secure better degrees. </p> <p>Wiliam's research has shown that grades often bear little resemblance to the true academic abilities of students measured by continuous assessment. He also told the committee that other research suggests that state school students with three Bs at A-level have the same academic ability as private school pupils with three As who benefit from extra resources and learning alongside other bright pupils. In the US, universities place more onus on a student's final school grades, irrespective of how they compare to national scores. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Dr Gerry McCrum told the MPs that Oxford University \"is not doing as well as it ought\" in attracting students from all backgrounds. \"My solution would be to do away with the interview and just use A-levels,\" he said. His research has shown that pupils from private schools are twice as likely as state school students to secure places at Oxford and Cambridge even with comparable grades.

      "bodyText": "Students with top A-level grades should be selected for Oxbridge by lottery to improve the intake from state schools, an expert in education assessment has told MPs. Researchers into university admissions also told the House of Commons education committee that the Oxbridge interview system should be abandoned to reduce bias. The radical proposals came yesterday as the government unveiled \u00a320m for university access initiatives as part of the comprehensive spending review. The funds will pay for university summer schools for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, better links between academics and teachers, new recruitment officers and improvements to admissions programmes. Universities which submit plans for annual improvements in accessibility will get more cash from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The new money for access and the MPs' inquiry into admissions have emerged in the wake of the Laura Spence controversy, when Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, accused Oxford University of elitism after it turned down the state school sixth-former. Yesterday, head of the education school at King's College, London, Professor Dylan Wiliam, told the MPs that unless universities could show that admissions procedures were fair, they should pick well-qualified students at random. Professor Wiliam said that entrants would be chosen from a pool of students with high grades but state school students would not need to show such high grades - a reflection of their propensity to secure better degrees. Wiliam's research has shown that grades often bear little resemblance to the true academic abilities of students measured by continuous assessment. He also told the committee that other research suggests that state school students with three Bs at A-level have the same academic ability as private school pupils with three As who benefit from extra resources and learning alongside other bright pupils. In the US, universities place more onus on a student's final school grades, irrespective of how they compare to national scores. Meanwhile, Dr Gerry McCrum told the MPs that Oxford University \"is not doing as well as it ought\" in attracting students from all backgrounds. \"My solution would be to do away with the interview and just use A-levels,\" he said. His research has shown that pupils from private schools are twice as likely as state school students to secure places at Oxford and Cambridge even with comparable grades. Dr McCrum described the final stages of the Oxford selection process as a 'black art'. Cambridge has overtaken Oxford as the most socially exclusive university in the country, according to the latest breakdown of figures for student admissions unveiled in the Guardian this week. In 1998-99, over 80% of Cambridge undergraduate admissions comprised students from the upper and middle classes.",

Speak for yourself, matey.</p> <p>Nevertheless, let's accept that she is indeed a serene and diaphanous figure whose presence would enhance any church fete. What of her political or \"efficient\" duties? The birthday tributes are astonishingly coy on this subject. \"Not giving interviews - it's a brilliant ploy,\" Lord Bell of Belgravia writes in the Sunday Times. \"Absolutely nobody knows what she thinks about anything.\"</p> <p>What codswallop. Thanks to the recently published diaries of her friend Woodrow Wyatt, we know many of the Queen Mother's opinions. In March 1986, for instance, she tells Wyatt that when the royal family are alone together they \"often drink a toast at the end of dinner to Mrs Thatcher. She adores Mrs Thatcher.\" She also adores President PW Botha of South Africa, and \"thinks it is awful how the BBC and media misrepresent everything that Botha is trying to do\".</p> <p>That summer, while lunching at Clarence House with Wyatt and Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Her Majesty delivers an unprompted rant against black Commonwealth countries which have been pressing for sanctions against South Africa. Would she mind, Wyatt wonders, if some black countries resigned from the Commonwealth in protest against Thatcher's line? \"Not at all, if that's what they want to do,\" the Queen Mother replies, briskly denouncing President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia as \"an idiot\".</p> <p>A few months before the 1987 election, a nervous Queen Mum asks Wyatt for reassurance that the Tories will stay in power. As he writes, \"she is much more pro-Conservative than the Queen or the Prince of Wales\". She is also opposed to female ordination, since \"the women who wanted to be priests all seem so aggressive\".</p> <p>After a discussion on the war crimes bill, Wyatt records, \"We talked about Jews for a bit and she said she liked them very much but they were a separate people and a strange people, keeping to themselves and their own ways. She clearly has some reservations about Jews in her old-fashioned English way.\"</p> <p>Other \"reservations\" surface in these chats with her confidant. \"Actually, she doesn't really like the French very much at all,\" Wyatt writes in March 1991. Later in the year they talk about the European Community. \"She is terrified of the Germans, and said, 'Never trust them, never trust them. They can't be trusted.' I thought that quite amusing as the Royal Family is of German origin.\"</p> <p>In revealing the Queen Mother as a rightwing xenophobe, Lord Wyatt's diaries merely confirm what we always suspected. Still, it is rather surprising that this useful corroborative source hasn't been mentioned in any of the \"special supplements\" and \"souvenir magazines\" that purport to tell us what she is really like.</p> <p>There is an even more striking omission. Right up until the start of the second world war, the then Queen was an enthusiastic appeaser of Hitler. Yet the word appeasement has appeared in none of the lengthy articles by supposedly serious historians over the past few days. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Andrew Roberts maintains that she, along with Winston Churchill, came \"to symbolise Britain's determination to withstand Hitler and eventually to conquer him\".</p> <p>Roberts should re-read his own book Eminent Churchillians, published in 1994. In a most instructive chapter titled The House of Windsor and the Politics of Appeasement, he observed that the Queen and King \"failed to make the mental leap necessary to appreciate that feeding the Nazi beast whetted its appetite, and that only a firm stance early on could have averted war. They represented the most unprepossessing aspects of conventional wisdom, at precisely the time when it was proving dangerously mistaken\". Nor was she \"noticeably concerned by the plight of the Nazis' victims, considering a country's internal political arrangements to be her own affair\".</p> <p>In his gawd-bless-yer-ma'am essay last weekend, Roberts cited a state visit to France in July 1938 as an example of her high diplomatic skills. \"With the deteriorating international situation of the late 1930s it was vital for Britain's allies and potential allies to be as well disposed towards her as possible in the event of war. She performed superbly.\" Er, not quite. As Roberts pointed out in Eminent Churchillians, the Queen's behaviour in Paris led the French prime minister, Edouard Daladier, to conclude that she was \"an excessively ambitious young woman who would be ready to sacrifice every other country in the world so that she may remain Queen\".</p> <p>This seemed to be borne out by her subsequent intrigues. When Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich on September 30 1938, he was driven straight from Heston aerodrome to Buckingham Palace - where, by royal invitation, he stood alongside the King and Queen on the balcony to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd. John Grigg once described this photo opportunity, which took place before Parliament could debate or vote on the Munich agreement, as \"the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century\". In December 1938, the pro-appeasement Times produced Christmas cards bearing an \"exclusive souvenir photo\" of the balcony scene in which the King and Queen endorsed the PM's abandonment of Czechoslovakia. The same photograph is, however, conspicuously absent from all the lavishly illustrated brochures marking the Queen Mother's \"100 Glorious Years\".</p> <p>Is it unfair to blame her for the actions of her husband? Not at all. It was she who led the royal campaign in favour of Neville Chamberlain and against Winston Churchill, whom she loathed. At a Buckingham Palace dinner in the summer of 1939, Chamberlain was seated between the Queen and the Duchess of Kent, both of whom spent the evening urging him forcefully not to bring Churchill into the government.</p> <p>Anyone who doubted the wisdom or morality of appeasement - including the King's private secretary, Sir Alexander Hardinge - was regarded as an enemy. Following Hardinge's eventual resignation, the diplomat Oliver Harvey wrote in his diary that \"there has been friction for some time (beginning from Munich and NC), largely caused by the Queen, who was determined to get him out. The King is fundamentally a weak character and certainly a rather stupid one. The Queen is a strong one out of a rather reactionary stable.\"</p> <p>When Churchill took charge in May 1940, she was appalled. In a handwritten letter of condolence to Chamberlain, she revealed \"how deeply I regretted your ceasing to be our prime minister. I can never tell you in words how much we owe you. We felt so safe with the knowledge that your wisdom and high purpose were there at our hand.\" Referring to the war, she added: \"You did all in your power to stave off such agony and you were right.\"</p> <p>As Roberts admitted in his book, \"she clearly felt little need to maintain even the fiction of royal impartiality in politics\". Which is more than can be said for the household cavalry of constitutional historians and political leaders who are now peddling that same feeble fiction all over again.

      "bodyText": "A diverse series of protests coordinated over the internet threatens to disrupt the opening of the Olympics in Sydney in September. Internet activists are passing on the tactics and techniques developed during the successful cyber protests against the World Trade Organisation in Seattle last year and against the World Bank in Washington in April. The Sydney Alternative Media Centre, which is being launched this week, is the latest radical Australian website modelled on those used to plan and publicise the protests in Seattle and Washington, as well as the recent demonstration in Whitehall. The parliament of New South Wales has passed temporary laws to try to keep tight control of the Olympic stadiums. The regulations outlaw the unauthorised assembly of people and give controversial \"temporary enforcement officers\" police powers to instantly remove from the designated Olympic areas people deemed to be causing \"annoyance\". But the control of cyberspace may prove more difficult. Groups including aborigines, anarchists and local people protesting about recent rent increases, as landlords cash in on the anticipated 340,000 tourists visiting the city for the Games, plan to use the internet to help organise an unauthorised demonstration during the opening ceremony on September 15. Four days before that, ambitious \"S11\" demonstrations against a World Economic Forum meeting in Melbourne will provide a test for many anti-capitalist activists - and for the Australian police. Meanwhile, activist sites are urging protesters to target many of the Olympic sponsors, including Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Unilever and IBM. And it was reported last week that hackers also plan to sabotage the official Olympic website, which has three servers in the US and one in Australia. On Sunday, the Sydney branch of the Independent Media Centre, one of the most successful Seattle sites, is to train volunteers to upload video and audio footage, and photographs, on to its website, to enable instant, unofficial coverage of potential protests. \"We'll be a reality channel you can turn on,\" said an activist calling himself Predator, who claimed to represent the Independent Media Centre. \"Want to post stories about the Olympics, but with a different take to the blind praise and glorification dished out by CNN/MSN? Welcome aboard.\" Protesters see the Games as an embodiment of the excesses of global capitalism. \"The International Olympic Committee is the final stage of corporate evolution,\" said Predator. \"They don't produce anything, they redirect local resources to further their own ends, they ignore the needs of the global citizenry and they use the corporate media to distribute their aims.\" \"The anti-Olympic movement has been able to broaden its appeal through the use of the internet,\" said Helen Jefferson Lenskyj, professor of sociology at the University of Toronto, who has spent five months in Sydney researching the Olympic industry. Most of the demonstrations at the Sydney Olympics are likely to focus on the failure of the Australian government to complete a reconciliation with the aboriginal community, Prof Lenskyj said. \"Many groups want to put the world spotlight on white Australia's record of racism, so the radical left are more than happy to put that at the top of their agenda,\" she said. \"But it is the local housing issues that obviously affect low-income people - aborigines, immigrants and the homeless - more.\" Ray Jackson, a spokesman for the Indigenous Social Justice Association, said that although a group called the Anti-Olympic Alliance was trying to provide an umbrella organisation, overall control of the protests was impossible. \"What action takes place depends entirely on the security forces who will be lined up against us in an effort to prevent us from entering the Olympic site and camping in Bicentennial Park for the duration of the Games,\" he said. www.olympics.com/eng Sydney 2000: official site www.samcentre.org Sydney Alternative Media Centre www.sydney.indymedia.org Sydney Independent Media Centre www.cat.org.au/aoa Anti-Olympic Alliance www.s11.org World Economic Forum protest",

In the words of the review report, \"surface image is sometimes greater than substance\". Social services in Birmingham reflects a \"gap between policy and procedures and the reality of practice on the ground\". Clarity of vision and a sense of direction are both lacking. </p> <p>The review was one of a series being carried out by the audit commission and the government's social services inspectorate. Although the report is by no means the most damning produced so far, the size of Birmingham (a \u00a3223m social services budget last year) and the consistency of Labour control (unchanged since 1984) give the findings special significance. </p> <p>The city council, which received a draft of yesterday's report in April and had verbal feedback from the review team last December, is pointing to a series of changes being made under the leadership of Sandra Taylor, appointed social services director late last year. </p> <p>Sir Michael Lyons, the council's chief executive, says: \"We accept that there is a big job to do within the authority: it is one of the most important facing us over the next two years. The report acknowledges the strong, corporate framework within the authority, which will ensure the social services department can rely on the full support of myself and other senior colleagues to work together to achieve change.\" </p> <p>The review was carried out last November and December and the team was led by Dennis Simpson, former social services director of Southwark, south London. Quality of services was found to be highly variable, with some rated very good and others giving \"serious concern\", although a questionnaire sent to more than 400 users and carers found that 72% thought services excellent or very good and only 6% thought them poor - one of the most positive scores of any joint review to date. </p> <p>According to the review team, the commitment of frontline staff is not in doubt. The authority needs to harness the undoubted energy of the majority in order better to focus their skills and achieve more consistent results. While services for people with mental health problems are relatively robust, and those for elderly people have been the subject of much policy initiative, services for people with learning disabilities have \"lost focus\" and those for children and families demand \"instant attention and quick corrective action\". </p> <p>At the time of the review, 175 children in care - one in 10 of all those \"looked after\" - were unallocated to a social worker. Thirty had been unallocated for more than a year. Some 25% of those in care did not have a care plan and 30% were overdue for a statutory six-month case review. </p> <p>Child protection has wrongly been given priority over looked-after children, the report says. Birmingham has proportionally fewer children in foster care than any comparable authority and more children in residential care than all but one. The quality of care in children's homes is \"questionable\". Even so, child protection work is \"still less than robust\". </p> <p>What typifies the council's problems, the report argues, is the length of time often taken to translate policies into practice: although consultants were commissioned in 1994 to review the social services computer strategy, the new system they recommended is still being piloted; similarly, concerns about children's homes were raised in the early 1990s, yet a strategy has emerged only in the past year. </p> <p>The review team notes that Taylor, who moved from the equivalent post in Leicester, agreed with much of its analysis. She's promising a \"dramatic\" increase in numbers of staff in child protection teams; \"major work\" to reshape children's residential services; improved training and greater oversight of practice on the ground, including development of a peripatetic expert team. There will also be a raft of new senior staff for the social services department, including a head of performance. </p> <p>\"It is a challenging agenda and cannot be achieved overnight,\" says Taylor. \"I am nevertheless convinced that the necessary changes can be made.\" </p> <p>The joint review team is evidently less convinced.

That's the official verdict of a national overview report published today, based on returns from all 150 English social services authorities. </p> <p> John Hutton, social care minister, writes in a foreword to the report that \"significant improvements\" have been made over the past year in areas such as collection and use of management information. \"And there is evidence that this is beginning to translate into improved experiences and outcomes for children.\" </p> <p> Progress, however, is relative. Today's report comes hard on the heels of findings by the government's social services inspectorate (SSI) that children from ethnic minorities are failing to get services that meet their needs. Of a sample eight authorities inspected, only one had \"taken race equality issues seriously\". </p> <p> The answer to this apparent para dox, it seems, is that authorities are heading in the right direction but that, in many places, this is manifest in terms of process rather than practice. As Diana Robbins, author of the Quality Protects (QP) report, puts it: \"The year two evaluation of QP has been described as producing a mountain of paper. But the top of the mountain provides the clearest possible view of councils moving, with their partners, towards providing better services for children and their families.\" </p> <p> Though the evaluation is the second of its kind, it covers the first year of QP funding through the children's services grant worth \u00a3375m over three years. All 150 returns, known as management action plans (Maps), have been approved - qualifying the authorities for their share of next year's funding - and eight singled out as being of particularly high quality: Blackpool, Manchester, Portsmouth, Stockton-on-Tees, Suffolk, Tameside in Greater Manchester and Wandsworth and Westminster in London. Each of the eight achieved an overall \"very good\" rating of three on a four-point scale. </p> <p> At Blackpool, QP co-ordinator Sue White says having to address the agenda has given the authority an opportunity to go back to basics and take a hard look at children's services across the board. As a new, unitary council created in 1998, it had the distinct advantage of no \"history\", but the disadvantage of having lost a lot of key staff who had stayed with Lancashire. It also had the special challenge of a transient population including many vulnerable families. </p> <p> \"We started off with a clean slate and we set out to work together from day one,\" says White. \"The key thing was that we had an assistant director for children's services, Daphne Sanders, who had a clear vision of how we should deliver QP and everybody bought into that vision. It's had an effect on every aspect of children's services and led into other areas of the department as well.\" </p> <p> Blackpool is praised in the report for staging a strategy conference to draw everybody into the QP process. Implementation has included greatly improving the council's own children's homes; boosting recruitment and quality control of foster carers, while introducing a fostering payment scheme; and applying fresh approaches to adoption, services for disabled children and use of private sector placements. </p> <p> Overall, the report, Tracking Progress in Children's Services, finds \"huge\" improvement in authorities' capacity to monitor and report performance on children's services. This, among other things, means that the report can make the first national estimate of the number of young people receiving services under the Children Act - 330,000. The report also notes marked progress in involving children themselves in the design, delivery and evaluation of services, and in the involvement of councillors in strategic thinking and governance. </p> <p> The indifference to children's services shown by many councillors came as a shock to officials and ministers involved in the planning of QP. A series of seminars has been staged to tackle this, but an unpublished survey for the Department of Health by research group Mori is believed to show that a huge impact was made by a letter to councils from Frank Dobson, when he was health secretary, reminding elected members in no uncertain terms of their responsibilities as corporate parents of children in care. </p> <p> On the down side, the report finds less progress in involving children in decisions about their own care. Only a quarter of councils are said to be making good ground in this area. Robbins, an independent consultant, warns that \"until an approach to looked after children based on partnership with them becomes more entrenched in the day-to-day practice of social work with children, the most earnest aspirations set by councils could be subverted by non-compliance or, more simply, by reliance on traditional methods\". </p> <p> Disappointment is also expressed at the \"slippage\" in QP programmes, amounting to almost 4% of budgeted expenditure in 1999-2000. A key fac tor in this was the trouble experienced by authorities in recruiting staff: the report comments on \"the difficulty experienced everywhere in finding the right people to fill all the new posts which QP plans required\". </p> <p> Summing up, Robbins concludes: \"Progress is real, and in the most advanced councils this progress is being seen and measured.\" She admits, however, that many achievements remain concerned with process, rather than demonstrable improvement in children's lives. \"Few councils have yet reached the point of both being able to identify, implement and monitor a strategy for change, and then demonstrate the effect of that change in terms of outcomes.\" </p> <p> So the SSI, inspecting services for ethnic minority children between April and November last year, found that most authorities were still not well placed to deliver care and support appropriate to their needs. While councils did have anti-racist and equal opportunities policies and strategies, there was \"little evidence\" of their implementation. \"Many authorities,\" says the inspection report, \"talked about 'mainstreaming' the issues, but in practice this often meant that they were ignored\". </p> <p> The report, Excellence Not Excuses, looks at services in Buckinghamshire, Leicestershire, Liverpool, Sheffield, Wolverhampton and three authorities in London - Islington, Southwark and Hammersmith and Fulham. It says that \"in some instances, the safety of ethnic minority children was being compromised because physical and sexual abuse had not been identified and properly dealt with as a child protection issue\". </p> <p> Hutton is warning that, in the wake of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry and the subsequent Macpherson report, the government expects authorities to be acutely sensitive to the challenges of meeting the needs of ethnic minority children and families. \"This report has flagged up some very serious issues that must be addressed,\" he says. \"We need to see real improvement in services in these areas.\"</p>",

The report, Excellence Not Excuses, looks at services in Buckinghamshire, Leicestershire, Liverpool, Sheffield, Wolverhampton and three authorities in London - Islington, Southwark and Hammersmith and Fulham. It says that \"in some instances, the safety of ethnic minority children was being compromised because physical and sexual abuse had not been identified and properly dealt with as a child protection issue\". Hutton is warning that, in the wake of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry and the subsequent Macpherson report, the government expects authorities to be acutely sensitive to the challenges of meeting the needs of ethnic minority children and families. \"This report has flagged up some very serious issues that must be addressed,\" he says. \"We need to see real improvement in services in these areas.\"",

According to reports in Portuguese sports daily O Jogo (Portuguese for The Water Holding Receptacle), Maric will definitely be signing for Porto in the near future for a surprisingly high fee of \u00a32m. Heck, they even printed pictures of him dining in a Porto restaurant to prove it. However, given the nature of the Croat's stay on Tyneside, Newcastle fans might be forgiven for not counting their chickens until they've hatched.

Basically bought by Ruud Gullit as a replacement for Rob Lee, Maric managed to start only 17 games in a season and a half, scoring two goals (both against FC Zurich). Maric has spent most of his time outside the first team squad, and has been up for sale since January - when a return to Croatia Zagreb fell through because the club couldn't afford him. He then bunked Newcastle's post-season trip to the Caribbean, and stuck his neck into the whole transport debate by declaring that Britons drive on the wrong side of the road. </p> <p> Maric has, in fact, made such an indelible contribution to the North East that it's a wonder they don't put up a statue in his honour. But it looks like selling him on for a transfer fee will have to do instead. According to a Portuguese source -mmm, madeira - \"The player arrived yesterday and the deal is done. It's now just a matter of him passing his medical.\" So let's just hope that Silvio flourishes in Portugal once more. You never know, he might earn himself a move back to the Premiership. </p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY </strong></p> <p> \"They have visas for six months and if they want to see England, they will see it. I am sure they will come back within six months. They have done nothing wrong\" - The president of Bradford's Intertoto Cup opponents, FC Atlantas of Lithuania, on 22 fans who have disappeared since last week's match at Valley Parade. The Daily Mail are believed to have someone on the case already. </p> <p><strong>FOR FERG'S SAKE </strong></p> <p> The Imperial Lord Ferg has always been a fount of ideas. Signing Ralph Milne was one. As was playing Ryan Giggs on the right wing in Big Cup final. As was bitching about former friends and colleagues in his autobiography. So why he would need to call on his sons for advice on his retirement plans is anyone's guess. But he did, and you, the valiant Fiver readership, have not been shy in suggesting what they were suggesting. If you see what we're saying. </p> <p> According to a man rummaging through rubbish on Bournemouth pier - brought to the Fiver by way of Andrew Palmer - Ferg will plough all his spare hours into a new dotcom venture. Scotfree.com will be a database of \"convincing excuses for those accused of traffic and minor criminal offences\". Which sounds great. </p> <p> Elsewhere, W Clayton believes that the High Lord will help out Britain's over-stretched air traffic control industry by \"standing on top of high structures to warn away aeroplanes with his red face\". Brendan Higgins, meanwhile, foresees a venture into another troubled industry, as Ferg helps out farmers by \"milking bulls\". </p> <p> Surely the options are endless, especially if Ferg doesn't decide to become the new Taggart (as suggested by x number of readers). But it's not all japes, as some readers believe those pesky kids could be up to something. \"They're going to steal his face and pass it around themselves in order to do anything they want,\" warns Ric Bradley, while Neil Gage is convinced that young Darren Ferg \"is patenting his idea of working his nuts off when coming up to contract negotiations and then doing bugger all for the next two years\". </p> <p> Only (an infinitely-prolonged period of injury) time will tell, we guess. </p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL </strong></p> <p> Spurs have denied that David Ginola is set for a move back to France with Marseille. \"It is not true. We haven't spoken to anyone directly at Marseille,\" said David Pleat earlier today. </p> <p> Wimbledon have put Paul Merson at the top of their summer shopping list. The club's owner Bjorn Rune Gjelsten said: \"Terry [Burton, the Dons' manager] has given me a list of names and Paul Merson is one of them.\" </p> <p> Aston Villa are believed to be interested in signing Juninho, 18 months after a prospective move to the club fell apart over the Brazilian's wage demands. </p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF </strong></p> <p> Juventus have denied that Zinedine Zidane is about to join Real Madrid or Barcelona. A club spokesman said: \"Zidane belongs to Juve. He is still under contract and will begin the season with us.\" </p> <p> Steve Archibald is on the verge of completing his takeover of Airdrie after provisional liquidators KPMG confirmed him as preferred bidder for the club. </p> <p> The FA have passed on information to the fraud squad to help with an investigation into the financial affairs of Hull City. </p> <p> Giorgi Kinkladze is expected to miss Derby's first two Premiership matches of the season against Southampton and Newcastle after successfully undergoing a hernia operation yesterday. </p> <p> Bolton have signed Birmingham full-back Simon Charlton under the Bosman ruling. Charlton, 29, has agreed a two-year deal. </p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO </strong></p> <p> Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (7pm)<br>Games and boats and planes. </p> <p> Six-a-side Football - Live (7.30pm, 1.30am)<br>The Manchester Masters.

He then bunked Newcastle's post-season trip to the Caribbean, and stuck his neck into the whole transport debate by declaring that Britons drive on the wrong side of the road. Maric has, in fact, made such an indelible contribution to the North East that it's a wonder they don't put up a statue in his honour. But it looks like selling him on for a transfer fee will have to do instead. According to a Portuguese source -mmm, madeira - \"The player arrived yesterday and the deal is done. It's now just a matter of him passing his medical.\" So let's just hope that Silvio flourishes in Portugal once more. You never know, he might earn himself a move back to the Premiership. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"They have visas for six months and if they want to see England, they will see it. I am sure they will come back within six months. They have done nothing wrong\" - The president of Bradford's Intertoto Cup opponents, FC Atlantas of Lithuania, on 22 fans who have disappeared since last week's match at Valley Parade. The Daily Mail are believed to have someone on the case already. FOR FERG'S SAKE The Imperial Lord Ferg has always been a fount of ideas. Signing Ralph Milne was one. As was playing Ryan Giggs on the right wing in Big Cup final. As was bitching about former friends and colleagues in his autobiography. So why he would need to call on his sons for advice on his retirement plans is anyone's guess. But he did, and you, the valiant Fiver readership, have not been shy in suggesting what they were suggesting. If you see what we're saying. According to a man rummaging through rubbish on Bournemouth pier - brought to the Fiver by way of Andrew Palmer - Ferg will plough all his spare hours into a new dotcom venture. Scotfree.com will be a database of \"convincing excuses for those accused of traffic and minor criminal offences\". Which sounds great. Elsewhere, W Clayton believes that the High Lord will help out Britain's over-stretched air traffic control industry by \"standing on top of high structures to warn away aeroplanes with his red face\". Brendan Higgins, meanwhile, foresees a venture into another troubled industry, as Ferg helps out farmers by \"milking bulls\". Surely the options are endless, especially if Ferg doesn't decide to become the new Taggart (as suggested by x number of readers). But it's not all japes, as some readers believe those pesky kids could be up to something. \"They're going to steal his face and pass it around themselves in order to do anything they want,\" warns Ric Bradley, while Neil Gage is convinced that young Darren Ferg \"is patenting his idea of working his nuts off when coming up to contract negotiations and then doing bugger all for the next two years\". Only (an infinitely-prolonged period of injury) time will tell, we guess. THE RUMOUR MILL Spurs have denied that David Ginola is set for a move back to France with Marseille. \"It is not true. We haven't spoken to anyone directly at Marseille,\" said David Pleat earlier today. Wimbledon have put Paul Merson at the top of their summer shopping list. The club's owner Bjorn Rune Gjelsten said: \"Terry [Burton, the Dons' manager] has given me a list of names and Paul Merson is one of them.\" Aston Villa are believed to be interested in signing Juninho, 18 months after a prospective move to the club fell apart over the Brazilian's wage demands. NEWS IN BRIEF Juventus have denied that Zinedine Zidane is about to join Real Madrid or Barcelona. A club spokesman said: \"Zidane belongs to Juve. He is still under contract and will begin the season with us.\" Steve Archibald is on the verge of completing his takeover of Airdrie after provisional liquidators KPMG confirmed him as preferred bidder for the club. The FA have passed on information to the fraud squad to help with an investigation into the financial affairs of Hull City. Giorgi Kinkladze is expected to miss Derby's first two Premiership matches of the season against Southampton and Newcastle after successfully undergoing a hernia operation yesterday. Bolton have signed Birmingham full-back Simon Charlton under the Bosman ruling. Charlton, 29, has agreed a two-year deal.

      "body": "<p>I've become obsessed with eggs. I cook them up by the half-dozen, hardboiled, and keep them in the fridge. I eat two for breakfast. When I get home from work, I pop another one in my mouth, smeared with mayonnaise. If I'm peckish later on, I might even have a fourth, with a sprinkle of salt, before I go to bed. </p> <p>My obsession began many weeks ago when I was travelling down in the lift from an appointment at the assisted conception unit. My boyfriend and I had been briefed about the pre-implantation genetic diagnosis procedure, and the necessity to harvest a good batch of my eggs, in the hope that at least a few would be unaffected. On the floor below, a woman wearing a white overall, her hair covered with a white net cap, entered the lift. She was carrying a large white bucket, the sort you need to mop the floor with, and on the bucket was written just two words - READY EGGS. My God, I thought, some lucky infertile woman has produced a whole bucketload of them! And they carry them around like that, without even a lid on! </p> <p>I leaned over to peer at the fine batch. I saw dozens of hardboiled eggs bobbing up and down in salted water. I had mistaken the woman's uniform. She wasn't a doctor; she worked in the canteen. She was on her way to slap together some egg mayonnaise sandwiches. Since then, all and any eggs have become symbolic of my eggs. </p> <p>There's a strong connection between food and sex. Babette's Feast, one of the most erotic films of all time, is, as far as I can remember, totally devoid of any naked flesh. The film's sensuality comes entirely from the consumption of gargantuan meals with greasy fingers. Sex and oral consumption are even confused at the infertility clinic. Just by the reception desk there's a blue icebox, the sort designed to keep beer and egg mayonnaise sandwiches cool, with \"semen samples\" written on top. </p> <p>Yet, ironically, when trying to get pregnant the simple act of eating becomes hugely problematic. We are bombarded with advice and warnings until the only thing it seems safe to swallow is a daily capsule of folic acid. I believe this heavy emphasis on a wholesome mother producing a wholesome full-term child is misguided. What you eat doesn't cause autism, what you drink doesn't cause cerebral palsy, and whatever else you do doesn't cause Down's syndrome. Despite claims of books with titles such as Planning for a Healthy Baby, there's no guarantee that little Benjamin will turn out even with all four limbs intact. But what this plethora of advice does promise is to make most early pregnancies extremely stressful. And it erroneously places the blame for any difference or disability in a child on the mother and her behaviour. </p> <p>I am still waiting to hear about intensive investigations into things outside a potential mother's control, such as my own chromosomal condition, which causes frequent miscarriages and is utterly unaffected by what I imbibe. Or into the father-to-be who must, even in the majority of IVF conceptions, provide half of the raw material. Yet the latest research project into miscarriages continues to focus on women. A national lottery grant has enabled the Miscarriage Association to commission a two-year research project to ascertain whether certain things - such as smoking, caffeine, alcohol, stress and air travel - can influence the outcome of a pregnancy. It seems that every little piece of pleasure for a would-be mother - from a glass of Chardonnay to going on holiday - is potentially harmful to her child. Better to stay home and stay sober. The only thing you are permitted to indulge in is self-blame. </p> <p>But while we have to monitor every mouthful of double espresso, it's deemed perfectly acceptable for us IVF patients to take vast amounts of drugs that make us feel nauseous. The notes accompanying my daily injection of FSH, a natural hormone, warn it makes some women suffer morning sickness. Morning sickness? But I'm not pregnant - I'm infertile and trying to get pregnant. Throughout my four pregnancies that ended in miscarriage, I vomited each morning. Now I've got morning sickness when I'm not even pregnant. Sometimes life seems very unfair. </p> <p>But generally the news is good. I had my ovaries scanned a couple of days ago, and the follicles are measuring up nicely, which suggests they're plump with eggs. In a few days time, I'm booked in for \"retrieval\", when any eggs in my fattened ovaries will be removed. I must remember to have some boiled eggs the night before, for luck. And I may well wash them down with a nice strong cup of coffee. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:leahwild@cswebmail.com\">leahwild@cswebmail.com</a></p>",

I don't think you can bring them up the same, and it's a mistake to assume you can. You should give them the same opportunities, but you've got to recognise that men get particular messages, and you've got to be responsive to that. It's very important to give the message that both are equally good - in the 70s there was this fear among some feminist mothers of male children over what they would grow up to be. I think you should talk to boys about empathy and to give them permission to have feelings. Verdict: No.</p> <p><strong> Mary Walton</strong> Mother of four, including twins Matilda and Edward<br> </p> <p>My twins don't fit into the stereotypes. Edward's speech is better than Matilda's, and he was ahead in potty-training, too. The main difference I notice is in physical energy.

      "bodyText": "Angela Neustatter Writer and feminist and mother of two sons It's not about bringing them up identically, it's about bringing them up appropriately. I don't think you can bring them up the same, and it's a mistake to assume you can. You should give them the same opportunities, but you've got to recognise that men get particular messages, and you've got to be responsive to that. It's very important to give the message that both are equally good - in the 70s there was this fear among some feminist mothers of male children over what they would grow up to be. I think you should talk to boys about empathy and to give them permission to have feelings. Verdict: No. Mary Walton Mother of four, including twins Matilda and Edward My twins don't fit into the stereotypes. Edward's speech is better than Matilda's, and he was ahead in potty-training, too. The main difference I notice is in physical energy. Edward has lots of it, and I definitely feel I have to take him out several times every day, just so he can run around. I know some people would have bought him guns and weapon toys, but I've made it clear it's not something I want. I don't think we're bringing up Edward any differently from Matilda, although I think it's very important always to respond to your children individually. Verdict: Yes.

      "body": "<p>It is the baldness of her statement that disturbs me. For a second, it almost seems funny. I am sitting on the steps of our house, reading the paper, as our youngest daughter waltzes up and down the pavement on her bike. \"Daddy, don't read,\" she says. \"You've got to watch me all the time. You know what happened to Sarah Payne.\" </p> <p>She's six years old, and not noticeably in touch with reality. I've never heard her referring to a news story before. There is no panic in her voice. Just a matter of factness. \"Someone may come and take me away if you don't watch.\" When I was her age, I was riding my bike down to the local shops, doing all sorts of messages for my mum. </p> <p>I ask her who Sarah Payne is. \"She's a little girl who was taken away, kidnapped.\" What does kidnapped mean? \"Taken away when you don't want to be, by a man.\" By now she is bored with my questioning, and hops back on her bike. </p> <p>Perhaps I'm becoming rose-tinted, but I thought it was parents who told their children about the dangers they had to be aware of, rather than the other way round. Now she's providing the information and setting out the rules. How do I respond? What if I disagree with what she says I must do to keep her safe? </p> <p>A few minutes later she tells me a bit more about Sarah - how she'd been taken away by a man in a white van, and how everyone at school is looking out for white vans driven by an odd-looking strangers. Then she is off down the street again. </p> <p>Next day I phone the Anna Freud Centre, which is chock-a-block with child psychotherapists. I have never done anything like this before, and I feel uneasy. \"Yes,\" says Julia Fabricius, the director, \"it's a tricky one isn't it? Can I ask you what you said to your daughter?\" She admits she's struggling for an answer, and isn't sure if there is one. I tell her I'm not sure what the question is. What made me feel most troubled was how calm, how clinical, my daughter's response was. Fabricius says this may well be because she doesn't understand the full enormity of it. </p> <p>\"I guess I'd try to find out where she got the information from, what she actually knows. Her version of the story may be far from the truth. Listening to what children have heard is very important.\" </p> <p>When I was a child my fears were rooted in fiction and movies - Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Oliver Twist. The fate of children who were taken and abused scared me, but I always knew they were stories. Perhaps we were more immune to the everyday horrors of the world because we weren't so saturated in media. TV was new, special, more controlled. There was a clear distinction between children's telly and adult telly, and we followed the rules. Playschool didn't segue into the news, or maybe it's that we knew to turn it off when it did. </p> <p>Steve Biddulph, psychologist and childcare expert, believes it is unhealthy for children to read, watch or listen to news until they are nine: \"Constant exposure to things they can do nothing about can create emotional agitation and even mental illness.\" He argues that it gives them a skewed vision of life because it focuses on horrors they're not equipped to deal with. Which is fair enough - but surely it gives you just as twisted a perspective if you think that life is one long lovefest. And if you're prepared to lock up your sons and daughters for their first decade, you may censor the life out of them. </p> <p>Jan Parker, co-author of Raising Happy Children, tells me of the time her then four-year-old twins were riding the roundabout at Ikea as a post-traumatic shopping treat. Halfway through the ride, Capital Radio turned into the news - the chilling court report on the trial of Fred West, detailing the murders he committed. Parker says she tried to take the kids off the roundabout, asked herself how the hell she was going to answer the children's questions. As it happens, she needn't have worried. \"They'd not taken any of it in. Because it was so far beyond their comprehension, it went straight over their heads,\" she says. </p> <p>Parker thinks the case of Sarah Payne is different: \"Most children of school age can relate to the story of another child who has been taken away.\" She says that a young girl has just knocked on the door to play with her kids, and the child's opening gambit was: \"They've found the body.\" The children talked about it, and it soon became clear they didn't really understand what this meant. One suggested the doctors could still make her better. </p> <p>Parker feels the important thing is to talk to them, set them straight, tell them enough to enable them to feel safe and to counter playground rumour: \"It helps to stress that these are extremely rare incidents and to talk with them about what they can do to if they feel threatened.\" The thing you don't want to do, says Parker, is tell them more information than they need or have requested, or suggest that behind every hedge hides a bogeyman. </p> <p>Many children will have seen yesterday's tabloids. They were almost as brutal and terrifying as Sarah's death. \"NAIL THE BASTARD\", screamed the Sun's front page. The Mirror ran a sensationalist spread picturing 22 kids who had been killed. Under the headline \"How can we stop this despicable slaughter of young children?\", Brian Reade wrote: \"I want whoever killed little Sarah to spend his life dodging razor blades in his food, needing an armed guard when he takes a shower and fearing his throat being slashed every night. Hanging these bastards really is too good for them.\" </p> <p>Now there seem to be two problems. First, how do we explain Sarah's death and, second, how do we explain the violence of the media's response? I suppose we shouldn't assume that children understand news in the way we do. They need to be told that when an incident is splashed all over the papers it is because it is unusual rather than the norm, although sometimes children seem more aware of this than we do. </p> <p>When I arrive home my daughter has more news about Sarah. \"She's dead,\" she says. \"It's really sad isn't it Daddy?\" she says. Yes, I say, it's horrible, and prepare for one of those painful conversations about why anyone could do this. But she walks off. A couple of minutes later she calls me back. \"Daddy, have you seen the fairy house I made?\" she asks.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Busy morning for Barbara Jones: almost 20 drug users now on methadone maintenance drop by for urine samples and monthly health checks. The afternoon gets quieter: by teatime, there's just a fortysomething mother being counselled for binge drinking. </p> <p>Jones, a substance abuse worker, isn't based in a crack-and-crisis inner city. Her patch, in green and billowy Shropshire, is Oswestry - a farming town quickened, you might suppose, only by market days, summer fetes and pub brawls. </p> <p>Wrong. Sleepy Shropshire is firmly fixed on the national grid set up by drug dealers who've staked out every bit of Britain as efficiently as fast-food chains. Alcohol and drug misuse is pervasive in a population of around 280,000, scattered in small towns and rural communities. To cope with the problem, the county council and the county health authority set up a multi-disciplinary substance abuse team two years ago. It's now showing high success rates, which home secretary Jack Straw no doubt hopes the government's proposed national drug treatment agency will match. </p> <p>New cases in the six months to March this year totalled 162 for alcohol, 120 for drugs, plus 27 people treated in both categories. Team manager Jon Aston says that, using the Maudsley addiction profile to monitor outcomes, 22% of drinkers quit alcohol totally and 69% cut down their intake. With drug referrals, 41% stopped using their main drug completely (47% of needle-users stopped injecting) while all the rest reduced their usage. </p> <p>At a time when local authorities are pondering a gloomy long-term future in which cutbacks could leave them with nothing more than the provision of core social services, Shropshire is showing that it pays to be bold: its scheme is innovative, entrepreneurial and expansionist. </p> <p>John Weeks, the local authority's director of social care and health, points out that while lip service is often paid to the notion of partnerships between public sector bodies, their community substance abuse team is an example of how it can work in practice. What's more, Weeks argues, it proves to a doubting Downing Street that local authorities can be trusted to implement key ministerial policies across the country. </p> <p>It shows, too, that a good commu nity scheme can be sold, literally, to other agencies: Shropshire has won a contract to provide Shrewsbury prison with specialist drug workers. </p> <p>The significant number of prisoners asking for help justified the contract, but the team went one better. The deal it proposed includes taking care of local prisoners on release if they fall back into a drink and drugs routine - as well as supporting released prisoners returning home to Shropshire from other jails. The team has also been awarded a contract to supply an arrest referral worker for drug related offences to liaise with police stations in the county. </p> <p>Other counties might shrug off drunkenness as a traditional part of rural life; they might deny that their villages are being infiltrated by drug pushers. In Shropshire, they know different. The social landscape is changing. Plumeting farm incomes lead to more instances of depression and marriage breakdowns. Even in a relatively remote and settled area there's rising teenage restlessness. </p> <p>The helpline at the team's main base - a former school in Shrewsbury - bears this out. It receives between six and 12 calls a day: from parents coming across suspicious substances in their children's bedrooms, drug users seeking help or GPs ringing mostly about patients with drink problems. \"We've got more calls as we've got more known, more credible,\" says Aston. </p> <p>The success of the mixed discipline approach is gradually giving the team confidence to expand into other areas. There are plans to recruit a specialist mental health worker on the basis that a third of people with psychiatric problems are misusing drink or drugs. \"We're also thinking of doing work with the children of parents who abuse,\" says Aston. </p> <p>Perhaps it's the innovative nature of the project, or the fact that several bodies and agencies are providing funding, but traditional barriers between professionals have dissolved pretty easily. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Keron Fletcher points out that it's far more usual for such teams to be health-led. He believes Shropshire has made its social services-led team work because it makes the most of everyone's training: social work, medical and psychological. </p> <p>Barbara Jones, who trained as a nurse, testifies that's just what happens. \"If we had one set of professional beliefs, it wouldn't be helpful,\" she says. \"But we have many different approaches. We don't always agree, but that's vital for the way we develop as a team. The dynamics are always changing, but the core values are the same; it's what we're about as human beings.\" </p> <p>Considering the workload that builds up - and the distances to be covered between centres in a sparsely-populated area - the team manages to offer a wide range of care: advice over the phone, counselling, agreeing realistic targets for quitting or reducing dependence on drugs or alcohol; working with young people; sharing care with GPs; supervising the detoxification of heavy drinkers in their own homes over a 10-day period; running a needle exchange. And when cases demand it, referrals for hospital treatment and residential care are arranged. </p> <p>Resources are stretched, but complaints about that are cheerful, not resentful, and don't open up rivalries between colleagues of different disciplines. On the drugs front, the pressure comes from easy availability creating more users. </p> <p>Tucked away in its corner, near the border with Wales, Oswestry is not immune. Drug abuse has become as common an occurrence as excessive drinking in this town of 30 pubs. </p> <p>That fortysomething binge drinker - let's call her June - says her 19-year-old son reckons it's easy to buy drugs in almost any bar. And Jones adds that most of her clients are or have been heroin users, while some are admitting that they also use crack and cocaine. \"The gap is narrowing between cannabis and heroin,\" says Jones. The lure is Liverpool: it's only an hour or so away, and some locals buy their heroin there more cheaply. </p> <p>Availability may be \"rife\", as June says, yet there's no panic.

      "bodyText": "Busy morning for Barbara Jones: almost 20 drug users now on methadone maintenance drop by for urine samples and monthly health checks. The afternoon gets quieter: by teatime, there's just a fortysomething mother being counselled for binge drinking. Jones, a substance abuse worker, isn't based in a crack-and-crisis inner city. Her patch, in green and billowy Shropshire, is Oswestry - a farming town quickened, you might suppose, only by market days, summer fetes and pub brawls. Wrong. Sleepy Shropshire is firmly fixed on the national grid set up by drug dealers who've staked out every bit of Britain as efficiently as fast-food chains. Alcohol and drug misuse is pervasive in a population of around 280,000, scattered in small towns and rural communities. To cope with the problem, the county council and the county health authority set up a multi-disciplinary substance abuse team two years ago. It's now showing high success rates, which home secretary Jack Straw no doubt hopes the government's proposed national drug treatment agency will match. New cases in the six months to March this year totalled 162 for alcohol, 120 for drugs, plus 27 people treated in both categories. Team manager Jon Aston says that, using the Maudsley addiction profile to monitor outcomes, 22% of drinkers quit alcohol totally and 69% cut down their intake. With drug referrals, 41% stopped using their main drug completely (47% of needle-users stopped injecting) while all the rest reduced their usage. At a time when local authorities are pondering a gloomy long-term future in which cutbacks could leave them with nothing more than the provision of core social services, Shropshire is showing that it pays to be bold: its scheme is innovative, entrepreneurial and expansionist. John Weeks, the local authority's director of social care and health, points out that while lip service is often paid to the notion of partnerships between public sector bodies, their community substance abuse team is an example of how it can work in practice. What's more, Weeks argues, it proves to a doubting Downing Street that local authorities can be trusted to implement key ministerial policies across the country. It shows, too, that a good commu nity scheme can be sold, literally, to other agencies: Shropshire has won a contract to provide Shrewsbury prison with specialist drug workers. The significant number of prisoners asking for help justified the contract, but the team went one better. The deal it proposed includes taking care of local prisoners on release if they fall back into a drink and drugs routine - as well as supporting released prisoners returning home to Shropshire from other jails. The team has also been awarded a contract to supply an arrest referral worker for drug related offences to liaise with police stations in the county. Other counties might shrug off drunkenness as a traditional part of rural life; they might deny that their villages are being infiltrated by drug pushers. In Shropshire, they know different. The social landscape is changing. Plumeting farm incomes lead to more instances of depression and marriage breakdowns. Even in a relatively remote and settled area there's rising teenage restlessness. The helpline at the team's main base - a former school in Shrewsbury - bears this out. It receives between six and 12 calls a day: from parents coming across suspicious substances in their children's bedrooms, drug users seeking help or GPs ringing mostly about patients with drink problems. \"We've got more calls as we've got more known, more credible,\" says Aston. The success of the mixed discipline approach is gradually giving the team confidence to expand into other areas. There are plans to recruit a specialist mental health worker on the basis that a third of people with psychiatric problems are misusing drink or drugs. \"We're also thinking of doing work with the children of parents who abuse,\" says Aston. Perhaps it's the innovative nature of the project, or the fact that several bodies and agencies are providing funding, but traditional barriers between professionals have dissolved pretty easily. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Keron Fletcher points out that it's far more usual for such teams to be health-led. He believes Shropshire has made its social services-led team work because it makes the most of everyone's training: social work, medical and psychological. Barbara Jones, who trained as a nurse, testifies that's just what happens. \"If we had one set of professional beliefs, it wouldn't be helpful,\" she says. \"But we have many different approaches. We don't always agree, but that's vital for the way we develop as a team. The dynamics are always changing, but the core values are the same; it's what we're about as human beings.\" Considering the workload that builds up - and the distances to be covered between centres in a sparsely-populated area - the team manages to offer a wide range of care: advice over the phone, counselling, agreeing realistic targets for quitting or reducing dependence on drugs or alcohol; working with young people; sharing care with GPs; supervising the detoxification of heavy drinkers in their own homes over a 10-day period; running a needle exchange. And when cases demand it, referrals for hospital treatment and residential care are arranged. Resources are stretched, but complaints about that are cheerful, not resentful, and don't open up rivalries between colleagues of different disciplines. On the drugs front, the pressure comes from easy availability creating more users. Tucked away in its corner, near the border with Wales, Oswestry is not immune. Drug abuse has become as common an occurrence as excessive drinking in this town of 30 pubs. That fortysomething binge drinker - let's call her June - says her 19-year-old son reckons it's easy to buy drugs in almost any bar. And Jones adds that most of her clients are or have been heroin users, while some are admitting that they also use crack and cocaine. \"The gap is narrowing between cannabis and heroin,\" says Jones. The lure is Liverpool: it's only an hour or so away, and some locals buy their heroin there more cheaply. Availability may be \"rife\", as June says, yet there's no panic. Jones says of her methadone patients: \"Drug use is only a tiny part of their lives. They work, they have families, they play a part in the community. They are incredibly stable people.\" However, there's one glitch in the co-operation between professionals. While shared care with GPs works very well in the rest of the county, there's a no-go situation in Oswestry, with family doctors refusing to put patients on methadone because of rogue prescribing some time ago. So a Shrewsbury doctor has to make weekly trips to patients at the team's Oswestry centre. \"There is a lot of room for development with the GPs,\" concedes Jones, \"but they are hugely helpful on the alcohol detox side.\"",

But Stephen Bubb has big plans for his new role at Acevo, the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations. By the time he gets behind his desk in September, Bubb will have begun putting some flesh on the bones of his three-year plan aimed at increasing the profile and membership of the 13-year-old organisation. </p> <p>About time too, according to some in the sector. While Acevo's activities - training, mentoring initiatives and publications, to name a few - offer support to chief executives, the organisation has yet to fulfil its potential of championing leadership within the sector. Bubb's brief will be to exploit this potential to the full. \"The charity chief executive role can be difficult, they are often out front on their own,\" he says. \"The important thing is to provide them with leadership support which is actually going to make a real contribution to the sector.\" </p> <p>Providing people with the tools they need to make a difference has been a core part of Bubb's role as director of personnel and administration at the National Lottery Charities Board (NLCB), the body established in 1994 to distribute lottery funds to voluntary organisations across the UK. He was there from day one, recruiting senior management, setting up the admin and human resource systems, finding and fitting out 17 offices across the country and establishing a grant application system. Bubb also established a leadership programme for senior managers. </p> <p>\"Having been involved right at the start of the charities board, there is a sense of pride and achievement from establishing an organisation of national renown,\" he says. \"But after five years, I was looking for another challenge. Leadership is a bit of a buzzword, but for me it sums up the drive for a greater professionalism in the voluntary sector.\" </p> <p>Ideally he would like to create a leadership academy for the voluntary sector. \"There are plenty of people around who will fund a business school at Oxford.

His budget at the NLCB is \u00a35m, while Acevo's turnover is around a tenth of that. He moves from having a staff of 25 to a team of nine. \"Funding at the charities board hasn't been a problem because it comes from the lottery.

After reading PPE at Oxford in the early 1970s (contemporaries included Tony Blair and Ann Widdecombe), he worked briefly in the civil service (\"so tedious that I couldn't wait to get out\") before taking a job as research officer for Jack Jones, then general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union. Bubb worked closely with Jones on shaping employment legislation and the social contract under the 1974 Labour government. \"It was fantastic experience and I got involved with the nitty gritty negotiations,\" he enthuses. </p> <p>After the 1979 general election, he went to the National Union of Teachers as a negotiations officer, a job that involved helping to resolve teachers' pay disputes but also developing training for union staff. Bubb then \"swapped sides\", taking a post as head of personnel at the Association of Metropolitan Authorities (now merged into the Local Government Association). While there, he helped set up the \"single status\" pay for local government staff which replaced the separate blue and white collar systems. </p> <p>Bubb, 47, believes his experience and networks will help Acevo achieve a national platform for its work. Colleagues agree. \"He spends a lot of time cultivating contacts and has very good political antennae,\" says one. </p> <p>Partnership work is high on the agenda, particularly with other umbrella bodies in the sector.

      "body": "<p>It's not easy finding the headquarters of Thames Chase on the eastern outskirts of London. Along small countryish lanes decorated with burnt-out cars, along a bumpy track through fields being dug for a golf course, you end up in a collection of farm buildings that have seen better days. Visitors have suggested to John Meehan that he knocks them down and starts again. But for Meehan, who has spent much of his life with Thames Chase in Portakabins, the farm HQ is \"luxury\". Meehan, born in the East End, is the director of Thames Chase, one of London's two community forests. </p> <p>There are 12 such forests in and around England's main conurbations. Planted 10 years ago, they are one of Britain's most successful environmental projects. With the national forest, which stretches over 200 sq miles on the old Midlands coalfield west of Leicester, the forests are also Britain's biggest environ mental project. But they're a reasonably well-kept secret. </p> <p>Urban forestry has become increasingly popular with governments in the 90s but the good news has yet to filter out much to the public. </p> <p>Given the scope and ambitions of the community forests, this is somewhat surprising. In total, they cover over 450,000 hectares - an area bigger than Suffolk; Thames Chase is almost the size of the Isle of Wight. The aim is to increase woodland cover by 30%, in each community forest, by about 2030 - in contrast to the present miserable 7%, the second lowest in the European Union. </p> <p>The Forestry Commission and the Countryside Agency which, as the Countryside Commission, pushed the idea forward in 1989, recently listed the gains since the forests were established: over 6,000 hectares of new woodland planted, an area 25 times that of Hyde Park; over 10,000 hectares opened up for access; 5,000km of public access routes, nearly 800km of new hedgerow. </p> <p>In some areas - notably transport corridors where planners want to impress potential inward investors (or tourists) with a \"green gateway\" - gains have been remarkable. Along the A689 in the Tees Forest around Middlesbrough, tree cover has increased from 0.2% to 16%. But trees, and the effects they create, need time. </p> <p>In Thames Chase, half a million trees have been planted, about 220 hectares of woodland, but tree cover has only climbed from 9-10% since 1990. It hasn't helped that farmers, wary of new public access and reluctant to commit their land to trees when there is, or was, more money to be made out of EU farming grants, have responded coolly. </p> <p>Meehan acknowledges that the woodlands of Thames Chase have yet to reach the \"critical mass\" where people sit up and take notice. He thinks this is something to do with size and eye levels. \"Trees don't really make an impact until you start looking up to them.\" But he believes that \"we are beginning to see coalescence\" - bits and pieces of new woodlands forming green chains across the landscape - and takes great comfort from the fact that several early plantings have achieved a kind of cartographic respectability. They are now \"green blobs\" on Ordnance Survey maps. \"There will be a point at which it all feels part of a whole, whereas at the moment it's just fragmented improvements.\" </p> <p>That moment may be sooner rather than later. National forestry strategy has undergone a sea-change in the late 90s. As Nerys Jones, director of the National Urban Forestry Unit (NUFU), points out, it has four main strands - rural development, regeneration, conservation and recreation. Timber production, in other words, is no longer the overriding objective. </p> <p>As part of this rethink, the Forestry Commission, which under the last government was busy selling off woodlands, is now busy buying new land for planting - near the cities. In April, it was awarded \u00a39m from the Treasury's capital modernisation fund for forest creation in three of the community forests areas, including Thames Chase, where new mixed woodlands of oak, larch, pine and willow are rising up on reclaimed rubbish dumps next to housing estates. </p> <p>What, you might ask, have forests in Hornchurch and Havering got to do with capital modernisation? According to Joe Watts, the commission's officer in Thames Chase, it's all to do with efficiency. Mixed forests in derelict areas near lots of people - 26m people live within 20km of the community forests - are better at delivering access, recreation and economic development and regeneration than the notorious serried ranks of conifers once planted in the remoter areas of Scotland or Norfolk. A Treasury approved cost-benefit analysis has concluded that overall, between 1990 and 2030, benefits will outweigh costs by \u00a3265m. </p> <p>That could be a conservative figure. It's always been loosely appreciated, for example, that greenery in cities has economic spin-offs, promoting liveability, raising property values and attracting inward investment. But what sort of greenery? And what about the fear of crime that has often accompanied tree planting in cities? </p> <p>The last decade has shown that a few simple design ideas can radically increase public acceptability. These include thinning out dense stands of trees and removing shrubs to improve sight lines; leaving uncluttered margins along paths; if necessary, introducing lights; and improving what planners call \"interpretation\", anything from signposts to guided walks, art festivals and poetry days. The result, says Meehan, is that forests become busy and, thus, self-policing. \"People no longer feel threatened because these places are so popular and well-used,\" he says. </p> <p> Urban forests were undoubtedly seen as something of an oddity when they were launched - what place does a forest have in a city? Fast forward to November, 1999, however, and here is Tony Blair commending them as \"a model and inpiration for others\". </p> <p>Jones says there is a new appreciation that trees provide a robust and cheap-to-maintain landscape - cheaper than parks and mown grassland - that can absorb noise and crowds and yet provide a sense of intimacy. There is evidence of their therapeutic role, too; research has shown that a tree-filled view cuts hospital drugs bills and reduces commuting stress. </p> <p>Add to that their capacity to soak up the carbon dioxide that generates global warming, provide shade from harmful solar radiation and combat traffic pollution linked to the rise in asthma, and, says Jones, \"people are beginning to see that trees in cities don't just look nice. They're functional, too. The challenge is to get across the message that the urban forest isn't just an amenity landscape - an added extra that's going to cost more. It is a net contributor to the quality of life in cities\".</p> <p>\u0095 Forest Fever Fortnight of Fun, two weeks' of activities in community forests throughout England, starts on Saturday.

In some areas - notably transport corridors where planners want to impress potential inward investors (or tourists) with a \"green gateway\" - gains have been remarkable. Along the A689 in the Tees Forest around Middlesbrough, tree cover has increased from 0.2% to 16%. But trees, and the effects they create, need time. In Thames Chase, half a million trees have been planted, about 220 hectares of woodland, but tree cover has only climbed from 9-10% since 1990. It hasn't helped that farmers, wary of new public access and reluctant to commit their land to trees when there is, or was, more money to be made out of EU farming grants, have responded coolly. Meehan acknowledges that the woodlands of Thames Chase have yet to reach the \"critical mass\" where people sit up and take notice. He thinks this is something to do with size and eye levels. \"Trees don't really make an impact until you start looking up to them.\" But he believes that \"we are beginning to see coalescence\" - bits and pieces of new woodlands forming green chains across the landscape - and takes great comfort from the fact that several early plantings have achieved a kind of cartographic respectability. They are now \"green blobs\" on Ordnance Survey maps. \"There will be a point at which it all feels part of a whole, whereas at the moment it's just fragmented improvements.\" That moment may be sooner rather than later. National forestry strategy has undergone a sea-change in the late 90s. As Nerys Jones, director of the National Urban Forestry Unit (NUFU), points out, it has four main strands - rural development, regeneration, conservation and recreation. Timber production, in other words, is no longer the overriding objective. As part of this rethink, the Forestry Commission, which under the last government was busy selling off woodlands, is now busy buying new land for planting - near the cities. In April, it was awarded \u00a39m from the Treasury's capital modernisation fund for forest creation in three of the community forests areas, including Thames Chase, where new mixed woodlands of oak, larch, pine and willow are rising up on reclaimed rubbish dumps next to housing estates. What, you might ask, have forests in Hornchurch and Havering got to do with capital modernisation? According to Joe Watts, the commission's officer in Thames Chase, it's all to do with efficiency. Mixed forests in derelict areas near lots of people - 26m people live within 20km of the community forests - are better at delivering access, recreation and economic development and regeneration than the notorious serried ranks of conifers once planted in the remoter areas of Scotland or Norfolk. A Treasury approved cost-benefit analysis has concluded that overall, between 1990 and 2030, benefits will outweigh costs by \u00a3265m. That could be a conservative figure. It's always been loosely appreciated, for example, that greenery in cities has economic spin-offs, promoting liveability, raising property values and attracting inward investment. But what sort of greenery? And what about the fear of crime that has often accompanied tree planting in cities? The last decade has shown that a few simple design ideas can radically increase public acceptability. These include thinning out dense stands of trees and removing shrubs to improve sight lines; leaving uncluttered margins along paths; if necessary, introducing lights; and improving what planners call \"interpretation\", anything from signposts to guided walks, art festivals and poetry days. The result, says Meehan, is that forests become busy and, thus, self-policing. \"People no longer feel threatened because these places are so popular and well-used,\" he says. Urban forests were undoubtedly seen as something of an oddity when they were launched - what place does a forest have in a city? Fast forward to November, 1999, however, and here is Tony Blair commending them as \"a model and inpiration for others\". Jones says there is a new appreciation that trees provide a robust and cheap-to-maintain landscape - cheaper than parks and mown grassland - that can absorb noise and crowds and yet provide a sense of intimacy. There is evidence of their therapeutic role, too; research has shown that a tree-filled view cuts hospital drugs bills and reduces commuting stress. Add to that their capacity to soak up the carbon dioxide that generates global warming, provide shade from harmful solar radiation and combat traffic pollution linked to the rise in asthma, and, says Jones, \"people are beginning to see that trees in cities don't just look nice. They're functional, too. The challenge is to get across the message that the urban forest isn't just an amenity landscape - an added extra that's going to cost more. It is a net contributor to the quality of life in cities\". \u0095 Forest Fever Fortnight of Fun, two weeks' of activities in community forests throughout England, starts on Saturday.

Scapegoating the badger Here in west Cornwall, the Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) is preparing for the experimental badger cull (The culling fields, July 5), hiding traps in the hedgerows with a view to starting shooting - at close range through the bars of the trap - in the very near future.

Jane Rosendale St Buryan. On the move Congratulations on being the first newspaper to bring to the fore the problems - amounting in some cases to suffering - of many mobile home residents (Mobile phoney, July 12). However, as one of the marchers who took to the streets on July 3, as you mention, I must point out that it was not to 10 Downing Street that we wended our way, but first to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to present a letter to the office of Nick Raynsford, the housing minister, and then to parliament to discuss the situation with Hilton Dawson MP.

Caring without training In Melanie Henwood's article, (A helping hand, June 28) she states of social care that \"it is not a career path which young people aspire to follow\". On the contrary, the project for adults with learning disabilities where my son works has at least half a dozen graduates in their 20s working on it at any one time. They all seem very keen to remain with this client group, but in the absence of appropriate training, and with poor remuneration, many look elsewhere. If only the training needs of this group of young people were met, perhaps they could help raise the status of \"care work\" to the level we should expect in a civilised society. Kate Warner Claybrooke Parva Leicestershire. Confronting trauma I was astonished to read Raj Persaud's opinion that psychologists tend to avoid challenging areas of mental health work, preferring to deal with middle-class angst (It's good to talk, June 28). Like all my NHS clinical psychology colleagues, my work is overwhelmingly with people with cognitive and physical disability or serious mental health problems, the majority of whom are vulnerable and living in adversity. If anyone has chosen a job exposing themselves to the concerns of the chattering classes, it is not the clinical psychologist but the middle-class media psychiatrist.

This will be addressed by national occupational standards for staff throughout the sector, including care homes, day centres and the home help service. </p> <p>The consultation paper will make local authorities more accountable for the standard of social services - whether or not these are provided directly by the council or commissioned elsewhere. \"We want to provide councils, and particularly their statutory director of social services, with a means of ensuring the quality of services,\" Hutton said. </p> <p>His third main strand of reform will be to establish a Social Care Institute of Excellence (Scie) to give authoritative guidance on good practice.

Waiting times have shortened dramatically, even in notoriously problematic areas such as orthopaedics. \"When we started, we were running at 40-45% [of orthopaedics patients] seen within 13 weeks,\" says Catterall. \"Now it's 86%.\" </p> <p>How is it done? Very simply. Instead of receiving an appointment date from the hospital, the new patient gets a letter saying they are on the waiting list and will be contacted again shortly before they can be seen.

The DNA rate was running up to 14% at Basildon and can be 20%, or even higher, in some London hospitals. Under partial booking, it is down to 4-5%. It is a similar picture in rheumatology, where DNAs are sharply down and all new patients are now seen within 13 weeks, compared to just 54% before the pilot started. </p> <p>So far, partial booking has been used by only one of the trust's six orthopaedics consultants. Although it is now being introduced into the ear, nose and throat specialism, extending it further is likely to depend on adaptation of the trust's computerised patient administration system - standard in much of the NHS - which has been promised by the supplier this autumn. </p> <p>More fundamental obstacles to national implementation of partial booking may come in areas where people are less able to follow the system. At Basildon, a reminder is sent two weeks after the second letter but then, if the patient has not phoned in within a further fortnight, the referral goes back to the GP. </p> <p>There have been fewer problems than expected - perhaps because people with communication difficulties are by now accustomed to getting help with telephone based public services and commerce - but the picture could be different in some inner-city areas. </p> <p>Sara Coles, Basildon's director of planning and service development, says: \"The only issue is that we don't have a large ethnic mix of patients here, and nor does Chesterfield.

      "body": "<p>One in four women suffers domestic violence at some time during their lives. Almost all have contact with health services.</p> <p>A government campaign, Living Without Fear, designed to tackle rape and violence against women, aims to promote \"zero tolerance\" of domestic violence. As part of this initiative, the Department of Health, in March, launched a manual which calls for all health staff to receive training to identify domestic abuse and offer practical help. Typical injuries, which it says health staff may encounter, include fractured bones, lost teeth and missing hair, although non-physical signs - such as depression and frequently missed appointments - may also be a clue. </p> <p>Abuse often begins or worsens during pregnancy. This may include injuries to breasts, abdomen or chest, leading to miscarriage and other foetal problems. The manual says staff should encourage women to disclose violence and help them access agencies such as women's refuges. The woman's safety must be paramount and all information should be treated in confidence. </p> <p>Last week, five NHS schemes were among 34 projects backed in a Home Office drive against rape and domestic violence. The schemes include: </p> <p>\u0095 Training for doctors and nurses in casualty departments at Charing Cross and Hammersmith hospitals, London, to recognise domestic violence and offer referral channels to police and other agencies. </p> <p>\u0095 Four pilot schemes in GP practices in Salford, Greater Manchester, where women who suffer domestic violence will be asked whether they want their injuries photographed and kept on file for use in a future court cases. </p> <p>\u0095 A scheme placing Victim Support volunteers in the casualty department of North Devon hospital, Barnstaple, to offer practical help to victims of domestic violence. </p> <p> Samantha was well known to health professionals in her home town. Over nine years, she saw her GP, health visitor and staff in the local casualty department with a succession of injuries to her face, arms and legs - all caused by her violent partner. Although her GP eventually advised her to leave home - after her boyfriend kicked her in the head with a steel-capped boot - no health worker offered support or information to help her escape. Finally, 18 months ago, when her partner threatened to kill her, she ran away with her three children to a women's refuge. </p> <p>\"They assume if you are in that situation you don't want to get out,\" says 30-year-old Samantha (not her real name), who is now living independently away from her home area. </p> <p>Hers is a common tale in women's refuges up and down the country. Professional bodies have for several years been urging health staff to take domestic violence seriously. As part of a \u00a37m Home Office initiative, five NHS projects were last week awarded grants for their work with domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. But critics say this is little more than token recognition. </p> <p>Studies and anecdotal evidence show that many NHS workers still turn a blind eye to domestic violence. Often, they are ill-equipped to respond. They are untrained in detecting signs of abuse and, if they do, are reluctant to get involved or have no idea how to help. </p> <p>Almost one in four women suffers domestic violence at some point in their lives and every three days a woman is killed by a partner or ex-partner, according to Home Office figures. Every day women walk into doctors' surgeries, health centres and casualty departments with black eyes, cuts and other tell-tale signs of violent relationships. Such abuse is often at its worst during pregnancy, when almost every woman has health service contact. And the NHS is ideally placed to detect and help combat it. </p> <p>Yet health professionals often fail to help, according to research. While the Department of Health recently issued a manual on spotting and dealing with domestic violence, experts are concerned that the guidelines are not backed up with sufficient resources or political clout. </p> <p>\"What we have got is a critical point in a change of consciousness among quite a lot of health profes sionals,\" says Nicola Harwin, coordinator of the Women's Aid Federation. \"What we haven't got is practical changes.\" </p> <p>Helly Langley, who runs Canterbury women's refuge, agrees. Health workers' response to domestic violence is \"ad hoc and arbitrary\", she says. One woman recently fled to the refuge after attending casualty with two broken hands - slammed in a door by her former partner - yet nobody queried her claim that it was an accident. Catrina Sheard, who later lived for a time at the Canterbury refuge, was offered sympathy but nothing more when she told staff at a casualty department that her ex-boyfriend broke her nose. </p> <p>A survey by Langley of 208 women living in the refuge from 1995-97 found that a third had attended casualty units, but only 36% of those had revealed the cause of their injuries. The rest were not questioned. Often, she says, women are \"waiting to be asked\" - a comment repeated in similar studies. Yet of 58% of women in the study who did report violence to GPs, 67% said the doctor was unsympathetic or unresponsive. A total 65% of the women were assaulted during pregnancy. </p> <p>Langley is now working with midwives and health visitors from East Kent Community NHS trust to help them respond more sympathetically to domestic violence. </p> <p>As pregnancy is often a trigger point for abuse, the role of midwives and health visitors is critical. The Royal College of Midwives has already produced guidance on domestic violence and the Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association is about to follow suit. </p> <p>\"There is increasing evidence exploding the myth that pregnancy is a haven of peace and bliss for women,\" says Tara Kaufmann, the RCM's head of policy. </p> <p>Having a baby can impose huge emotional and financial stress on families, and that may prompt or exacerbate violence. Midwives often see signs of abuse, such as bruising, injuries to the genitals or missing clumps of hair, as well as emotional symptoms, such as depression, Kaufmann says. Since almost every pregnant woman has ante-natal care, midwives have \"an incredible opportunity\" to help. Yet while she believes midwives are more aware of the issue, not all feel able to act. Often they are just too busy to ask questions - or, if they do, they are afraid of \"opening the floodgates\". </p> <p>Midwives in Leeds, however, have helped several women escape violent relationships since they introduced a mandatory three-day training session last year, teaching them to identify domestic violence, question women sympathetically and offer help, such as referral to a refuge. The midwives, working for the Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust, now routinely ask patients whether they have suffered violence, and they give everybody cards detailing emergency information. </p> <p>Some women hide the cards in the soles of their shoes, says midwife Mary Steen, who helped to design the project. One woman, who revealed after questioning that she had been kicked downstairs, was found an immediate place in a refuge. An Asian woman, having her fourth baby, was helped to find a refuge after she disclosed, through an interpreter, that she had been beaten by her husband through every pregnancy. Previously, he had acted as the interpreter. </p> <p>But such programmes are still a rarity and not always successful. A two-year project training midwives at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, London, uncovered unprecedented levels of abuse. In all, 6% of women patients revealed that they had been attacked in their current or previous pregnancy, whereas only one case had been identified in the previous two years, says Gillian Mezey, consultant psychiatrist at St George's hospital, London, who helped to run the study. But, despite the training, many midwives were unwilling to broach the topic - and on the day the project ended in April this year, the routine questioning stopped. </p> <p>\"I think a lot of midwives, in their head, understand this is a problem,\" Mezey says. \"But because many of them, and many doctors and nurses generally, feel domestic violence doesn't have a solution - it is not something we can do anything about as health professionals - there is a sense that we should not be asked to get involved.\" </p> <p> Health visitor Sue Peckover found similar ambivalence in her profession in a study she presented earlier this year. While a third of health visitors demonstrated good practice in handling domestic violence, the other two-thirds were largely unaware of the problem. One health visitor estimated that a quarter of her case load suffered domestic abuse, while another said she had come across only one case in her entire career. A minority of women survivors of abuse said health staff had helped them. While Peckover believes awareness has improved since her interviews in 1996-97, she says the picture is still varied. </p> <p>John Ryan, consultant in accident and emergency medicine at the Royal Sussex County hospital, Brighton, sees evidence of domestic violence daily in his department and argues that staff take cases \"very seriously\". Victims are offered referrals to police or social services, although these are often refused. But Ryan, who speaks for the British Association for Accident and Emergency Medicine, which has also produced guidance on the issue, admits that rising demands restrict training time on domestic violence. </p> <p>One training scheme for health staff in Camden, north London, ran into difficulties during last winter's beds crisis, when nurses could not be released for courses. </p> <p>Suzanne Watts, research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped to run the Camden project, says: \"I think there is lots of willingness in the health service, but there are a lot of constraints too.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual for Healthcare Professionals is available free from the Department of Health, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH or at <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/domestic.htm\">www.doh.gov.uk/domestic.htm</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "One in four women suffers domestic violence at some time during their lives. Almost all have contact with health services. A government campaign, Living Without Fear, designed to tackle rape and violence against women, aims to promote \"zero tolerance\" of domestic violence. As part of this initiative, the Department of Health, in March, launched a manual which calls for all health staff to receive training to identify domestic abuse and offer practical help. Typical injuries, which it says health staff may encounter, include fractured bones, lost teeth and missing hair, although non-physical signs - such as depression and frequently missed appointments - may also be a clue. Abuse often begins or worsens during pregnancy. This may include injuries to breasts, abdomen or chest, leading to miscarriage and other foetal problems. The manual says staff should encourage women to disclose violence and help them access agencies such as women's refuges. The woman's safety must be paramount and all information should be treated in confidence. Last week, five NHS schemes were among 34 projects backed in a Home Office drive against rape and domestic violence. The schemes include: \u0095 Training for doctors and nurses in casualty departments at Charing Cross and Hammersmith hospitals, London, to recognise domestic violence and offer referral channels to police and other agencies. \u0095 Four pilot schemes in GP practices in Salford, Greater Manchester, where women who suffer domestic violence will be asked whether they want their injuries photographed and kept on file for use in a future court cases. \u0095 A scheme placing Victim Support volunteers in the casualty department of North Devon hospital, Barnstaple, to offer practical help to victims of domestic violence. Samantha was well known to health professionals in her home town. Over nine years, she saw her GP, health visitor and staff in the local casualty department with a succession of injuries to her face, arms and legs - all caused by her violent partner. Although her GP eventually advised her to leave home - after her boyfriend kicked her in the head with a steel-capped boot - no health worker offered support or information to help her escape. Finally, 18 months ago, when her partner threatened to kill her, she ran away with her three children to a women's refuge. \"They assume if you are in that situation you don't want to get out,\" says 30-year-old Samantha (not her real name), who is now living independently away from her home area. Hers is a common tale in women's refuges up and down the country. Professional bodies have for several years been urging health staff to take domestic violence seriously. As part of a \u00a37m Home Office initiative, five NHS projects were last week awarded grants for their work with domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. But critics say this is little more than token recognition. Studies and anecdotal evidence show that many NHS workers still turn a blind eye to domestic violence. Often, they are ill-equipped to respond. They are untrained in detecting signs of abuse and, if they do, are reluctant to get involved or have no idea how to help. Almost one in four women suffers domestic violence at some point in their lives and every three days a woman is killed by a partner or ex-partner, according to Home Office figures. Every day women walk into doctors' surgeries, health centres and casualty departments with black eyes, cuts and other tell-tale signs of violent relationships. Such abuse is often at its worst during pregnancy, when almost every woman has health service contact. And the NHS is ideally placed to detect and help combat it. Yet health professionals often fail to help, according to research. While the Department of Health recently issued a manual on spotting and dealing with domestic violence, experts are concerned that the guidelines are not backed up with sufficient resources or political clout. \"What we have got is a critical point in a change of consciousness among quite a lot of health profes sionals,\" says Nicola Harwin, coordinator of the Women's Aid Federation. \"What we haven't got is practical changes.\" Helly Langley, who runs Canterbury women's refuge, agrees. Health workers' response to domestic violence is \"ad hoc and arbitrary\", she says. One woman recently fled to the refuge after attending casualty with two broken hands - slammed in a door by her former partner - yet nobody queried her claim that it was an accident. Catrina Sheard, who later lived for a time at the Canterbury refuge, was offered sympathy but nothing more when she told staff at a casualty department that her ex-boyfriend broke her nose. A survey by Langley of 208 women living in the refuge from 1995-97 found that a third had attended casualty units, but only 36% of those had revealed the cause of their injuries. The rest were not questioned. Often, she says, women are \"waiting to be asked\" - a comment repeated in similar studies. Yet of 58% of women in the study who did report violence to GPs, 67% said the doctor was unsympathetic or unresponsive. A total 65% of the women were assaulted during pregnancy. Langley is now working with midwives and health visitors from East Kent Community NHS trust to help them respond more sympathetically to domestic violence. As pregnancy is often a trigger point for abuse, the role of midwives and health visitors is critical. The Royal College of Midwives has already produced guidance on domestic violence and the Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association is about to follow suit. \"There is increasing evidence exploding the myth that pregnancy is a haven of peace and bliss for women,\" says Tara Kaufmann, the RCM's head of policy. Having a baby can impose huge emotional and financial stress on families, and that may prompt or exacerbate violence. Midwives often see signs of abuse, such as bruising, injuries to the genitals or missing clumps of hair, as well as emotional symptoms, such as depression, Kaufmann says. Since almost every pregnant woman has ante-natal care, midwives have \"an incredible opportunity\" to help. Yet while she believes midwives are more aware of the issue, not all feel able to act. Often they are just too busy to ask questions - or, if they do, they are afraid of \"opening the floodgates\". Midwives in Leeds, however, have helped several women escape violent relationships since they introduced a mandatory three-day training session last year, teaching them to identify domestic violence, question women sympathetically and offer help, such as referral to a refuge. The midwives, working for the Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust, now routinely ask patients whether they have suffered violence, and they give everybody cards detailing emergency information. Some women hide the cards in the soles of their shoes, says midwife Mary Steen, who helped to design the project. One woman, who revealed after questioning that she had been kicked downstairs, was found an immediate place in a refuge. An Asian woman, having her fourth baby, was helped to find a refuge after she disclosed, through an interpreter, that she had been beaten by her husband through every pregnancy. Previously, he had acted as the interpreter. But such programmes are still a rarity and not always successful. A two-year project training midwives at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, London, uncovered unprecedented levels of abuse. In all, 6% of women patients revealed that they had been attacked in their current or previous pregnancy, whereas only one case had been identified in the previous two years, says Gillian Mezey, consultant psychiatrist at St George's hospital, London, who helped to run the study. But, despite the training, many midwives were unwilling to broach the topic - and on the day the project ended in April this year, the routine questioning stopped. \"I think a lot of midwives, in their head, understand this is a problem,\" Mezey says. \"But because many of them, and many doctors and nurses generally, feel domestic violence doesn't have a solution - it is not something we can do anything about as health professionals - there is a sense that we should not be asked to get involved.\" Health visitor Sue Peckover found similar ambivalence in her profession in a study she presented earlier this year. While a third of health visitors demonstrated good practice in handling domestic violence, the other two-thirds were largely unaware of the problem. One health visitor estimated that a quarter of her case load suffered domestic abuse, while another said she had come across only one case in her entire career. A minority of women survivors of abuse said health staff had helped them. While Peckover believes awareness has improved since her interviews in 1996-97, she says the picture is still varied. John Ryan, consultant in accident and emergency medicine at the Royal Sussex County hospital, Brighton, sees evidence of domestic violence daily in his department and argues that staff take cases \"very seriously\". Victims are offered referrals to police or social services, although these are often refused. But Ryan, who speaks for the British Association for Accident and Emergency Medicine, which has also produced guidance on the issue, admits that rising demands restrict training time on domestic violence. One training scheme for health staff in Camden, north London, ran into difficulties during last winter's beds crisis, when nurses could not be released for courses. Suzanne Watts, research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped to run the Camden project, says: \"I think there is lots of willingness in the health service, but there are a lot of constraints too.\" \u0095 Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual for Healthcare Professionals is available free from the Department of Health, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH or at www.doh.gov.uk/domestic.htm",

Moreover, Mr Kabbah wants the court to be structured so that Sierra Leone's attorney general is the chief or co-chief prosecutor of the court. \"This structure will allow the government of Sierra Leone to play a lead role in the prosecution while receiving international assistance and expertise,\" the president wrote, leading to concerns from human rights groups as to whether Mr Sankoh would ever receive a fair trail in Sierra Leone. \"The UN could not support in any way a court that limited jurisdiction to post-Lome [the 1999 peace accord which included a blanket amnesty for those who committed atrocities] and only the RUF,\" said Ms Dufka. Human Rights Watch favours a court more within the UN system, rather than Britain's more pragmatic quick-fix approach. While differences between the US and Britain have blocked the creation of a special court, the effort has also been impeded by disagreement on the wider UN mandate for Sierra Leone. The US is reluctant to approve an additional 3,500 troops to the present force of 12,000 unless UN forces are allowed to be more aggressive - to the extent of retaking the diamond mines from the rebels. The US favours the deployment of Nigerian troops, who have fought in Sierra Leone before, a move opposed by Britain because of alleged Nigerian corruption. Useful link Human Rights Watch",

In 1820, Pratt found himself in Boston, looking for a ship: </p> <p>I soon commenced hunting for a voyage, but it was dull times with commerce as seamen's wages were but ten dollars per month, and there were more sailors than ships in port, and I found it dull times for green hands. But after looking around for a few days I heard there were hands wanted to go on a whaling voyage to the Pacific Ocean. I made no delay, but hastened to the office and put down my name and received twelve dollars of advance money, which I laid out in sea clothes.... Six more hands were shipped for the same vessel, and we were all sent on board of a packet bound to Nantucket.</p> <p> As Pratt's account suggests, a whaling voyage was the lowest rung on the maritime ladder for a seaman. Nantucketers like Thomas Nickerson and his friends might look to their first voyage as a necessary step in the beginning of a long and profitable career. But for the men who were typically rounded up by shipping agents in cities such as Boston, it was a different story. Instead of the beginning of something, shipping out on a whaling voyage was often a last and desperate resort. <br> The seven black sailors who agreed to sign on for a voyage aboard the Essex-Samuel Reed, Richard Peterson, Lawson Thomas, Charles Shorter, Isaiah Sheppard, William Bond, and Henry Dewitt-had even fewer choices than Addison Pratt would in 1820. None of their names appear in Boston or New York directories from this period, indicating that they were not landowners. Whether or not they called Boston home, most of them had probably spent more than a few nights in the boardinghouses in the waterfront area of the North End of the city-a place notorious as a gathering place for itinerant seamen, black and white, looking for a berth. <br> As they boarded the packet for Nantucket, the seven African Americans knew at least one thing: they might not be paid well for their time aboard a Nantucket whaler, but they were assured of being paid no less than a white person with the same qualifications. Since the time when Native Americans had made up the majority of Nantucket's labor force, the island's shipowners had always paid men according to their rank, not their color. Some of this had to do with the Quakers' antislavery leanings, but much of it also had to do with the harsh realities of shipboard life. In a tight spot, a captain didn't care if a seaman was white or black; he just wanted to know he could count on the man to complete his appointed task. <br> Still, black sailors who were delivered to the island as green hands were never regarded as equals by Nantucketers. In 1807, a visitor to the island reported: </p> <p>[T]he Indians having disappeared, Negroes are now substituted in their place. Seamen of color are more submissive than the whites; but as they are more addicted to frolicking, it is difficult to get them aboard the ship, when it is about to sail, and to keep them aboard, after it has arrived. The Negroes, though they are to be prized for their habits of obedience, are not as intelligent as the Indians; and none of them attain the rank of [boatsteerer or mate].</p> <p> It wasn't lofty social ideals that brought black sailors to this Quaker island, but rather the whale fishery's insatiable and often exploitative hunger for labor. \"[A]n African is treated like a brute by the officers of their ship,\" reported William Comstock, who had much to say about the evils of Nantucket's Quaker shipowners. \"Should these pages fall into the hands of any of my colored brethren, let me advise them to fly Nantucket as they would the Norway Maelstrom.\" Even Nickerson admitted that Nantucket whaling captains had a reputation as \"Negro drivers.\" Significantly, Nantucketers referred to the packet that delivered green hands from New York City as the \"Slaver.\" <br> By the evening of Wednesday, August 11, all save for Captain Pollard were safely aboard the Essex. Anchored beside her, just off the Nantucket Bar, was another whaleship, the Chili. Commanded by Absalom Coffin, the Chili was also to leave the following day. It was an opportunity for what whalemen referred to as a \"gam\"-a visit between two ships' crews. Without the captains to inhibit the revelry (and with the Bar between them and town), they may have seized this chance for a final, uproarious fling before the grinding discipline of shipboard life took control of their lives. <br> At some point that evening, Thomas Nickerson made his way down to his bunk and its mattress full of mildewed corn husks. As he faded off to sleep on the gently rocking ship, he surely felt what one young whaleman described as a great, almost overwhelming \"pride in my floating home.\" <br> That night he was probably unaware of the latest bit of gossip circulating through town-of the strange goings-on out on the Commons. Swarms of grasshoppers had begun to appear in the turnip fields. \"[T]he whole face of the earth has been spotted with them ...,\" Obed Macy would write. \"[N]o person living ever knew them so numerous.\" A comet in July and now a plague of locusts? <br> As it turned out, things would end up badly for the two ships anchored off the Nantucket Bar on the evening of August 11, 1819. The Chili would not return for another three and a half years, and then with only five hundred barrels of sperm oil, about a quarter of what was needed to fill a ship her size. For Captain Coffin and his men, it would be a disastrous voyage. <br> But nothing could compare to what fate had in store for the twenty-one men of the Essex. </p>",

It wasn't lofty social ideals that brought black sailors to this Quaker island, but rather the whale fishery's insatiable and often exploitative hunger for labor. \"[A]n African is treated like a brute by the officers of their ship,\" reported William Comstock, who had much to say about the evils of Nantucket's Quaker shipowners. \"Should these pages fall into the hands of any of my colored brethren, let me advise them to fly Nantucket as they would the Norway Maelstrom.\" Even Nickerson admitted that Nantucket whaling captains had a reputation as \"Negro drivers.\" Significantly, Nantucketers referred to the packet that delivered green hands from New York City as the \"Slaver.\" By the evening of Wednesday, August 11, all save for Captain Pollard were safely aboard the Essex. Anchored beside her, just off the Nantucket Bar, was another whaleship, the Chili. Commanded by Absalom Coffin, the Chili was also to leave the following day. It was an opportunity for what whalemen referred to as a \"gam\"-a visit between two ships' crews. Without the captains to inhibit the revelry (and with the Bar between them and town), they may have seized this chance for a final, uproarious fling before the grinding discipline of shipboard life took control of their lives. At some point that evening, Thomas Nickerson made his way down to his bunk and its mattress full of mildewed corn husks. As he faded off to sleep on the gently rocking ship, he surely felt what one young whaleman described as a great, almost overwhelming \"pride in my floating home.\" That night he was probably unaware of the latest bit of gossip circulating through town-of the strange goings-on out on the Commons. Swarms of grasshoppers had begun to appear in the turnip fields. \"[T]he whole face of the earth has been spotted with them ...,\" Obed Macy would write. \"[N]o person living ever knew them so numerous.\" A comet in July and now a plague of locusts? As it turned out, things would end up badly for the two ships anchored off the Nantucket Bar on the evening of August 11, 1819. The Chili would not return for another three and a half years, and then with only five hundred barrels of sperm oil, about a quarter of what was needed to fill a ship her size. For Captain Coffin and his men, it would be a disastrous voyage. But nothing could compare to what fate had in store for the twenty-one men of the Essex.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Chapter one: Nantucket (part two)</strong></p> <p>The town that Thomas Nickerson knew had a ramshackle feel about it. All it took was one walk through its narrow sandy streets to discover that despite the stately church towers and the occasional mansion, Nantucket was a far cry from Salem. \"The good citizens of [Nantucket] do not seem to pride themselves upon the regularity of their streets [or] the neatness of their sidewalks,\" observed a visiting Quaker. The houses were shingled and unpretentious and, as often as not, included items scavenged from ships. \"[H]atchways make very convenient bridges for gutters ...; a plank from the stern of a ship-having the name on it-answers the double purpose of making a fence-and informing the stranger if he can be at a loss-in what town he is.\" <br> Instead of using the official street names that had been assigned for tax purposes in 1798, Nantucketers spoke of \"Elisha Bunker's street\" or \"Captain Mitchell's.\" \"The inhabitants live together like one great family,\" wrote the Nantucketer Walter Folger, who happened to be a part-owner of the Essex, \"not in one house, but in friendship. They not only know their nearest neighbors, but each one knows all the rest. If you should wish to see any man, you need but ask the first inhabitant you meet, and he will be able to conduct you to his residence, to tell what occupation he is of, and any other particulars you may wish to know.\" <br> But even within this close-knit familial community, there were distinctions, and Thomas Nickerson was on the outside looking in. The unhappy truth was that while Nickerson's mother, Rebecca Gibson, was a Nantucketer, his father, Thomas Nickerson, had been from Cape Cod, and Thomas Junior had been born in Harwich in 1805. Six months later, his parents moved him and his sisters across the sound to Nantucket. It was six months too late. <br>Nantucketers took a dim view of off-islanders. They called them \"strangers\" or, even worse, \"coofs,\" a term of disparagement originally reserved for Cape Codders but broadened to include all of those unlucky enough to have been born on the mainland. <br> It might have earned Thomas Nickerson some regard on the island if his mother had at least come from old Nantucket stock, with a last name like Coffin, Starbuck, Macy, Folger, or Gardner. Such was not the case. On an island where many families could claim direct descent from one of the twenty or so \"first settlers,\" the Gibsons and Nickersons were without the network of cousins that sustained most Nantucketers. \"Perhaps there is not another place in the world, of equal magnitude,\" said Obed Macy, \"where the inhabitants [are] so connected by consanguinity as in this, which add[s] much to the harmony of the people and to their attachment to the place.\" Nickerson's friends and shipmates Owen Coffin, Charles Ramsdell, and Barzillai Ray could count themselves as part of this group. Thomas might play with them, go to sea with them, but deep down he understood that no matter how hard he might try, he was, at best, only a coof. <br> Where a person lived in Nantucket depended on his station in the whaling trade. If he was a shipowner or merchant, he more than likely lived on Pleasant Street, set back on the hill, farthest from the clamor and stench of the wharves. (In subsequent decades, as their ambitions required greater space and visibility, these worthies would gravitate toward Main Street). Captains, in contrast, tended to choose the thoroughfare with the best view of the harbor: Orange Street. With a house on the east side of Orange, a captain could watch his ship being outfitted at the wharf and keep track of activity in the harbor. Mates, as a rule, lived at the foot of this hill (\"under the bank,\" it was called) on Union Street, in the actual shadow of the homes they aspired one day to own. <br> On the corner of Main and Pleasant Streets was the Friends' immense South Meeting House, built in 1792 from pieces of the even bigger Great Meeting House that once loomed over the stoneless field of the Quaker Burial Ground at the end of Main Street. Just because Nickerson had been brought up a Congregationalist didn't mean he had never been inside this or the other Quaker meetinghouse on Broad Street. One visitor claimed that almost half the people who attended a typical Quaker meeting were not members of the Society of Friends. Earlier that summer, on June 29, Obed Macy recorded that two thousand people (more than a quarter of the island's population) had attended a public Quaker meeting at the South Meeting House. <br> While many of the attendees were there for the good of their souls, those in their teens and early twenties tended to have other motives. No other place on Nantucket offered a better opportunity for young people to meet members of the opposite sex. Nantucketer Charles Murphey described in a poem how young men such as himself used the long gaps of silence typical of a Quaker meeting </p> <p>To sit with eager eyes directed<br> On all the beauty there collected<br> And gaze with wonder while in sessions<br> On all the various forms and fashions.<br></p> <p> Yet another gathering spot for amorous young people was the ridge of hills behind the town where the four windmills stood. Here couples could enjoy a spectacular view of the town and Nantucket Harbor, with the brand-new lighthouse at the end of Great Point visible in the distance. <br> What is surprising is how rarely Nantucketers, even young and adventurous Nantucketers like Nickerson and company, strayed beyond the gates of the little town. \"As small as [the island] is,\" one whale-oil merchant admitted in a letter, \"I was never at the extreme east or west, and for some years I dare say have not been one mile from town.\" In a world of whales, sea serpents, and ominous signs in the night sky, all Nantucketers, whalemen and landsmen alike, looked to the town as a sanctuary, a fenced-in place of familiar ways and timeless ancestral alliances, a place to call home. <br> Passions stirred beneath Nantucket's Quaker facade. Life might seem restrained and orderly as hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people made their way to meeting each Thursday and Sunday, the men in their long dark coats and wide-brimmed hats, the women in long dresses and meticulously crafted bonnets. But factors besides Quakerism and a common heritage also drove the Nantucket psyche-in particular, an obsession with the whale. No matter how much the inhabitants might try to hide it, there was a savagery about this island, a bloodlust and pride that bound every mother, father, and child in a clannish commitment to the hunt. <br> The imprinting of a young Nantucketer began at the earliest age. The first words a baby was taught included the language of the chase-\"townor,\" for instance, a Wampanoag word meaning that the whale has been sighted for a second time. Bedtime stories told of killing whales and eluding cannibals in the Pacific. One mother approvingly recounted how her nine-year-old son attached a fork to the end of a ball of darning cotton and then proceeded to harpoon the family cat. The mother happened into the room just as the terrified pet attempted to escape, and unsure of what she had found herself in the middle of, she picked up the cotton ball. Like a veteran boatsteerer, the boy shouted, \"Pay out, mother! Pay out! There she sounds through the window!\" <br> There was rumored to be a secret society of young women on the island whose members pledged to marry only men who had already killed a whale. To help these young women identify them as hunters, boatsteerers wore chockpins (small oak pins used to keep the harpoon line in the bow groove of a whaleboat) on their lapels. Boatsteerers, superb athletes with prospects of lucrative captaincies, were considered the most eligible of Nantucket bachelors. <br> Instead of toasting a person's health, a Nantucketer offered invocations of a darker sort: </p> <p>Death to the living,<br> Long life to the killers,<br> Success to sailors' wives<br> And greasy luck to whalers.<br></p> <p>Despite the bravado of this little ditty, death was a fact of life with which all Nantucketers were thoroughly familiar. In 1810 there were forty-seven fatherless children on Nantucket, while almost a quarter of the women over the age of twenty-three (the average age of marriage) had been widowed by the sea. <br> In old age, Nickerson still visited the graves of his parents in the Old North Burial Ground. In 1819, during the last few weeks before his departure aboard the Essex, he undoubtedly made his way to this fenced-in patch of sun-scorched grass and walked among its canted stones. Nickerson's father had been the first of the parents to die, on November 9, 1806, at the age of thirty-three. His gravestone read: </p> <p>Crush'd as the moth beneath thy hand<br> We moulder to the dust<br> Our feeble powers can ne'er withstand<br> And all our beauty's lost.</p> <p>Nickerson's mother, who had borne five children, died less than a month later at the age of twenty-eight. Her oldest living daughter was eight years old; her only son was not yet two. Her inscription read: </p> <p>This mortal life decays apace<br> How soon the bubble's broke<br> Adam and all his numerous race<br> Are Vanity and Smoke.</p> <p> Nickerson, who was raised by his grandparents, wasn't the only orphan aboard the Essex. His friend Barzillai Ray had also lost both his parents. Owen Coffin and Charles Ramsdell had each lost a father. This may have been their closest bond: each of them, like so many Nantucketers, was a fatherless child for whom a ship's officer would be much more than a demanding taskmaster; he would be, quite possibly, the first male authority figure the boys had ever known. <br> Perhaps no community before or since has been so divided by its commitment to work. For a whaleman and his family, it was a punishing regimen: two to three years away, three to four months at home. With their men gone for so long, Nantucket's women were obliged not only to raise the children but also to run many of the island's businesses. It was largely the women who maintained the complex web of personal and commercial relationships that kept the community functioning. J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, whose classic Letters from an American Farmer describes his lengthy stay on the island a few years prior to the outbreak of the Revolution, suggested that the Nantucket women's \"prudence and good management ... justly entitles them to a rank superior to that of other wives.\" <br> Quakerism contributed to the women's strength. In its emphasis on the spiritual and intellectual equality of the sexes, the religion fostered an attitude that was in keeping with what all Nantucketers saw plainly demonstrated to them every day: that women, who on Nantucket tended to be better educated than the island's men, were just as intelligent, just as capable as their male counterparts. <br> By necessity and choice, the island's women maintained active social lives, visiting one another with a frequency Crevecoeur described as incessant. These visits involved more than the exchange of mere gossip. They were the setting in which much of the business of the town was transacted. The ninteenth-century feminist Lucretia Coffin Mott, who was born and raised on Nantucket, remembered how a husband back from a voyage commonly followed in the wake of his wife, accompanying her to get-togethers with other wives. Mott, who eventually moved to Philadelphia, commented on how odd such a practice would have struck anyone from the mainland, where the sexes operated in entirely different social spheres. <br> Some of the Nantucket wives adapted quite well to the three-years-away, three-months-at-home rhythm of the whale fishery. The islander Eliza Brock recorded in her journal what she called the \"Nantucket Girl's Song\": </p> <p>Then I'll haste to wed a sailor, and send him off to sea,<br> For a life of independence, is the pleasant life for me.<br> But every now and then I shall like to see his face,<br> For it always seems to me to beam with manly grace,<br> With his brow so nobly open, and his dark and kindly eye,<br> Oh my heart beats fondly towards him whenever he is nigh.<br> But when he says \"Goodbye my love, I'm off across the sea,\"<br> First I cry for his departure, then laugh because I'm free.</p> <p> The mantle of power and responsibility settled upon the Nantucket woman's shoulders on her wedding day. \"[N]o sooner have they undergone this ceremony,\" said Crevecoeur, \"than they cease to appear so cheerful and gay; the new rank they hold in the society impresses them with more serious ideas than were entertained before.... [T]he new wife ... gradually advises and directs [the household]; the new husband soon goes to sea; he leaves her to learn and exercise the new government in which she is entered.\" <br> To the undying outrage of subsequent generations of Nantucket loyalists, Crevecoeur claimed that many of the island's women had developed an addiction to opium: \"They have adopted these many years the Asiatic custom of taking a dose of opium every morning, and so deeply rooted is it that they would be at a loss how to live without this indulgence.\" Why they took the drug is perhaps impossible to determine from this distance in time. Still, the portrait that emerges-of a community of achievers attempting to cope with a potentially devastating loneliness-makes the women's dependence on opium perhaps easier to understand. The ready availability of the drug on the island (opium was included in every whaleship's medical chest) combined with the inhabitants' wealth may also help to explain why the drug was so widely used in Nantucket. <br> There is little doubt that intimacy-physical as well as emotional-between a wife and a husband must have been difficult to establish under the tremendously compressed circumstances of the few months available between voyages. An island tradition claims that Nantucket women dealt with their husbands' long absences by relying on sexual aids known as \"he's-at-homes.\" Although this claim, like that of drug use, seems to fly in the face of the island's staid Quaker reputation, in 1979 a six-inch plaster penis (along with a batch of letters from the nineteenth century and a laudanum bottle) was discovered hidden in the chimney of a house in the island's historic district. Just because they were \"superior wives\" didn't mean that the island's women were without normal physical desires. Like their husbands, Nantucket's women were ordinary human beings attempting to adapt to a most extraordinary way of life. <br> Thomas Nickerson may have enjoyed his first moments aboard the Essex, exploring her dark, hot interior, but the thrill was soon over. For the next three weeks, during the warmest summer anyone could remember, Nickerson and the gradually accumulating crew of the Essex labored to prepare the ship. Even in winter, Nantucket's wharves, topped by a layer of oil-soaked sand, stank to the point that people said you didn't see Nantucket when you first rounded the lighthouse at Brant Point, you smelled it. That July and August the stench rising from the wharf must have been pungent enough to gag even a veteran whaleman. <br> At that time on Nantucket it was standard practice to have the newly signed members of a whaleship's crew help prepare the vessel for the upcoming voyage. Nowhere else in New England was a sailor expected to help rig and provision his ship. That was what riggers, stevedores, and provisioners were for. But on Nantucket, whose Quaker merchants were famous for their ability to cut costs and increase profits, a different standard prevailed. <br> Whalemen did not work for wages; they were paid a share, or lay-a predetermined portion of the total take-at the end of the voyage. This meant that whatever work a shipowner could extract from a sailor prior to a voyage was, in essence, free or, to Nickerson's mind, \"a donation of ... labor\" on the part of the sailor. A shipowner might advance a seaman some money to help him purchase the clothing and equipment necessary for the voyage, but it was deducted (with interest) from his lay at the conclusion of the voyage. <br> As cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson had what was known as a very \"long\" (or meager) lay. Although the ship papers from the Essex's 1819 voyage have vanished, we know that Nickerson's predecessor, the cabin boy Joseph Underwood of Salem, received a 1/198 lay for the previous voyage. Given that the Essex's cargo of 1,200 barrels of sperm oil sold for about $26,500, Underwood was paid, once the expenses of the voyage were deducted from the gross and his personal expenses were deducted from his own portion, a grand total of about a $150 for two years' work. Although this was a pitiful wage, the cabin boy had been provided with room and board for two years and now had the experience to begin a career as a whaleman. <br> By the end of July, the Essex's upperworks-just about everything at deck level and above-had been completely rebuilt, including a new layer of pine decking and a cookhouse. At some point-probably before Nickerson joined the crew-the Essex was laid over on her side for coppering. Immense block-and-tackle systems were strung from the ship's masts to the wharf to haul the ship onto her side. The exposed bottom was then sheathed in copper to protect the ship from marine growth, which could turn her four-inch-thick oak hull planking into a soft, porous veneer. <br> At twenty years of age, the Essex was reaching the point when many vessels began to exhibit serious structural deterioration. Whale oil seems to have acted as a preservative, providing most whaleships with lives much longer than that of a typical merchant vessel. Still, there were limits. Rot, teredo worms, and a condition called iron sickness, in which the ship's rusted iron fastenings weakened the oak, were all potential problems. <br> The ever lengthening voyages around Cape Horn were another concern. \"The ship[s] being so long at sea without much repairs,\" Obed Macy would write in his journal, \"must shorten the durations of the ships [by] many years.\" Indeed, the Essex had undergone several days of repairs in South America during her previous voyage. She was an old ship caught up in a new era of whaling, and no one knew how much longer she would last. <br> Owners were always reluctant to invest any more money in the repair of a ship than was absolutely necessary. While they had no choice but to rebuild the Essex's upperworks, there could well have been suspicious areas below the waterline that they chose to address at a later time, if not ignore. That summer, the Essex's principal owners, Gideon Folger and Sons, were awaiting delivery of a new, much larger whaleship, the Aurora. This was not the year to spend an inordinate amount of money on a tired old vessel like the Essex. <br> Nantucket's shipowners could be as fierce in their own bloodless way as any whaleman. They might \"act the Quaker,\" but that didn't keep them from pursuing profits with a lethal enthusiasm. <br> In Moby-Dick, one of the Pequod's owners is Bildad, a pious Quaker whose religious scruples do not prevent him from extorting cruelly long lays from the crew (he offers Ishmael a 1/777 lay!). With his Bible in one hand and ledgerbook in the other, Bildad resembles a lean, Quakerly John D. Rockefeller, his mind and soul devoted to the cold calculus of making a whaling voyage pay. <br> There were some observers who claimed that, rather than leading the islanders to prosperity and grace, Quakerism was at the root of whatever evil flourished in the sharp business practices of Nantucket's shipowners. <br>According to William Comstock, who penned an account of a whaling cruise from Nantucket in the 1820s, \"Unfortunately, the anger which [the Quakers] are forbidden to express by outward actions, finding no vent, stagnates the heart, and, while they make professions of love and good will ..., the rancor and intense malevolence of their feelings poisons every generous spring of human kindness.\" <br> Gideon Folger and Paul Macy, two major shareholders in the Essex, were prominent members of the island's Quaker upper class. Yet, according to Nickerson, Macy, in charge of outfitting the Essex that summer of 1819, attempted to cut costs by severely underprovisioning the ship. In this practice he was not alone. \"[T]he owners of whaleships too frequently neglect to victual their ships properly,\" Comstock wrote, \"depending on the Captain to stint his crew in proportion to his means, by which a few dollars are saved to the rich owners, while the poor hard laboring sailor famishes with hunger.\" While it would be unfair to point to Paul Macy as responsible, even in part, for the grief that eventually awaited the men of the Essex, the first step toward that future began with Macy's decision to save a little money in beef and hardtack. <br> On Nantucket in the early nineteenth century, people didn't invest in bonds or the stock market, but rather in whaleships. By purchasing shares in several ships rather than putting their money in a single vessel, islanders spread both the risk and the reward throughout the community. Agents such as Macy and Folger could expect a total return on their whaling investments of somewhere between 28 and 44 percent per year. <br> Making this level of profitability all the more remarkable was the state of the world's economy in 1819. As Nantucket continued to add ship after ship to her fleet, mainland businesses were collapsing by the hundreds. Claiming that the \"days of our fictitious affluence is past,\" a Baltimore newspaper reported that spring on \"dishonored credits, deserted dwellings, inactive streets, declining commerce, and exhausted coffers.\" Nantucket remained an astonishing exception. Just as its isolated situation many miles out to sea enabled it to enjoy the warming influence of the Gulf Stream (providing for the longest growing season in the region), Nantucket existed, at least for the time being, in its own benign climate of prosperity. <br> Between July 4 and July 23, ten whaleships left the island, most heading out in pairs. The wharves were busy with laborers long into the night, all caught up in the disciplined frenzy of preparing whaleships for sea. But Gideon Folger, Paul Macy, and the Essex's captain, George Pollard, knew that all the preparations would be for naught if they couldn't find a crew of twenty-one men. <br> Since there were only so many Nantucketers to go around, shipowners relied on off-islanders with no previous sailing experience, known as \"green hands,\" to man their vessels. Many came from nearby Cape Cod. Shipping agents in cities up and down the East Coast also provided the owners with green hands, often sending them to Nantucket in groups aboard packet ships. <br> A green hand's first impression of the island was seldom positive. The young boys loitering on the waterfront inevitably harassed the new arrivals with the cry \"See the greenies, come to go ileing.\" (\"Oil\" was pronounced \"ile\" on Nantucket.) Then followed a walk from Straight Wharf to the base of Main Street, where a clothing and dry goods store served as the \"grand resort and rendezvous of seafaring men.\" Here men looking for a berth or just killing time (known as \"watching the pass\" on Nantucket) spent the day in a haze of tobacco smoke, lounging on an assortment of benches and wooden boxes. <br> On this island of perpetual motion, job-seeking seamen were expected to whittle. It was the way a man whittled that let people know what kind of berth he expected. A whaleman with at least one voyage under his belt knew enough to draw his knife always away from him. This signaled that he was looking for a boatsteerer's berth. Boatsteerers, on the other hand, whittled in the opposite direction, toward themselves; this indicated that they believed they were ready to become a mate. Not knowing the secret codes that Nantucketers had developed, a green hand simply whittled as best he knew how. <br> Many of the green hands felt as if they had found themselves in a foreign country where the people spoke a different language. All Nantucketers, even the women and little children, used nautical terms as if they were able-bodied seamen. According to one visitor, \"Every child can tell which way the wind blows, and any old woman in the street will talk of cruising about, hailing an old messmate, or making one bring to, as familiarly as the captain of a whaleship, just arrived from the northwest coast, will describe dimension to a landlubber by the span of his jibboom, or the length of his mainstay.\" For the green hands, whose first taste of the sea may have been on the packet ship to Nantucket, it was all a bewildering blur, particularly since many of the islanders also employed the distinctive \"thee and thou\" phrasing of the Quakers. <br> Compounding the confusion was the Nantucketers' accent. It wasn't just \"ile\" for \"oil\"; there was a host of peculiar pronunciations, many of which varied markedly from what was found even as nearby as Cape Cod and the island of Martha's Vineyard. A Nantucket whaleman kept his clothing in a \"chist.\" His harpoons were kept \"shurp,\" especially when \"atteking\" a \"lirge\" whale. A \"keppin\" had his own \"kebbin\" and was more often than not a \"merrid\" man, while a \"met\" kept the ship's log for the entire \"viege.\" <br> Then there were all these strange phrases that a Nantucketer used. If he bungled a job, it was a \"foopaw,\" an apparent corruption of the French faux pas that dated back to the days after the Revolution when Nantucketers established a whaling operation in Dunkirk, France. A Nantucketer didn't just go for a walk on a Sunday afternoon, he went on a \"rantum scoot,\" which meant an excursion with no definite destination. Fancy victuals were known as \"manavelins.\" If someone was cross-eyed, he was \"born in the middle of the week and looking both ways for Sunday.\" <br> Green hands were typically subjected to what one man remembered as \"a sort of examination\" by both the shipowner and the captain. Recalled another, \"We were catechized, in brief, concerning our nativity and previous occupation, and the build and physical points of each were looked to, not forgetting the eyes, for a sharp-sighted man was a jewel in the estimation of the genuine whaling captain.\" Some green hands were so naive and poorly educated that they insisted on the longest lay possible, erroneously thinking that the higher number meant higher pay. The owners were all too willing to grant their wishes. <br> Whaling captains competed with one another for men. But, as with everything on Nantucket, there were specific rules to which everyone had to adhere. Since first-time captains were expected to defer to all others, the only men available to Captain Pollard of the Essex would have been those in whom no one else had an interest. By the end of July, Pollard and the owners were still short by more than half a dozen men. <br> On August 4, Obed Macy stopped by the Marine Insurance Company at the corner of Main and Federal Streets to look at the thermometer mounted on its shingled exterior. In his journal he recorded, \"93 degrees and very little wind, which has rendered it almost insupportable to be exposed to the rays of the sun.\" <br> The next day, August 5, the fully rigged Essex was floated over the Nantucket Bar into deep water. Now the loading could begin in earnest, and a series of smaller craft called lighters began ferrying goods from the wharf to the ship. First to be stowed were the ground-tier casks-large, iron-hooped containers each capable of holding 268 gallons of whale oil. They were filled with seawater to keep them swollen and tight. On top of these were stowed casks of various sizes filled with freshwater. Firewood took up a great deal of space, as did the thousands of shooks, or packed bundles of staves, which would be used by the ship's cooper to create more oil casks. On top of that was enough food, all stored in casks, to last two and a half years. If the men were fed the same amount as merchant seamen (which is perhaps assuming too much when it came to a Nantucket whaler), the Essex would have contained at least fourteen tons of meat (salt beef and pork), more than eight tons of bread, and thousands of gallons of freshwater. Then there were massive amounts of whaling equipment (harpoons, lances, etc.), as well as clothing, charts, sails (including at least one spare set), navigational instruments, medicine, rum, gin, lumber, and so on. In addition to the three newly painted whaleboats that were suspended from the ship's davits, there were at least two spare boats: one stored upside down on a rack over the quarterdeck, another mounted on spare spars that projected over the stern. <br> By the time the men were done loading the Essex six days later-their labors briefly interrupted by a tremendous shower of rain duly noted by Obed Macy on August 9-the ship was almost as heavily laden as it would be with whale oil on her return to Nantucket. Explained one Nantucketer, \"[T]he gradual consumption of provisions and stores keeps pace with the gradual accumulation of oil ..., and a whaleship is always full, or nearly so, all the voyage.\" <br> Something, however, was still missing: the men needed to fill the seven empty berths in the Essex's forecastle. At some point, Gideon Folger put out the call to an agent in Boston for as many black sailors as the agent could find.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,345071,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

All it took was one walk through its narrow sandy streets to discover that despite the stately church towers and the occasional mansion, Nantucket was a far cry from Salem. \"The good citizens of [Nantucket] do not seem to pride themselves upon the regularity of their streets [or] the neatness of their sidewalks,\" observed a visiting Quaker. The houses were shingled and unpretentious and, as often as not, included items scavenged from ships. \"[H]atchways make very convenient bridges for gutters ...; a plank from the stern of a ship-having the name on it-answers the double purpose of making a fence-and informing the stranger if he can be at a loss-in what town he is.\" Instead of using the official street names that had been assigned for tax purposes in 1798, Nantucketers spoke of \"Elisha Bunker's street\" or \"Captain Mitchell's.\" \"The inhabitants live together like one great family,\" wrote the Nantucketer Walter Folger, who happened to be a part-owner of the Essex, \"not in one house, but in friendship. They not only know their nearest neighbors, but each one knows all the rest. If you should wish to see any man, you need but ask the first inhabitant you meet, and he will be able to conduct you to his residence, to tell what occupation he is of, and any other particulars you may wish to know.\" But even within this close-knit familial community, there were distinctions, and Thomas Nickerson was on the outside looking in. The unhappy truth was that while Nickerson's mother, Rebecca Gibson, was a Nantucketer, his father, Thomas Nickerson, had been from Cape Cod, and Thomas Junior had been born in Harwich in 1805. Six months later, his parents moved him and his sisters across the sound to Nantucket. It was six months too late. Nantucketers took a dim view of off-islanders. They called them \"strangers\" or, even worse, \"coofs,\" a term of disparagement originally reserved for Cape Codders but broadened to include all of those unlucky enough to have been born on the mainland. It might have earned Thomas Nickerson some regard on the island if his mother had at least come from old Nantucket stock, with a last name like Coffin, Starbuck, Macy, Folger, or Gardner. Such was not the case. On an island where many families could claim direct descent from one of the twenty or so \"first settlers,\" the Gibsons and Nickersons were without the network of cousins that sustained most Nantucketers. \"Perhaps there is not another place in the world, of equal magnitude,\" said Obed Macy, \"where the inhabitants [are] so connected by consanguinity as in this, which add[s] much to the harmony of the people and to their attachment to the place.\" Nickerson's friends and shipmates Owen Coffin, Charles Ramsdell, and Barzillai Ray could count themselves as part of this group. Thomas might play with them, go to sea with them, but deep down he understood that no matter how hard he might try, he was, at best, only a coof. Where a person lived in Nantucket depended on his station in the whaling trade. If he was a shipowner or merchant, he more than likely lived on Pleasant Street, set back on the hill, farthest from the clamor and stench of the wharves. (In subsequent decades, as their ambitions required greater space and visibility, these worthies would gravitate toward Main Street). Captains, in contrast, tended to choose the thoroughfare with the best view of the harbor: Orange Street. With a house on the east side of Orange, a captain could watch his ship being outfitted at the wharf and keep track of activity in the harbor. Mates, as a rule, lived at the foot of this hill (\"under the bank,\" it was called) on Union Street, in the actual shadow of the homes they aspired one day to own. On the corner of Main and Pleasant Streets was the Friends' immense South Meeting House, built in 1792 from pieces of the even bigger Great Meeting House that once loomed over the stoneless field of the Quaker Burial Ground at the end of Main Street. Just because Nickerson had been brought up a Congregationalist didn't mean he had never been inside this or the other Quaker meetinghouse on Broad Street. One visitor claimed that almost half the people who attended a typical Quaker meeting were not members of the Society of Friends. Earlier that summer, on June 29, Obed Macy recorded that two thousand people (more than a quarter of the island's population) had attended a public Quaker meeting at the South Meeting House. While many of the attendees were there for the good of their souls, those in their teens and early twenties tended to have other motives. No other place on Nantucket offered a better opportunity for young people to meet members of the opposite sex. Nantucketer Charles Murphey described in a poem how young men such as himself used the long gaps of silence typical of a Quaker meeting To sit with eager eyes directed On all the beauty there collected And gaze with wonder while in sessions On all the various forms and fashions. Yet another gathering spot for amorous young people was the ridge of hills behind the town where the four windmills stood. Here couples could enjoy a spectacular view of the town and Nantucket Harbor, with the brand-new lighthouse at the end of Great Point visible in the distance. What is surprising is how rarely Nantucketers, even young and adventurous Nantucketers like Nickerson and company, strayed beyond the gates of the little town. \"As small as [the island] is,\" one whale-oil merchant admitted in a letter, \"I was never at the extreme east or west, and for some years I dare say have not been one mile from town.\" In a world of whales, sea serpents, and ominous signs in the night sky, all Nantucketers, whalemen and landsmen alike, looked to the town as a sanctuary, a fenced-in place of familiar ways and timeless ancestral alliances, a place to call home. Passions stirred beneath Nantucket's Quaker facade. Life might seem restrained and orderly as hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people made their way to meeting each Thursday and Sunday, the men in their long dark coats and wide-brimmed hats, the women in long dresses and meticulously crafted bonnets. But factors besides Quakerism and a common heritage also drove the Nantucket psyche-in particular, an obsession with the whale. No matter how much the inhabitants might try to hide it, there was a savagery about this island, a bloodlust and pride that bound every mother, father, and child in a clannish commitment to the hunt. The imprinting of a young Nantucketer began at the earliest age. The first words a baby was taught included the language of the chase-\"townor,\" for instance, a Wampanoag word meaning that the whale has been sighted for a second time. Bedtime stories told of killing whales and eluding cannibals in the Pacific. One mother approvingly recounted how her nine-year-old son attached a fork to the end of a ball of darning cotton and then proceeded to harpoon the family cat. The mother happened into the room just as the terrified pet attempted to escape, and unsure of what she had found herself in the middle of, she picked up the cotton ball. Like a veteran boatsteerer, the boy shouted, \"Pay out, mother! Pay out! There she sounds through the window!\" There was rumored to be a secret society of young women on the island whose members pledged to marry only men who had already killed a whale. To help these young women identify them as hunters, boatsteerers wore chockpins (small oak pins used to keep the harpoon line in the bow groove of a whaleboat) on their lapels. Boatsteerers, superb athletes with prospects of lucrative captaincies, were considered the most eligible of Nantucket bachelors. Instead of toasting a person's health, a Nantucketer offered invocations of a darker sort: Death to the living, Long life to the killers, Success to sailors' wives And greasy luck to whalers. Despite the bravado of this little ditty, death was a fact of life with which all Nantucketers were thoroughly familiar. In 1810 there were forty-seven fatherless children on Nantucket, while almost a quarter of the women over the age of twenty-three (the average age of marriage) had been widowed by the sea. In old age, Nickerson still visited the graves of his parents in the Old North Burial Ground. In 1819, during the last few weeks before his departure aboard the Essex, he undoubtedly made his way to this fenced-in patch of sun-scorched grass and walked among its canted stones. Nickerson's father had been the first of the parents to die, on November 9, 1806, at the age of thirty-three. His gravestone read: Crush'd as the moth beneath thy hand We moulder to the dust Our feeble powers can ne'er withstand And all our beauty's lost. Nickerson's mother, who had borne five children, died less than a month later at the age of twenty-eight. Her oldest living daughter was eight years old; her only son was not yet two. Her inscription read: This mortal life decays apace How soon the bubble's broke Adam and all his numerous race Are Vanity and Smoke. Nickerson, who was raised by his grandparents, wasn't the only orphan aboard the Essex. His friend Barzillai Ray had also lost both his parents. Owen Coffin and Charles Ramsdell had each lost a father. This may have been their closest bond: each of them, like so many Nantucketers, was a fatherless child for whom a ship's officer would be much more than a demanding taskmaster; he would be, quite possibly, the first male authority figure the boys had ever known. Perhaps no community before or since has been so divided by its commitment to work. For a whaleman and his family, it was a punishing regimen: two to three years away, three to four months at home. With their men gone for so long, Nantucket's women were obliged not only to raise the children but also to run many of the island's businesses. It was largely the women who maintained the complex web of personal and commercial relationships that kept the community functioning. J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, whose classic Letters from an American Farmer describes his lengthy stay on the island a few years prior to the outbreak of the Revolution, suggested that the Nantucket women's \"prudence and good management ... justly entitles them to a rank superior to that of other wives.\" Quakerism contributed to the women's strength. In its emphasis on the spiritual and intellectual equality of the sexes, the religion fostered an attitude that was in keeping with what all Nantucketers saw plainly demonstrated to them every day: that women, who on Nantucket tended to be better educated than the island's men, were just as intelligent, just as capable as their male counterparts. By necessity and choice, the island's women maintained active social lives, visiting one another with a frequency Crevecoeur described as incessant. These visits involved more than the exchange of mere gossip. They were the setting in which much of the business of the town was transacted. The ninteenth-century feminist Lucretia Coffin Mott, who was born and raised on Nantucket, remembered how a husband back from a voyage commonly followed in the wake of his wife, accompanying her to get-togethers with other wives. Mott, who eventually moved to Philadelphia, commented on how odd such a practice would have struck anyone from the mainland, where the sexes operated in entirely different social spheres. Some of the Nantucket wives adapted quite well to the three-years-away, three-months-at-home rhythm of the whale fishery. The islander Eliza Brock recorded in her journal what she called the \"Nantucket Girl's Song\": Then I'll haste to wed a sailor, and send him off to sea, For a life of independence, is the pleasant life for me. But every now and then I shall like to see his face, For it always seems to me to beam with manly grace, With his brow so nobly open, and his dark and kindly eye, Oh my heart beats fondly towards him whenever he is nigh. But when he says \"Goodbye my love, I'm off across the sea,\" First I cry for his departure, then laugh because I'm free. The mantle of power and responsibility settled upon the Nantucket woman's shoulders on her wedding day. \"[N]o sooner have they undergone this ceremony,\" said Crevecoeur, \"than they cease to appear so cheerful and gay; the new rank they hold in the society impresses them with more serious ideas than were entertained before.... [T]he new wife ... gradually advises and directs [the household]; the new husband soon goes to sea; he leaves her to learn and exercise the new government in which she is entered.\" To the undying outrage of subsequent generations of Nantucket loyalists, Crevecoeur claimed that many of the island's women had developed an addiction to opium: \"They have adopted these many years the Asiatic custom of taking a dose of opium every morning, and so deeply rooted is it that they would be at a loss how to live without this indulgence.\" Why they took the drug is perhaps impossible to determine from this distance in time. Still, the portrait that emerges-of a community of achievers attempting to cope with a potentially devastating loneliness-makes the women's dependence on opium perhaps easier to understand. The ready availability of the drug on the island (opium was included in every whaleship's medical chest) combined with the inhabitants' wealth may also help to explain why the drug was so widely used in Nantucket. There is little doubt that intimacy-physical as well as emotional-between a wife and a husband must have been difficult to establish under the tremendously compressed circumstances of the few months available between voyages. An island tradition claims that Nantucket women dealt with their husbands' long absences by relying on sexual aids known as \"he's-at-homes.\" Although this claim, like that of drug use, seems to fly in the face of the island's staid Quaker reputation, in 1979 a six-inch plaster penis (along with a batch of letters from the nineteenth century and a laudanum bottle) was discovered hidden in the chimney of a house in the island's historic district. Just because they were \"superior wives\" didn't mean that the island's women were without normal physical desires. Like their husbands, Nantucket's women were ordinary human beings attempting to adapt to a most extraordinary way of life. Thomas Nickerson may have enjoyed his first moments aboard the Essex, exploring her dark, hot interior, but the thrill was soon over. For the next three weeks, during the warmest summer anyone could remember, Nickerson and the gradually accumulating crew of the Essex labored to prepare the ship. Even in winter, Nantucket's wharves, topped by a layer of oil-soaked sand, stank to the point that people said you didn't see Nantucket when you first rounded the lighthouse at Brant Point, you smelled it. That July and August the stench rising from the wharf must have been pungent enough to gag even a veteran whaleman. At that time on Nantucket it was standard practice to have the newly signed members of a whaleship's crew help prepare the vessel for the upcoming voyage. Nowhere else in New England was a sailor expected to help rig and provision his ship. That was what riggers, stevedores, and provisioners were for. But on Nantucket, whose Quaker merchants were famous for their ability to cut costs and increase profits, a different standard prevailed. Whalemen did not work for wages; they were paid a share, or lay-a predetermined portion of the total take-at the end of the voyage. This meant that whatever work a shipowner could extract from a sailor prior to a voyage was, in essence, free or, to Nickerson's mind, \"a donation of ... labor\" on the part of the sailor. A shipowner might advance a seaman some money to help him purchase the clothing and equipment necessary for the voyage, but it was deducted (with interest) from his lay at the conclusion of the voyage. As cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson had what was known as a very \"long\" (or meager) lay. Although the ship papers from the Essex's 1819 voyage have vanished, we know that Nickerson's predecessor, the cabin boy Joseph Underwood of Salem, received a 1/198 lay for the previous voyage. Given that the Essex's cargo of 1,200 barrels of sperm oil sold for about $26,500, Underwood was paid, once the expenses of the voyage were deducted from the gross and his personal expenses were deducted from his own portion, a grand total of about a $150 for two years' work. Although this was a pitiful wage, the cabin boy had been provided with room and board for two years and now had the experience to begin a career as a whaleman. By the end of July, the Essex's upperworks-just about everything at deck level and above-had been completely rebuilt, including a new layer of pine decking and a cookhouse. At some point-probably before Nickerson joined the crew-the Essex was laid over on her side for coppering. Immense block-and-tackle systems were strung from the ship's masts to the wharf to haul the ship onto her side. The exposed bottom was then sheathed in copper to protect the ship from marine growth, which could turn her four-inch-thick oak hull planking into a soft, porous veneer. At twenty years of age, the Essex was reaching the point when many vessels began to exhibit serious structural deterioration. Whale oil seems to have acted as a preservative, providing most whaleships with lives much longer than that of a typical merchant vessel. Still, there were limits. Rot, teredo worms, and a condition called iron sickness, in which the ship's rusted iron fastenings weakened the oak, were all potential problems. The ever lengthening voyages around Cape Horn were another concern. \"The ship[s] being so long at sea without much repairs,\" Obed Macy would write in his journal, \"must shorten the durations of the ships [by] many years.\" Indeed, the Essex had undergone several days of repairs in South America during her previous voyage. She was an old ship caught up in a new era of whaling, and no one knew how much longer she would last. Owners were always reluctant to invest any more money in the repair of a ship than was absolutely necessary. While they had no choice but to rebuild the Essex's upperworks, there could well have been suspicious areas below the waterline that they chose to address at a later time, if not ignore. That summer, the Essex's principal owners, Gideon Folger and Sons, were awaiting delivery of a new, much larger whaleship, the Aurora. This was not the year to spend an inordinate amount of money on a tired old vessel like the Essex. Nantucket's shipowners could be as fierce in their own bloodless way as any whaleman. They might \"act the Quaker,\" but that didn't keep them from pursuing profits with a lethal enthusiasm. In Moby-Dick, one of the Pequod's owners is Bildad, a pious Quaker whose religious scruples do not prevent him from extorting cruelly long lays from the crew (he offers Ishmael a 1/777 lay!). With his Bible in one hand and ledgerbook in the other, Bildad resembles a lean, Quakerly John D. Rockefeller, his mind and soul devoted to the cold calculus of making a whaling voyage pay. There were some observers who claimed that, rather than leading the islanders to prosperity and grace, Quakerism was at the root of whatever evil flourished in the sharp business practices of Nantucket's shipowners. According to William Comstock, who penned an account of a whaling cruise from Nantucket in the 1820s, \"Unfortunately, the anger which [the Quakers] are forbidden to express by outward actions, finding no vent, stagnates the heart, and, while they make professions of love and good will ..., the rancor and intense malevolence of their feelings poisons every generous spring of human kindness.\" Gideon Folger and Paul Macy, two major shareholders in the Essex, were prominent members of the island's Quaker upper class. Yet, according to Nickerson, Macy, in charge of outfitting the Essex that summer of 1819, attempted to cut costs by severely underprovisioning the ship. In this practice he was not alone. \"[T]he owners of whaleships too frequently neglect to victual their ships properly,\" Comstock wrote, \"depending on the Captain to stint his crew in proportion to his means, by which a few dollars are saved to the rich owners, while the poor hard laboring sailor famishes with hunger.\" While it would be unfair to point to Paul Macy as responsible, even in part, for the grief that eventually awaited the men of the Essex, the first step toward that future began with Macy's decision to save a little money in beef and hardtack. On Nantucket in the early nineteenth century, people didn't invest in bonds or the stock market, but rather in whaleships. By purchasing shares in several ships rather than putting their money in a single vessel, islanders spread both the risk and the reward throughout the community. Agents such as Macy and Folger could expect a total return on their whaling investments of somewhere between 28 and 44 percent per year. Making this level of profitability all the more remarkable was the state of the world's economy in 1819. As Nantucket continued to add ship after ship to her fleet, mainland businesses were collapsing by the hundreds. Claiming that the \"days of our fictitious affluence is past,\" a Baltimore newspaper reported that spring on \"dishonored credits, deserted dwellings, inactive streets, declining commerce, and exhausted coffers.\" Nantucket remained an astonishing exception. Just as its isolated situation many miles out to sea enabled it to enjoy the warming influence of the Gulf Stream (providing for the longest growing season in the region), Nantucket existed, at least for the time being, in its own benign climate of prosperity. Between July 4 and July 23, ten whaleships left the island, most heading out in pairs. The wharves were busy with laborers long into the night, all caught up in the disciplined frenzy of preparing whaleships for sea. But Gideon Folger, Paul Macy, and the Essex's captain, George Pollard, knew that all the preparations would be for naught if they couldn't find a crew of twenty-one men. Since there were only so many Nantucketers to go around, shipowners relied on off-islanders with no previous sailing experience, known as \"green hands,\" to man their vessels. Many came from nearby Cape Cod. Shipping agents in cities up and down the East Coast also provided the owners with green hands, often sending them to Nantucket in groups aboard packet ships. A green hand's first impression of the island was seldom positive. The young boys loitering on the waterfront inevitably harassed the new arrivals with the cry \"See the greenies, come to go ileing.\" (\"Oil\" was pronounced \"ile\" on Nantucket.) Then followed a walk from Straight Wharf to the base of Main Street, where a clothing and dry goods store served as the \"grand resort and rendezvous of seafaring men.\" Here men looking for a berth or just killing time (known as \"watching the pass\" on Nantucket) spent the day in a haze of tobacco smoke, lounging on an assortment of benches and wooden boxes. On this island of perpetual motion, job-seeking seamen were expected to whittle. It was the way a man whittled that let people know what kind of berth he expected. A whaleman with at least one voyage under his belt knew enough to draw his knife always away from him. This signaled that he was looking for a boatsteerer's berth. Boatsteerers, on the other hand, whittled in the opposite direction, toward themselves; this indicated that they believed they were ready to become a mate. Not knowing the secret codes that Nantucketers had developed, a green hand simply whittled as best he knew how. Many of the green hands felt as if they had found themselves in a foreign country where the people spoke a different language. All Nantucketers, even the women and little children, used nautical terms as if they were able-bodied seamen. According to one visitor, \"Every child can tell which way the wind blows, and any old woman in the street will talk of cruising about, hailing an old messmate, or making one bring to, as familiarly as the captain of a whaleship, just arrived from the northwest coast, will describe dimension to a landlubber by the span of his jibboom, or the length of his mainstay.\" For the green hands, whose first taste of the sea may have been on the packet ship to Nantucket, it was all a bewildering blur, particularly since many of the islanders also employed the distinctive \"thee and thou\" phrasing of the Quakers. Compounding the confusion was the Nantucketers' accent. It wasn't just \"ile\" for \"oil\"; there was a host of peculiar pronunciations, many of which varied markedly from what was found even as nearby as Cape Cod and the island of Martha's Vineyard. A Nantucket whaleman kept his clothing in a \"chist.\" His harpoons were kept \"shurp,\" especially when \"atteking\" a \"lirge\" whale. A \"keppin\" had his own \"kebbin\" and was more often than not a \"merrid\" man, while a \"met\" kept the ship's log for the entire \"viege.\" Then there were all these strange phrases that a Nantucketer used. If he bungled a job, it was a \"foopaw,\" an apparent corruption of the French faux pas that dated back to the days after the Revolution when Nantucketers established a whaling operation in Dunkirk, France. A Nantucketer didn't just go for a walk on a Sunday afternoon, he went on a \"rantum scoot,\" which meant an excursion with no definite destination. Fancy victuals were known as \"manavelins.\" If someone was cross-eyed, he was \"born in the middle of the week and looking both ways for Sunday.\" Green hands were typically subjected to what one man remembered as \"a sort of examination\" by both the shipowner and the captain. Recalled another, \"We were catechized, in brief, concerning our nativity and previous occupation, and the build and physical points of each were looked to, not forgetting the eyes, for a sharp-sighted man was a jewel in the estimation of the genuine whaling captain.\" Some green hands were so naive and poorly educated that they insisted on the longest lay possible, erroneously thinking that the higher number meant higher pay. The owners were all too willing to grant their wishes. Whaling captains competed with one another for men. But, as with everything on Nantucket, there were specific rules to which everyone had to adhere. Since first-time captains were expected to defer to all others, the only men available to Captain Pollard of the Essex would have been those in whom no one else had an interest. By the end of July, Pollard and the owners were still short by more than half a dozen men. On August 4, Obed Macy stopped by the Marine Insurance Company at the corner of Main and Federal Streets to look at the thermometer mounted on its shingled exterior. In his journal he recorded, \"93 degrees and very little wind, which has rendered it almost insupportable to be exposed to the rays of the sun.\" The next day, August 5, the fully rigged Essex was floated over the Nantucket Bar into deep water. Now the loading could begin in earnest, and a series of smaller craft called lighters began ferrying goods from the wharf to the ship. First to be stowed were the ground-tier casks-large, iron-hooped containers each capable of holding 268 gallons of whale oil. They were filled with seawater to keep them swollen and tight. On top of these were stowed casks of various sizes filled with freshwater. Firewood took up a great deal of space, as did the thousands of shooks, or packed bundles of staves, which would be used by the ship's cooper to create more oil casks. On top of that was enough food, all stored in casks, to last two and a half years. If the men were fed the same amount as merchant seamen (which is perhaps assuming too much when it came to a Nantucket whaler), the Essex would have contained at least fourteen tons of meat (salt beef and pork), more than eight tons of bread, and thousands of gallons of freshwater. Then there were massive amounts of whaling equipment (harpoons, lances, etc.), as well as clothing, charts, sails (including at least one spare set), navigational instruments, medicine, rum, gin, lumber, and so on. In addition to the three newly painted whaleboats that were suspended from the ship's davits, there were at least two spare boats: one stored upside down on a rack over the quarterdeck, another mounted on spare spars that projected over the stern. By the time the men were done loading the Essex six days later-their labors briefly interrupted by a tremendous shower of rain duly noted by Obed Macy on August 9-the ship was almost as heavily laden as it would be with whale oil on her return to Nantucket. Explained one Nantucketer, \"[T]he gradual consumption of provisions and stores keeps pace with the gradual accumulation of oil ..., and a whaleship is always full, or nearly so, all the voyage.\" Something, however, was still missing: the men needed to fill the seven empty berths in the Essex's forecastle. At some point, Gideon Folger put out the call to an agent in Boston for as many black sailors as the agent could find. Continue",

The frame of everything was Glamis with its battlements and towers, and you side-saddle on your boxy grey inside the moment as it froze and held: your life your own and all the world unknown. 1914-18: SERVICE The shutter opens and the world expands. It's Hawtrey at the Colly for your birthday but he can't be heard, or not heard as he wants - outside, along St Martin's Lane, a people-torrent runs and will not wait to get the enemy. The show goes on. And then goes on elsewhere, in wards where nursing changes strangers into brothers while your real brothers pack their bags and leave as strangers, or else go for good. 1923: MARRIAGE Jazz, New Look, new plunging necklaces and snap! you're cornered in a studio where beauty holds its own but loses edge and makes a soft advertisement for love. For love which finds its focus as a bride and keeps its nerve, and sees its way, then rides the shimmer of its own delight returning to the world the gift it gives in private - tongue-tied tongue set loose, the head confirming what the heart believes. 1937: CORONATION In public; chairs into thrones; people to subjects, and the shudder of transition rippling through the camera's eye - his sombre face an effigy as inescapably the crown is lowered; your face tender with the load it brings to bear, and what it means to hear beyond the shooshing satins and the stone Guernica crumbling, fire in Palestine, and Germany again - earth groaning as it shifts its weight and stalls in misery. 1940: BLITZ THE PALACE CUP: then comes the blast and choking lift that brings you where you look East Enders in the face - not land exactly now but roof-spars, earth-in-shreds, a gluey crater which was once indoors, and you as one of us - or like enough to make a crowd of wind-frayed kids and peering mums, and husbands jostling with the press-men in their burly coats, all think you are. And thank their lucky stars. 1952: WIDOWHOOD Basalt blackness at his funeral and basalt stillness: through your veil the fossil-face of grief, the stricken gaze which bounces back the flash-lights to their source but masks a working brain, and sees the years and years ahead the way an acrobat might see a tightrope and the audience below: the dizzy space, the camera-pops, the swaying line between thin air and ground and every single step bourne up by company. 1960: THE FAMILY The years wind on, the world and family develop into colour and due season: winter poppies, Spring in May, the grassy Ascot drive half summer-greeting, half-acknowledgement. And everything a system made of signs: the marches past, foundation stones, the plaques and special trees which prove your life in ours yet make it seem a secret too - the way a salmon swells in secret through the currents of a pool you stand beside, and glances at your fly, and keeps its course. 1997: LATE ON No changes, on the face of it: the balconies, the open smile and wave, the garden parties, and the hats, the hats, the hats, all pictures in our albums or our heads along with these: the photos no-one took of you - the grandmother-confessor-friend, the mourner at divorces and the rest, the worldly watcher of the world who shows the world no changes on the face of it: the balconies, the open wave and smile, the hats, the hats, the hats.

The latest document, written by Labour's polling expert Philip Gould in early May, describes the government's unpopularity on a number of key issues and concludes 'the New Labour brand has become seriously contaminated'. The leak has spoilt what should have been a good day for the government, after the chancellor of the exchequer's announcement of big public spending increases. The embarrassment is magnified by the fact that this is the fourth big leak this year from the heart of the government: someone seems to have it in for Tony Blair. <p><b>So leaks always happen. Why get worried now?</b><br> It's true that revelations from the heart of government are common and the fine line between leaking and briefing is uncertain. \"Leaking is what you do; briefing is what I do,\" as former prime minister Jim Callaghan once put it. But the prime minister's inner circle is usually immune. Since June, however, two emails sent by pollster Philip Gould revealed criticism of the prime minister's speech to the Women's Institute; and on Saturday, the Guardian printed emails sent by the prime minister's private secretary, Anji Hunter, about her management of the BBC's fly-on-the-wall documentary on Downing Street. On Monday, a memo written by Tony Blair appeared in the press. Leaks such as these make life very difficult for those working in Number 10. Like the rest of us, they've come to depend upon computers and emails - and it will be hard for Tony Blair to maintain trust in his personal staff.</p> <p><b>So who's the leaker?</b><br> The people who know - Trevor Kavanagh, the political editor of the Sun, and Andrew Pierce, of the Times, aren't saying. The rest of us, including Tony Blair, just have to guess. Downing Street has hinted that the Conservative party might have had something to do with it but haven't offered any evidence so far. There's no evidence that the leaks have all come from the same person, although this is possible. </p> <p><b>What's the motive?</b> <br> This is what's puzzling everyone. The latest Philip Gould memo was sent to only four people: the prime minister; Gordon Brown, the chancellor; Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary; and Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press secretary (Gordon Brown says he has never seen the copy sent to him - although given his workload, this is not necessarily surprising). None of these people seems to have anything to gain from the leaks, unless they hold a particularly poisonous grudge. </p> <p><b>So what other theories are there?</b><br> Some think that a computer hacker - or perhaps someone working on the Downing Street website - found the documents on the government computer system and passed them to the Conservative party. Since one of the leaks appears to be of a fax, this seems unlikely. In the past, civil servants such as Clive Ponting (over the sinking of the Belgrano) and Sarah Tisdall (over the siting of US missiles) leaked because they had access to documents on major policy decisions which they believed to be morally wrong. But very few civil servants will have seen the Downing Street memos - and anyway, they concern the trivia of government rather than policy.</p> <p><b>Is leaking illegal?</b><br> Almost certainly, if you are a civil servant who has signed the official secrets act. Clive Ponting was tried for sending documents to MPs, although the jury failed to convict him and Sarah Tisdall was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and served four. The position for MPs is less clear. When they join the Privy Council senior parliamentarians swear to \"keep secret all matters committed and revealed\", but they are hardly expected to uphold this in practice.

On Monday in the Guardian he noted that, as well as changing the face of children's publishing, Rowling had changed the nature of book reviewing. \"She has created a world in which novels - like new cars, grouse, Beaujolais nouveau and Star Wars movies - are mass-purchased on the first day of availability and in which book reviews are phoned in at half-time like a sports report.\"</p> <p> <strong>Tom Kemp</strong> also rushed out a review for Monday's <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> (all papers threw out the idea of reviewing the book on their books pages; this was NEWS; this was HISTORY). Kemp complained about sleeplessness, and it seemed to have affected the review, which was dreary. He had asked to review the book, he told us, but sounded as if he now regretted it.</p> <p> \"It is probable that a great many children will read the book from beginning to end, although it will take most of them a very long time,\" he stated rather obviously. \"As for myself, I remain a Harry Potter fan, although not quite as enthusiastic as before. The Goblet of Fire is well up to the high standard of its predecessors. The trouble with it, apart from its length, is that it is very much the same as its predecessors. JK Rowling hit upon a winning formula at the beginning of the series, and she has hardly changed it.\"</p> <p> It was left to <strong>Penelope Lively</strong>, who had the luxury of waiting until Thursday to produce her <strong>Independent</strong> review, to round on the absurdity of the rapid-reviewing process. \"The histrionic embargo on copies of this book left this reviewer obliged to scramble through its 600 pages with unseemly haste - which leaves you feeling tetchy and ill-disposed,\" she wrote. \"Bloomsbury should beware: more of this kind of thing and they'll alienate everyone. As for reports of rioting parents at King's Cross, weeping children, bleary-eyed families keeping midnight vigils ... enough is enough.\"</p> <p> Despite her complaints, Ms Lively was kind to the book: \"The Potter saga has all the prime qualities: a meticulously imagined fantasy world, an unlimited fund of witty and provocative invention, a cracking narrative pace. The mutterings that it is derivative - a hotchpotch of well-worn themes and characters from children's literature - are misplaced. Everything is derivative, looked at in one way. In critical circles, it is called intertextuality.\" </p> <p> She thought it too long, said she was \"bug-eyed from reading\" (what about Sarah Johnson!) but still wished Ms Rowling \"all strength for the final laps\", before returning to her original cri de coeur - \"for goodness sake, let's have a more level-headed publication next time.\"</p> <p> So five days after publication the early critics had had their say.

Such loose talk will offend many Labour activists Frank Dobson supporters.</p> <p>Mr Gould implicitly admits that attacks from the left - for betrayal - are part of what \"progressive governments\" must endure, not least because the media is conservative and \"the leftwing press is pretty feeble\".</p> <p>He even wonders if Labour lacks \"politicians genuinely in tune with the people.</p> <p>In his memo - spread across two pages of today's Sun - he candidly admits weaknesses but goes on to argue that, provided Labour resorts to \"utmost clarity\" and not \"confusing and abstract third way messages\", it can win again.</p>",

Perhaps it should never have been committed to paper at all. \"There is currently now a chance that our majority will fall dramatically following the pattern of 1945 and 1964 (he means 1966) _ there is growing evidence that the settled pattern of Labour's poll lead has been broken by recent events,\" Mr Gould concedes. As with Mr Blair's Chequers memo of April 29 - also leaked to the Murdoch-owned \"New Labour\" Sun and Times - the context was William Hague's spate of law and order speeches, the row over repeal of Section 28 and \"unpopularity\" over the euro. Mr Gould complains that the government seems to be drifting, \"growing almost monthly weaker and more diffuse\" unable to tackle issues it could have anticipated, but seems \"powerless to turn into effective preventative action\". Flaying the government, he warns of \"constant criticism and, worse, even ridicule\" and he talks despairingly of \"spin, lack of conviction and apparent lack of integrity, manifested by the mayoral election process\". Such loose talk will offend many Labour activists Frank Dobson supporters. Mr Gould implicitly admits that attacks from the left - for betrayal - are part of what \"progressive governments\" must endure, not least because the media is conservative and \"the leftwing press is pretty feeble\". He even wonders if Labour lacks \"politicians genuinely in tune with the people. In his memo - spread across two pages of today's Sun - he candidly admits weaknesses but goes on to argue that, provided Labour resorts to \"utmost clarity\" and not \"confusing and abstract third way messages\", it can win again.",

We have not fully modernised as a party. We have been New Labour on the economy but we have appeared soft on crime, not pro-family, lacking in gut patriotic instincts. We quickly seem to have grown out of touch. Our ministers simply do not seem as in touch as they were in Opposition. There has been no shared agreement about what is the New Labour project for the government. How do we move on to win a large majority? None of these explanations are adequate in themselves and there are others. What has gone wrong is some kind of accumulation of all of the above.

The bold, radical second term requires that we pass the threshhold requirements of the first. But we must be absolutely confident what threshhold means. It does not mean just governing with competence and delivery at a reasonable level of improvement. The threshhold is as much about instinct, endeavour, values as it is about what we have done. It is vital that we understand this. This means that in all the core areas - NHS, economy, crime, education, patriotism, social inclusion and community, family - we have not just delivered workable policies but have shown the right instincts and the right level of commitment and endeavour. In government, virtue will not reap its own reward. Delivery alone will not produce, in DA's [Douglas Alexander] phrase, deliverance. We have to win hearts as well as minds in every single one of our core areas. Our contract with the British people is as much emotional as it is rational. We must move from third way to one way. We must build a one way pattern from a mosaic of uncompromising and single-minded positions in all of the policy and issue areas rather than a whole raft of often confusing and abstract third way messages. This means that on the economy we are for stability, on education we are for standards and, for example, on crime we are tough or for zero tolerance; on the NHS we are for consumers; on Britain for patriotism; on poverty we will end it for children, etc. (These words are not right, they are examples.)

So, what I thought I would do is go through some of the things you couldn't possibly know about and then at various points, you can ...\" </p> <p>This does not sound promising. De Bono, frowning like Nixon through the gloom, is holding a piece of paper on which he has typed a list of topics. As he talks, these clarify as a list of his achievements. It is interesting that, despite the many books he has written on how to communicate, the 67-year-old disregards the first rule of exchange: namely that it is customary to allow the other person to speak occasionally. </p> <p>\"Now, for instance, there's a bunch of academics in South Africa who got together to make a CD on who had most contributed on the whole history of humanity. Anyway, I was one of the 50. Then the international astronomical union named a planet after me; again, someone suggested that they might. </p> <p>\"I have been told that on the internet there are so many references to my work that if you spent two minutes on each reference and you began work at nine in the morning and stopped at five in the afternoon, and you began aged 20, you'd not be finished by the time you were 80, doing nothing else.\" It is a statement inviting pedantry: when you put de Bono's name in one of the large search engines, it brings up 5,226 references, roughly the same number as those summoned for Michael Flatley, the star of Riverdance, and precisely half the number returned for the 1980s girl band Bananarama. Umberto Eco, by comparison, gets 27,899 mentions, Steven Hawking 28,399, Camille Paglia 14,900. </p> <p>De Bono sweeps on. \"These are other people's judgments, not my judgment. In other words, if the venture capitalists say, 'We want to hear from you,' it's their judgment. Now I'll tell you about some more direct things.\" This is the cue for another unprovoked, back-slapping anecdote. \"I was coming back from Australia and the arrivals lounge at British Airways and I was going to have a shower. And the shower attendant, standing there, this very humble chap, heard my name and said, 'Are you Edward de Bono who writes the books?' I said yes. He said, 'Oh, I read all of them, so refreshing.' This is an ordinary shower attendant at Heathrow, not a chief executive and so on.\" And so on and so on. </p> <p>The success on which de Bono's extraordinary self-regard is based came about in 1969 with the publication of his first important book, The Mechanism of Mind, in which he explored the neurological coding thought to form the basis of human perception. It was welcomed by physicists as a persuasive and authoritative study, based on years of high-level research. De Bono, born in Malta and a graduate in medicine from Malta University, won a Rhodes Scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained an honours degree in psychology and physiology and then a DPhil in medicine. </p> <p>He retains the vestige of a foreign accent, a lilting intonation that it is tempting to read as a device to minimise the chances of interruption. \"We'll come back to that,\" says de Bono, when I break his flow. \"Just remember that question and I'll talk about it all together.\" </p> <p>With the 1970s, and the boom in the self-help book market, de Bono turned his attention to the more lucrative field of popular psychology. He coined the term \"lateral thinking\", and started putting out books on problem solving and creative thinking with titles such as I Am Right, You Are Wrong, and How to Be More Interesting. </p> <p>In his book Six Thinking Hats, published in 1990, he suggested that business meetings might run more smoothly if members put on imaginary hats, colour-coded to encourage group synergy: the black hat for negative thoughts, the yellow for optimistic and so on. In this manner, says de Bono, everyone would be \"thinking in the same direction\", and \"ego would be taken out of the situation\". </p> <p>He refers to himself as a \"thinker\", a loose term that allows him to move between disciplines. He \"thinks\" about politics: \"I think the Northern Ireland situation could have been much better handled. I know most of the players - I know David Trimble, I know Gerry Adams and so on - and I've given talks on Northern Ireland; there's a lot of interest in my work.\" </p> <p>He thinks about economics: \"I suggested something that made a lot of sense: I said that, in a democracy, if your party lost the election, you should pay 10% less tax than the other party. They have the luxury of having their choice of government. It's very sensible.\" </p> <p>And he thinks about foreign policy. De Bono once advised the Foreign Office that the Arab-Israeli conflict might in part be due to the low levels of zinc found in a people who eat unleavened bread, a known side effect of which is aggression. He suggested shipping out jars of Marmite. </p> <p>Such is the pride de Bono takes in his work on conflict resolution (\"I'm on the council in England for dispute resolutions\") that it was noted with some amusement in the press recently that he lost a dispute with the Norfolk planning authorities after trying to stop a barn conversion from going ahead next door to his 18th century home. De Bono becomes quite agitated at the mention of this. \"That again, unfortunately, is totally dishonest, because I haven't been involved in that at all. Not at all. My wife is very much interested in architecture. I haven't been involved at all. I've been away. But I'm afraid that's a typical example of ... I haven't been involved at all. Typical dishonesty.\" </p> <p>Whilst he welcomes controversy as proof of the power of his work, de Bono tends to regard people who disagree with him as being either stupid or dishonest, although they leave a rather deep impression. \"When my book Six Hats came out, Adam Mars-Jones of the Independent wrote a very silly little clever-clever piece. That book, we know, has saved $40m dollars and tens of thousands of man-hours. Now, some silly little idiot, trying to be clever, compared to the actual results, that just makes him look like a fool.\" </p> <p>His next book is due out in September, and de Bono snaps out of his reverie and throws me a devilish look. \"It will upset a lot of people,\" he says triumphantly. On his website, he predicts that the book \"will upset those minds that are usually upset by my work. It will upset all the literary people who believe that language is wonderful and perfect. In the book I suggest that language is the biggest barrier to human progress because language is an encyclopaedia of ignorance. Old perceptions are frozen into language and force us to look at the world in an old-fashioned way.\" This is gibberish. </p> <p>The de Bono Code Book, as it will be called, posits the idea that communication would be better served if we all spoke in numerical code. For example, instead of saying: \"Mum, help me out, but don't lecture me,\" we might say: \"Code six.\" He throws in a few references to his old stamping ground, the neuro-physiological impulse, but it remains a mixture of bad syntax, pseudo-intellectualism and the bleeding obvious. </p> <p>It is a shame, because he has many sensible things to say, about education, about how children with hobbies develop faster than those without, about how to re-engage the long-term unemployed. To get to these, however, one must endure almost Swiftian heights of absurdity. As I'm leaving, I catch sight of a didgeridoo propped up against the door.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's government was last night shaken by further damaging disclosures about its internal strategy dilemmas when another memorandum written by Labour's pollster, Philip Gould, was leaked to the Murdoch press. Written in early May, days after Mr Blair's newly leaked memo to senior colleagues, Mr Gould's assessment restated his familiar theme: \"Our current situation is serious.\" He quoted a Blair policy unit aide at No 10 saying: \"Perhaps worst of all, the New Labour brand has been badly contaminated\" and said that Peter Mandelson, Mr Gould's old ally, privately asked: \"Something has gone seriously wrong - but what?\" Last night Labour MPs were divided between those who believe that the government is the victim of a \"high politics\" row within the Blairite kitchen cabinet and - the majority view - that the Conservatives are orchestrating a \"job lot\" of documents to cause maximum damage. \"All the recent leaks have one central theme: that Tony Blair is all spin and no substance,\" one senior Downing Street official said last night. \"Since this is being said on the very day that Gordon Brown sets out substantial plans for the next three years some people will start thinking that something pretty unfair is going on.\" Admitting that Labour's extra funding for the NHS may have come too late to meet expectations and that William Hague's populist offensive on law and order themes seems to have outflanked Labour, Mr Gould asked: \"How many ministers genuinely want to be tough on crime?\" Though the contents of the memo printed in today's Times and Sun cover much of the same \"out of touch\" ground which their sister paper the Sunday Times reported last month, the timing was clearly intended to detract attention from Gordon Brown's spending review. Senior Downing Street officials were angered by the leak and the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, is expected to include it in the inquiry he is already mounting into Monday's publication - in the same papers - of Mr Blair's memo of April 29, fretting about public misperceptions of his government. Mr Gould's memo, sent to a handful of key ministers and officials - by fax and, possibly, email - admitted that the likely Labour lead over the Tories, estimated at 42% to 37% (the Guardian's ICM poll this week put it at 42% to 35%) was \"much too close for comfort\". It contrasted Bill Clinton's shaky start in 1992 - and strong finish - with Labour's early good luck which had led to 18 months of \"drifting, growing almost monthly weaker and more diffuse\". Some Labour backbenchers and even ministers half-believe that the leaks are a symptom of internal conflict between senior Blair advisers within No 10. That seems unlikely given the stakes and the risk that any leaker would face if caught damaging both the chancellor and the prime minister. Some evidence points to the Tories being used as go-between for a leaker whose motives are money rather than politics. One fact supporting this view is that Tory officials last week boasted to journalists that they had a good story up their sleeves.

      "body": "<p>Are the chancellor's coffers half full or half empty? That all depends on how you look at it. Optimists who look ahead will find the golden dawn painted out across the sky. Colossal sums are pouring into health and education, into transport and housing. Cascades of coins reach into every crevice, from new nurseries for hard pressed working mothers to the World Service. Year after year for four years ahead, the money rolls out: spend, spend, spend on everything.</p> <p>Gloomier souls may look at it at first through different spectacles. The teachers, doctors and public service managers who have struggled through the austerity years may see this largesse with a rather more jaundiced eye. It was bought with prudence, it is the fruit of prudence, but for them prudence had been squeezed from their bone marrow in those two years that saw the lowest public spending in 35 years. The word prudence had the same threatening ring as John Major's fearful words, \"If it isn't hurting it isn't working\". It did hurt. The chancellor himself yesterday spoke of the \"damage done by decades of under-investment\", but the two worst years were his own, when public spending fell to 38.3% of GDP. (In 1976 it was 49.9% - not a fair analogy but telling nonetheless.)</p> <p>Mindful of this ambivalence, the chancellor wisely spoke in solemn tones. Beyond the odd epithet flung across to the writhing benches opposite, there was no triumphalism. This is not quite the time for Rejoice! Rejoice! The lesson has been well-learned from the announcement of the last comprehensive spending review in July 1998, which pumped up public expectations that couldn't be delivered. In the midst of the hardest spending years in living memory, people suddenly expected to see signs of miracles everywhere around them. The spending didn't begin until nine months later. Even then, government agencies atrophied by years of cuts were unable to spend it all fast enough. So this time the chancellor spoke few words: he let the figures speak for themselves, which they did eloquently. Less was more.</p> <p>Again, this money doesn't start until next April, one month before the expected election-day. Hospitals and schools will be spending, but there'll be no magic transformation. No doubt more bad-news figures will continue to trip up the government now and then - crime rising instead of falling, wrestling with the intractable hospital waiting lists and school class sizes. And yet the good signs are all there. Already good auguries abound: if every other programme works as well as the New Deal for the young unemployed, then an array of progressive social triumphs await. The New Deal is the first in a long history of unemployment schemes and projects (YTS, Yops and others) to pay for itself, covering its own costs so far in the numbers taken off benefits and found a job solely through its agency. As a totem, it's a hopeful omen for how well-spent all this money could be.</p> <p>The mountain still to be climbed was there in last week's official poverty statistics.

It's the most pressing case for a major increase in the minimum wage, pegging it to average earnings.

According to a Mori analysis this week, grumbles about taxes come a very long way behind complaints that after three years, not enough has changed.

      "bodyText": "Are the chancellor's coffers half full or half empty? That all depends on how you look at it. Optimists who look ahead will find the golden dawn painted out across the sky. Colossal sums are pouring into health and education, into transport and housing. Cascades of coins reach into every crevice, from new nurseries for hard pressed working mothers to the World Service. Year after year for four years ahead, the money rolls out: spend, spend, spend on everything. Gloomier souls may look at it at first through different spectacles. The teachers, doctors and public service managers who have struggled through the austerity years may see this largesse with a rather more jaundiced eye. It was bought with prudence, it is the fruit of prudence, but for them prudence had been squeezed from their bone marrow in those two years that saw the lowest public spending in 35 years. The word prudence had the same threatening ring as John Major's fearful words, \"If it isn't hurting it isn't working\". It did hurt. The chancellor himself yesterday spoke of the \"damage done by decades of under-investment\", but the two worst years were his own, when public spending fell to 38.3% of GDP. (In 1976 it was 49.9% - not a fair analogy but telling nonetheless.) Mindful of this ambivalence, the chancellor wisely spoke in solemn tones. Beyond the odd epithet flung across to the writhing benches opposite, there was no triumphalism. This is not quite the time for Rejoice! Rejoice! The lesson has been well-learned from the announcement of the last comprehensive spending review in July 1998, which pumped up public expectations that couldn't be delivered. In the midst of the hardest spending years in living memory, people suddenly expected to see signs of miracles everywhere around them. The spending didn't begin until nine months later. Even then, government agencies atrophied by years of cuts were unable to spend it all fast enough. So this time the chancellor spoke few words: he let the figures speak for themselves, which they did eloquently. Less was more. Again, this money doesn't start until next April, one month before the expected election-day. Hospitals and schools will be spending, but there'll be no magic transformation. No doubt more bad-news figures will continue to trip up the government now and then - crime rising instead of falling, wrestling with the intractable hospital waiting lists and school class sizes. And yet the good signs are all there. Already good auguries abound: if every other programme works as well as the New Deal for the young unemployed, then an array of progressive social triumphs await. The New Deal is the first in a long history of unemployment schemes and projects (YTS, Yops and others) to pay for itself, covering its own costs so far in the numbers taken off benefits and found a job solely through its agency. As a totem, it's a hopeful omen for how well-spent all this money could be. The mountain still to be climbed was there in last week's official poverty statistics. Some experts doubt anything the government can do will narrow the gap in earnings between richest and poorest, as all across the western world salaries at the top soar away in this boom time. What matters more is whether the government narrows the gap between the bottom and the middle, and they are starting to do that for families with children and for poor pensioners. But to hit the child-poverty abolition target, it will need more and more money from state top-up schemes to be added every year if their real incomes are to increase equally alongside general income rises.

      "body": "<p>There have been no structuralist studies on the Three Stooges, nor retrospectives at the National Film Theatre, nor film festivals showing the work of the knockabout clowns' favourite director, Edward Bernds, who has died aged 94.</p> <p>Since the essence of their low comedy, a crude relic of silent screen slapstick, consisted of eye-poking, nose-pinching, shin-kicking and head-walloping, it is hardly surprising.</p> <p>Bernds directed 25 of the Stooges films in the longest running series of two-reel comedies in cinema, allowing Moe, Larry and Curly (or Shep) to do their \"shtick\" unimpeded. Unlike other comedians, they never sought to be lovable, being content to be three unprepossessing, unruly morons.</p> <p>In fact, Bernds and his charges had their admirers among rational adults - from Jean Renoir to the Coen Brothers. But Bernds' oeuvre stretches wider, if not deeper, than the Three Stooges, and he could lay claim, more than most, to the title of \"King of the Bs\", with myriad followers of his dirt-cheap movies, the majority of which were made for Allied Artists.</p> <p>It was for that poverty row studio that he directed two camp sci-fi classics, World Without End (1956) and Queen of Outer Space (1958). In these he recycled sets and leftover spacesuits from other films, but was allowed CinemaScope and DeLuxe Color.</p> <p>In the former, astronauts find themselves in a time warp on 21st century Earth (post-nuclear war), battling a phoney giant spider, mutant cavemen and people in tights and tunics. In the latter, Zsa Zsa Gabor, in a slit skirt, is a rebel Venusian who falls in love with four earthmen whom her man-hating queen wants to destroy.</p> <p>Aside from his directorial work Bernds (pronounced Burns) was also one of the pioneers of sound. A radio operator in Chicago, he was brought out to Hollywood by United Artists to help with the transition to talking pictures.

      "bodyText": "There have been no structuralist studies on the Three Stooges, nor retrospectives at the National Film Theatre, nor film festivals showing the work of the knockabout clowns' favourite director, Edward Bernds, who has died aged 94. Since the essence of their low comedy, a crude relic of silent screen slapstick, consisted of eye-poking, nose-pinching, shin-kicking and head-walloping, it is hardly surprising. Bernds directed 25 of the Stooges films in the longest running series of two-reel comedies in cinema, allowing Moe, Larry and Curly (or Shep) to do their \"shtick\" unimpeded. Unlike other comedians, they never sought to be lovable, being content to be three unprepossessing, unruly morons. In fact, Bernds and his charges had their admirers among rational adults - from Jean Renoir to the Coen Brothers. But Bernds' oeuvre stretches wider, if not deeper, than the Three Stooges, and he could lay claim, more than most, to the title of \"King of the Bs\", with myriad followers of his dirt-cheap movies, the majority of which were made for Allied Artists. It was for that poverty row studio that he directed two camp sci-fi classics, World Without End (1956) and Queen of Outer Space (1958). In these he recycled sets and leftover spacesuits from other films, but was allowed CinemaScope and DeLuxe Color. In the former, astronauts find themselves in a time warp on 21st century Earth (post-nuclear war), battling a phoney giant spider, mutant cavemen and people in tights and tunics. In the latter, Zsa Zsa Gabor, in a slit skirt, is a rebel Venusian who falls in love with four earthmen whom her man-hating queen wants to destroy. Aside from his directorial work Bernds (pronounced Burns) was also one of the pioneers of sound. A radio operator in Chicago, he was brought out to Hollywood by United Artists to help with the transition to talking pictures. He first worked on The Iron Mask (1929), a silent film to which was added a speech at the begin ning and end delivered by Douglas Fairbanks, the film's star. After moving to Columbia Pictures, Bernds became Frank Capra's regular sound mixer, working on all but one of his films from 1930 to 1939, including It Happened One Night (1934), Mr Deeds Goes to Town (1936), and Mr Smith Goes to Washington (1939). At the same time, he was writing for Three Stooges two-reelers. It was 1944 when he took over direction. Bernds' first features were the last five of the long-running Blondie series, based on Chic Young's popular cartoon strip. However, by the time he took over, the once delightful series, starring Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake as Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead, had run out of ideas, ending with Beware of Blondie (1950). Bernds then directed two features derived from another comic strip, Gasoline Alley and Corky of Gasoline Alley (both 1951), about a young couple who run a diner, before moving on to the Bowery Boys series, seven years after it had started. Among the eight formulaic kids' Saturday matinee pictures between 1953 and 1956, featuring the ageing juvenile delinquents, Bernds was responsible for Loose in London, in which tall and gormless Sach Jones (Huntz Hall) is thought to be related to a dying British earl; Clipped Wings, where Sach and pug-nosed little punk Slip Mahoney (Leo Gorcey) join the air force; The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters, wherein Sach turns into a werewolf; and Bowery to Bagdad, with the lads spirited to Iraq by genie Eric Blore. Bernds was also involved in other enjoyably bad drive-in fodder movies: Reform School Girl (1957) - baby-doll pyjamas and an idealistic shrink; Space Master X-7 (1958) - an alien fungus called \"blood rust\" brought back by astronauts from space; High School Hellcats (1959) - girl gets into bad company at tough reform school. He was also entrusted with Return of the Fly (1959), a competent sequel in which the son of the Fly follows in his father's droppings. Ignoring the fact that the Three Stooges style of burlesque was more suited to a short film sketch than the cheapie feature, Bernds embarked on The Three Stooges Meet Hercules (1962), in which a time machine transports the trio to ancient Greece, where they wear togas with modern shoes and socks, and The Three Stooges in Orbit (1962), with Martians resembling Frankenstein monsters. The affable Bernds retired in 1965, and in recent years appeared in the television documentaries Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow and Frank Capra's American Dream. He is survived by a son, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. \u0095 Edward Bernds, film director, born July 12 1905; died May 20 2000",

Internet protocal is the language that allows computers to share resources across a network. </p> <p>In that time it has bought 21 internet companies, including yesterday's acquisitions of two internet service providers in France and Germany, two \"network integrators\" in Holland and Spain, and a web hosting company in Holland. They are expected to add $40m (\u00a324m) annually to C&amp;W's revenues and a further 30,000 customers including blue chip clients such as Microsoft, Compaq, Virgin and Warner Bros. </p> <p>Mike McTighe, chief executive of C&amp;W's global operations, said yesterday's purchases would be the last big internet acquisitions as the company now had the flexible staff base and geographical coverage to serve its business customers. </p> <p>\"I would say we are number three in the business-to-business environment in continental Europe,\" said Mr McTighe, ranking C&amp;W behind UUNet and PSINetinternet. European business was slightly ahead of plan but the group was only three months into the new financial year. </p> <p>C&amp;W will co-brand the companies it acquires for the first 12 months, after which they adopt the name of the London-based company. It has internet operations in Britain, Germany, Holland, Spain, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, France, Austria and Belgium. </p> <p>In 2000, 40% of the group's revenues were sourced from data and internet protocol services and the remainder from voice. </p> <p>C&amp;W has said it will spend $3.5bn by 2001 boosting its network coverage as well as its customer and traffic acquisition. </p> <p>The company last week opened one of Europe's largest web hosting facilities in Swindon and has recently completed a partnership with Nokia to deliver an internet platform for mobile phones.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cable &amp; Wireless yesterday staked its claim to being the third largest provider of internet services to the burgeoning European business-to-business sector after it spent \u00a3100m buying up web companies. C&amp;W bought five internet-related businesses in Europe where it has been aggressively building a portfolio of companies that provide services including web hosting and design, network integration, e-commerce and the delivery of application services where businesses can rent software over the net. In 18 months C&amp;W has spent \u00a3650m transforming itself from a traditional telecoms operator, that derived most of its revenue from voice traffic, to an organisation that is increasing its investment in data and internet protocol services. Internet protocal is the language that allows computers to share resources across a network. In that time it has bought 21 internet companies, including yesterday's acquisitions of two internet service providers in France and Germany, two \"network integrators\" in Holland and Spain, and a web hosting company in Holland. They are expected to add $40m (\u00a324m) annually to C&amp;W's revenues and a further 30,000 customers including blue chip clients such as Microsoft, Compaq, Virgin and Warner Bros. Mike McTighe, chief executive of C&amp;W's global operations, said yesterday's purchases would be the last big internet acquisitions as the company now had the flexible staff base and geographical coverage to serve its business customers. \"I would say we are number three in the business-to-business environment in continental Europe,\" said Mr McTighe, ranking C&amp;W behind UUNet and PSINetinternet. European business was slightly ahead of plan but the group was only three months into the new financial year. C&amp;W will co-brand the companies it acquires for the first 12 months, after which they adopt the name of the London-based company. It has internet operations in Britain, Germany, Holland, Spain, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, France, Austria and Belgium. In 2000, 40% of the group's revenues were sourced from data and internet protocol services and the remainder from voice. C&amp;W has said it will spend $3.5bn by 2001 boosting its network coverage as well as its customer and traffic acquisition. The company last week opened one of Europe's largest web hosting facilities in Swindon and has recently completed a partnership with Nokia to deliver an internet platform for mobile phones.",

      "body": "<p>A racially motivated assault by nationalists on ethnic Indians living in a village in the Dawasamu area, near Suva, may prove to be a harbinger of worsening violence and division in Fiji. Local newspapers reported yesterday that about 100 families had been forced to flee their homes as the attackers looted and set buildings on fire and terrorised the inhabitants at knifepoint.</p> <p>This is not the first such incident since George Speight, a failed businessman turned populist demagogue, launched an armed coup against the elected, Indian-led government in May. Last week's negotiated end to the ensuing hostage siege, the appointment of a new president, and the creation yesterday of a nationalist-minded cabinet has done little to reduce tensions. With the country split demographically by 56% to 44% between indigenous Fijians and Indians, close cooperation between the two groups would seem to be necessary and unavoidable. Fiji's hard-won 1997 multiracial constitution did indeed provide a framework for power-sharing.

      "bodyText": "A racially motivated assault by nationalists on ethnic Indians living in a village in the Dawasamu area, near Suva, may prove to be a harbinger of worsening violence and division in Fiji. Local newspapers reported yesterday that about 100 families had been forced to flee their homes as the attackers looted and set buildings on fire and terrorised the inhabitants at knifepoint. This is not the first such incident since George Speight, a failed businessman turned populist demagogue, launched an armed coup against the elected, Indian-led government in May. Last week's negotiated end to the ensuing hostage siege, the appointment of a new president, and the creation yesterday of a nationalist-minded cabinet has done little to reduce tensions. With the country split demographically by 56% to 44% between indigenous Fijians and Indians, close cooperation between the two groups would seem to be necessary and unavoidable. Fiji's hard-won 1997 multiracial constitution did indeed provide a framework for power-sharing. But that document, along with credible democratic rule, trust and goodwill, has been wilfully destroyed by Mr Speight's and his supporters' arrogant insistence on racial dominance and by the unsavoury, unwise complicity of the tribal chiefs and the military. Given that the new government lacks Indian members in any senior posts (some candidates are said to have refused to serve out of fear for their families' safety), and given that Mr Speight is still not satisfied, despite the jobs offered to several of his supporters, there seems every prospect of more trouble like that at Dawasamu. Ratu Josefa Iloilo, the new president, describes himself as \"dedicated to promoting national unity and encouraging moderation, inclusiveness, consideration and compassion for all in our country\". But his prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, who has usurped the position rightfully held by the deposed Mahendra Chaudhry, gives the lie to such utterances. Before being confirmed in office, he sought to appease nationalists with guarantees of preferential treatment and affirmative action favouring indigenous Fijians, coupled with vague promises of wealth redistribution. Just how long do these people think the Indian community's forbearance will last? Along with the political, social, and human damage, the economic bill grows daily.

This was estimated to total \u00a34.2b over three years, including an estimated \u00a3600m for new Objective 1 projects in the English regions. Public spending in Wales will be allowed to increase by an average of 5.4 % in real terms over the next three years, the biggest increase the Welsh settlement has ever had.</p> <p>The spending figures - rising from \u00a38bn this year to \u00a310bn in 2003-04 - include \u00a3421m the assembly can draw down from EU funds allocated to west Wales and the valleys under Objective 1.</p> <p>But opposition number crunchers were quick to claim that Wales was being short changed. The Labour executive faces a torrid time during a debate on the spending review this morning.</p> <p>Plaid Cymru called the settlement a slap in the face for Wales, claiming that only part of the \u00a31.2bn EU component of the regeneration funds was being made available and that no government money had been allocated for match funding.</p> <p>The Conservative economic development spokesman, Alun Cairns, said the prime minister had failed to live up to his promise not to let Wales down. He said match funding for Objective 1 would have to be found from budgets set aside for education and health.</p> <p>The three English counties have been promised a total of \u00a32bn under Objective 1, while west Wales and the valleys are in line for \u00a31.2bn.</p> <p>Cornwall county council gave a cautious welcome to the statement but said it would need to see the details.</p> <p>The county needs to raise \u00a3300m in match funding to unlock \u00a3300m of EU aid for regeneration projects.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/csr/story/0,2763,344701,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Andrew Rawnsley: analysis</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sr2000/report/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Spending review: full text</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/csr/story/0,2763,344690,00.html\">Full text of chancellor's speech</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,344654,00.html\">The issue explained</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor's promise of a new approach to raise investment levels in some of the poorest parts of the UK was greeted with delight yesterday. Large parts of Wales, together with Cornwall, South Yorkshire and Merseyside, stand to benefit from billions of pounds in aid under Europe's Objective 1 programme to regenerate economically deprived parts of the EU. The chancellor said that within the departmental allocations made yesterday the government would ensure funding for the European structural funds projects, including Objective 1. This was estimated to total \u00a34.2b over three years, including an estimated \u00a3600m for new Objective 1 projects in the English regions. Public spending in Wales will be allowed to increase by an average of 5.4 % in real terms over the next three years, the biggest increase the Welsh settlement has ever had. The spending figures - rising from \u00a38bn this year to \u00a310bn in 2003-04 - include \u00a3421m the assembly can draw down from EU funds allocated to west Wales and the valleys under Objective 1. But opposition number crunchers were quick to claim that Wales was being short changed. The Labour executive faces a torrid time during a debate on the spending review this morning. Plaid Cymru called the settlement a slap in the face for Wales, claiming that only part of the \u00a31.2bn EU component of the regeneration funds was being made available and that no government money had been allocated for match funding. The Conservative economic development spokesman, Alun Cairns, said the prime minister had failed to live up to his promise not to let Wales down. He said match funding for Objective 1 would have to be found from budgets set aside for education and health. The three English counties have been promised a total of \u00a32bn under Objective 1, while west Wales and the valleys are in line for \u00a31.2bn. Cornwall county council gave a cautious welcome to the statement but said it would need to see the details. The county needs to raise \u00a3300m in match funding to unlock \u00a3300m of EU aid for regeneration projects.

Before then even the elite of society, who appeared in portraits, had nothing to be proud of in their teeth. He admits that teeth and open mouths occasionally appeared in art before the late 18th century, but the depiction usually suggested there was something wrong with the subject.</p> <p>\"Protocols of artistic representation in place since antiquity had not permitted the exposure of teeth in a portrait without that gesture being coded as revealing its subject to be demotic, demented or morally deformed,\" he said. \"Yet it had become just possible by the end of the ancien r\u00e9gime for a painter to show a beautiful woman smiling and showing her teeth without such pejorative connotations.\"</p> <p>Jacob Simon, curator of 18th century portraiture at the National Portrait Gallery, in London, said the earliest open-mouthed portrait in their collection was a painting of Lord Nelson's mistress, Emma, Lady Hamilton, by George Romney. The Hamilton portrait was painted two years earlier than that of Mme Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun, in 1785, but Mr Simon conceded that given the prejudices of the time the sitter might have come under Prof Jones's heading of \"demotic, demented or morally deformed\".</p> <p>\"The toothy smile is a 20th century clich\u00e9,\" Mr Simon said. \"I can first find it in the very late 18th century but then only fairly sporadically until you get to the 20th.\"</p> <p>The word dentist was coined in Paris in 1728 by the surgeon Pierre Fauchard, who first laid out the scientific principles of modern dentistry and emphasised the care and preservation of teeth rather than pulling them out when they were rotten. He rose to fame at a time when syphilis and the mercury-based contemporary cure for it were ravaging people's teeth and the mass consumption of sugar was under way.</p> <p>Before the emergence of Fauchard Parisians depended on such tyrants of the mouth as Fat Thomas, an enormous tooth-puller who used to practise on the Pont Neuf dressed in a hat with peacock feathers and a scarlet Turkish coat, under the banner \"The Tooth, and If Not, the Jaw\".</p> <p>Louis XIV, the Sun King, lost half his upper jaw to a determined tooth-puller in the 1680s. At that time the best false teeth on offer were discarded human teeth fitted to hippopotamus jaw, or the discoloured wooden dentures worn by George Washington.</p> <p>But in the enlightenment of the later 18th century Paris became to dentistry what California is today - the leading source of toothbrushes, a centre for tooth powders and the origin of porcelain false teeth as an alternative to hippo jaw.</p> <p>Fauchard himself pioneered a popular spring-loaded style of denture, which had an unfortunate tendency to jump out of the owner's mouth without warning.</p>",

He admits that teeth and open mouths occasionally appeared in art before the late 18th century, but the depiction usually suggested there was something wrong with the subject. \"Protocols of artistic representation in place since antiquity had not permitted the exposure of teeth in a portrait without that gesture being coded as revealing its subject to be demotic, demented or morally deformed,\" he said. \"Yet it had become just possible by the end of the ancien r\u00e9gime for a painter to show a beautiful woman smiling and showing her teeth without such pejorative connotations.\" Jacob Simon, curator of 18th century portraiture at the National Portrait Gallery, in London, said the earliest open-mouthed portrait in their collection was a painting of Lord Nelson's mistress, Emma, Lady Hamilton, by George Romney. The Hamilton portrait was painted two years earlier than that of Mme Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun, in 1785, but Mr Simon conceded that given the prejudices of the time the sitter might have come under Prof Jones's heading of \"demotic, demented or morally deformed\". \"The toothy smile is a 20th century clich\u00e9,\" Mr Simon said. \"I can first find it in the very late 18th century but then only fairly sporadically until you get to the 20th.\" The word dentist was coined in Paris in 1728 by the surgeon Pierre Fauchard, who first laid out the scientific principles of modern dentistry and emphasised the care and preservation of teeth rather than pulling them out when they were rotten. He rose to fame at a time when syphilis and the mercury-based contemporary cure for it were ravaging people's teeth and the mass consumption of sugar was under way. Before the emergence of Fauchard Parisians depended on such tyrants of the mouth as Fat Thomas, an enormous tooth-puller who used to practise on the Pont Neuf dressed in a hat with peacock feathers and a scarlet Turkish coat, under the banner \"The Tooth, and If Not, the Jaw\". Louis XIV, the Sun King, lost half his upper jaw to a determined tooth-puller in the 1680s. At that time the best false teeth on offer were discarded human teeth fitted to hippopotamus jaw, or the discoloured wooden dentures worn by George Washington. But in the enlightenment of the later 18th century Paris became to dentistry what California is today - the leading source of toothbrushes, a centre for tooth powders and the origin of porcelain false teeth as an alternative to hippo jaw. Fauchard himself pioneered a popular spring-loaded style of denture, which had an unfortunate tendency to jump out of the owner's mouth without warning.",

In London the Foreign Office minister, John Battle, called in the Fijian high commissioner, Filimone Jitoko, to press for the restoration of democratic rights in Fiji. But the Foreign Office decided against trade sanctions saying the impact would be felt by the poorest Fijians and the ethnic Indian population, who make up the bulk of the business community. The new government was formed after a 56-day hostage crisis instigated by George Speight, leader of a Fijian nationalist movement. Britain, which has no aid programme to Fiji, has already stopped ministerial and military visits and supported the suspension of Fiji from Commonwealth councils. Britain's main import from Fiji is sugar. Tourism from Britain has already been hit because of the hostage crisis. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the British high commissioner, Michael Dibben, had been recalled \"for consultation\", a diplomatic device for registering a protest without breaking ties. Mr Battle said yesterday: \"We are disturbed that the deal struck to secure the release of the hostages abrogates the 1997 constitution and leaves almost half the population of Fiji without democratic representation.\" He added: \"Relief at the safe release of all the hostages should not obscure the fact that the crisis for Fiji is not over.\" The Foreign Office said: \"We are not going down the trade sanctions route because that kind of thing would not affect Speight but would affect people who are already suffering.\" Although the government includes representatives from Mr Speight's group, he has only four sympathisers in a government that comprises 20 cabinet ministers and 12 assistant ministers.

Chris Emmett, 35, and trainee lawyer Christian Jideofo, 40, were found guilty at the Old Bailey yesterday on conspiracy charges relating to their part in the four-year racket. New passports were supplied to people who had overstayed their permission to stay in Britain. Emmett, an immigration officer at Gatwick airport, stamped the passports, giving their holders the right to enter Britain indefinitely. Emmett and Jideofo collected \u00a33,000 a time from clients, mainly from Nigeria and Ghana. Some 76 people helped to stay in Britain have been traced so far, but sources with knowledge of the case believe the total could be as high as 600. Mark Gadsden, prosecuting, told the jury the 76 were just \"the visible tip of a much larger iceberg\". Judge Timothy Pontius adjourned sentencing until Friday and said he would hold an assets confiscation hearing on Emmett in November. Mr Gadsden said that proceeds from the sale of two properties had been found in a Channel Islands account under the name of a company which owned the house that was Emmett's home in Purley, Surrey. He told the court that between 1992 and 1996 Emmett had \"grossly abused the trust\" he had held. His wife, Elizabeth Emmett, 30, who had also worked as an immigration officer at Gatwick, was cleared in the middle of the seven-week trial when the judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence against her. Emmett said in court that his lavish lifestyle came from businesses he ran selling second hand cars and double glazing. During one eight-month period he had spent \u00a3250,000, about \u00a31,000 a day, on \"lavish living\". The jury took five hours to find Emmett and Jideofo guilty of conspiracy to defraud the home secretary and conspiracy to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants into the UK. A Home Office spokesman said that officials would examine what lessons could be learned: \"This verdict is the successful conclusion of a lengthy and complicated joint investigation by the Metropolitan police and the immigration service. \"The investigation demonstrates our commitment to rooting out corruption within the public service.\" Lawyers for Jideofo and Emmett were considering an appeal. In court they had argued that those who had bought stamps and passports to remain in Britain, and had testified for the prosecution, had done so because they had been promised, or hoped for, permission to stay. The Home Office last night was adamant that \"no deals were done\". But in a report on one prosecution witness, George Ukor, an immigration officer wrote: \"Recommend that leave to enter be deferred until after the court appearance so as not to prejudice the outcome.\" Mike Schwarz, solicitor for Jideofo, said: \"It was a case where the prosecution was as much on trial as the defendants.\"",

They married two weeks later in Las Vegas.</p> <p>The couple had carried out a clandestine love affair because her family did not approve of the relationship.</p> <p>Ms Khalifa will have to prove that she qualifies as a political asylum seeker. Her lawyers argue that she would face serious persecution if she was deported to Bahrain. But according to the the Gulf state's Washington embassy, her family have stressed that they love her and that she will face no reprisals.</p> <p>In making his ruling at a closed session hearing of the immigration and naturalisation court in San Diego, the judge made it clear that the onus was on Ms Khalifa - whose father is one of the many cousins of Kuwait's emir - to prove that she faced a genuine threat if sent home.</p> <p>\"I can guarantee that this is not just as case of 'Daddy will be mad at me',\" Jan Bejar, the lawyer representing the couple, told reporters. He said he was seeking a delay of 90 days before the next hearing, to compile a defence.</p> <p>Private Johnson has said in interviews that his wife could face death at the hands of people whipped up by angry Muslim clerics if she went home, on the basis that she had eloped with a non-Muslim who was also an American.

      "bodyText": "The story of an American marine who fell for a young woman from Bahrain's ruling clan and forged military papers so she could enter the United States has failed to captivate the heart of an immigration court judge. Hollywood, which has already bought the love-across-the-divide story, must now wait to see whether it has a happy ending. A California judge, Ignacio Fernandez, refused on Monday to drop a charge of illegal entry to the US against Meriem al-Khalifa, 19, who came to the country in November last year after falling in love with Jason Johnson, 25, a US marine she met at a Bahraini shopping mall. They married two weeks later in Las Vegas. The couple had carried out a clandestine love affair because her family did not approve of the relationship. Ms Khalifa will have to prove that she qualifies as a political asylum seeker. Her lawyers argue that she would face serious persecution if she was deported to Bahrain. But according to the the Gulf state's Washington embassy, her family have stressed that they love her and that she will face no reprisals. In making his ruling at a closed session hearing of the immigration and naturalisation court in San Diego, the judge made it clear that the onus was on Ms Khalifa - whose father is one of the many cousins of Kuwait's emir - to prove that she faced a genuine threat if sent home. \"I can guarantee that this is not just as case of 'Daddy will be mad at me',\" Jan Bejar, the lawyer representing the couple, told reporters. He said he was seeking a delay of 90 days before the next hearing, to compile a defence. Private Johnson has said in interviews that his wife could face death at the hands of people whipped up by angry Muslim clerics if she went home, on the basis that she had eloped with a non-Muslim who was also an American. Middle East experts in the US have said they doubt this, Bahrain being fairly liberal in some respects, but that social stigma could attach to her. The couple had hoped that the court would throw out the immigration authorities' charges and allow Ms Khalifa to apply for permanent residence. But the use of forged military documents is not being taken lightly by the authorities. With the papers, Ms Khalifa boarded a commercial flight to the US . Landing in Chicago, she tried to go through immigration wearing baggy clothes and a New York Yankees baseball cap, so as to resemble an American, but officials stopped her. The Marine Corps demoted Mr Johnson to private and assigned him extra duty. Since being married the couple have lived at Camp Pendleton, the marines' base north of San Diego.",

The armed forces this year will also get a one-off payment of \u00a3200m from the Treasury's reserve in recognition, a senior defence official said yesterday, of the need to replace equipment shortcomings exposed by the Kosovo war. The budget, which restores some of the cuts imposed by the 1998 strategic defence review, were settled only \"late in the day\" after tough negotiations with the Treasury, officials said. In a leaked memo written in April, Tony Blair warned his advisers: \"On defence, we need to make the [comprehensive spending review] work for defence.

He added: \"We are not going to be announcing any big new projects.\" Finessing the figures, the Ministry of Defence described the rise as \"the first planned real terms increase\" in its budget since 1985, before the end of the cold war. The government also announced a new \"conflict prevention\" budget managed by the MoD, the Foreign Office, and Department for International Development. It will total about \u00a3500m next year, with a quarter earmarked for Africa where almost half of all war-related deaths occur. However, officials said it was unclear what kind of crisis this new budget - which could provoke inter-departmental disputes - would cover. Figures published by the Treasury also reveal that the combined budget for the security and intelligence agencies - MI5, MI6, and GCHQ - will rise from \u00a3803m this year to \u00a3941m in three years' time, an increase of about 17%.

We'll get a nice headline out of it, too: RIP, RIP.

Half the country uses email these days: they don't much fancy having their steamy one-liners to Sandra in Marketing being pored over by PC Plod either. This is a good example of what could be a liberal, yet populist issue: we can call it Stop the Snoops. I, personally, should be associated with this.</p> <p>Anyway, back to those touchstone issues. First, we might need to see off all this spin-not-substance, government-by-focus-group stuff. I think there's a way to do that. We can say that, yes, we are populists - if populism means listening to the people of this country and respecting what they believe. Sometimes that will mean taking the temperature at an MP's surgery, sometimes a session with a focus group. The principle is the same: in a democracy, no politician has to apologise for listening to the people and trying to deliver what they want. After all, we know what we think of politicians who are out of touch with popular feeling: we call them arrogant and kick them out of office.</p> <p>But we should take this argument further. We have to stress that there need be no clash between this kind of populism and radical, conviction politics. Instead, it means conviction radicals simply have to make their case to the broad mass of public opinion. Any liberal who fears that cannot be done is a faint-heart who doubts the appeal of his or her own ideas. If our vision is right, it will appeal - as long as we are creative in explaining it. Put simply, we can make a populist, tabloid-friendly case for a radical, centre-left agenda. We just have to dare.</p> <p>My thoughts are:</p> <p>i) Crime: here's an example of a nut we cracked once - only to forget how we did it. As you all know, I coined, with no help whatsoever from any other senior Labour figure, what may be the liberal-populist slogan of the decade: tough on crime, tough on the causes of the crime. The sheer brilliance of that line was that it captured both halves of our message. Now, the kind of panic-artists who dreamed up that nonsense about \u00a3100 on-the-spot cashpoint fines were remembering only the first bit of the slogan. We forgot to push the second half: tough on the causes of crime.</p> <p>Via that phrase, Gordon's announcement yesterday of squillions more on education can be linked directly to our crime agenda. So can the great success of the New Deal. We can say that we are getting to grips with the roots of crime - attacking the spiral of poverty and deprivation that causes our young men to go off the rails. Sure, it doesn't feed into improved crime statistics straightaway. These things take time. But link our work on the roots of crime with a proper respect for the law - rather than abusing it with on-the-hoof wheezes that solve nothing - and we will do the right thing and win popular plaudits.</p> <p>ii) Asylum seekers. So far we have run around boasting about our toughness on \"removals\", only mentioning genuine refugees as an afterthought. We have got this the wrong way around. We need to remind people first of the basic, human obligation to welcome the stranger in need - and, second, we need to explain what's in it for us: spelling out how much Britain has gained from newcomers.</p> <p>Once again, this will lend itself easily to populist treatment. Get me to visit some refuge where there are a whole lot of asylum seekers (preferably women with children) who underwent unspeakable torture in the countries they fled. Get that on the Six O'Clock News and just watch the numbers shift. I'll get into full Diana mode, holding hands and listening to stories. Next we'll get a whole lot of celebs to tell how their parents/grandparents were the asylum seekers of their day: Ben Elton or Ken Hom or Meera Syal, it doesn't matter. Just as long as middle England realises how many of its favourites trace their roots to middle Europe, middle Asia or middle Africa.</p> <p>With that in place, establishing the legitimate right of people to immigrate, then we can be as hard as we like on people who abuse the rules. Until now, we have whipped up too much anger on the latter, unable to draw on any goodwill toward the former. The Kosovo campaign proved the British can be a compassionate nation when confronted with real people in distress, no matter how different they are from ourselves. We can tap into that again.</p> <p>There are similar, populist versions of every one of the policies the cautious say are too liberal, or too unpopular for Labour to run on and win. We just have to have the courage to make our case. We don't have to match the Daily Mail brand of rightwing populism with rightwingery of our own. Instead, we can be leftwing and populist - with no apologies.</p> <p>While we're at it, we may want to question the status of all these cultural matters as \"touchstones\". My guess is that voters still judge governments on the core tasks: education, health, pensions. Here we need to keep our heads down, make the right reforms and spend the money Gordon doled out yesterday. We have a decent story to tell here. People felt the pain for three years while we sorted out the fundamentals and got the economy right. Now they can feel the gain in gradually-improving public services, knowing that they are living in a house built on secure foundations. Oh, and let's be populist about this, too: let's talk about tangibles, rather than abstracts - about hip-replacement factories, rather than \u00a320bn investments. And remember.

I don't like garlic very much anyway, but my husband is always trying to get me to cook my lamb curry, because he says it's the best. Person I don't like? Er that's hard. I don't like Denise Van Outen, I think she's a bit common, if you see what I mean. And very rude, I don't like that. I think my husband does though, hm.\"",

Ministers have acted on recommendations from a recent national strategy for neighbourhood renewal with a modest \u00a3400m to help tackle what the chancellor called the causes of poverty, rather than just the consequences. Gordon Brown also announced a \u00a3500m boost in the budgets of eight English regional development agencies, and ruled that they would be able to decide priorities of their own within a block grant. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister and environment secretary, hailed the spending review as a big boost for the regions and local government, with spending set to rise by 11% a year on average over the next three years.

Ministers are also working on a financial package to \"maintain the post office network in both rural and urban areas\", the chancellor said. Pressure groups generally responded warmly to the initiative, which involves a \u00a3400m new neighbourhood renewal fund, building on recommendations from a report by the government's social exclusion unit. The unit's recent national strategy for neighbourhood renewal suggested a special cross-cutting mini department in Whitehall that could oversee work principally undertaken by the Department of the Environment, the Department for Education and Employment and the Home Office in many of the country's 3,000 poorest communities. The chancellor has decided to place faith in new partnerships between councils and Whitehall to deliver a national strategy aimed at bridging the divide between the poorest communities and the rest of the country.

Management at the Liverpool hospital were aware of his condition before he performed any operations, but considered the surgeon to be in a low-risk category for transmitting the virus. The patients in Scotland became infected with hepatitis B last year. It is understood that the surgeon is now working in the United States. Letters have been sent to his former patients advising them to contact their doctor for a blood test. Mike Bone, chief executive of the Broadgreen cardiothoracic centre, said: \"Because it is some years since the exposure, there is a very, very small chance that anybody could still be infected. Some people who catch the infection do not have any signs, that is why we are offering the blood tests.\" He said there was no criticism of the surgeon. Tony Hart, consultant microbiologist at the centre, said: \"When the surgeon came to work here he told us he had hepatitis B, but at the same time was graded as a low-risk carrier. Our understanding of the disease has since changed and under new Department of Health guidelines we have undertaken this procedure to identify those patients.\" He said none of the former patients who had been contacted had developed any symptoms of acute hepatitis. The treatments carried out at the centre by Mr Gehlot included heart bypass operations and open heart surgery. He also worked as a junior doctor on heart operations at Castle Hill and Cottingham hospitals in Hull between March 1990 and January 1991. East Riding and Hull health authority said that it had contacted 139 of the surgeon's former patients. \"We recognise that patients may be anxious about this news but they can be reassured that all the research evidence shows the risk of infection is very remote,\" the joint statement by the health authority and hospital trust said. \"Nevertheless, following national guidelines, we have taken the view that it is prudent to take all precautionary steps possible.\"",

Gordon Brown announced a \"major package\" of investment in services for elderly people would be unveiled next week, the principal plank of which would be proposals on funding care of the elderly. He also flagged the \"pensioners' credit,\" aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest elderly people, proposals for which are due in the autumn. This was highlighted in the March budget, when Mr Brown said it should mean that a pensioner with income of less than \u00a3100 a week, or a couple with less than \u00a3150, would qualify for the new credit to improve their income. The pensioners' credit has been mentioned \"time and time again,\" and all the speculation suggested that the announcement on long-term care was likely to deliver a blow to many elderly people by requiring them to pay a large part of their nursing costs, Help the Aged said. \"In the biggest spending increase in recent history, the old have been overlooked yet again,\" said the charity.

      "byline": "Jane Cornwell",

      "body": "<p>Jimmy Little strolls on to the stage at Hanover Expo in a powder-blue suit, bootlace tie and Cuban heels, a stylish counterpoint to the jeans and T-shirts of his guest backing band, Karma County. \"Music is one of those beautiful things in life that helps us to understand stories,\" says the 63-year-old aborigine softly, launching into a languid rendition of Nick Cave's (Are You) The One I've Been Waiting For. \"I've never left Australia before now,\" he adds. \"This is all wonderfully weird.\" </p> <p>Though not, perhaps, as weird as the concept album that got him here in the first place. Messenger, Little's 27th commercial recording, is a collection of 11 songs from Australia's contemporary rock canon, crooned by an artist who began his career at 16, had a number one in 1964 with a country gospel number called Royal Telephone and was for years Australia's only aboriginal music star. </p> <p>Little rose to fame singing international hits, as was insisted by the live audiences of the day. (\"I'd get booed off otherwise,\" he says). When the burgeoning pop market checked the demand for his Bobby Darin and Everly Brothers covers, he returned to the gentle country-rock beloved of indigenous Australians. The Jimmy Little Country Spectacular filled the clubs until the early 80s, its demise hastened by the alternative rock scene that Messenger so smoothly subverts. </p> <p>Little was languishing in semi-obscurity on Sydney's pub circuit when he was spotted by Karma County frontman, Brendan Gallagher, in 1996. \"I was transfixed,\" Gallagher recalls. \"All I could think of was getting that voice on tape.\" Little's \"interpretations\" were released in Australia last year. Where, thanks to a combination of critical acclaim, cross-generational appeal and approval from the songwriters - \"Jimmy Little has the sweetest, saddest voice in Australia,\" observed Neil Finn - Messenger has become ubiquitous. </p> <p>Here were songs of love, loss and yearning by cult artists such as the Church, the Go Betweens and Ed Kuepper, songs that had entered the national psyche, sung by an old-style crooner enjoying a Terry Callier-like renaissance. Little considers aboriginality a professional irrelevance. But - in a climate where Australian prime minister John Howard refuses to apologise formally for the sins of his forebears - he has become a reluctant spokesperson for his people. </p> <p>The eldest of seven children, Little was raised among his mother's people, the Yorta Yorta, at the Cummeragunja Mission in northern Victoria. When not working as a fruit picker, his father headed a touring vaudeville troupe that featured a 30- member all-male gum-leaf orchestra (just fold one over and blow). Entertaining rural white Australians meant blacking up to sing Mammy before imparting serious cultural messages with Dreamtime myths and original guitar-led songs such as Give the Coloured Lad a Chance. </p> <p>\"A non-indigenous audience didn't want to hear too many of the traditional stories,\" says Little in Hanover. \"They wanted to hear the big-screen musicals performed live.\" He nonetheless cites the singing cowboys and minstrels he saw at his local picture theatre - where aborigines were segregated from whites - as among his early influences. \"I knew then I wanted to be a troubadour. My pride in my heritage has always been intact. I saw myself as an urban warrior from the bushland. Instead of hunting emus and wallabies I was hunting jobs and opportunities.\" </p> <p>Little was awarded Pop Star of the Year in 1964, the era of the racist White Australia Policy, when Rolf Harris was still singing the line \"Let me abos go loose, Bruce\" on Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. He says it made him all the more determined to be himself, and insists that the evergreen popular ballads he covered have parallels with the oral tradition of his culture. By moving into country music he was also returning to his roots: post-war, aborigines appropriated an American genre they heard constantly over the wireless and used it to take their stories to a wider audience. </p> <p>\"I didn't want to restrict myself to just one style, either,\" shrugs Little, who was inducted into the Australasian Country Music Roll of Renown in 1994. \"I wanted to diversify.\" His other great love - aside, that is, from his wife of 45 years, Marjorie Rose - is acting. Forays have included a role in a 1959 Billy Graham film, Shadow of the Boomerang, and most recently as an aboriginal elder in Wim Wenders's Until the End of the World. \"I've used the arts to send the message out in all directions,\" he says. </p> <p>In the 80s, with his audiences dwindling, Little took a break from performing and qualified as a teacher of aboriginal studies. \"I went walkabout,\" he smiles. \"I wanted to take my experience of the mainstream back to the classroom, to see if there were any other Jimmy Littles there.

      "bodyText": "Jimmy Little strolls on to the stage at Hanover Expo in a powder-blue suit, bootlace tie and Cuban heels, a stylish counterpoint to the jeans and T-shirts of his guest backing band, Karma County. \"Music is one of those beautiful things in life that helps us to understand stories,\" says the 63-year-old aborigine softly, launching into a languid rendition of Nick Cave's (Are You) The One I've Been Waiting For. \"I've never left Australia before now,\" he adds. \"This is all wonderfully weird.\" Though not, perhaps, as weird as the concept album that got him here in the first place. Messenger, Little's 27th commercial recording, is a collection of 11 songs from Australia's contemporary rock canon, crooned by an artist who began his career at 16, had a number one in 1964 with a country gospel number called Royal Telephone and was for years Australia's only aboriginal music star. Little rose to fame singing international hits, as was insisted by the live audiences of the day. (\"I'd get booed off otherwise,\" he says). When the burgeoning pop market checked the demand for his Bobby Darin and Everly Brothers covers, he returned to the gentle country-rock beloved of indigenous Australians. The Jimmy Little Country Spectacular filled the clubs until the early 80s, its demise hastened by the alternative rock scene that Messenger so smoothly subverts. Little was languishing in semi-obscurity on Sydney's pub circuit when he was spotted by Karma County frontman, Brendan Gallagher, in 1996. \"I was transfixed,\" Gallagher recalls. \"All I could think of was getting that voice on tape.\" Little's \"interpretations\" were released in Australia last year. Where, thanks to a combination of critical acclaim, cross-generational appeal and approval from the songwriters - \"Jimmy Little has the sweetest, saddest voice in Australia,\" observed Neil Finn - Messenger has become ubiquitous. Here were songs of love, loss and yearning by cult artists such as the Church, the Go Betweens and Ed Kuepper, songs that had entered the national psyche, sung by an old-style crooner enjoying a Terry Callier-like renaissance. Little considers aboriginality a professional irrelevance. But - in a climate where Australian prime minister John Howard refuses to apologise formally for the sins of his forebears - he has become a reluctant spokesperson for his people. The eldest of seven children, Little was raised among his mother's people, the Yorta Yorta, at the Cummeragunja Mission in northern Victoria. When not working as a fruit picker, his father headed a touring vaudeville troupe that featured a 30- member all-male gum-leaf orchestra (just fold one over and blow). Entertaining rural white Australians meant blacking up to sing Mammy before imparting serious cultural messages with Dreamtime myths and original guitar-led songs such as Give the Coloured Lad a Chance. \"A non-indigenous audience didn't want to hear too many of the traditional stories,\" says Little in Hanover. \"They wanted to hear the big-screen musicals performed live.\" He nonetheless cites the singing cowboys and minstrels he saw at his local picture theatre - where aborigines were segregated from whites - as among his early influences. \"I knew then I wanted to be a troubadour. My pride in my heritage has always been intact. I saw myself as an urban warrior from the bushland. Instead of hunting emus and wallabies I was hunting jobs and opportunities.\" Little was awarded Pop Star of the Year in 1964, the era of the racist White Australia Policy, when Rolf Harris was still singing the line \"Let me abos go loose, Bruce\" on Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. He says it made him all the more determined to be himself, and insists that the evergreen popular ballads he covered have parallels with the oral tradition of his culture. By moving into country music he was also returning to his roots: post-war, aborigines appropriated an American genre they heard constantly over the wireless and used it to take their stories to a wider audience. \"I didn't want to restrict myself to just one style, either,\" shrugs Little, who was inducted into the Australasian Country Music Roll of Renown in 1994. \"I wanted to diversify.\" His other great love - aside, that is, from his wife of 45 years, Marjorie Rose - is acting. Forays have included a role in a 1959 Billy Graham film, Shadow of the Boomerang, and most recently as an aboriginal elder in Wim Wenders's Until the End of the World. \"I've used the arts to send the message out in all directions,\" he says. In the 80s, with his audiences dwindling, Little took a break from performing and qualified as a teacher of aboriginal studies. \"I went walkabout,\" he smiles. \"I wanted to take my experience of the mainstream back to the classroom, to see if there were any other Jimmy Littles there. I'd tell them, 'You need to be in touch with your past to know where your future is.'\" At the end of that decade he was named Aboriginal of the Year. With such an impressive CV (he's also sung for the Pope in Alice Springs and, on the back of Messenger, been enrolled in the Australian Recording Industry Hall of Fame), it's easy to understand why some aboriginal activists have become frustrated with Little's unwillingness to take a leadership role in rejuvenating the reconciliation process between white Australians and the land's traditional owners. \"Politicians do their job and I do mine,\" he says. \"As I am now I can walk down the middle path.

On stilts. The devil arrives on a bike, one hand on the handlebars and the other clutching a noisy ghetto blaster. Judas takes his 30 pieces of silver in the form of used bank notes that he stuffs into the inside pocket of his grubby mac. Mary and Joseph , stirred up by the devil, snarl at one another in Polish as she tries to explain why she's pregnant with another's child.

When I ask Szkotak where all these images of war come from, he says simply: \"Polish history is full of blood.\" His partner, the actress Marta Strzalko, goes on to forge a link with the war-time history of Coventry Cathedral. \"It's such an amazing place,\" she says, \"that we couldn't stay indifferent to what happened here.\" </p> <p>Teatr Biuro Podrozy have already done street theatre in Poland based on the story of Mary and Joseph. \"Directors of Polish summer festivals are coming to see this play in Coventry and I think they'll take it,\" says Strzalko. But heaven knows what the regular churchgoers will make of their interpretation of the biblical story. Or how it would have been viewed by the Coventry Shearmen and Tailors who commissioned the play in the first place. Eaton is confident on both counts. </p> <p>\"I think the Shearmen and Tailors would have been well into it,\" he beams, mischievously. \"After all, these plays were a demonstration of the power of the guilds against the church and the aristocracy. They were showing off their civic pride against the twin bastions of feudalism, and sometimes they were kicked out of churches for being too controversial.\" </p> <p>Eaton unearthed the play in the city archives. \"It was written in 1549 by Thomas Crowe, but the original manuscript has been destroyed in a fire,\" he says. \"Luckily, it was transcribed by a Victorian antiquarian. It still stands up as a fantastic piece of literature.\" </p> <p>Only fragments of the original work have survived in the updated version; they are stitched into the running commentary by two narrators. The emphasis is very much on the visual, sometimes shockingly so - making this the antithesis of the cosy nativity play. </p> <p>\"The cathedral authorities here have always been open to new interpretations of the biblical story,\" Eaton says. \"We've talked it through with them and they're aware of the potential power of this work and these images.\" </p> <p>Could they not be upset by them? \"I hope not,\" interjects Szkotak, who describes himself as an agnostic with Catholic roots. \"But the message is for all people, not just churchgoers.

They are marked by the exclusivity that so dogs theatre. </p> <p>But, as many companies have discovered, outdoor theatre can also be inclusive, attracting a diverse audience, many of whom might never step inside a theatre building. </p> <p>Jonathan Petherbridge, artistic director of the outdoor theatre group London Bubble, whose long experience with outdoor productions began in 1981 with a promenade version of Gone With the Wind, says that taking theatre outside alters the relationship of the audience with the piece. During performances of Gone With the Wind he was intrigued to discover that \"the audience were more like supporters. They felt they were involved in the action, they wanted it to work, they weren't being ignored.\" </p> <p>The feeling that an outdoor audience is with you not against you is something that Ben Crocker, the artistic director of Exeter's Northcott Theatre, has also noticed. Crocker's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream will mark the theatre's sixth annual residency in the nearby Rougemont gardens. At a time of year when theatres are often hard-pressed to sell tickets, last year's Shakespeare in the Gardens season was 91% sold out. </p> <p>With access a key word with arts funders, outdoor theatre should have a distinct advantage, but too many dire productions have made funders suspicious. Ian Hastings is just completing his first year as artistic director of the Dukes theatre company. His first outdoor production in Williamson Park, Lancaster, is a new version of Don Quixote. He believes that as the novelty of outdoor performance wears off neither audiences nor funders will be fobbed off by work that has no real content. </p> <p>\"You've got to make the experience a different one from walking in the park and throwing a stick for the dog, and you've got to make it more than just an event, although that of course is part of its appeal,\" says Hastings. \"We are a subsidised theatre, and we can't apply different criteria to what goes on in the park from what goes on in the building during the rest of the year.\" </p> <p>Giving the audience more than it may realise and more than it thinks it wants (outdoor audiences are notoriously susceptible to fireworks and often seem to yearn for nothing else) sometimes requires as much ingenuity as dealing with the unexpected storms that a British summer can unleash. (There is a theory that part of the success of outdoor theatre is that it encourages a Blitz-style spirit as people huddle beneath blankets to protect themselves from the weather.) </p> <p>Perhaps more than anything, performances outside refuel the debate about the theatre's relationship to both the space in which it is created and to the wider community. A Midsummer Night's Dream means one thing when performed in the Pimms and picnic gentility of the Open Air Theatre in London's Regent's Park, quite another when seen in secret nooks in Greenwich Park. </p> <p>London Bubble's Petherbridge believes that theatre outdoors can challenge perceptions but can itself become an institution if you always revisit the same sites. This year the Bubble will be heading for the back streets of Rotherhithe, Deptford and Shooters Hill for a promenade version of the 5,000-year-old Sumerian myth, Gilgamesh. The company will be bringing together professional performers, members of the Bubble's participatory groups and a choir to tell the story of the urban king who is out of control. </p> <p>\"We want to create a piece that brings together audience and performers to participate in the sort of celebration and ritual that large scale and somewhat impersonal projects such as the Dome and the River of Fire fail to deliver,\" says Petherbridge. </p> <p>Our yearning for rituals and ways to make meaning of our lives shouldn't be underestimated. In its most basic form this is what theatre does, but when, as we have done over the last 500 years, you remove it from the streets and open spaces and lock it away in special buildings it is increasingly hard to make the connections between what we see on stage and our own lives. </p> <p>London Bubble's Gilgamesh is at Mayflower Gardens, London SE16, from July 26 to 29, then tours. Details: 020-7237 1663. Don Quixote is at Williamson Park, Lancaster (01524 66645), till August 19. A Midsummer Night's Dream is at Rougemont Gardens, Exeter (01392 493493), till August 12.</p>",

He believes that as the novelty of outdoor performance wears off neither audiences nor funders will be fobbed off by work that has no real content. \"You've got to make the experience a different one from walking in the park and throwing a stick for the dog, and you've got to make it more than just an event, although that of course is part of its appeal,\" says Hastings. \"We are a subsidised theatre, and we can't apply different criteria to what goes on in the park from what goes on in the building during the rest of the year.\" Giving the audience more than it may realise and more than it thinks it wants (outdoor audiences are notoriously susceptible to fireworks and often seem to yearn for nothing else) sometimes requires as much ingenuity as dealing with the unexpected storms that a British summer can unleash. (There is a theory that part of the success of outdoor theatre is that it encourages a Blitz-style spirit as people huddle beneath blankets to protect themselves from the weather.) Perhaps more than anything, performances outside refuel the debate about the theatre's relationship to both the space in which it is created and to the wider community. A Midsummer Night's Dream means one thing when performed in the Pimms and picnic gentility of the Open Air Theatre in London's Regent's Park, quite another when seen in secret nooks in Greenwich Park. London Bubble's Petherbridge believes that theatre outdoors can challenge perceptions but can itself become an institution if you always revisit the same sites. This year the Bubble will be heading for the back streets of Rotherhithe, Deptford and Shooters Hill for a promenade version of the 5,000-year-old Sumerian myth, Gilgamesh. The company will be bringing together professional performers, members of the Bubble's participatory groups and a choir to tell the story of the urban king who is out of control. \"We want to create a piece that brings together audience and performers to participate in the sort of celebration and ritual that large scale and somewhat impersonal projects such as the Dome and the River of Fire fail to deliver,\" says Petherbridge. Our yearning for rituals and ways to make meaning of our lives shouldn't be underestimated. In its most basic form this is what theatre does, but when, as we have done over the last 500 years, you remove it from the streets and open spaces and lock it away in special buildings it is increasingly hard to make the connections between what we see on stage and our own lives. London Bubble's Gilgamesh is at Mayflower Gardens, London SE16, from July 26 to 29, then tours. Details: 020-7237 1663. Don Quixote is at Williamson Park, Lancaster (01524 66645), till August 19. A Midsummer Night's Dream is at Rougemont Gardens, Exeter (01392 493493), till August 12.",

It is also true that after the end of the next three-year period public spending as a proportion of the whole economy will still be significantly lower than in most of the Thatcher years, and below that in comparable European countries.

Yesterday's three-year plan does not start until April, so most of it will not happen until after the next election when voters will be asked to endorse it - and the Conservatives have been challenged to cut it.

Until now, education has been squeezed much harder than health, with its share of GDP falling from 5.2% in 1992 down to 4.6% last year.

Help for this last group will be boosted by the creation of a new national children's fund, which will have a \u00a3450m budget over three years. Labour's heartlands will be happy, too, that housing is getting a long over due boost with a 12% annual increase over four years as well as a new \u00a3400m neighbourhood renewal fund to help improve facilities on the poorest estates.

Tough targets to ensure that inefficient forces lift their game will be essential if this money is not to be wasted. The chancellor also increased defence spending after years of post-cold war decline under the Tories, boosted his New Deal measures and conjured up more money for the arts and, very creditably, for overseas aid to help alleviate world poverty. All this should boost Labour's lagging electoral fortunes.

But it is hard to make this stick when he has a higher than expected budget surplus of \u00a320.4bn (not including the \u00a322.5bn from the radio spectrum auction which is being banked) and when the economy - hit by the effects of the overvalued pound - is slowing down. Increased public spending is needed socially as well as economically to make up for the neglect of recent years. Mr Portillo is right to say that he will be watching very carefully how efficiently it is being spent, and how the Treasury's new appraisal techniques will work. It would be better if their efficacy was monitored by the Audit Commission rather than Mr Blair's bland annual report.</p> <p>Mr Portillo also asks whether Mr Brown will keep to these high levels of public spending even if the economy drops below the expected growth rate.

Broadcast 52 weeks a year with no opposition to see off, Channel 4's T4 umbrella (no one knows what the T actually stands for) has firmly embedded itself into this slot, providing a long needed alternative for those of us who feel we have little in common with John Craven or Esther Rantzen. </p> <p>Offering a less kiddie-oriented service than Saturday's morning output, T4 was originally created to form a brand around Sunday's omnibus edition of Hollyoaks - already established as a big draw. But since its inception in October 1998, T4's catchment has shifted from 14-20 year olds to its current 16-34 age group, allowing a more relaxed, less patronisingly hysterical delivery than this time slot, 9am-1pm, usually allows, addressing the fact that its viewers are more likely to be nursing a hangover than greeting the day whacked up on Sunny Delight and Jesus. </p> <p>So just what is T4 giving us? Presided over by the amiable Dermot O'Leary and Margherita Taylor, the schedule looks like this: 9 am: City Guys - a fairly useless teen sitcom concerning a pair of kids, one rich, one poor, attending a NY school. They're the original Odd Couple, except of course they're not. 9.30am: CatDog - one of those post-Ren And Stimpy attempts at studied wackiness where any inspirational moments seem accidental. It's the kind of show that would have R&amp;S creator John K glad he's still alive, as all the spinning in his grave would make him nauseous. These two shows seem fairly incongruous with the rest of the morning's output, presumably due to the target audience unlikely to have dragged themselves out of their pit, and conceivably to bore younger viewers into finding something else with their day to avoid the more corruptive material to follow. </p> <p>It's only when we hit 10am that things start to take shape, with Bits - a cleaned-up version of the late-night computer games and gadgets show wherein three impossibly feisty female presenters review all that's new in the impenetrable-to-anyone over-30 world of what was once called video games. It's fast, informative, irreverent and typically T4, getting its message across via a mixture of snappy camera moves and occasional shots of the hostesses' cleavage. </p> <p>10.30am sees the arrival of Planet Pop. Formerly the domain of a couple of grins on sticks doing the record companies' PR job, this show underwent a drastic change with the addi tion of highly personable ex-Kenickie singer Lauren Laverne. It is less sarcastic in tone than BBC's The O Zone, with more leftfield strains of music without short-changing either style, bridging the gap between Royal Trux and Steps. 11am - hallelujah. It's the Hollyoaks Omnibus. Lately, of course, Hollyoaks has become required viewing, by virtue - for want of a better word - of its wild inconsistencies. Torn between its old-style frivolous nature, with good-looking teens/ ugly adults and bad acting, and its newer bent to address such subject matter as bullying, abortion and gay rape, it's like watching two different programmes cut together. </p> <p>12.40pm: Dawsons Creek. The pairing of this with Hollyoaks is what gives T4 its strength. Ostensibly dealing with the same subject matter, the two shows couldn't be more different. Though it's stuck to its original idea of overly self-analytical teenagers, Dawson's emphasis has shifted from Dawson and Joey, who, dramatically speaking, are rapidly disappearing up a different kind of creek, to allow the other characters to shine. </p> <p>But T4 is more than just the sum of its parts: the presenters are required to watch all the shows in advance and are allowed a great deal of freedom to knock the more ludicrous storylines and characters. Its growing reputation is attracting more \"dangerous\" guests - a relative term, but remember it's on at the same time as Countryfile and Jesus 2000. The cast of Queer As Folk have all appeared, often finding themselves reined in by O'Leary and Taylor as they forget the hour and the day. The choice of musical guests is also enjoying a change. Acts who normally avoid rising this early, such as Ian Brown, Embrace and The Charlatans, are queuing up to appear, while the quality of pop turns is increasing - soon, two Spice Girls will appear on the same show. Having now been deemed worthy of showing the weekly Friends repeat and spilling over to an extra Tuesday evening slot, this imprint seems to be living up to Channel 4's remit. An alternative with a cohesive link. </p> <p>So it seems as if, while no one knows what the T stands for, any derogatory guesses will prove unfair.</p>",

Torn between its old-style frivolous nature, with good-looking teens/ ugly adults and bad acting, and its newer bent to address such subject matter as bullying, abortion and gay rape, it's like watching two different programmes cut together. 12.40pm: Dawsons Creek. The pairing of this with Hollyoaks is what gives T4 its strength. Ostensibly dealing with the same subject matter, the two shows couldn't be more different. Though it's stuck to its original idea of overly self-analytical teenagers, Dawson's emphasis has shifted from Dawson and Joey, who, dramatically speaking, are rapidly disappearing up a different kind of creek, to allow the other characters to shine. But T4 is more than just the sum of its parts: the presenters are required to watch all the shows in advance and are allowed a great deal of freedom to knock the more ludicrous storylines and characters. Its growing reputation is attracting more \"dangerous\" guests - a relative term, but remember it's on at the same time as Countryfile and Jesus 2000. The cast of Queer As Folk have all appeared, often finding themselves reined in by O'Leary and Taylor as they forget the hour and the day. The choice of musical guests is also enjoying a change. Acts who normally avoid rising this early, such as Ian Brown, Embrace and The Charlatans, are queuing up to appear, while the quality of pop turns is increasing - soon, two Spice Girls will appear on the same show. Having now been deemed worthy of showing the weekly Friends repeat and spilling over to an extra Tuesday evening slot, this imprint seems to be living up to Channel 4's remit. An alternative with a cohesive link. So it seems as if, while no one knows what the T stands for, any derogatory guesses will prove unfair.",

But, please, let us not rush into curbs on the good journalism that works well. <br> <b>Anthony Bevins </b> <br> Political editor, The Express</p> <p>\u0095 Alan Rusbridger positions most problems in the corrosive relationship between the Lobby and government spokespeople, or on those whose job it is to \"drip poison on Ken Follett, Gordon Brown ... et al\".</p> <p>This intemperate sentence betrays the media's own blind spot - an all-consuming obsession with spin. Take your lead story on the government's annual report - \"hedged around with admissions that there was still much to do\" (Poverty gap hits Labour boasts, July 14). So, if the government proclaims some achievement it is \"boasting and spin doctoring\"; if it says we haven't got a fair and just society yet, it is hedging about and admitting failure. If spin is about language and presentation, then what has the Guardian done by positioning these stories and their trivial arguments on the front page and telling them the way it has? It has spun them of course, but some call it journalism.</p> <p>I head up the communications output of Brighton &amp; Hove council. Research data suggest that nearly 70% of residents think their council keeps them informed, against a national average for local authorities of 37%. Still we are called spin doctors.</p> <p>I fully understand the frustration that led Alistair Campbell to start publishing lobby briefings on the Downing Street website. It's not spin-doctoring, it's a mission to explain. <br><b>Tony Miller <br> </b>Brighton &amp; Hove council <br> <a href=\"mailto:tony.miller@brighton-hove.gov.uk\">tony.miller@brighton-hove.gov.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 The use of the words \"ghost voices\" was most appropriate, because the whole business of government briefing and communication does seem to be like a s\u00e9ance - knock once if it's attributable, twice if it's not. Surely all that is required is the truth: what was said and who said it. The reader can then be left to judge its worth and people can be held accountable for what they have said. <br> <b>Harry Glenister<br></b> Taunton, Somerset</p>",

Anthony Bevins Political editor, The Express \u0095 Alan Rusbridger positions most problems in the corrosive relationship between the Lobby and government spokespeople, or on those whose job it is to \"drip poison on Ken Follett, Gordon Brown ... et al\". This intemperate sentence betrays the media's own blind spot - an all-consuming obsession with spin. Take your lead story on the government's annual report - \"hedged around with admissions that there was still much to do\" (Poverty gap hits Labour boasts, July 14). So, if the government proclaims some achievement it is \"boasting and spin doctoring\"; if it says we haven't got a fair and just society yet, it is hedging about and admitting failure. If spin is about language and presentation, then what has the Guardian done by positioning these stories and their trivial arguments on the front page and telling them the way it has? It has spun them of course, but some call it journalism. I head up the communications output of Brighton &amp; Hove council. Research data suggest that nearly 70% of residents think their council keeps them informed, against a national average for local authorities of 37%. Still we are called spin doctors. I fully understand the frustration that led Alistair Campbell to start publishing lobby briefings on the Downing Street website. It's not spin-doctoring, it's a mission to explain. Tony Miller Brighton &amp; Hove council tony.miller@brighton-hove.gov.uk \u0095 The use of the words \"ghost voices\" was most appropriate, because the whole business of government briefing and communication does seem to be like a s\u00e9ance - knock once if it's attributable, twice if it's not. Surely all that is required is the truth: what was said and who said it. The reader can then be left to judge its worth and people can be held accountable for what they have said.

      "bodyText": "An England football fan convicted of sparking riots during Euro 2000 was yesterday set free from a Belgian jail after his legal team successfully argued that he had legitimate grounds for appeal. Mark Forrester, a former member of the England supporters club and an Aston Villa season ticket holder, will now be permitted to return to the UK but will find himself back in Brussels later this year for his appeal hearing. Forrester's conviction last month, for inciting riots ahead of the England-Germany match when he allegedly assaulted several police officers, still stands. Aged 33, and married with a two-year old child, Forrester was the only England fan to be given a custodial sentence during the tournament after police witnesses described how he kicked and punched their colleagues and encouraged other fans to attack riot police. Judge Regine Claeys told Forrester at the time that there was \"very clear and detailed evidence\" that he had instigated riots on the night of June 16 and that he was \"very provocative and aggressive\". His lawyers argued yesterday, however, that the special fast track procedure under which he was convicted meant they did not have enough time to put together a proper defence, and that they were not permitted to bring in witnesses who would have supported his case. The advocate general of the Brussels appeal court yesterday acknowledged that certain elements of the case did need to be rechecked. Jan Fermon, Forrester's lawyer, immediately claimed he would now be able to clear his client's name. \"The police case is that he was identified on three separate occasions as being involved in trouble.

The court found that Ewald was the \"driving force\" behind the doping programme. A member of the Communist party's central committee from 1963, he was president of East Germany's main sports federation from 1961 until 1988. The judges accepted the prosecution's contention that he and H\u00f6ppner simply brushed aside scientific evidence of the dangers in their determination to boost East Germany's international image; with less than 17m inhabitants it came to rival countries such as the United States and Soviet Union, whose populations ran into the hundreds of millions. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, the East Germans' won 40 gold medals. Their \"secret\" lay in H\u00f6ppner's pills and injections. In a comment which many of his former patients will regard as supremely ironic, he said after yesterday's verdict: \"You have to be able to lose sometimes.\"",

Meanwhile, the agriculture ministry has contacted US counterparts who ordered the destruction of sheep imported from Europe because they displayed signs of a BSE-like disease. It appears satisfied that some were suffering from a form of scrapie.</p>",

Heads of sheep are already banned from human consumption, a move introduced in 1996 particularly to protect ethnic minority groups. In addition, the tonsils and spleen of all sheep and the spinal cords of sheep over a year old are banned. But intestines are still used for sausage casings, and lymph tissue, also infected in laboratory experiments, is wide spread through other meat on lambs and sheep. The main fear is that the presence of scrapie, a BSE-like disease in sheep not known to have endangered human health, may be disguising the BSE agent, which may have transferred to sheep through now-banned cannibalistic feeding regimes in the 1980s. Scrapie-infected sheep brains are being tested using mice to detect whether a BSE-like strain is evident. The agency document suggested one might be identified \"at any time\". \"Due to the limitations of existing studies and available methods, failure to detect BSE in the national flock will not be conclusive evidence that it is not present.\" The tone of the document contrasts with that of scientists on Seac, the advisory committee for BSE and its human form, which suggested last February that tests on sheep brains up to then \"do not have the characteristics associated with BSE\". The agency hopes genetic breeding techniques will increase sheep resistance to BSE and scrapie over the next 10-20 years. Meanwhile, the agriculture ministry has contacted US counterparts who ordered the destruction of sheep imported from Europe because they displayed signs of a BSE-like disease. It appears satisfied that some were suffering from a form of scrapie.",

What a script can't tell you is what a film will look like, feel like. At some point in the process, a storyboard artist might come in to help sketch out the eventual visuals.

Ghost World, a rich, complex feature film in its own right, is soon to be released as an actual movie, starring Thora Birch, from American Beauty, and Steve Buscemi. The director is Terry Zwigoff, who made Crumb, the extraordinary documentary portrait of cartoonist Robert Crumb and his dysfunctional family. Zwigoff is an unknown quantity when it comes to fiction, but judging by Crumb, he'll be more than capable of handling Ghost World's subtleties (yes, in a comic book). Clowes and Zwigoff collaborated on the screenplay, but I wonder how much it resembles a conventional script - I'd like to think Clowes at least drew a few faces in the margins. </p> <p>Clowes, a versatile master of comic-art pastiche, used to be known as a pop surrealist. His first hit series featured jazzily executed beatnik hero Lloyd Llewellyn; then his own regular title Eightball launched a labyrinthine straight-from-the-id serial called Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron, so nightmarish that it made Twin Peaks look like a Merchant-Ivory number. But in his realist mode, Clowes is a sensitive observer of character and culture - his one-off strip Caricature, about a middle-aged hack caricaturist falling for a hip, callow admirer, is as insightful and emotionally rich as the best American short stories. </p> <p>Ghost World is in Clowes's realist vein. Its stars are Enid and Rebecca, teenage small-town girls who hang out, waste time, laugh, lapse into gloom. They spend a summer indulging their snootily ironic tastes - sniggering at lame TV comedians, frequenting \"the Mona Lisa of the bad, fake diners\", analysing the Freudian language of cookie packaging. They think they're smarter than their peers, and pretty much are, but occasionally their assurance takes a blow: they gradually accumulate guilt at the heartless prank phone calls they make. They're not smart, adorable kids, but self-absorbed, cynical, sentimental, appallingly patronising towards the old and the ugly. But you can't help loving them. </p> <p>Clowes is brilliant at the precociously jaded, know-it-all cadences of teenage dialogue, but he does as much with looks as with words. Bespectacled, nerd-chic Enid goes through endless fashion hoops trying to define herself, as her hair switches from spiky green to bobbed black, and she swaps her trapper's cap for a ludicrous bat-eared mask from the local sex shop. Subtle facial expressions count for everything - a grossed-out twist of the lip, or the melancholic blankness on Enid's face after she loses her virginity. Grotesques cross the girls' path, but the real freaks are the stereotypes who think they're classy outsiders - repellent grinners like the editor of an outrage fanzine, or the ex-punk turned \"big-ass corporate fuck\" who thinks he's screwing the system. </p> <p>Ghost World's eloquent shifts prove that comics can create mood with perfect economy. The best in-joke has Enid fantasising about famous comics artist \"David Clowes\", whom she imagines as a tough-jawed intellectual. In the final frame on page 29, Enid sees the real Daniel Clowes, looking excruciatingly geeky; in the first frame on page 30, she's sitting disconsolate over her soda.

The government's figures show that the vast majority of children in poverty live in families where no one is in work.</p> <p>\"We hope that the fact that nothing further was announced today doesn't mean that the problems of people supporting children on benefits are sliding down the agenda,\" said Geoff Fimister of the Child Poverty Action Group.</p> <p>The new children's fund will work with national children's charities and local community organisations which offer one to one help for children and families at risk, before they hit a crisis. Its budget for next fiscal year is set at \u00a3100m, rising to \u00a3200m by 2003-04.</p> <p>Yesterday's announcement marks a new high in cooperation between the voluntary sector and government departments to tackle Britain's problems of ingrained poverty and deprivation. Over the next three years, \u00a370m of the fund's budget will be distributed directly to voluntary sector organisations.</p> <p>\"The war against child poverty requires not just additional cash but the support and encouragement of all forces of care and compassion in every community,\" said Mr Brown. \"It can only be won by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together.\"</p> <p>Children's charities welcomed Mr Brown's call for more cooperation.

      "bodyText": "The government's determination to tackle child poverty and social exclusion was underlined yesterday when Gordon Brown announced a cross department initiative to help the poorest and most vulnerable children in Britain. In an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage, the chancellor has doubled investment in the Sure Start programme which aims to improve the life chances of under-fives by ensuring they are ready to learn when they begin school. He also announced a Children's Fund to be run by voluntary organisations, which will identify and provide services for children showing signs of difficulties, and Connexions, a personal adviser service to help 13 to 19-year-olds stay in education. Child poverty activists welcomed the measures but warned that Mr Brown must continue to act to raise the incomes of families on benefits, which he has raised substantially in Labour's last two budgets. The government's figures show that the vast majority of children in poverty live in families where no one is in work. \"We hope that the fact that nothing further was announced today doesn't mean that the problems of people supporting children on benefits are sliding down the agenda,\" said Geoff Fimister of the Child Poverty Action Group. The new children's fund will work with national children's charities and local community organisations which offer one to one help for children and families at risk, before they hit a crisis. Its budget for next fiscal year is set at \u00a3100m, rising to \u00a3200m by 2003-04. Yesterday's announcement marks a new high in cooperation between the voluntary sector and government departments to tackle Britain's problems of ingrained poverty and deprivation. Over the next three years, \u00a370m of the fund's budget will be distributed directly to voluntary sector organisations. \"The war against child poverty requires not just additional cash but the support and encouragement of all forces of care and compassion in every community,\" said Mr Brown. \"It can only be won by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together.\" Children's charities welcomed Mr Brown's call for more cooperation. The Children's Society, NSPCC, Save the Children Fund and Barnardo's welcomed the new money and in a statement said that it was only through working with local communities that the government could make any difference to the lives of poor children. However, the charities expressed disappointment that there was not more funding for the network of local and regional children's funds which will total only \u00a370m over the next three years. \"This must be linked to a coherent, long term strategy to end child poverty,\" said Neera Sharma, policy adviser for Barnardo's. Investment in Sure Start, the existing scheme to help vulnerable pre-schoolers, will be boosted by \u00a3315m by the end of the three years covered by this spending review. The number of programmes will be doubled so that the expanded scheme will reach a third of poor children under four in England. In return, the departments responsible for Sure Start, Health and Education have agreed to reduce the numbers of children on the programme who are re-registered as at risk by 20%, to cut smoking by pregnant mothers by 10% and reduce the number of children living in households where no one is employed. Connexions, the new advisory service, will work on truancy and raising educational achievements. It will be coordinated with expanded services for vulnerable young people including mental health services, housing support and drug treatment. Mr Brown also announced a \u00a3380m programme for children between five and 13, to bridge the gap between Sure Start and the Connexions service.
