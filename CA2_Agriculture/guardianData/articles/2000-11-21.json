At noon yesterday he talked with his players in an attempt to patch up battered confidence, the entire first-team squad attending a meeting which lasted roughly an hour. </p> <p>\"I wanted to hear their opinions,\" said Robson. \"I thought I had put it right when I tried to simplify the game for them, yet on Saturday we didn't simplify the game, we complicated it and it cost us again. </p> <p>\"The players are showing me they are not as good as I thought they were because the decisions they are making are wrong. Defensively, as a unit, we are frail and that is why we haven't kept a clean sheet this season.\" </p> <p>Robson has led Boro to two promotions and three Wembley finals since taking over in 1994, but that relative success came at massive expense with \u00a378m spent on transfer fees. However, although he was again booed by the crowd of 27,965 on Saturday, the beleaguered manager was offered some support by the chairman of the official Middlesbrough supporters' club. </p> <p>\"I want to see Bryan Robson stay and succeed here, as a lot of people do,\" said David Buckton. \"I think that he can, but time must be running out. The team has not performed well this season. Obviously the manager has got to take responsibility - and he does - which has put him under a lot of pressure. </p> <p>\"They could bring somebody in to help out and there is an element of supporters who want to see a change, but there are those who think that Bryan is the man for the job. I think he still has a lot to do and I don't want to see him fail at this.\" </p> <p>Middlesbrough's \u00a38m record signing, Ugo Ehiogu, agreed: \"There's no doubt about it, we are in a dogfight now, but at the moment we just seem to be shooting ourselves in the foot,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But a win and two draws from our next three games and we're unbeaten in three and climbing the table. We can still turn it around but the gaffer can't legislate for people making mistakes in critical areas.\" </p> <p>To make matters worse, Boro face a Bradford side with fresh impetus as the Bantams try to impress their new manager Jim Jefferies, who yesterday signed a 2-year contract at Valley Parade. Billy Brown, his assistant at his former club Hearts, will accompany him to West Yorkshire. </p> <p>\"Over the next few weeks we'll have a close look and I'll make decisions very quickly about who I believe is good enough to stay in the team to help the club get out of this situation,\" he said. \"If I've got to be tough, single-minded and make decisions then I will do it because I've done it before.\" </p> <p>\"Jim is an old-fashioned football man, a great coach, motivator and judge of a player,\" said the Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond. \"He has turned difficult situations around at his three previous clubs - Berwick, Falkirk and Hearts - and turned them round quickly. He represents our best chance of survival.\" </p> <p>With Bradford three points adrift at the bottom of the table, the new manager's first task will be to squeeze a goal from the bluntest attack in the country. City have scored only five times in the Premiership this season, although Jefferies is looking forward to working with Benito Carbone and Stan Collymore. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt they are talented players, and if they play to the top of their form then Bradford will not have a problem,\" he said. \"I will work with them and encourage them and kick their backside when I have to.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

It could be tight, possibly 1-0.\" \u2022 A man has been charged with throwing missiles during the derby game at Manchester City's Maine Road ground on Saturday when Manchester United's David Beckham was pelted with coins. John Leigh, 40, of Ilkley, West Yorkshire, will appear before Manchester magistrates tomorrow. City are not expected to be punished by the FA for the coin throwing. Manchester United (probable, 4-4-2): Barthez; P Neville, Brown, G Neville, Irwin; Beckham, Keane, Scholes, Giggs; Sheringham, Yorke. Panathinaikos (probable, 4-4-2): Nikopolidis; Henriksen, Goumas, Vokolos, Fyssas; Saric, Basinas, Karagounis, Kola; Warzycha, Liberopoulos. \u2022 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Subs: Kotsolis, Olivares, Vlaovic, Nasiopoulos, Koutsoures, Kola, Kiassos. Referee: Domenico Messiena (Italy) 1 Panathinaikos kick off and knock the ball back into their own half before trying to work it up the right. Panathinaikos spend the first minute passing confidently before a speculative hoof towards Barthez enables United to gain possession. 3 Phil Neville plays a one-two with Beckham on the right but the move is blocked by Galetto. 4 Karagounis centres from just outside the United area and Vokolos has a crack from distance - the shot flies into the crowd. 6 United looking comfortable on the ball and doing a good job of keeping possession if not creating any early chances. 8 Panathinaikos win a free-kick 30 yards out after Keane brings down Warzycha, but the Greek side fail to capitalise. 10 Butt, Scholes and Sheringham work the ball along the line 20 yards out, but Sheringham dwells too long and is tackled. Panathinaikos then break and nearly score when the ball is lobbbed over the top of United's backline and on to the chest of Warzycha 10 yards out - Barthez comes and forces Warzycha to jab wide. 12 United living dangerously as Liberopoulos very nearly puts Panathinaikos in the lead with a swift shot from just inside the area; Barthez again saves the day by charging out early for the block. 15 United, in danger of losing their grip on the game, have their first decent chance when Butt fires in a shot from 20 yards to the right-hand post - Panathinaikos keeper Nikopolidis dives to his left to make the save; Yorke comes in for the rebound before the linesman calls time on the chance. 19 United corner from the right.

Comes to nothing. 75 Substitution Kiassos on for Warzycha. 76 Another lull as both teams pause for thought - United seem intent on exploiting the left and to this end the majority of Beckham's crosses this half have come from the left flank, usually aimed towards Keane deep on the far side. Shame Panathinaikos read it every time. 79 Substitution Olivares on for Sypniewski. 81 GOAL Man Utd 2 - 1 Panathinaikos A great run by Silvestre takes him past two defenders and into the area; his shot is blocked but Scholes is on to the rebound in a flash to put United in the lead. 85 Having regained the lead, United now start to live dangerously when first Silvestre and then Yorke give the ball away in their own half - even if they do fight successfully to get it back. 89 Silvestre attempts another break down the right but this time fails to reach the area.

      "body": "<p>The government and voluntary sector bodies are planning a campaign to \"Get Britain Giving\". The idea is that a whole new \"brand\" will be established to persuade the British population to give more. The campaign is precipitated by the recent changes that have made giving to charity more tax-efficient. The Treasury, National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Charities Aid Foundation and a number of charities have already agreed to put funds behind the campaign and last month a mailing landed on many charity chief executives' desks asking them to contribute \u00a35,000 or more to the fund. </p> <p>One of the rallying cries for any giving initiative is usually that the Americans give a much higher percentage of their income to charity. However, <strong>I find it hard to see how a generic giving campaign can ever work</strong>. </p> <p>The reason for my pessimism is simple: people don't give for the sake of giving, but because they want to help something or somebody. People give to people or because they are moved by a cause, or inspired by a particular project or person. Every good fundraiser knows this and it's why the best of them become almost invisible when they ask for money. Look at the fundraising campaigns of Oxfam, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or any other major fundraiser, and it's the difference your donation will make to a person or an animal that shines through. </p> <p>The recent changes to Gift Aid and payroll giving now mean that virtually any donation from a taxpayer can now be made more effective.

      "bodyText": "The government and voluntary sector bodies are planning a campaign to \"Get Britain Giving\". The idea is that a whole new \"brand\" will be established to persuade the British population to give more. The campaign is precipitated by the recent changes that have made giving to charity more tax-efficient. The Treasury, National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Charities Aid Foundation and a number of charities have already agreed to put funds behind the campaign and last month a mailing landed on many charity chief executives' desks asking them to contribute \u00a35,000 or more to the fund. One of the rallying cries for any giving initiative is usually that the Americans give a much higher percentage of their income to charity. However, I find it hard to see how a generic giving campaign can ever work. The reason for my pessimism is simple: people don't give for the sake of giving, but because they want to help something or somebody. People give to people or because they are moved by a cause, or inspired by a particular project or person. Every good fundraiser knows this and it's why the best of them become almost invisible when they ask for money. Look at the fundraising campaigns of Oxfam, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or any other major fundraiser, and it's the difference your donation will make to a person or an animal that shines through. The recent changes to Gift Aid and payroll giving now mean that virtually any donation from a taxpayer can now be made more effective. But the irony is that it isn't the government or the voluntary sector bodies who need to act, but charities themselves. Too few have done enough to convert their supporters to tax-efficient giving, let alone use it as a reason to ask for more money. One major charity has only converted 15% of its 500,000 eligible supporters This lack of action is partly down to the difficulties of changing database systems: one senior fundraiser told me that he believes that only charities with the most sophisticated databases will be able to make the most of Gift Aid.

      "body": "<p>Yesterday the NSPCC published a report which should horrify every adult. Child Maltreatment in the United Kingdom surveyed almost 3,000 18-24-year-olds about how they were treated as children. One in 10 said they were forced or threatened into sex acts against their will before reaching 16. </p> <p>Only 14% of this abuse was said to be carried out by the person we would most readily point a finger at - the father. The most frequent culprit was, it was claimed, another child. </p> <p>It is a phenomenal claim. Look around your children's class. According to this report, at least one of those schoolboy faces struggling with his five times table masks a sex offender. Then turn your eye towards your own sitting room. The child most likely to abuse your daughter is the boy watching the Tweenies with her. Forty three per cent of abuse was said to be perpetrated by a sibling. It's no longer big brother, but little brother we have to watch out for. </p> <p>It is not surprising that the report's findings show physical abuse to be seven times more prevalent than sexual abuse. But the coverage has focused almost entirely on the sexual element. This focus on child-on-child sex abuse has arisen from exactly the same professional quarters that introduced us to the atrocities of adult sex offenders. </p> <p>But you cannot and should not apply the same judgments and analysis to children's behaviour. A seven-year-old showing his willy to a four-year-old is not the same thing as a 40-year-old man flashing at a woman in the park. </p> <p>Kiss chase in the playground is not a form of indecent assault. It's a game, even if occasionally an unwelcome or unwanted one. The intention, understanding, meaning and effect are entirely different. </p> <p>The respondents to the survey endorsed this. They identified the most distressing form of abuse by far as not sexual nor even physical abuse, but bullying. </p> <p>Of course, not all children's activities are harmless, but some are more harmless than others. The report encompasses a wide range of actions that could count as sexual abuse, from kissing and cuddling to forcible oral and penetrative sex. </p> <p>What inevitably happens is that overall terrifying statistics are quoted, then, as an example, an incidence of the most extreme kind is given. The London Young Abusers Centre cites oversexualised five-year-olds, sexually abusive 11-year-olds, 14-year-old rapists and even sexual homicides. The impression is that a huge number of young teenagers are buggering little boys. </p> <p>Yet even according to the NSPCC's own calculations, the more extreme examples only make up a small minority of the abusive actions that actually occur. The commonest form of sexual contact was \"exposed their sex organs or other private parts of their body to you in order to shock you or excite themselves\"; by far the least common was anal intercourse. </p> <p>I hope this report's intention is to alert us to an under-reported problem. But my concern is, as with the attention given to \"stranger danger\" after the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne last summer, it will not make us more alert; it will simply make us more fearful. We will redirect our suspicion away from adult males to our own children. Brothers and sisters sharing baths, helping each other to dress, even showing each other their genitals will be revisited with an over anxious eye. </p> <p>The case of 11-year-old Raoul Wuthrich, who was accused by a watchful neighbour in Colorado, US, of touching his five-year-old sister \"in an inappropriate way\" while helping her to pee in the garden, is a sign of just such presumptions. The case against him eventually collapsed. </p> <p>There is one more worrying aspect of the report. It automatically assumes that the respondent is a victim, not a perpetrator. Of the 213 questions in the survey, not a single one asked the interviewee if he or she had ever committed abuse as a child. It all happens to you, and is never done by you. So who are these children who sexually abuse others of a similar age? The answer is simple: it wasn't you, and it certainly isn't your child. It's somebody else's family; somebody else's problem. </p> <p>You should be afraid. You should be very afraid. But the fear should not be of our children, or those of our next-door neighbour, or the stranger's son with the lousy hair who lives up the street. We should be afraid that childhood has become the latest landscape to be invaded by often misrepresented statistics that can fill even the most stalwart and sensible parent with terror. </p> <p>There is a real problem of child physical abuse. There is terrible emotional neglect. There is even some sexual abuse by children of children. Let's tackle it. But let's not try and make cheap points for our own ends and not the wellbeing of damaged children. It only makes us worry far more and helps far less towards solving the real problems.</p>",

I guess I was just very lucky.\"",

And there will be good news for scientists from disciplines as diverse as astronomy and particle physics, to medical research and engineering.</p> <p>Apart from healthy real terms increases for most of the councils\u0092 core budgets, they will all get something from the \u00a3250m cross cutting themes being announced. So, the biotechnology and biological sciences, and medical sciences will benefit from more money for genomic research. The particle physicists and environmental scientists will benefit from extra funding for e-science, and future powerful computing networks. The engineers will be able to build new detectors and instruments through extra support for basic technologies. And the social scientists are getting some extra funds for business schools. </p> <p>And all this comes on the back of the surprise announcement last week that academic salaries will be boosted to the tune of \u00a3330m over the next three years. </p> <p>University heads next week have organised a conference to partly digest these new funding plans, but also to consider the future direction of research. </p> <p>Leading the stock-taking exercise will be Sir Howard Newby, president of the Committee of vice-chancellors and Principals. Newby was the central proponent for a new \u0091hub and spoke model\u0092 for postgraduate funding during the recent funding council research review. Plans to concentrate postgraduate funds into top rated departments (the hubs) were watered down in the final report. But the issue is nonetheless set to be one of the few controversial topics emerging from the review.</p> <p>There will also be an update on the transparency review, which for the first time will estimate how much time academics spend on research, teaching, and other activities. It will not shock anyone that one of its main conclusions is that academics are working overtime to subsidise their work. The conference meanwhile will hear about the government\u0092s latest attempts (Foresight programme and science white paper) to get UK industry to start investing in research. Perhaps the biggest development from the white paper will be at least 25 new Faraday partnerships, networks which bring academics and businesses together. There will also be a discussion on the 'European Research area'. Bureaucracy of European grant schemes alienates many researchers, but they should be aware of plans to establish a the ER area, which could promise an open market of research grants across the continent. </p> <p>21st Century Research: New Challenges for Universities is being held on Tuesday 28 November at the Commonwealth Institute, London W8.

Apart from healthy real terms increases for most of the councils\u0092 core budgets, they will all get something from the \u00a3250m cross cutting themes being announced. So, the biotechnology and biological sciences, and medical sciences will benefit from more money for genomic research. The particle physicists and environmental scientists will benefit from extra funding for e-science, and future powerful computing networks. The engineers will be able to build new detectors and instruments through extra support for basic technologies. And the social scientists are getting some extra funds for business schools. And all this comes on the back of the surprise announcement last week that academic salaries will be boosted to the tune of \u00a3330m over the next three years. University heads next week have organised a conference to partly digest these new funding plans, but also to consider the future direction of research. Leading the stock-taking exercise will be Sir Howard Newby, president of the Committee of vice-chancellors and Principals. Newby was the central proponent for a new \u0091hub and spoke model\u0092 for postgraduate funding during the recent funding council research review. Plans to concentrate postgraduate funds into top rated departments (the hubs) were watered down in the final report. But the issue is nonetheless set to be one of the few controversial topics emerging from the review. There will also be an update on the transparency review, which for the first time will estimate how much time academics spend on research, teaching, and other activities. It will not shock anyone that one of its main conclusions is that academics are working overtime to subsidise their work. The conference meanwhile will hear about the government\u0092s latest attempts (Foresight programme and science white paper) to get UK industry to start investing in research. Perhaps the biggest development from the white paper will be at least 25 new Faraday partnerships, networks which bring academics and businesses together. There will also be a discussion on the 'European Research area'. Bureaucracy of European grant schemes alienates many researchers, but they should be aware of plans to establish a the ER area, which could promise an open market of research grants across the continent. 21st Century Research: New Challenges for Universities is being held on Tuesday 28 November at the Commonwealth Institute, London W8.

      "body": "<p>The head to head between Oxford and Cambridge will be one of the most eagerly anticipated events of the academic calendar next year. And we are not talking about the boat race, varsity match, or even Jeremy Paxman's University Challenge TV quiz. </p> <p>The competition is the Research Assessment Exercise - a national obsession for academics. The goal is to secure top research ratings for as many departments as possible - careers depend on it and each department knows its research funding will be dictated for the next four years by the figure that emerges. Universities will pursue just about every possible tactic to get the grades: poaching star researchers from other universities; filling academic posts before they actually fall vacant; and restructuring whole departments so that they correspond more closely to the areas of expertise on panels of referees. </p> <p>The ratings, largely based on the strength of published academic papers, bring both academic kudos and cash. But what makes the exercise such an intriguing guessing game is that no one knows how much money will be allocated per researcher for each rating. The million dollar question (quite literally for many departments) is whether they will make more money by submitting larger numbers of academics at a guaranteed lower rating, or by selecting only the very best researchers and gambling for a higher rating. </p> <p>The big talking point after the last RAE results, announced in December 1996 (there were over 300 hits on the RAE website on Christmas Day), was that Oxford's gamble to select relatively few academics in the exercise had played off. In terms of grants won, Oxford had deposed Cambridge from the top of the league table. </p> <p>As the records of the Cambridge academic board reveal, Oxford's tactical coup is still a source of dented academic pride: \"While other institutions used this tactic to a greater or lesser degree in 1996, Cambridge generally eschewed it as a matter of policy: only some 2% of the university's staff were not included, as against (for example) 9% at Oxford. The vice-chancellor has recently offered a robust criticism of the practice of other universities. Although it is frankly admitted that by adopting a similar policy Cambridge would have achieved a higher proportion of 5-star ratings (and maybe, consequently, more research funding).\" </p> <p>Now overseeing Cambridge's 2001 RAE submissions in the run-up to the 30 April deadline, Professor Hugh Mellor, the university's pro-vice-chancellor, concedes: \"Oxford gambled one way, we gambled another. It did appear to pay off for them, they did get more money.\" </p> <p>Despite the events of five years ago, Mellor says that the university will not be systematically more selective this time, but will invite heads of department to make judgments over who is chosen for the assessment. Oxford's RAE organisers refused to speak directly about the exercise, but released a statement denying that their 1996 submission was \"unusually selective\". They also pointed out that they submitted more researchers in total than Cambridge (1,764 compared with 1,595). Could this argument signal that the university will adopt a more selective approach again for 2001? </p> <p>According to Mellor, Cambridge also fell victim last time round to \"an unreasonably frenetic\" transfer market of academics during the late stages before the deadline for the exercise. The university countered with \"proleptic\" appointments - filling vacancies before they arise (Mellor's own words). According to the minutes of the academic board, \"some 28 appointments, in 20 units of assessment, were made in connection with the [1996] RAE. Seven of the new professors were persuaded to move from other institutions. The other two were internal promotions.\" </p> <p>For the 2001 exercise, the university's board authorised \u00a31.3m to be spent on such appointments, \"to be filled by 1 October 2000, primarily based on the existing needs of institutions and the prospects of improving or maintaining ratings\". </p> <p>At least 23 senior appointments have been made through the scheme: eight in the school of physical sciences; four in each of the schools of arts and humanities, humanities and social sciences, and biological sciences; and three in technology. </p> <p>Oxford suffered a huge blow to its research standing last month when a trio of professors - Roy Anderson, Brian Spratt and Geoff Smith - and about 80 researchers moved to Imperial College London. Attempting to dismiss this as \"part of the normal movement of academic staff between leading research-intensive universities\", the university has appointed a number of high-profile academics in the past year - for example at the Said Business School, the new Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, and the new therapeutic immunology research unit. </p> <p>In fact both universities have introduced more flexible pay and appointment procedures for staff since the 1996 exercise, improving their ability to hire (and retain) academic high-fliers, while Oxford has created a new Department of Politics and International Relations to \"improve the capacity of the sub-faculty of politics to respond to the Research Assessment Exercise.\" </p> <p>Not only does a 5-star bring in money from the funding councils - more than four times as much as a 3b for the same volume of research activity - but it confers the prestige a department needs to win contracts from the research councils and private industry. High ratings attract postgraduates and have a disproportionate impact on newspaper league tables because they affect staff-student ratios and library spending. </p> <p>Throughout the country, submissions are being prepared and revised and revised again in preparation for the April 30 deadline. Gone are the innocent days when a department, asked by senior management to beef up its submission, sent back the same sketchy statement in larger type. </p> <p>For the 2001 exercise, preparation has been more intense than ever. The paperwork is voluminous and complex, including regulations about staff who die while in their posts. </p> <p>Edinburgh has just finished a dummy run of submissions from all departments. Glasgow - which only managed 35 departments in the top three categories in 1996, compared with its east coast rival's 42 - has been preparing for 18 months. </p> <p>But at Southampton the director of planning, John Taylor, says preparations for 2001 started as soon as the last exercise was announced. The university did a dummy run two years ago, with every department filling in the forms and external academics offering comments and advice: \"We aimed to identify weaknesses when we had still an opportunity to do something about them.\" </p> <p>While a lot of universities plan to play the Oxford gambit and be more selective about the staff they enter as \"research active\", Southampton will enter more staff this time - 95% instead of 85%. \"We believe the quality of our staff has gone up,\" says Taylor. </p> <p>Not only does each department have to decide which staff to enter but also which of the 69 units of assessment to choose - tricky in some cases. Professor Peter Holmes, vice-principal for research at Glasgow University, points out that biomedical scientists working on cardiovascular disease could come under at least three units of assessment: biological sciences, clinical laboratory sciences or studies and professions allied to medicine. New research income at the university has doubled in four years to \u00a3110m, but tactics are still vital. </p> <p>Glasgow will be entering a small number of joint submissions with its neighbour Strathclyde, though Holmes feels collaboration is not adequately recognised or rewarded. </p> <p>But how glittering will the prizes for this marathon turn out to be? It depends how the funding councils decide to cut the cake in the light of the results - possibly departments rated 3b will get no research funding (today 1-star and 2-star get nothing). Almost certainly there will be a bigger crop of high grades. Funding is unlikely to keep pace, though research seems to have done well in the government's spending plans. Some departments could lose money despite maintaining or improving ratings. </p> <p>Comments Geoffrey Copland, vice-chancellor of Westminster, a new university which had some successes in 1996: \"A general uplift of scores without an uplift in money is not going to help anybody very much.\" </p> <p><strong>Researching the research</strong><br></p> <p> Could things be more uncertain over the future direction of university research?

      "bodyText": "There is no schedule for the Florida supreme court\u00cds potentially crucial announcement on whether or not to keep the manual recounts going in the contested US election, an official insisted today. It had been anticipated that there might be a ruling soon, which could effectively decide the fate of the US presidential deadlock between George W Bush and Al Gore. However, Craig Waters, a spokesman for Florida\u00cds highest court, said all speculation was unfounded. He said: \"There is no timetable at the present time as to when a decision is going to be made. We just don\u00cdt know.\" Seven judges are struggling with a quandary central to the outcome, which is: how to save the state from being counted out of the election while protecting the rights of all voters to have their say. Mr Waters said that while some of the judges had been absent from court today because of ceremonial duties, they and the teams of lawyers were working very hard. Florida\u00cds chief justice Charles T Wells declared yesterday: \"We have a long-standing policy ... that says the real interests here are the voters.\" He spoke as the seven-member court heard oral arguments on the disputed manual recount, how the counts should be done and whether those results should be included in the final state tally of about 6m votes. Mr Wells asked repeatedly how long the state had to certify a winner and still have its voice heard when the electoral college meets to pick a president. The magic date, mentioned repeatedly by Democrats during yesterday\u00cds hearing, was December 12, the day designated in federal law for Florida to pick its electors. The electoral college meets six days later. On that basis, the justices could rule as early as today, or not for weeks. At mid morning, Mr Waters emerged from the court to say \"there's nothing new\". He explained he was only making a statement because of a flood of rumours, and to assure reporters there was no decision yet. \"We are still in the same stage we were yesterday,\" he said.

      "byline": "John Carvel, social affairs editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A single mother and her seven children have been declared \"intentionally homeless\" after being forced out of their south London house by a racist gang wielding baseball bats and knives.</p> <p>Southwark's Labour council has given June Rowe and her family until December 11 to vacate a hostel in the Old Kent Road where it placed them after the attack in June.</p> <p>In a letter explaining the decision, the council acknowledged that the Rowe family qualified as homeless and \"in priority need.\" But officials said the council was no longer legally required to provide accommodation because of the family's poor behaviour before the attack.</p> <p>Southward housing department has effectively washed its hands of the Rowes on the grounds that they could have been evicted legitimately if a gang of at least 20 white youths had not saved time by driving the family out with bricks, stones and racist insults.</p> <p>The decision is particularly distressing for Mrs Rowe, 34, because her teenage daughter is seven months pregnant and the ante-natal midwife is concerned that she may give birth in bed-and-breakfast accommodation or worse.</p> <p>One of her sons is due to be released from a secure unit next month and will probably be placed in care unless the family can be found a permanent home.</p> <p>The attack that sparked the crisis came late one Sunday afternoon in June at the four bedroom house in Bermondsey where the Rowes had been living since they were placed there by the council in December 1997.</p> <p>Mrs Rowe said her family suffered persistent racial abuse and harassment from neighbours since moving into the property. The children were becoming emotionally disturbed and this was affecting their behaviour at school. But the council refused to rehouse them.</p> <p>According to Mrs Rowe's account of the attack, a large group of youths gathered outside her home, shouting abuse and throwing bricks and stones.</p> <p>\"They were all armed with knives and various other weapons. My son and I were hit by bricks. My son had to be taken to hospital by ambulance ... I was so terrified by the incident that I refused to stay there any longer.\"</p> <p>The family fled to stay briefly with Mrs Rowe's brother at Lee Green in south-east London.</p> <p>According to a report on the incident by the Metropolitan police race hate unit, Mrs Rowe and her son were called \"black bastards\" by a group of 20 to 30 people \"armed with an assortment of weapons such as baseball bats, knives and possibly a sword\". The boy needed continuing medical attention for his injuries, but was not detained in hospital.</p> <p>The police report said: \"There is a likelihood of repeat victimisation should the victims remain resident at this property.\"</p> <p>Mrs Rowe said she was initially told by Southwark officials that her family should return to the house. When she insisted it was too dangerous to do so, they arranged alternative accommodation in a hostel on the Old Kent Road.</p> <p>A single attic room on the top floor was provided for Mrs Rowe, her children aged 17, 14, 13, 11, eight, seven and four, and all their toys, cooking utensils and possessions. They slept on three double mattresses and a bunk bed and had to use the same space for eating and general living accommodation.</p> <p>After intervention by Harriet Harman, the local MP, and Madeleine Lindsay, Mrs Rowe's solicitor, the family was provided with a second room in mid-October.</p> <p>Last week Southwark council gave Mrs Rowe its final decision on her request for housing assistance.

      "bodyText": "A single mother and her seven children have been declared \"intentionally homeless\" after being forced out of their south London house by a racist gang wielding baseball bats and knives. Southwark's Labour council has given June Rowe and her family until December 11 to vacate a hostel in the Old Kent Road where it placed them after the attack in June. In a letter explaining the decision, the council acknowledged that the Rowe family qualified as homeless and \"in priority need.\" But officials said the council was no longer legally required to provide accommodation because of the family's poor behaviour before the attack. Southward housing department has effectively washed its hands of the Rowes on the grounds that they could have been evicted legitimately if a gang of at least 20 white youths had not saved time by driving the family out with bricks, stones and racist insults. The decision is particularly distressing for Mrs Rowe, 34, because her teenage daughter is seven months pregnant and the ante-natal midwife is concerned that she may give birth in bed-and-breakfast accommodation or worse. One of her sons is due to be released from a secure unit next month and will probably be placed in care unless the family can be found a permanent home. The attack that sparked the crisis came late one Sunday afternoon in June at the four bedroom house in Bermondsey where the Rowes had been living since they were placed there by the council in December 1997. Mrs Rowe said her family suffered persistent racial abuse and harassment from neighbours since moving into the property. The children were becoming emotionally disturbed and this was affecting their behaviour at school. But the council refused to rehouse them. According to Mrs Rowe's account of the attack, a large group of youths gathered outside her home, shouting abuse and throwing bricks and stones. \"They were all armed with knives and various other weapons. My son and I were hit by bricks. My son had to be taken to hospital by ambulance ... I was so terrified by the incident that I refused to stay there any longer.\" The family fled to stay briefly with Mrs Rowe's brother at Lee Green in south-east London. According to a report on the incident by the Metropolitan police race hate unit, Mrs Rowe and her son were called \"black bastards\" by a group of 20 to 30 people \"armed with an assortment of weapons such as baseball bats, knives and possibly a sword\". The boy needed continuing medical attention for his injuries, but was not detained in hospital. The police report said: \"There is a likelihood of repeat victimisation should the victims remain resident at this property.\" Mrs Rowe said she was initially told by Southwark officials that her family should return to the house. When she insisted it was too dangerous to do so, they arranged alternative accommodation in a hostel on the Old Kent Road. A single attic room on the top floor was provided for Mrs Rowe, her children aged 17, 14, 13, 11, eight, seven and four, and all their toys, cooking utensils and possessions. They slept on three double mattresses and a bunk bed and had to use the same space for eating and general living accommodation. After intervention by Harriet Harman, the local MP, and Madeleine Lindsay, Mrs Rowe's solicitor, the family was provided with a second room in mid-October. Last week Southwark council gave Mrs Rowe its final decision on her request for housing assistance. In spite of the police evidence about the attack on her Bermondsey home, it said it was \"unable to concur that the incident was conclusively a racially motivated attack.\" The family's private landlords had been unwilling to renew the tenancy because of complaints about the Rowes' noisy behaviour and damage to the property estimated at \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000. Managing agents served notice of repossession before the attack. The council concluded that the family deliberately caused their own eviction. The 1996 Housing Act says: \"A person becomes homeless intentionally if he deliberately does or fails to do anything in consequence of which he ceases to occupy accommodation which is available for his occupation and which it would have been reasonable for him to continue to occupy.\" On Wednesday the Guardian asked the council for an opportunity to get answers to three questions: why officials appeared to have discounted police evidence about the racist attack, why they thought a single attic room was appropriate temporary accommodation for a family of seven, and how the system could produce an outcome where nobody accepted responsibility for housing a family \"in priority need.\" Two days later a spokeswoman for Southwark said: \"The council's legal obligation is to those who have not made themselves intentionally homeless. In the case of June Rowe investigations have shown that she had made herself intentionally homeless. We have no comment beyond that, because the decision letter states the council's position. Mrs Rowe's lawyers are requesting a review of the decision. They have asked for her to be allowed to stay at the hostel after December 11, although the council has no legal responsibility to let her do so. Mrs Rowe's future may depend on a human rights case being brought before the courts.",

There will be no more.\"</p> <p>Honduras international defender Samuel Caballero is being lined up to replace either Sol Campbell at Spurs or Rio Ferdinand at West Ham, according to Planet Football.</p> <p>Manchester United are ready to sell Dwight Yorke if they receive an offer of around \u00a315m.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Lazio have banned Sven-Goran Eriksson from travelling to Villa Park to watch England's friendly against Spain in February.

It is not going to happen.\"</p> <p>Sander Westerveld has criticised his teammates for their woeful performance against Spurs. \"There's no point in pretending otherwise, if we continue to play the way we did against Tottenham we'll be out of Europe very quickly and we won't finish any higher than sixth in the Premiership,\" he told icons.com. \"We must improve on Thursday when we play Olympiakos in [Euro Vase],\" he added. \"If we make the same mistakes again we'll be beaten 5-0.\" </p> <p>John Hartson's \u00a34m move to Charlton is in danger of collapsing after the Addicks board failed to agree to his wage demands.</p> <p>Jack Dyson, a member of Manchester City's 1956 FA Cup-winning team, has died in Oldham at the age of 66.

But no matter how well-prepared you are for the news, there is nothing you can do about it. Only one man has the power to make a change and, yes, that's Robbo. Resuming a series of lectures that didn't do too well when he first aired them a year ago, Robbo took his soapbox out today to remind his players that performances on the field are not his responsibility. \"Players have to stand up and be counted,\" he said. \"They have to realise they are the ones who are making mistakes.\" Of course (the Fiver, at this point, resists the urge to point out that it wasn't the players who signed Noel Whelan). Warming to his theme, Robbo went on: \"It doesn't matter about tactics or formations that you play if people are making bad individual errors then you are going to lose football matches.\" True, and probably even more compelling if Kelvin Koogan hadn't said something similar after Euro 2000. \"They're not just letting me down, they're letting the club and themselves down,\" Robbo concluded stirringly, without checking on whether letting club and self down actually bothers his players or not. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Leeds have given West Ham a \u00a315m \"take it or leave it\" ultimatum for Rio Ferdinand, according to Teamtalk. The website quotes Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, who claims: \"West Ham can take it or leave it. The player may only be worth \u00a35m to them in the near future depending on the outcome of EU deliberations. Our bid already constitutes a world record for a defender, and is a measured valuation. There will be no more.\" Honduras international defender Samuel Caballero is being lined up to replace either Sol Campbell at Spurs or Rio Ferdinand at West Ham, according to Planet Football. Manchester United are ready to sell Dwight Yorke if they receive an offer of around \u00a315m. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Lazio have banned Sven-Goran Eriksson from travelling to Villa Park to watch England's friendly against Spain in February. A statement from Lazio's director general, Massimo Cragnotti, said: \"We made an exception in allowing him to go to Turin for the England v Italy match, accompanied by Lazio staff. But to allow him to go to another stadium to watch another England friendly, this time at Villa Park, would not be right for Lazio's players, for the fans or for the club. It is not going to happen.\" Sander Westerveld has criticised his teammates for their woeful performance against Spurs. \"There's no point in pretending otherwise, if we continue to play the way we did against Tottenham we'll be out of Europe very quickly and we won't finish any higher than sixth in the Premiership,\" he told icons.com. \"We must improve on Thursday when we play Olympiakos in [Euro Vase],\" he added. \"If we make the same mistakes again we'll be beaten 5-0.\" John Hartson's \u00a34m move to Charlton is in danger of collapsing after the Addicks board failed to agree to his wage demands. Jack Dyson, a member of Manchester City's 1956 FA Cup-winning team, has died in Oldham at the age of 66. Dyson, a striker who scored 26 goals in 63 league appearances for City, also made 150 appearances for Lancashire county cricket team over a 10-year period, scoring 4,433 runs and taking 161 wickets. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match (10.30pm) Man Utd highlights.

      "body": "<p>Patients are like wild animals: you can never show fear, or they will attack. I'm tempted to believe that we have a habit of over-complicating things, not just to patients, but to each other, in order to bolster some illusory sense of control. </p> <p>On some level, even to the most educated and involved patient, we routinely lie in our mannerisms and attitudes, because medicine just isn't a precise business, and if you took a moment to be honest with yourself, you would admit that you find it hard to cope with that, especially when mortality is hitting you for the first time, and especially in A&amp;E. </p> <p>You don't want me standing over you in casualty thinking out loud: \"Buggered if I know, but you can't die too quickly as long as I hit you with some oxygen and keep your circulation moving.\"</p> <p>You want nurses and doctors dashing in and out of the cubicle, barking out coded instructions with thinly veiled urgency: you want the machine that goes ping, you want to be seen the moment you walk in the door, and you want it all to happen to the soundtrack of a drum and bass remix of the Casualty theme tune. </p> <p>What you get, of course, after waiting for several hours in a crowded waiting room full of screaming toddlers and haemorrhagic tramps, is a junior doctor like me. And once I've ascertained that you're not on the verge of death, while you are sizing me up for the haggard-looking teenager I appear to be (I promise you, I'm 24 and I work well under pressure), I'm trying to work out what kind of doctor you want me to be, because most of the time, it's harder than diagnosing your (frankly rather pedestrian) angina attacks. </p> <p>The stakes are high. I've had patients, who were either demented or plain belligerent, just clam up on me: I swear, I was so friendly and charming, they just stopped taking me seriously, and waited for the real doctor to arrive. I may feel the same way myself sometimes, but believe me, those real doctors can take a very long time to answer their bleeps. </p> <p>I know I can't expect it to be any other way. I don't expect you to tick the box marked \"authoritarian medical practitioner please\" any more than I expect you to fall out of the ambulance with Subdural Haematoma Scan My Head Please written on your T-shirt. </p> <p>But what I don't like is when it gets complicated and you uppity, over-educated Guardian readers start off all bitchy about me not telling you exactly what diagnostic options are passing through my head and then start demanding a more precise logical explanation of exactly why your 97-year-old mother fell off the commode this morning when the best I can come up with is that her house is a mess, the telephone cable is spangled across the room at ankle height, she can't see without her specs, and her children should do the honourable thing and either stick her in a home or let her move in with them in their flash central London pied \u00e0 terre. </p> <p>Am I ranting? My humblest apologies. Just try to remember that if you're going to die on the doorstep, we'll save you if anyone can, and if you're not, then we're doing just fine, Holby City histrionics or not. This is a teaching hospital for God's sake: we spew out doctors faster than you spew up blood. This is as good as it gets. </p> <p>On a more important note, I'd like to share with you my research findings on the transmissibility and infective nature of body odour. My interest was first aroused when the groins on one particular geriatrics ward started smelling the same as that of Mr P, a relatively new arrival to our surreal little salon, by which I mean that he had been festering in an acute medical bed at risk of hospital-acquired infections while social services quietly ignored him for a trifling three weeks. </p> <p>Body odours, it seems, are the result of a peculiar interplay between the nutrients secreted in your body's natural juices, and the microbes that feed on them. Just as different species of bacteria and fungi have furnished the French with a wide variety of cheeses from the same kind of milk, so a different selection of invisible helpers are apparently at work in the armpits, gussets and insoles of us all. This is an area in which I have recently become something of a connoisseur. </p> <p>At first the aroma of condensed egg white and vinegar was confined to the other gentlemen sharing his bay, whose sores had been tended by the same team of nurses. Within a week it had spread throughout the male end of the ward, and recently we have been detecting it on the surgical wards three floors below. </p> <p>And now, this morning, as I sit in my towel waiting for the doctor with whom I share a bathroom to finish his interminable shower, I cannot ignore the heady, familiar aroma which fills my nostrils. It is not a chain of events on which I wish to dwell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Patients are like wild animals: you can never show fear, or they will attack. I'm tempted to believe that we have a habit of over-complicating things, not just to patients, but to each other, in order to bolster some illusory sense of control. On some level, even to the most educated and involved patient, we routinely lie in our mannerisms and attitudes, because medicine just isn't a precise business, and if you took a moment to be honest with yourself, you would admit that you find it hard to cope with that, especially when mortality is hitting you for the first time, and especially in A&amp;E. You don't want me standing over you in casualty thinking out loud: \"Buggered if I know, but you can't die too quickly as long as I hit you with some oxygen and keep your circulation moving.\" You want nurses and doctors dashing in and out of the cubicle, barking out coded instructions with thinly veiled urgency: you want the machine that goes ping, you want to be seen the moment you walk in the door, and you want it all to happen to the soundtrack of a drum and bass remix of the Casualty theme tune. What you get, of course, after waiting for several hours in a crowded waiting room full of screaming toddlers and haemorrhagic tramps, is a junior doctor like me. And once I've ascertained that you're not on the verge of death, while you are sizing me up for the haggard-looking teenager I appear to be (I promise you, I'm 24 and I work well under pressure), I'm trying to work out what kind of doctor you want me to be, because most of the time, it's harder than diagnosing your (frankly rather pedestrian) angina attacks. The stakes are high. I've had patients, who were either demented or plain belligerent, just clam up on me: I swear, I was so friendly and charming, they just stopped taking me seriously, and waited for the real doctor to arrive. I may feel the same way myself sometimes, but believe me, those real doctors can take a very long time to answer their bleeps. I know I can't expect it to be any other way. I don't expect you to tick the box marked \"authoritarian medical practitioner please\" any more than I expect you to fall out of the ambulance with Subdural Haematoma Scan My Head Please written on your T-shirt. But what I don't like is when it gets complicated and you uppity, over-educated Guardian readers start off all bitchy about me not telling you exactly what diagnostic options are passing through my head and then start demanding a more precise logical explanation of exactly why your 97-year-old mother fell off the commode this morning when the best I can come up with is that her house is a mess, the telephone cable is spangled across the room at ankle height, she can't see without her specs, and her children should do the honourable thing and either stick her in a home or let her move in with them in their flash central London pied \u00e0 terre. Am I ranting? My humblest apologies. Just try to remember that if you're going to die on the doorstep, we'll save you if anyone can, and if you're not, then we're doing just fine, Holby City histrionics or not. This is a teaching hospital for God's sake: we spew out doctors faster than you spew up blood. This is as good as it gets. On a more important note, I'd like to share with you my research findings on the transmissibility and infective nature of body odour. My interest was first aroused when the groins on one particular geriatrics ward started smelling the same as that of Mr P, a relatively new arrival to our surreal little salon, by which I mean that he had been festering in an acute medical bed at risk of hospital-acquired infections while social services quietly ignored him for a trifling three weeks. Body odours, it seems, are the result of a peculiar interplay between the nutrients secreted in your body's natural juices, and the microbes that feed on them. Just as different species of bacteria and fungi have furnished the French with a wide variety of cheeses from the same kind of milk, so a different selection of invisible helpers are apparently at work in the armpits, gussets and insoles of us all. This is an area in which I have recently become something of a connoisseur. At first the aroma of condensed egg white and vinegar was confined to the other gentlemen sharing his bay, whose sores had been tended by the same team of nurses. Within a week it had spread throughout the male end of the ward, and recently we have been detecting it on the surgical wards three floors below. And now, this morning, as I sit in my towel waiting for the doctor with whom I share a bathroom to finish his interminable shower, I cannot ignore the heady, familiar aroma which fills my nostrils. It is not a chain of events on which I wish to dwell.",

      "body": "<p>Around 100,000 people attend hospital casualty units each year with burns injuries. The culprits are often the dangers lurking in every kitchen - steaming kettles, bubbling hot oil or fat, and scalding cups of tea or coffee - and the victims tend to be toddlers, unsteady on their feet, hugely curious, and completely lacking a sense of danger. </p> <p>But one of the most horrific burns cases in recent months was that of Alfred Page, a 12-year-old boy from Gillingham, Kent, who was injured not in the home but while out playing with home-made petrol bombs. He suffered 70% burns when another boy sparked a lighter near him, and will bear permanent scars. </p> <p>The other boy, also 12, still faces a sentence after admitting, at a court case that ended last week, \"recklessly\" causing grievous bodily harm. </p> <p>Alfred, however, has made a remarkable recovery since the incident in May. He no longer takes painkillers, can walk without a frame, and has started studying again. But his fightback is far from over and he faces further skin grafts. </p> <p>Alfred was treated at the St Andrew's Centre at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, where surgeons have pioneered work on the restoration of burns victims' skin using an artificial replacement made from an extraordinary combination of silicon and derivatives of shark's skin and cowhide. </p> <p>This \"artificial skin\", Integra, can achieve remarkable and rapid results for burns sufferers. But it is expensive enough to make NHS accountants go pale. A sheet of Integra about 10 inches by eight inches costs about \u00a31,500. Typically, at least 10 will be needed to treat a burn, depending on the size of the injury and the victim's age. </p> <p>The treatment works by using the body's own regenerative powers. The artificial skin - which looks like a semi-transparent clingfilm wrap and initially smells of the alcohol it is preserved in - is laid over the wound once all the dead tissue has been excised. </p> <p>Normal healthy skin is made up of two layers: the epidermis, which is the waterproof protective layer on top, and the dermis, which contains more complex structures like the hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands that produce oils. </p> <p>In a deep burn, both these layers are destroyed. Victims with extensive deep burns have no temperature controls because they cannot sweat. </p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the burn, they can sometimes even walk around feeling no pain because the nerve endings in their skin have been stripped away. </p> <p>Integra is also made up of two layers: silicon on top, and a mix of bovine collagen and shark fin cartilage underneath. </p> <p>Collagen is the basic building block of the human body, says Peter Dziewulski, consultant plastic surgeon at the St Andrew's Centre. </p> <p>\"If you think of the body as a house, collagen makes up the structure, the bricks as it were,\" he says. </p> <p>In the case of Integra, it comes from special herds of cattle that are guaranteed BSE-free, combined with the shark derivative, chondroitin-6 sulphate, which acts \"like the cement between the bricks that binds the collagen more tightly together\". </p> <p>Blood vessels grow into the collagen lattice to form a new dermis, and the burn victim's body uses the animal material to create new cells. </p> <p>The body does not reject the shark and cow matter as it would do transplants of pig skin or another person's skin (both of which are alternatives) because it is not intact \"foreign\" cells but a kind of potpourri of reconstituted biological material. </p> <p>It usually takes about three to four weeks for the blood vessels to reach the top of the collagen layer, after which the silicon is peeled off and a very thin skin graft is used to replace the epidermis. </p> <p>\"[Integra] allows us to take away the all the dead tissues very quickly after the injury. Dead tissues always attract bacteria,\" says Dziewulski. </p> <p>It gets the wound closed, which protects against infection and reduces water losses, and reduces the metabolic overdrive experienced by a burn victim as the body battles to recover. </p> <p>It also means that the patient does not have to go through the unpleasant experience of having grafts taken from other parts of his body (in some cases the burn is so extensive there is not much skin left on the patient to graft over the burns). </p> <p>But what Integra does not recreate is all the complex structures, the hair follicles and glands that provide essential functions - such as helping insulate us, and keeping the skin oiled and waterproof - that we do not notice unless we lose them. </p> <p>Here the surgeons at the St Andrew's centre have made an advance on existing treatment. Consultant plastic surgeon Jim Frame has found that implanting hair follicles into the Integra will stimulate the growth of new skin. </p> <p>Working on the scalp of a badly burned patient last year, he found that cells from the hair follicles grew up the hair shaft and provided a new layer of epidermis over the wounded area. </p> <p>In two weeks, a new epidermis had grown around the hairs, removing the need for a second operation to apply a skin graft. The patient, a man in his 20s from Essex, became the first person in the world to benefit from the new treatment. The ultimate aim of the surgeons' quest is to regenerate new skin as soon after the burn injury as possible. </p> <p>And what does the future hold for Alfred Page, who was finally allowed home in September after four months in hospital and 20 operations? He declared at the weekend that he was looking forward to indulging once more in his favourite hobby - fishing. </p> <p>\"I went with Dad for three hours the first week I came home,\" he said. \"It was great just breathing in some sea air.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Burned Children's Club runs an overseas exchange scheme and annual outdoor pursuits holiday for young burn victims treated at the St Andrew's Centre. Readers can make donations to the club, a registered charity, at 114 Middle Crockerford, Vange, Basildon, Essex, SS16 4JA.</p> <p><strong>Treating burns: then and now</strong></p> <p><strong> Ted Rogers, 82</strong> </p> <p>Treatment for burns may have been less hi-tech 50 years ago, but it proved effective for injured second world war soldier Ted Rogers, whose face and hands were ravaged in an explosion caused by a German bomb hitting a lorry carrying ammunition. </p> <p>\"I was an anti-tank gunner with the 7th armoured division against the Axis forces in the desert. </p> <p>\"I went with the eighth army under Montgomery from Alamein to fight at Mareth in Tunisia, where the Germans had a strong defensive line. In March 1943 I was in a slit trench and a Stuka dive bomber dropped a bomb that unfortunately hit the truck, which was carrying about 120 rounds of artillery ammunition and I don't know how many gallons of petrol. </p> <p>\"The blast went down into the trench and I was very seriously burned, mostly my hands and face. All I could see was fire. </p> <p>\"I was flown from Tripoli to Cairo, where they cleaned the wound up. The orderly picked bits off you that were coming away, like a bit of my ear. </p> <p>\"My eyelids were replaced with skin from my arms. The skin on my hands was replaced with grafts, which was done in England when I was transferred to a hospital in County Durham. I had dozens of operations. </p> <p>\"All the skin off the back of my hands had to be replaced. That was done with skin from my stomach, and in order to replace the skin on my stomach they took a fairly thick lump from my thigh. Little bits of skin were taken off my arm to make up what was lost from my thigh. I felt extremely ill; I almost weep at the thought of it now.\" </p> <p>Painful though the operations were, he made a successful recovery. On his return to civilian life, Rogers resumed his peacetime occupation of bricklaying, and even went on to build a yacht, which he sailed across the Atlantic. </p> <p>One remarkable side-effect of the burns is that he has found it acts like \"a built-in facelift\" as he has grown older. \"People who have severe burns, your face is initially contracted, but as the years go by this acts as a facelift, instead of your face sagging it remains fairly firm in contour,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> Terry Everitt, 46</strong> </p> <p>A works manager from Essex, Terry suffered extensive burns when he was very young. Over the years he has had as many as 60 operations, but he suffered continual problems until he was treated with Integra. </p> <p>\"I was about a year old and put something on top of the fireguard. It caught fire and set light to my woollen jumpsuit,\" he says. </p> <p>\"My mother came in and pulled it off, but because it was wool it had melted into my chest, and it pulled all the skin off my chest and the bottom half of my face. </p> <p>\"I've always lived with it. From the bottom of my lower lip to the top of my stomach I had scar tissue. Scar tissue doesn't grow, so I had to have numerous operations, taking skin grafts from different areas of my body. </p> <p>\"I always used to spend all my summer holidays in hospital having bits of skin taken off. When you get to be a teenager, blaming problems on the scars becomes an easy way out: 'There's no point in trying for the job because they're not going to give it to me.' If you get on the bus you find that people do not want to sit next to you. </p> <p>\"Because the skin used for transplants came off my thighs, I've had to go back every three or four years to have the fat taken off, or they [the transplant areas on his chest] end up looking like Cornish pasties. </p> <p>\"My natural growing stopped a long time ago, but I put on a bit of weight, as you tend to, and it started pulling my shoulders in. I could look straight ahead, but I couldn't look up. </p> <p>\"The advantage of the Integra is that it stretches; before I could only get my right arm up to about a 90 degree angle, now I can put it straight up in the air. </p> <p>\"And if I take my top off now, you have to look very close to notice that it is not normal skin.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Around 100,000 people attend hospital casualty units each year with burns injuries. The culprits are often the dangers lurking in every kitchen - steaming kettles, bubbling hot oil or fat, and scalding cups of tea or coffee - and the victims tend to be toddlers, unsteady on their feet, hugely curious, and completely lacking a sense of danger. But one of the most horrific burns cases in recent months was that of Alfred Page, a 12-year-old boy from Gillingham, Kent, who was injured not in the home but while out playing with home-made petrol bombs. He suffered 70% burns when another boy sparked a lighter near him, and will bear permanent scars. The other boy, also 12, still faces a sentence after admitting, at a court case that ended last week, \"recklessly\" causing grievous bodily harm. Alfred, however, has made a remarkable recovery since the incident in May. He no longer takes painkillers, can walk without a frame, and has started studying again. But his fightback is far from over and he faces further skin grafts. Alfred was treated at the St Andrew's Centre at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, where surgeons have pioneered work on the restoration of burns victims' skin using an artificial replacement made from an extraordinary combination of silicon and derivatives of shark's skin and cowhide. This \"artificial skin\", Integra, can achieve remarkable and rapid results for burns sufferers. But it is expensive enough to make NHS accountants go pale. A sheet of Integra about 10 inches by eight inches costs about \u00a31,500. Typically, at least 10 will be needed to treat a burn, depending on the size of the injury and the victim's age. The treatment works by using the body's own regenerative powers. The artificial skin - which looks like a semi-transparent clingfilm wrap and initially smells of the alcohol it is preserved in - is laid over the wound once all the dead tissue has been excised. Normal healthy skin is made up of two layers: the epidermis, which is the waterproof protective layer on top, and the dermis, which contains more complex structures like the hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands that produce oils. In a deep burn, both these layers are destroyed. Victims with extensive deep burns have no temperature controls because they cannot sweat. In the immediate aftermath of the burn, they can sometimes even walk around feeling no pain because the nerve endings in their skin have been stripped away. Integra is also made up of two layers: silicon on top, and a mix of bovine collagen and shark fin cartilage underneath. Collagen is the basic building block of the human body, says Peter Dziewulski, consultant plastic surgeon at the St Andrew's Centre. \"If you think of the body as a house, collagen makes up the structure, the bricks as it were,\" he says. In the case of Integra, it comes from special herds of cattle that are guaranteed BSE-free, combined with the shark derivative, chondroitin-6 sulphate, which acts \"like the cement between the bricks that binds the collagen more tightly together\". Blood vessels grow into the collagen lattice to form a new dermis, and the burn victim's body uses the animal material to create new cells. The body does not reject the shark and cow matter as it would do transplants of pig skin or another person's skin (both of which are alternatives) because it is not intact \"foreign\" cells but a kind of potpourri of reconstituted biological material. It usually takes about three to four weeks for the blood vessels to reach the top of the collagen layer, after which the silicon is peeled off and a very thin skin graft is used to replace the epidermis. \"[Integra] allows us to take away the all the dead tissues very quickly after the injury. Dead tissues always attract bacteria,\" says Dziewulski. It gets the wound closed, which protects against infection and reduces water losses, and reduces the metabolic overdrive experienced by a burn victim as the body battles to recover. It also means that the patient does not have to go through the unpleasant experience of having grafts taken from other parts of his body (in some cases the burn is so extensive there is not much skin left on the patient to graft over the burns). But what Integra does not recreate is all the complex structures, the hair follicles and glands that provide essential functions - such as helping insulate us, and keeping the skin oiled and waterproof - that we do not notice unless we lose them. Here the surgeons at the St Andrew's centre have made an advance on existing treatment. Consultant plastic surgeon Jim Frame has found that implanting hair follicles into the Integra will stimulate the growth of new skin. Working on the scalp of a badly burned patient last year, he found that cells from the hair follicles grew up the hair shaft and provided a new layer of epidermis over the wounded area. In two weeks, a new epidermis had grown around the hairs, removing the need for a second operation to apply a skin graft. The patient, a man in his 20s from Essex, became the first person in the world to benefit from the new treatment. The ultimate aim of the surgeons' quest is to regenerate new skin as soon after the burn injury as possible. And what does the future hold for Alfred Page, who was finally allowed home in September after four months in hospital and 20 operations? He declared at the weekend that he was looking forward to indulging once more in his favourite hobby - fishing. \"I went with Dad for three hours the first week I came home,\" he said. \"It was great just breathing in some sea air.\" \u0095 The Burned Children's Club runs an overseas exchange scheme and annual outdoor pursuits holiday for young burn victims treated at the St Andrew's Centre. Readers can make donations to the club, a registered charity, at 114 Middle Crockerford, Vange, Basildon, Essex, SS16 4JA. Treating burns: then and now Ted Rogers, 82 Treatment for burns may have been less hi-tech 50 years ago, but it proved effective for injured second world war soldier Ted Rogers, whose face and hands were ravaged in an explosion caused by a German bomb hitting a lorry carrying ammunition. \"I was an anti-tank gunner with the 7th armoured division against the Axis forces in the desert. \"I went with the eighth army under Montgomery from Alamein to fight at Mareth in Tunisia, where the Germans had a strong defensive line. In March 1943 I was in a slit trench and a Stuka dive bomber dropped a bomb that unfortunately hit the truck, which was carrying about 120 rounds of artillery ammunition and I don't know how many gallons of petrol. \"The blast went down into the trench and I was very seriously burned, mostly my hands and face. All I could see was fire. \"I was flown from Tripoli to Cairo, where they cleaned the wound up. The orderly picked bits off you that were coming away, like a bit of my ear. \"My eyelids were replaced with skin from my arms. The skin on my hands was replaced with grafts, which was done in England when I was transferred to a hospital in County Durham. I had dozens of operations. \"All the skin off the back of my hands had to be replaced. That was done with skin from my stomach, and in order to replace the skin on my stomach they took a fairly thick lump from my thigh. Little bits of skin were taken off my arm to make up what was lost from my thigh. I felt extremely ill; I almost weep at the thought of it now.\" Painful though the operations were, he made a successful recovery. On his return to civilian life, Rogers resumed his peacetime occupation of bricklaying, and even went on to build a yacht, which he sailed across the Atlantic. One remarkable side-effect of the burns is that he has found it acts like \"a built-in facelift\" as he has grown older. \"People who have severe burns, your face is initially contracted, but as the years go by this acts as a facelift, instead of your face sagging it remains fairly firm in contour,\" he says. Terry Everitt, 46 A works manager from Essex, Terry suffered extensive burns when he was very young. Over the years he has had as many as 60 operations, but he suffered continual problems until he was treated with Integra. \"I was about a year old and put something on top of the fireguard. It caught fire and set light to my woollen jumpsuit,\" he says. \"My mother came in and pulled it off, but because it was wool it had melted into my chest, and it pulled all the skin off my chest and the bottom half of my face. \"I've always lived with it. From the bottom of my lower lip to the top of my stomach I had scar tissue. Scar tissue doesn't grow, so I had to have numerous operations, taking skin grafts from different areas of my body. \"I always used to spend all my summer holidays in hospital having bits of skin taken off. When you get to be a teenager, blaming problems on the scars becomes an easy way out: 'There's no point in trying for the job because they're not going to give it to me.' If you get on the bus you find that people do not want to sit next to you. \"Because the skin used for transplants came off my thighs, I've had to go back every three or four years to have the fat taken off, or they [the transplant areas on his chest] end up looking like Cornish pasties. \"My natural growing stopped a long time ago, but I put on a bit of weight, as you tend to, and it started pulling my shoulders in. I could look straight ahead, but I couldn't look up. \"The advantage of the Integra is that it stretches; before I could only get my right arm up to about a 90 degree angle, now I can put it straight up in the air. \"And if I take my top off now, you have to look very close to notice that it is not normal skin.\"",

      "bodyText": "At first glance, the announcement that the NHS \"ban\" on the anti-flu drug Relenza is to be lifted looks like a dazzling result for the pharmaceutical industry and an embarrassing u-turn for the health service technologies regulator, the national institute for clinical excellence (Nice). But Nice's latest guidance, which replaces last autumn's interim guidance advising GPs not to prescribe Relenza on the grounds that there was no clear evidence that it would help the NHS treat flu patients, shows that the institute's original decision was basically sound. Nice now accepts that clinical trials have shown that there are some benefits for patients at risk of serious complications from flu. But it does not accept that Relenza can be anything more than a niche anti-flu drug, at least as far as the NHS is concerned. When the Relenza debate blew up last year, there was speculation that the costs to the NHS of providing it could be at least \u00a310m a year and at most \u00a3100m a year - a handsome earner for Glaxo, not just in the UK but also overseas, where the Nice decision is closely monitored. But the institute's latest figures show that, if correctly prescribed by GPs in line with Nice guidance, the amount paid out by the NHS on the drug could be as little as \u00a32.3m, or, at the most, \u00a311.7m - a miniscule amount in terms of the total NHS budget and Glaxo's profits. Although the ban is lifted, very few people will actually get the drug, at least from NHS GPs. If there is no mass flu outbreak this winter, as few as 97,000 \"at risk\" patients - essentially those who are over 65 and suffer from asthma, heart disease, or diabetes - will be able to take Relenza. Rather daringly, the NHS has decided to take an unusually commonsensical approach to any flu outbreak. It believes that its old technology immunisation programme, together with the even older school remedy of staying at home and wrapping up warm can beat flu this winter. Nice's decision is a small but fair concession to Glaxo, and may calm the drug giant's legendary temper.

ITV's line-up for Christmas 2000 also features Simon Nye's all-star TV adaptation of Aladdin, featuring Martin Clunes, Griff Rhys Jones, Paul Merton and Patsy Kensit. Among factual highlights, the broadcaster will be reuniting the actors who played the Von Trapp children in Julie Andrews musical The Sound of Music for an After They Were Famous special. And ITV bosses confirmed today that they had snatched Blankety Blank from the BBC. The game show, made famous by Terry Wogan, underwent a revival last year under new presenter Lily Savage. ITV exercised an option to broadcast the show after it poached the cross-dressing star played by Paul O'Grady. ITV's Christmas schedule also includes pop acts Westlife, Steps and Lulu performing hits from the 60s Detroit hit factory in Motown Mania. Other highlights include Sinatra: Good Guy, Bad Guy, a documentary featuring Hollywood stars such as Janet Leigh and Eddie Fisher talking about the legendary singer and actor. For winter, ITV has lined up an impressive drama offering, with major new costume adaptations of classic novels The Mayor of Casterbridge and Nicholas Nickleby. The multi-million pound classic productions are being seen as part of an attempt by ITV to catch up on the BBC's drama department, which has made costume drama its hallmark. ITV's winter schedule will also feature Thursday 12th, a new thriller from Politician's Wife writer Paula Milne; and Plain Jane, an Edwardian drama scripted by Lucy Gannon starring Kevin Whately. In addition, John Thaw and Sarah Lancashire are coming together on screen for the first time in drama The Glass. And feature film Waking Ned, a comedy about a small Irish village gripped by lottery fever, starring Ian Bannen and James Nesbitt, will be premiering on ITV this winter. Entertainment offerings include Popstars, the Australian real life soap format that follows the creation and launch of a new band; and High Stakes, Richard Wilson's new ITV sitcom. ITV's winter factual highlights include serial murder series To Kill and Kill Again, from heavyweight indie documentary producer Brook Lapping Productions; Some Liked it Hot, a look at the British on holiday from oral history specialist Steve Humphries; and Time of Our Lives, which looks at the post war social changes that have transformed Britain.",

      "bodyText": "The controversial anti-flu drug Relenza will be made available on the NHS on a strictly limited basis this winter after a health service advisory body overturned its own ban on the drug, issued last Autumn. But the decision is bound by tight prescribing guidelines - the drug will only be made available to groups at risk of severe complications from flu such as the elderly, and only during officially classified general flu outbreaks. The decision means Relenza may be prescribed to as little as 97,000 people, at a cost to the NHS of just \u00a32.3m according to estimates by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), which today issued its guidance on the use of the drug. Nice predicts that if its guidance is effective, the numbers of patients eligible to receive Relenza would be limited to between three and 17 for each of the 29,000 GPs in England and Wales during the \"flu season.\" Trials suggest Relenza reduces the duration of flu symptoms from six to five days, and can allow infected adults to \"return to normal activities\" about half a day earlier than would otherwise be the case. But the institute makes it clear that Relenza should not be used to treat flu in otherwise healthy people. \"These patients are advised not to visit the GP but advised to stay at home and take medicines from the chemist to relieve the symptoms.\" Separate guidance to GPs issued today by the Department of Health makes it clear that the government's flu immunisation programme, which it hopes will reach at least 60% of the 65 and over age group, will the \"first line of defence\" against the illness. Relenza will be prescribed only to those patients who present themselves to GPs within 36 hours of the onset of \"flu-like\" illness when flu is \"circulating generally in the community\", and who are able to begin their course of treatment within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. A course of the drug, which is taken through an inhaler-like device twice daily, lasts five days and costs \u00a324. It works by stopping the influenza virus from spreading between cells in the lungs. Official guidelines state that flu is \"circulating in the community\" when there are between 50 and 400 cases per 100,000 GP consultations a week. Normally less than 50 out of every 100,000 visit their GP with flu-like symptoms every week. An epidemic is defined as more than 400 cases per 100,000 GP consultations. The last official epidemic in the UK was in 1989-90 when 29,000 people died from flu. Last October Nice advised that Relenza should not be available on the NHS because there was insufficient evidence that it would have a positive impact on the ability of the NHS to tackle flu. Its manufacturer, Glaxo Wellcome, said today it welcomed Nice's latest recommendation as an admission that Relenza had \"a role to play in the treatment of influenza when the virus is circulating in the community for the treatment of at risk adults\". But Nice's decision represents only a partial vindication for the drug giant, which reacted furiously to last year's ban, at one point threatening to move its \u00a31bn research and development operation from the UK to the United States.

      "bodyText": "The controversial anti-flu drug Relenza will be made available on the NHS on a strictly limited basis this winter after a health service advisory body overturned its own ban on the drug issued last autumn. The decision by the National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness (Nice) is bound by tight prescribing guidelines - the drug will only be made available to groups at risk of severe complications from flu, such as the elderly, and only during officially-classified general flu outbreaks. Nice predicts that the cost to the NHS of its latest guidance will be between just \u00a32.3m and \u00a311.7m - and these costs could fall if, as a result, fewer patients are hospitalised after developing severe flu-related problems. The decision marks the latest round in a tussle between the pharmaceutical industry and the health service treatment and technologies regulator over whether new drugs should be made openly available on the NHS. Last October Nice gave interim advice that Relenza should not be available because there was insufficient evidence that it would improve the ability of the NHS to tackle flu. Nice has now accepted that clinical trials offer evidence that Relenza can work - reducing the duration of symptoms by one day from six to five - but has ruled that its benefits should be targeted at high-risk groups. The decision means that, if guidelines are followed, Relenza may be prescribed to between 97,000 and 500,000 people, according to Nice. It predicts that the numbers of patients eligible to receive Relenza will be limited to between three and 17 for each of the 29,000 GPs in England and Wales during the \"flu season\". Glaxo Wellcome, which manufactures Relenza, welcomed Nice's latest guidance as an admission that Relenza had \"a role to play in the treatment of influenza when the virus is circulating in the community for the treatment of at-risk adults\". But Nice's decision represents only a partial vindication for the drug giant which reacted furiously to last year's ban, at one point threatening to move its \u00a31bn research and development operation from the UK to the United States. Trials suggest Relenza can allow infected adults to \"return to normal activities\" about half a day earlier than would otherwise be the case. (This is a different measure of effectiveness from the one-day gain in relief from symptons.) However Nice makes it clear that Relenza should not be used to treat flu in otherwise healthy people. \"These patients are advised not to visit the GP but to stay at home and take medicines from the chemist.\" Separate guidance to GPs issued today by the Department of Health makes it clear that the government's flu immunisation programme, which it hopes will reach at least 60% of the 65-and-over age group, will be the \"first line of defence\" against the illness. Relenza will be prescribed only to those patients who approach their GPs within 36 hours of the onset of \"flu-like\" illness when flu is \"circulating generally in the community\", and who are able to begin their course of treatment within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. A course of the drug, which is taken through an inhaler-like device twice daily, last five days and costs \u00a324. It works by stopping the influenza virus from spreading between cells in the lungs. Official guidelines state that flu is \"circulating in the community\" when there are between 50 and 400 cases per 100,000 GP consultations a week. Normally less than 50 out of every 100,000 visits to GP concern flu-like symptoms every week. An epidemic is defined as more than 400 cases per 100,000 GP consultations.

      "bodyText": "Centaur Communications has postponed the planned \u00a3250m flotation, which was expected by the end of the year. One analyst said the float had been \"pulled\", but other Centaur sources suggested that the plans had just hit a temporary hitch. Centaur, which publishes Marketing Week, New Media Age, The Lawyer and Money Marketing, was hoping to raise as much as \u00a3100m cash from the float. The decision to postpone the launch could affect the company's expansion plans. The company recently promoted former Lawyer editor Sean Brierley to a new role spearheading new magazine launches. Brierley was unavailable for comment. But insiders have suggested that the company, which made \u00a311m profit on sales of \u00a380m in its last financial results, could still afford to focus on new launches. The company's financial spokesman said the company \"would not comment on market speculation\". But it is understood that market conditions have put the kibosh on the float, which was due before the end of the year.",

The odd thing was that even many hardcore correspondents failed to recognise him at first. He looked familiar, but then the place was crawling with familiar looking people, so Dalrymple looked as though he almost fitted in.</p> <p>Then the penny dropped. This was the fabled fisherman who had rescued Elian Gonzalez from the ocean and spent the next six months burnishing the legend. In fact, Dalrymple was a house cleaner being taken on one of his first fishing trips, and he stayed on the boat while his cousin plunged into the water to lift the traumatised Cuban five-year-old from the car inner tube he had been clinging to. But those details were subsumed in the born again Dalrymple's over-arching faith in Elian the Redeemer, which finally reached its zenith in that final traumatic photograph of Elian being taken from Dalrymple's arms by heavily armed police.</p> <p>Now, five months later and just before Dalrymple had been forgotten entirely, he was back poking his head in front of the cameras outside West Palm Beach's Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), an anti-hurricane bunker where some of Florida's awkward ballots were being counted. It was as if the star of one discontinued Florida soap opera had stumbled onto the set of another.</p> <p>Describing himself as \"a victim of the administration\", Dalrymple said he had come to check on reports of skullduggery by Gorites inside the EOC.</p> <p>Rumours had been spreading of lost chad, the tiny fragments of cardboard on which we now discover US democracy stands or falls. As the cynical are now fond of repeating: Chad happens. It happens in particular when voters punch holes in their punch-card ballots but fail to dislodge entirely the little rectangular perforated plug they were supposed to punch out.

      "bodyText": "As in a saintly vision, Donato Dalrymple appeared, as he seems to whenever television cameras are gathered together. The odd thing was that even many hardcore correspondents failed to recognise him at first. He looked familiar, but then the place was crawling with familiar looking people, so Dalrymple looked as though he almost fitted in. Then the penny dropped. This was the fabled fisherman who had rescued Elian Gonzalez from the ocean and spent the next six months burnishing the legend. In fact, Dalrymple was a house cleaner being taken on one of his first fishing trips, and he stayed on the boat while his cousin plunged into the water to lift the traumatised Cuban five-year-old from the car inner tube he had been clinging to. But those details were subsumed in the born again Dalrymple's over-arching faith in Elian the Redeemer, which finally reached its zenith in that final traumatic photograph of Elian being taken from Dalrymple's arms by heavily armed police. Now, five months later and just before Dalrymple had been forgotten entirely, he was back poking his head in front of the cameras outside West Palm Beach's Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), an anti-hurricane bunker where some of Florida's awkward ballots were being counted. It was as if the star of one discontinued Florida soap opera had stumbled onto the set of another. Describing himself as \"a victim of the administration\", Dalrymple said he had come to check on reports of skullduggery by Gorites inside the EOC. Rumours had been spreading of lost chad, the tiny fragments of cardboard on which we now discover US democracy stands or falls. As the cynical are now fond of repeating: Chad happens. It happens in particular when voters punch holes in their punch-card ballots but fail to dislodge entirely the little rectangular perforated plug they were supposed to punch out. It clings on and causes problems in the machines. When it came to the manual recount in West Palm Beach and Broward counties, Republican observers were finding little bits of chad on the floor after recounting sessions. This, they claimed, was clear evidence of ballot tampering, or at least, mishandling. The Democrats countered that the chad was destined to fall off. It proved that it had only been hanging on by one or two corners, so by dropping away it was simply revealing voter preference. This difference of opinion caused several minor scuffles in the rush to get to a piece of chad first, and one accusation by a Republican observer that a piece of chad had been eaten by his Democratic counterpart. From the point of view of a reporter, chad is fairly amusing at first, and there has been much guffawing at \"pregnant chad\", which describes the condition of a punch-card which has been punched but not penetrated, so that the chad protrudes but holds on with all four corners. It is cumbersome to describe. But think of the foreign press and what linguistic gymnastics they have to go through . The Germans have come up with \"Shwangeres Konfetti mit Ausbeulung\" - pregnant confetti with a cavity.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The little boy in the grey school sweatshirt walked into his headteacher's office, handed him an official letter that had been sent to his home and burst into tears. \"I am writing to inform you,\" said the letter from the UK Immigration Service, \"that arrangements have been made for your removal from the United Kingdom.\" Additions in ink instructed Zhao Hong Su on the day and time he was to report to Heathrow to catch a flight to Beijing; that was in 1997 when Zhao was eight. </p> <p>Dai Williams, long-serving head of Lyndhurst primary school in Duckinfield, Greater Manchester, then realised that one of his ablest children was about to be deported. \"I tried to calm Zhao down,\" said Williams. \"I told him we would do our best to keep him, that we didn't want to lose a good pupil like him.\" </p> <p>Zhao, now 11, arrived in Britain with his mother Xiao Fang, his sister Miao, 16, and brother Jing, 14, in 1995. Three years earlier, his father Lian Hu Su had fled to this country and sought refugee status on the grounds that he could be persecuted for sheltering students during the Tiananmen Square massacre. The family's asylum applications have been turned down. Dates for their deportation have come and gone; the latest was last Wednesday but no police officers arrived at Lyndhurst or nearby Astley High, the comprehensive attended by Miao and Jing. (It now seems there may been a stay of execution for a week, or possibly a month; nothing is certain.) </p> <p>Even if the law had turned up, neither Williams nor John Mayes, Astley's head, would have let them in. \"I would have told them they could not come in without a prior appointment,\" said Williams. \"And if they had made a prior appointment, I would have made sure Zhao wasn't here.\" </p> <p>As in similar struggles against deportations at other schools, the Duckinfield heads have chosen to come off the fence to lead active campaigns that have involved pupils, teachers, non-teaching staff and governors. Theoretical lessons about anti-racism, law, justice, politics and the media have suddenly taken on a local, practical resonance. </p> <p>Three years ago, Lyndhurst's pupils helped to gather 3,000 signatures on a petition and shortly after that, things went quiet. But ominous letters again began arriving at the Su home a couple of months ago. \"We told Zhao's classmates, explaining that he would like to stay but an aspect of the law said that he had to go,\" said Williams. \"The children said that they didn't want to lose his friendship and the football team didn't want to lose a star player.\" </p> <p>When the latest deportation notices began to arrive, Zhao cried again and was comforted by his class teacher Hazel Heron. \"I was horrified that this child who had been in our school for so long was so upset and so unsure of what was going to happen to him,\" she said. \"I felt helpless.\" </p> <p>The children fired off letters to the home secretary, Jack Straw. \"They really care for Zhao and remember that he didn't know what snow was when he first came here,\" added Heron. Classmate Sally Backhouse, 11, gave her own tribute to her friend: \"He's funny, kind and generous and he helps me with my work.\" </p> <p>Over at Astley High Miao's friends, fired with a sense of injustice, queued up to plead her case. \"She was one of the first friends I made when I came here,\" said Roxanne Taylor, 15. \"When I found out that she could be sent to China, I got very upset and bought her a present. I can tell her everything and she won't tell anyone else. We have never fallen out.\" </p> <p>\"She's a bit quiet but people soon got to know her because she gets top marks in tests,\" added Louise Pearson, 15. \"I would like her to stay because all this is upsetting for her and her friends. I don't want to lose a friend.\" </p> <p>On the classroom blackboard English teacher Damaris Revell has written the name and address of home office minister Barbara Roche: more letters will soon be on their way from Duckinfield to Whitehall. </p> <p>Revell's group has been reading Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird as a GCSE set book and has moved on to learn about the civil rights movement and to study Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech. The girls were asked to write their own speeches about something important to them. Some wrote about their families and friends; one wrote about the Omagh bombing; Caroline Williams wrote about Miao's plight: \"If the deportation takes place, it won't only be me who will feel upset and hatred towards the government but the entire school, her friends and their families. Remember these are real people with real feelings. This is real life. Please don't ignore it.\" </p> <p>Revell senses that the threatened deportations have given a sense of urgency to the girls' consideration of human rights: politics has come into the classroom. \"I encourage freedom of speech in my lessons,\" she said. \"I have no qualms about what I am doing. </p> <p>\"I have two young sons and they are at the centre of my universe. I would do anything to keep them safe. Everyone has a right to feel safe and I don't care about passports or borders. We are talking here about three children whom we love.\" </p> <p>Astley's head, John Mayes, keeps a cricket ball on his desk and you sense that he would like to throw it at an immigration official. He wrote to the immigration service on behalf of the Su children in September last year and did not receive a reply until 11 months later. It suggested a review of the family's case was under way; but it arrived on the day letters began arriving to give formal notice of deportation. </p> <p>Astley High's campaign has been run in consultation with Miao and Jing. \"It would be easy for me to raise emotions in an assembly and I asked the children if I should do that. They said no, so explanations have been given in a more subtle way in tutor groups,\" said Mayes. \"There has been no tub-thumping. I would prefer our pupils to feel genuine emotion rather than to have things scripted for them. That can be counterproductive.\" </p> <p>But Mayes worries about the impact of the campaign on British officials (will it make them more obdurate?), on Chinese officials (will they victimise the Sus if they are forced to return to China?), on the Su children themselves. </p> <p>Whatever the risks, active campaigning by schools seems to work. The Institute of Race Relations has set up a Schools Against Deportations website, which tells of success stories at three London schools. Staff at Forest Gate school learned that Natasha Matambele was to be sent back to Angola only a day before the deportation was due to take place. With pupils, they launched a campaign that drew in the media. The Home Office delayed the deportation and eventually allowed the family to stay. At Haggerston school in Hackney, east London, Mansanga Nanga, Feliciana Nanga and Muyeke Lemba all faced deportation to Angola. A campaign at the school helped to win them the right to stay. Lal Mohammed, a pupil at Rokeby school in Stratford, was threatened with deportation to Tanzania last year at the age of 15. Lal's plight was explained to pupils in an assembly and refugee topics were covered; pupils wrote letters to ministers and collected signatures. Other agencies were involved. \"This should not be part of my job,\" said English teacher George Fuller. \"But none of us had a choice. The school is a ready-made community that can respond quickly in these situations. And that's what made the difference. </p> <p>\"There is no question of manipulation. The letters students wrote were very honest - Lal was quite capable of being unpleasant while this was hanging over him. Many wrote to say he wasn't their mate but felt that what was being done to him was wrong. With some of our boys, it's a sweat to get them to write a couple of lines for coursework. But some of their letters about Lal ran to a whole page.\" </p> <p>Lal was allowed to stay, has left school and now hopes to join the navy. \"Without the teachers and pupils at Rokeby, the campaign would have been much more difficult,\" he said. </p> <p>Dr A Sivanandan, director of the Institute of Race Relations, suggests teachers cannot remain impartial. \"Lots of teachers are beginning to take sides because they see the unfairness and injustice of it all,\" he said. \"They are beginning to realise that the ideals taught in schools have to be translated into the world outside. The injustice is so apparent you can touch it. Teachers are becoming alive to that.\" </p> <p>Back in the Astley High classroom, Samantha Chadwick considered the school's campaign on behalf of the Su family and said: \"If something happens to one person, it happens to the rest of us, too.\" </p> <p> \u0095 The Institute of Race Relations' Schools Against Deportations website is at: <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/sad/enter.htm\">www.irr.org.uk/sad/enter.htm</a></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If there's one word that ought to strike fear into the hearts of Palestinians every time they hear it, it's \"restraint\".</p> <p>Whenever the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, announces that he has thought carefully about the situation and has decided to continue his policy of restraint - as he did yesterday - we can be sure that some new and horrifying offensive will follow within hours.</p> <p>Last night's \"restraint\" was an unprecedented two-hour bombardment of the Gaza Strip - in which more than 30 missiles were fired and electricity was cut off - plus the bulldozing of Palestinian farms, in response to a terrorist attack which killed two adults aboard a bus carrying Israeli settlers' children.</p> <p>As if to confirm that such onslaughts really are restraint, other Israelis always step forward after the event to condemn Mr Barak for not being tough enough. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book, but the Israelis are masters at it.</p> <p>The secret is never to be caught defending the indefensible. Instead of trying to justify your disproportionate response to riots and relatively minor acts of terrorism, you shift the debate into even more preposterous territory. The effect of this is to make outrageous actions appear reasonable by comparison.</p> <p>We saw the same technique at work last week, when US President Bill Clinton asked Congress to provide $450m \"emergency\" aid for Israel. This consists of $200m to pay for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon last May, and $250m to protect Israel from a new type of Iranian missile - a privilege not accorded to any of the other countries within firing range.</p> <p>There is no sensible justification for these payments, but Mr Barak had made it known beforehand that Israel really needed $800m - and he has been complaining ever since.</p> <p>Hey presto! Instead of Congress asking, \"Why on earth should we pay this money?\" they will ask: \"Is it enough?\"</p> <p>Over the last few weeks I have had several emails from Israel apologists about the Palestinian children killed in the conflict. The general drift of these is to blame their parents for not keeping them out of the way of Israeli bullets.</p> <p>The same point could equally be made of yesterday's bus bombing.

      "bodyText": "If there's one word that ought to strike fear into the hearts of Palestinians every time they hear it, it's \"restraint\". Whenever the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, announces that he has thought carefully about the situation and has decided to continue his policy of restraint - as he did yesterday - we can be sure that some new and horrifying offensive will follow within hours. Last night's \"restraint\" was an unprecedented two-hour bombardment of the Gaza Strip - in which more than 30 missiles were fired and electricity was cut off - plus the bulldozing of Palestinian farms, in response to a terrorist attack which killed two adults aboard a bus carrying Israeli settlers' children. As if to confirm that such onslaughts really are restraint, other Israelis always step forward after the event to condemn Mr Barak for not being tough enough. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book, but the Israelis are masters at it. The secret is never to be caught defending the indefensible. Instead of trying to justify your disproportionate response to riots and relatively minor acts of terrorism, you shift the debate into even more preposterous territory. The effect of this is to make outrageous actions appear reasonable by comparison. We saw the same technique at work last week, when US President Bill Clinton asked Congress to provide $450m \"emergency\" aid for Israel. This consists of $200m to pay for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon last May, and $250m to protect Israel from a new type of Iranian missile - a privilege not accorded to any of the other countries within firing range. There is no sensible justification for these payments, but Mr Barak had made it known beforehand that Israel really needed $800m - and he has been complaining ever since. Hey presto! Instead of Congress asking, \"Why on earth should we pay this money?\" they will ask: \"Is it enough?\" Over the last few weeks I have had several emails from Israel apologists about the Palestinian children killed in the conflict. The general drift of these is to blame their parents for not keeping them out of the way of Israeli bullets. The same point could equally be made of yesterday's bus bombing. What sort of parents put their children in the front line of battle and send them to school in an armoured bus with a military escort? The answer is Israeli settlers. \"Settlers\" - the word has connotations of romance and adventure, but also of seeking a better life, tilling the soil. For Americans it probably conjures up images of quiet homesteads on the prairie. But in the case of Israeli settlers, \"thieves and brigands\" would be a better description. They live on stolen land and have been known to shoot Palestinian neighbours for quietly going about their own business picking olives. All the world, apart from Israel itself, regards the settlements as illegal, but Israel treats any attack on them as an unjustified outrage. Without the settlers, peace would have come long ago. For the sake of 200,000 bigots in the West Bank and Gaza, the conflict continues, threatening now to destabilise the entire Middle East. One day, the international community may wake up and impose some real restraint.

It also enhances their own personal development and makes them more attractive to prospective employers. </p> <p>The Birmingham Mentoring Consortium (BMC) runs the scheme, which enables degree-level students to apply for Millennium Awards worth \u00a32,000 each. The students act as mentors for young people at secondary school who are underachieving or at risk of school exclusion. They also design and carry out a one-year project in a local West Midlands community. </p> <p>\"Each mentor supports two or three young people and, together with four hours a week on the community project, this works out at about a day a week,\" says Gethin Davies, consultant director of Second City; Second Chance, which is part of the BMC. </p> <p>\"We do not advise third-year students to do it for obvious reasons, and year one is stressful in other ways, so it's better for year two students,\" Davies adds. </p> <p>Ian Webber is a mature student on a degree course in sports, physical education and community studies at Birmingham University who aims to become a primary school teacher. He has just completed the second year of his course, during which he mentored two 13-year-old boys. </p> <p>\"They are capable of achieving decent passes at GCSE but they don't have stable home lives and they were giving the teachers hassle,\" says Webber. \"The idea of mentoring is to give the kids someone to talk to, advice and a bit of leadership.\" </p> <p>Webber also got the boys involved in his community project, a basketball team for disaffected young people. Webber - who is married with a three-year-old son - has two jobs, one in a bar and one at Aston Villa Football Club, as well as working full-time through the summer vacation. </p> <p>\"The Millennium Award does make a difference,\" he says. \"It means I don't have to work so many hours and I can have time to study when I really need it.\" </p> <p>But the rewards have not all been monetary. \"I've benefited as much as the kids have. I've been able to use skills that have been lying dormant - I'm a good trainer, a good motivator. It's given me valuable insight into schools and the systems they use for discipline.\" </p> <p>Webber has a mixed ethnic background - \"I don't class myself as either black or white, and I've had varied influences through my childhood,\" he says. \"The two boys I was mentoring both come from a very strong black background and their parents speak patois. This is one issue we tried to address. I have read about it and it seems that in certain cases, black children speak patois to the teacher as a way of striking out. I explained that it's not a crime to speak patois but it's more polite to address people in formal settings using formal language. I said I didn't mind them slipping into patois but their teachers might find it a problem.\" </p> <p>The boys gave this suggestion a frosty reception at first, he says, but recently their teacher told Webber that things had improved dramatically. </p> <p>The Birmingham Mentoring Consortium is an inter-cultural mentoring organisation, currently embracing the Hindu, African-Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Sikh communities, as well as people from white and ethnically mixed backgrounds. Most mentees are supported by mentors from the same ethnic background as themselves. </p> <p>\"The concept of same-race support is important in terms of the role modelling dimension of mentoring,\" says Gethin Davies of Second City, Second Chance, who was recently awarded the OBE in recognition of the value of the scheme. </p> <p>Everyone wins, he says. The hard-pressed undergraduates get extra cash and valuable experience, while the kids benefit from having role models and mentor support. </p> <p>What's more, a range of new community projects was set up by the first 29 Millennium Award mentors, including schemes to help refugees into employment, to support young mothers and to teach computer skills to African-Caribbean elders. </p> <p>Dr Stephen Nepaulsingh, Aliesher Burrell's headteacher at Handsworth Wood Girls' School, says the scheme is good for his school. In each of the last two years, half a dozen pupils - some who have behavioural problems and are disruptive, some lacking in self-esteem, some who need adult support - have had mentors and he feels this has made a difference to their lives. Girls will often listen to an outsider rather than to their parents or teachers, he says. </p> <p>\"And the mentors are young people, closer to them in age, who can relate to them better.\" There are a number of other schemes around the UK that involve university students in mentoring - some of which are paid. </p> <p>But wouldn't someone who is doing it for altruistic reasons make a better mentor than someone attracted by the dosh? That may be true in individual cases, says Davies, but it is not statistically true. Recruitment and retention of mentors is a big problem for most mentoring schemes - without paying mentors it is difficult to get the long-term continuity that is so vital. </p> <p>In the BMC scheme, all the mentors who started the year were still there at the end. If \u00a32,000 to buy the mentor's time is what it takes to make the scheme work, he says, so be it. </p> <p>\u0095 In the National Mentoring Pilot Project, set up by the Department for Education and Employment in 1999, 16 universities and one higher education college have been linked with schools in Education Action Zones. Each higher education institution involved in the project has between 40 and 100 students working as mentors. The students earn \u00a35 an hour for four hours' work each week, mentoring pupils from schools that are considered to need extra support.</p> <p> \u0095 The Birmingham Mentoring Consortium aims to extend its work to the Pakistani community in Birmingham. If its bid to the Millennium Commission is successful, mentors of Pakistani background will be needed next year. Volunteer mentors are urgently needed now in preparation for this.

Recruitment and retention of mentors is a big problem for most mentoring schemes - without paying mentors it is difficult to get the long-term continuity that is so vital. In the BMC scheme, all the mentors who started the year were still there at the end. If \u00a32,000 to buy the mentor's time is what it takes to make the scheme work, he says, so be it. \u0095 In the National Mentoring Pilot Project, set up by the Department for Education and Employment in 1999, 16 universities and one higher education college have been linked with schools in Education Action Zones. Each higher education institution involved in the project has between 40 and 100 students working as mentors. The students earn \u00a35 an hour for four hours' work each week, mentoring pupils from schools that are considered to need extra support. \u0095 The Birmingham Mentoring Consortium aims to extend its work to the Pakistani community in Birmingham. If its bid to the Millennium Commission is successful, mentors of Pakistani background will be needed next year. Volunteer mentors are urgently needed now in preparation for this.

      "bodyText": "The Studio, the new film channel being launched by NTL and Hollywood studio Universal, has hired HHCL &amp; Partners to create a multi-million pound launch advertising campaign. The channel already has a strong line-up of films, including Notting Hill, Babe and The Flintstones, thanks to Universal's involvement. The joint venture is part of NTL's aim to build its own content instead of relying on products from Sky, as well as generating additional revenues by selling the channels to other broadcasters. The channel will launch \"within the next six months\", according to the company. Deborah Fitzgerald, marketing and communications director for Universal Studios Networks UK, said: \"We decided to invite HHCL to develop ideas for The Studio before looking at agencies because we are delighted with their work on Sci-Fi. \"This is a challenging brief for HHCL in that the two channels represent entirely different proposition and we anticipate an innovative and instinctive approach to them both.\"",

The formal email was drafted in a heavily guarded Tokyo hotel, where he has been staying since he arrived in Japan last week for an unscheduled visit.</p> <p>His cabinet resigned en masse in protest, complaining that he had not made it clear whether he would return home.</p> <p>Earlier the Peruvian embassy in Tokyo said Mr Fujimori was in Japan to ask for economic aid, and that his visit had been extended because he had a cold.

      "bodyText": "The Peruvian president, Alberto Fujimori, remained tight-lipped about his planned resignation yesterday despite speculation that he is seeking Japanese citizenship to avoid corruption charges at home. Mr Fujimori announced his decision to stand down in a terse statement issued on Monday in Japan, the birthplace of his parents. The formal email was drafted in a heavily guarded Tokyo hotel, where he has been staying since he arrived in Japan last week for an unscheduled visit. His cabinet resigned en masse in protest, complaining that he had not made it clear whether he would return home. Earlier the Peruvian embassy in Tokyo said Mr Fujimori was in Japan to ask for economic aid, and that his visit had been extended because he had a cold. It now refuses to say how long he will stay. Alejandro Toledo, the main opposition leader, believes Mr Fujimori is trying to obtain long-term refuge to avoid returning home to explain his role in a bribery and intimidation scandal. He said in Spain: \"We've just heard there has been a request for a Japanese passport.\" The opposition parties, who have gained control of congress since Mr Fujimori went abroad, want to question him about the activities of his former spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, who is now in hiding. Mr Montesinos is accused of human rights abuses, electoral fraud and receiving millions of dollars from drug barons. Mr Fujimori has refused to discuss matters relating to his 10 years of hardline rule, but he is bound to fear a supreme court to which three judges he had sacked have been reinstated. How long he will remain in Japan is unclear. Japan has a history of refusing asylum applications, but Mr Fujimori is entitled to apply for citizen ship because his parents were born there. He has plenty of time to lodge an application - foreign ministry officials said he would be allowed to stay for a year with diplomatic status even after leaving his post. A request for citizenship could open a constitutional can of worms. The Peruvian media claims that he was born in Japan, which would mean that he was not entitled to become president. The government denies the claim. In Lima yesterday opposition leaders said they were preparing to remove him from the presidency on the grounds of moral unfitness. Congressman Cesar Zumaeta Flores of the centre-left party Aprista said any resignation letter would be rejected and his post declared vacant. He said: \"His moral behaviour as president leaves a lot to be desired; the fact he has fled is totally shameful.\" Such a move could thwart Mr Fujimori's plans for his second vice president, Ricardo Marquez, to take over until elections are held in April, and let the opposition run a transitional government. The outgoing prime minister, Federico Salas, said Mr Fujimori might run for congress to get immunity from the criminal investigations. Speculation about the president was further compounded yesterday when removals vans entered the presidential palace.",

      "bodyText": "A possible last-minute backroom deal with party rebels yesterday seems to have saved the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, from the greatest threat to his seven-month premiership. After the retreat from a potentially damaging split, the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its coalition allies easily defeated a no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition in a chaotic parliamentary session late last night. The motion was beaten by a margin of 237 votes to 190. \"The general public has never said 'no' to the policies I have been pursuing since I took office,\" Mr Mori said, vowing to move beyond the political turmoil by focusing on new measures to stimulate the ailing economy. But his victory may prove short-lived because the rifts in the LDP are unlikely to heal without his removal from power. The no-confidence vote was an anti-climax to weeks of frenzied political speculation about the possible break-up of the party that has held power for all but 12 months of the past 45 years. The marathon session was interrupted by heated rows between MPs, including a conservative - a former wrestler - who was expelled from the chamber after he threw water over a heckler. Until the motion was tabled, the 480-seat lower house of parliament appeared to be split down the middle. But at the last minute Koichi Kato, the former general secretary of the LDP who led the rebellion, suddenly advised his supporters to abstain rather than vote against the government and risk expulsion from the party. \"You should retreat with dignity,\" he said tearfully. \"Unfortunately, the outlook for the vote is extremely delicate and we are not in a situation where we could necessarily claim victory.\" In an unusually public attack on his party leader, Mr Kato had earlier promised to force the resignation of Mr Mori at any cost. The Harvard-educated former diplomat said the country risked sinking like the Titanic if it continued with the unpopular prime minister's tax-and-spend policies, which have given Japan the biggest public deficit in the industrialised world. His defeat is a blow to the reformers in the LDP, who have seen the crisis of the past fortnight as the best opportunity for seven years to change the country's politics. The reason for the capitulation remained unclear last night, but it appeared that Mr Kato decided to yield ground after losing the numbers game, both in parliament and among the public. Earlier in the day more than 20 members of his faction - led by elderly cabinet members such as the finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa - refused to join his attack, which critics dismissed as a personal push for power. An opinion poll by the Asahi TV station showed that two-thirds of voters want the gaffe-prone Mr Mori to step down, although just 35% thought Mr Kato would make a better prime minister. Just before his u-turn, Mr Kato is believed to have met Hiromu Nonaka, the LDP's most-powerful \"shadow shogun\", prompting rumours that they might have agreed to remove Mr Mori later on to preserve party unity. Toku Yamasaki, head of another dissident LDP group, said the compromise paved the way for a future leadership challenge by Mr Kato. \"This may appear to be a failed attempt, but we must make this the new beginning.\" He said they must not lose the chance for Mr Kato to lead the LDP. But the public may find it difficult to forgive Mr Kato, who has now managed to betray both his conservative leader and reform-minded members of the government and opposition parties. \"This wasn't just a vote about Mr Mori, but about whether the Japanese nation will go bankrupt or not,\" Takayoshi Igarashi, professor of politics at Hosei University, said. \"Without reform and a new leader, Japan cannot survive.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At 10 to four on a winter afternoon, I'm looking at Brice Marden's paintings in London's Serpentine Gallery. My eye follows the loops and arcs and intersections of the lines that fill them, crossing and recrossing the canvases, swerving, wallowing, climbing and dipping. The line is never slack. It stays alert. </p> <p>Yet the longer I look, the more the painting's colour becomes fugitive and unfixable, the harder it is not to snag on details, and lose the thread of the structure of the painting and my own place in it. There's no beginning or end. </p> <p>Now there seems to be something wrong with my eyes: the paintings flicker, brighten up and then go dim again. But no, at this time of day, with the daylight going and the gallery lighting taking over, what I'm seeing is the flux of the National Grid, the surges in the power lines.</p> <p>I imagine all those hidden wires underground, a map of arteries and connections, the electrons pulsing down wires, and that somehow my own wiring has become entangled with the paintings, hooking me up to these fluctuations in the line. </p> <p>The painting I'm looking at is one of the earliest, and certainly the largest, in this survey of Marden's work of the past decade. It is called The Muses, a big, sallow, faded green canvas traversed by endless looping lines, endless complications. </p> <p>The painting, and the line, evokes natural things - weedy unkempt tangles and tendrils, autumn vines whose leaves have gone. There are bodies in there, too, a deja vu of breasts and hips, legs and necks, the curve and fall of drapery. There is a lot of air and space between the lines, and the thin greenness beyond is more like atmosphere, or the memory of a scent, than colour itself. </p> <p>Commentaries on this painting tell me it has something to do with Marden's father, and his love of nature, as well as the artist's own sojourns in Greece, the ghosts of gods in the rocks and vineyards, and his adolescent daughters dancing in the studio on the island of Hydra. </p> <p>It is a fertile image. It also inevitably recalls Jackson Pollock, and looks forward to some of Gary Hume's recent paintings of female bodies, duplicated and replicated and overlain in skeins of line, entangled with indoor plants. </p> <p>But Marden's painting stays resolutely itself, revealing its own indeterminacies in the fitful gallery light. Like all his works here, you want to look at it for a long time, go away, then look some more. </p> <p>It has been almost 20 years since Marden - who was born in 1938 - last had a major show in Britain, and almost 30 since, as a student, I saw that first grey and grainy catalogue of his, which had the artist standing naked alongside his gummy, waxy, painted monochromes. </p> <p>The paintings were dedicated to Otis Redding and Janis Joplin. (Artist take care: what if he'd name-checked Donny Osmond or Neil Diamond? What kind of slant would that have given the work?) Looking at The Muses, those old photos of the artist as a young man, interposing his own body next to the near-blank early paintings, come back as another faint echo. </p> <p>Early Marden was minimalism with soul. His work was evidently hand-made. It was contemplative yet also concise, reserved and somehow street-wise. His recalcitrant art implied hidden depths; but unlike Rothko's, say, it didn't make you feel put-upon or guilty if you didn't get the heavy-handed reverberations. </p> <p>Marden went on to dedicate drawings to poets Kenneth Rexroth and Gary Snyder, and to relate his later multi-panel paintings to the lintels and posts of Greek architecture. Classical allusions, and evocations of Mediterranean light, as well as to eastern mysticism, lent his work impeccable, austere credentials. </p> <p>But, at some point, we all stopped reading The Way of Zen and Marden's paintings sort of disappeared, amidst the noise and bluster of neo-expressionism. </p> <p>It was clear that Marden never wanted to go back to the tabula rasa. His paintings were always about fullness rather than emptiness. What was behind Marden's monochrome painting was drawing. Marden has always drawn, and for decades there was a sense of a split between his work in the two media. </p> <p>His drawings were always linear and, even when they related to the grid, there were enough accidents, blots, misrulings and spatters to make them interesting. One group was called Suicide Notes, and they looked to me like rehearsals for the scaffold. </p> <p>It took a long time for the drawing to get into the paintings in a full-blooded way. The line, when it did arrive, was spiky, tense and nervous. It appeared that it - or the man wielding the brush - was wired up or strung out. </p> <p>On the way from A to B, Marden's line had crying jags and anxiety attacks. It was jangly and tense, as if it had drunk too much coffee. It related to calligraphy, but it was abstract, uncertain whether it was structural or a form of invented writing. Sometimes a bit of a body, or a memory of a shape, would emerge, only to disappear again. </p> <p>Somehow, Marden marshalled this line and set it to work in his paintings, bringing with it incident, accident, overdrawing and erasure, all the impedimenta and clutter of drawing. Gradually - this exhibition shows us how - the curve got cleaner, the line more regular, its charge more even. </p> <p>Everything in the painting started to work in concert, from the ground up, and from the last layer and mark back to the first. Where does drawing end and painting begin? It doesn't matter. </p> <p>In Holland, where I spent a bit of time teaching this year, I'd hear the mutter that \"The Mondrian project is over\", uttered with regretful finality. The Mondrian project being, I suppose, a sort of utopian abstraction. </p> <p>And at a conference I attended this weekend, people were talking about the \"post-medium paradigm\" (only at conferences will one hear such a cloth-eared phrase, uttered without a hint of irony), and we perhaps ought to look at painting in the light of the fact that the medium is not the message. </p> <p>But never say it's over. Marden, quite unexpectedly, took up Mondrian's regular line, introducing it to late, late Willem de Kooning on the way. Marden's lines loop the loop. They arc and dip and wiggle, take purposeful open curves, drive over the painting's centre, then pull onto the hard shoulder of the canvas edge to negotiate corners with a tight turn. </p> <p>They circulate endlessly. You drive them with your eyes, first one way, then another. The line is even and smooth. This is driving over clean Tarmac with new tyres. Returning to the whole, you keep finding shapes, then losing them again. Your eyes switch from the blue line to the black, then onto the yellow for a while. It is the enjoyable pursuit of nothing, in search of a resolution that never comes. </p> <p>The evenness and uninflectedness of Marden's recent line - a line with even width and speed, a line that never falters or runs ragged - lends the paintings a sort of fixatedness. The colour is resonant and full, even when it is interestingly dirty. The paintings are flat, but not so cleaned up as to be mechanical. </p> <p>The line, which looks layered and colour-coded (red running over a blue-green over black, all on a bluish-grey ground, for example), is all in the same surface. The layering is optical as much as it is physical. You can't always tell in what order the colours were laid down, nor quite how many reversals and revisions have taken place. What passes for painterliness is the residue of the works' manufacture, rather than self-conscious attempts to be personal, stylish or anecdotal. </p> <p>Marden's recent work, especially over the past seven or eight years, is the end of the line for Mondrian - the Mondrian terminus, the closing of a loop. Mondrian, of course, began as a kind of art nouveau artist, and his work was filled with arcs and curves. It ended in straight lines, going up and down, left and right. Marden reintroduced the curve, the bulge, the hook and the arc, re-animating Mondrian's ghost. </p> <p>Yet of all ghosts - of history, of earlier painters and paintings - the strongest presence here is de Kooning, whose last works were driven entirely by instinct for painting, when even his sense of personality and self was dissembled by Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p>Marden does nothing if not pay homage to very late de Kooning, whose last coherent works were a kind of memory of the body and its boundaries - the artist's own, the bodies he admired and desired - all distilled into pure gesture and aching colour. </p> <p>If de Kooning's last works are for us about his own disappearance, a last behavioural trace, Marden's sense of the body is fully conscious of itself. It knows where it has been, it knows where it is going. </p> <p>The fixatedness of his line, inscribing and reinscribing itself on the bounded plane of the canvas, recording its passage, is fully aware and self-conscious. These are, I think, paintings about that sense of self-awareness, and the complications it entails. Looking at them, you become acutely aware of your own act of looking, of standing still in front of something that is both an abstraction, and utterly concrete. These are beautiful conundrums. </p> <p>\u0095 Brice Marden is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 (020-7298 1515), until January 7.</p>",

But never say it's over. Marden, quite unexpectedly, took up Mondrian's regular line, introducing it to late, late Willem de Kooning on the way. Marden's lines loop the loop. They arc and dip and wiggle, take purposeful open curves, drive over the painting's centre, then pull onto the hard shoulder of the canvas edge to negotiate corners with a tight turn. They circulate endlessly. You drive them with your eyes, first one way, then another. The line is even and smooth. This is driving over clean Tarmac with new tyres. Returning to the whole, you keep finding shapes, then losing them again. Your eyes switch from the blue line to the black, then onto the yellow for a while. It is the enjoyable pursuit of nothing, in search of a resolution that never comes. The evenness and uninflectedness of Marden's recent line - a line with even width and speed, a line that never falters or runs ragged - lends the paintings a sort of fixatedness. The colour is resonant and full, even when it is interestingly dirty. The paintings are flat, but not so cleaned up as to be mechanical. The line, which looks layered and colour-coded (red running over a blue-green over black, all on a bluish-grey ground, for example), is all in the same surface. The layering is optical as much as it is physical. You can't always tell in what order the colours were laid down, nor quite how many reversals and revisions have taken place. What passes for painterliness is the residue of the works' manufacture, rather than self-conscious attempts to be personal, stylish or anecdotal. Marden's recent work, especially over the past seven or eight years, is the end of the line for Mondrian - the Mondrian terminus, the closing of a loop. Mondrian, of course, began as a kind of art nouveau artist, and his work was filled with arcs and curves. It ended in straight lines, going up and down, left and right. Marden reintroduced the curve, the bulge, the hook and the arc, re-animating Mondrian's ghost. Yet of all ghosts - of history, of earlier painters and paintings - the strongest presence here is de Kooning, whose last works were driven entirely by instinct for painting, when even his sense of personality and self was dissembled by Alzheimer's disease. Marden does nothing if not pay homage to very late de Kooning, whose last coherent works were a kind of memory of the body and its boundaries - the artist's own, the bodies he admired and desired - all distilled into pure gesture and aching colour. If de Kooning's last works are for us about his own disappearance, a last behavioural trace, Marden's sense of the body is fully conscious of itself. It knows where it has been, it knows where it is going. The fixatedness of his line, inscribing and reinscribing itself on the bounded plane of the canvas, recording its passage, is fully aware and self-conscious. These are, I think, paintings about that sense of self-awareness, and the complications it entails. Looking at them, you become acutely aware of your own act of looking, of standing still in front of something that is both an abstraction, and utterly concrete. These are beautiful conundrums. \u0095 Brice Marden is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 (020-7298 1515), until January 7.",

      "bodyText": "Britain threw its full weight behind the European Union's new defence effort yesterday, pledging 12,500 men for a rapid reaction force in the face of what ministers dismissed as \"hysterical\" Tory warnings that the country's over-stretched armed forces were being drawn into an anti-Nato morass. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, made the long-trailed announcement at an EU meeting in Brussels, where the 15 member states offered a total of 100,000 troops, 400 aircraft and 100 ships for crisis management operations. They will be used for peacekeeping and humanitarian purposes, not for more war-like \"peacemaking\" operations, and no British troops will be sent anywhere without the explicit consent of the government of the day, Downing St stressed as the Tories and their media allies condemned \"a political gesture\".' The presence of Lords David Owen and Denis Healey, as well as such retired senior officers as General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley, among the critics of the force added weight. But the EU's lack of key military assets - troop-carrying aircraft, satellites for intelligence, and logistical support - effectively made the case that the new force's use will be limited. On a day seen as an historic milestone in giving the EU military muscle to match its economic weight, the council of ministers' building bristled with officers dripping gold braid and medals among the standard diplomats' suits. But Mr Hoon was distracted by a familiar UK battleground. He insisted that there was no question of creating a standing force, or anything else resembling the European army that the Tories claim is evidence of the government's \"stealthy march to a superstate\". Underlining the British point, the conference declaration said there would be no \"unnecessary duplication\" of Nato functions or assets. It stated explicitly: \"This does not involve the establishment of a European army.\" Lord George Robertson, the Nato secretary-general, joined the chorus of voices saying the RRF would strengthen Nato, not undermine it - and stressing that, whoever wins the White House, the US wants Europe to build up its military capacity after its weakness was exposed in former Yugoslavia. But illustrating the familiar difficulty that the EU means different things to different people, the German foreign minister, Joshka Fischer, said: \"This is part of the European integration process.\" Few EU leaders, including Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, agree with him. Mr Hoon said: \"It is extremely disappointing that what is a sensible commonsense way of planning a European commitment should become the subject of rather hysterical comment from Eurosceptic elements of the Conservative party.\" He insisted that there had been no discussion of controversial issues such as EU badges or uniforms. Yesterday's contributions, still not formally announced, range from 13,500 troops from Germany to just 100 from tiny Luxembourg, according to previously leaked figures. Ministers were given three secret annexes with details of current assets, assets needed, and the shortfall between the two. A sensitive issue is the creation of a review mechanism to ensure that the gap is closed. The pledges confirm that the EU should be able to meet its 2003 goal of being able to field a force of up to 60,000 within 60 days and to maintain it for one year. Javier Solana, the EU's defence and foreign policy chief, said the union needed to keep up the pace, notably by a deal with Nato on future cooperation. The force will be used for crisis tasks ranging from the evacuation of EU nationals, say from an African civil war, to Bosnian-style peace enforcement requiring heavily armed combat troops and the equipment to match. Highly mobile ground forces are seen as essential at a time when most of Europe's 2m soldiers - too many of them unsuitable conscripts - are still trained and equipped for cold war static defence. They lack state of the art equipment. Field Marshal Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of Britain's defence staff, said: \"With two million men and women under arms in Europe today, 60,000 doesn't seem so many.\" No new forces are being created to meet the goal and many of the troops pledged are also already committed to Nato. Any decision to deploy troops must be unanimous, and in a major operation the commander of the RRF will be the European who always holds the Nato post of deputy supreme allied commander, Europe: currently the Briton General Rupert Smith. The force commander will be the German General Rainer Schuwirth. The opposition leader, William Hague, has suggested repeatedly that troops from the 15 member states will fight under EU insignia, saying: \"If it looks like an elephant and sounds like an elephant, then it is an elephant.\" Useful links: www.europa.eu.int/pol/cfsp/index_en.htm EU: common foreign and security policy www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext EU's 1998 declaration on defence www.weu.int/eng/index.html Western European Union www.mod.uk/index.php3?page=882 MoD information on rapid reaction forces",

      "body": "<p>Cyberspace is proving tricky to navigate for the young entrepreneurs who dreamed of making millions from the internet. </p> <p>Yesterday saw another high-profile US dot.com, SkyAuction, pull its flotation, and in Silicon Valley workers have taken to dubbing the worst performing stocks on Nasdaq as members of the 90% club - a reference to how much the companies have lost compared with their value at the peak of the internet boom. </p> <p>In Britain the picture is just as bleak. One of Unilever's forays into the web recently ended when Wowgo, a site aimed at teenage girls, folded and the financial news site TheStreet closed its Clerkenwell offices on Friday. Shopping advice site Ready2shop is also scaling back its ambitions. </p> <p>Webmergers, a US-based investment site, said at least 130 internet companies have shut down worldwide since the beginning of this year. Nearly 100 of those companies focused primarily on a consumer rather than a business audience. The rate of closure has accelerated in November, according to Webmergers.com. </p> <p>Few of Britain's more high-profile launches have survived. Boo.com, which lost an estimated \u00a380m in about seven months, and Clickmango, fronted by Joanna Lumley, both failed in their original forms. </p> <p>This gloomy picture has not discouraged everyone, however. It has just emerged that Henry Lane Fox has left Lastminute.com, the much hyped etailer co-founded by his sister Martha, to set up his own business to business dot.com company. </p> <p>Lastminute, valued at \u00a3731m at its peak is now worth \u00a3140m. </p> <p>A company spokesperson refused to give details about Mr Lane Fox's new venture, apart from saying it is a business-to-business company that is not in the same area as Lastminute. Mr Lane Fox, a 25-year-old Oxford graduate, has been with the company for two-and-a-half years and worked in the product strategy department. </p> <p>By setting up a dot.com in the current market conditions Mr Lane Fox is bucking the negative trend that sees at least one dot.com go under every day. </p> <p>Wowgo, which provided fashion, health and beauty tips for teenage girls, closed just over a week ago.

      "bodyText": "Cyberspace is proving tricky to navigate for the young entrepreneurs who dreamed of making millions from the internet. Yesterday saw another high-profile US dot.com, SkyAuction, pull its flotation, and in Silicon Valley workers have taken to dubbing the worst performing stocks on Nasdaq as members of the 90% club - a reference to how much the companies have lost compared with their value at the peak of the internet boom. In Britain the picture is just as bleak. One of Unilever's forays into the web recently ended when Wowgo, a site aimed at teenage girls, folded and the financial news site TheStreet closed its Clerkenwell offices on Friday. Shopping advice site Ready2shop is also scaling back its ambitions. Webmergers, a US-based investment site, said at least 130 internet companies have shut down worldwide since the beginning of this year. Nearly 100 of those companies focused primarily on a consumer rather than a business audience. The rate of closure has accelerated in November, according to Webmergers.com. Few of Britain's more high-profile launches have survived. Boo.com, which lost an estimated \u00a380m in about seven months, and Clickmango, fronted by Joanna Lumley, both failed in their original forms. This gloomy picture has not discouraged everyone, however. It has just emerged that Henry Lane Fox has left Lastminute.com, the much hyped etailer co-founded by his sister Martha, to set up his own business to business dot.com company. Lastminute, valued at \u00a3731m at its peak is now worth \u00a3140m. A company spokesperson refused to give details about Mr Lane Fox's new venture, apart from saying it is a business-to-business company that is not in the same area as Lastminute. Mr Lane Fox, a 25-year-old Oxford graduate, has been with the company for two-and-a-half years and worked in the product strategy department. By setting up a dot.com in the current market conditions Mr Lane Fox is bucking the negative trend that sees at least one dot.com go under every day. Wowgo, which provided fashion, health and beauty tips for teenage girls, closed just over a week ago. The company was backed by Unilever and Durlacher. A Unilever spokesperson gave no explanation for its closure. The market conditions have also forced Xyratex, a network infrastructure systems company, to postpone its Neuer Markt listing because of weak capital markets conditions. The company had planned to list next month. \"From our point of view, the current capital market environment is not ideal for a qualitatively high valued placement,\" Ken Wilkie, Xyratex's chief executive said. Burst.com, a site specialising in the delivery of online video and audio, yesterday said it was cutting 80% of its staff to help reduce its monthly expenditure to $500,000 (\u00a3360,000).. At Ready2shop, the company is scaling back its ambitions for its website after failing to attract sufficient cash from venture capital backers. Trinny Woodall and Susan nah Constantine, who set up the company to provide women with shopping advice, yesterday confirmed they were looking for a strategic partner. Ms Woodall and Ms Constantine said in a statement: \"We are obviously disappointed that we've been forced to take such a tough decision, but by restructuring and minimising our overhead we can make the cash we have last another year. \"We're now redirecting our focus and effort into Ready2's offline business until confidence is restored in the market or until we conclude negotiations with a strategic partner for an exclusive web content deal.\" Fourteen people lost their jobs on Friday because the company, which does not sell through its site and does not carry adverts because it aims to offer impartial shopping advice, has not managed to pull in the \u00a37m it was trying to raise",

      "body": "<p>On the face of it the evidence against Mzwakhe Mbuli - the radical poet who performed at Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first black president - was overwhelming.</p> <p>When the police stopped his car just 200 metres from - and minutes after - a bank robbery in Pretoria three years ago, they found the stolen cash and weapons inside.</p> <p>His bizarre explanation why he was sitting with the proceeds of an armed robbery on his lap did not do his case much good. He claimed that a complete stranger had lobbed the bag, stuffed with money, a gun and a grenade, through the open car window and run off.</p> <p>The judge did not believe a word of it at the trial last year and jailed Mbuli for 13 years, along with two accomplices. An appeal court agreed that his description of events was \"highly improbable\".</p> <p>But Mbuli, known as the \"people's poet\", has found an unusual champion for his claim that he is the victim of a high-level conspiracy to prevent him revealing the names of top government officials involved in drug trafficking.</p> <p>Helen Suzman is an old hand at taking on the establishment. She sat in the whites-only parliament for 13 years as the only voice against apartheid. Now the grand dame of white liberalism is championing the cause of the angry black poet in Pretoria central prison, believing he is a victim of the injustice of the new South Africa.</p> <p>\"There is a conspiracy which the police are in on. I think the police are capable of anything. I've seen what they can do in the past and they're no better now,\" she said.</p> <p>Mrs Suzman, 83, was hauled on to the case through her niece, the actress Janet Suzman, who had been approached by Mbuli's agent in London. At first Mrs Suzman was sceptical of the poet's protestations of innocence but she agreed to use her influence to look at the case.</p> <p>\"I wasn't convinced at all of his story. I didn't know the man from a bar of soap, but I got to know him well. I was impressed with the man, with his good character,\" she said.</p> <p>There were two aspects that particularly troubled Mrs Suzman. Mbuli is not poor. He has a large following and eight albums to his name, built on his fame as a rabble-rousing poet at the burials of anti-apartheid activists.</p> <p>Some praised his work as liberation poetry, others dismissed it as Marxist agitprop.</p> <p>Either way, by the time of the robbery he could command more for a single performance than the 15,000 rand (\u00a31,400) stolen from the bank. In addition, he is famous enough in South Africa for plenty of people to recognise him if he robbed a bank without shielding his identity.</p> <p>\"It seemed to me quite incredible that a man who was making a good living should walk into a bank with a hand grenade but no disguise, which is important because he is a very striking man and his face is very well known,\" Mrs Suzman said.</p> <p>\"He performed at former president Mandela's inauguration. He is very well known. It doesn't make sense.\".</p> <p>Only two of the six witnesses could pick out Mbuli in an identity parade, and the process was so irregular that one of them had to be discounted.</p> <p>Mbuli claims that he was framed after threatening to reveal the names of prominent South African politicians involved in drug smuggling, given to him by a Swazi police officer. Mrs Suzman says there were two attempts to murder him.</p> <p>\"Then he was phoned by a guy who said he had information about who was responsible for the assassination attempts,\" she said.</p> <p>\"He said to meet at a certain time in Pretoria. They were waiting when a chap threw a canvas bag into the car, said 'the evidence is in the bag' and ran off.</p> <p>\"They turned the car around and the police stopped them. When they searched the car they found the hand grenade, the money and a pistol.\"</p> <p>The police say they stopped Mbuli's car because it had tinted windows and they thought it suspicious. If true, it is a remarkable stroke of luck for them that the only vehicle stopped at the time happened to be the one used in the robbery.</p> <p>Sceptics have challenged Mbuli to reveal the names of those he alleges are drug traffickers.

      "bodyText": "On the face of it the evidence against Mzwakhe Mbuli - the radical poet who performed at Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first black president - was overwhelming. When the police stopped his car just 200 metres from - and minutes after - a bank robbery in Pretoria three years ago, they found the stolen cash and weapons inside. His bizarre explanation why he was sitting with the proceeds of an armed robbery on his lap did not do his case much good. He claimed that a complete stranger had lobbed the bag, stuffed with money, a gun and a grenade, through the open car window and run off. The judge did not believe a word of it at the trial last year and jailed Mbuli for 13 years, along with two accomplices. An appeal court agreed that his description of events was \"highly improbable\". But Mbuli, known as the \"people's poet\", has found an unusual champion for his claim that he is the victim of a high-level conspiracy to prevent him revealing the names of top government officials involved in drug trafficking. Helen Suzman is an old hand at taking on the establishment. She sat in the whites-only parliament for 13 years as the only voice against apartheid. Now the grand dame of white liberalism is championing the cause of the angry black poet in Pretoria central prison, believing he is a victim of the injustice of the new South Africa. \"There is a conspiracy which the police are in on. I think the police are capable of anything. I've seen what they can do in the past and they're no better now,\" she said. Mrs Suzman, 83, was hauled on to the case through her niece, the actress Janet Suzman, who had been approached by Mbuli's agent in London. At first Mrs Suzman was sceptical of the poet's protestations of innocence but she agreed to use her influence to look at the case. \"I wasn't convinced at all of his story. I didn't know the man from a bar of soap, but I got to know him well. I was impressed with the man, with his good character,\" she said. There were two aspects that particularly troubled Mrs Suzman. Mbuli is not poor. He has a large following and eight albums to his name, built on his fame as a rabble-rousing poet at the burials of anti-apartheid activists. Some praised his work as liberation poetry, others dismissed it as Marxist agitprop. Either way, by the time of the robbery he could command more for a single performance than the 15,000 rand (\u00a31,400) stolen from the bank. In addition, he is famous enough in South Africa for plenty of people to recognise him if he robbed a bank without shielding his identity. \"It seemed to me quite incredible that a man who was making a good living should walk into a bank with a hand grenade but no disguise, which is important because he is a very striking man and his face is very well known,\" Mrs Suzman said. \"He performed at former president Mandela's inauguration. He is very well known. It doesn't make sense.\". Only two of the six witnesses could pick out Mbuli in an identity parade, and the process was so irregular that one of them had to be discounted. Mbuli claims that he was framed after threatening to reveal the names of prominent South African politicians involved in drug smuggling, given to him by a Swazi police officer. Mrs Suzman says there were two attempts to murder him. \"Then he was phoned by a guy who said he had information about who was responsible for the assassination attempts,\" she said. \"He said to meet at a certain time in Pretoria. They were waiting when a chap threw a canvas bag into the car, said 'the evidence is in the bag' and ran off. \"They turned the car around and the police stopped them. When they searched the car they found the hand grenade, the money and a pistol.\" The police say they stopped Mbuli's car because it had tinted windows and they thought it suspicious. If true, it is a remarkable stroke of luck for them that the only vehicle stopped at the time happened to be the one used in the robbery. Sceptics have challenged Mbuli to reveal the names of those he alleges are drug traffickers. Mrs Suzman believes he should. \"We have to clear this up,\" she said. Mbuli has another appeal pending. He is putting a lot of his faith in the woman who has become his most frequent visitor. \"I had always looked at Helen Suzman as a white woman. But here she is, like my mother twice over,\" he said. \"I would never have believed that this woman would be an enormous source of strength to me. \"She sits, talks to me, touches me, holds my hand.\"",

For Gore the presidency is something he has been seeking with fixated energy for at least 20 years, through an apprenticeship in Congress and then eight years as vice-president. For Bush the urge has not been there so long. He discovered a political career only in mid-life, and still appears to be the vessel for other people's ambition as much as his own. But for both, the battle to establish which of them got the highest number of honest votes in Florida now puts their very lives as public men on the line.</p> <p>The scale of what's at stake also impresses the American people. There is little apparent resentment at what is going on. The emblematic image of election 2000 will always be that of three exhausted ordinary citizens in Palm Beach county, peering at a voting card back and front, up and down, as if reading the runes in search of a message they know no other way to divine. Such is the American respect for process that the prospect of this being done 6m times, a hand count of the complete Florida vote, is not appalling. Normal life carries on. Stable countries survive chronic political uncertainty, their economies booming, for a long time. Look at Italy.</p> <p>On the other hand, this can't go on for ever. Short of the supreme court justices counting those 6m votes themselves, there will always be complaints of bias, negligence or fraud. Any outcome will be imperfect. But there has to be finality somewhere, a point that puts Al Gore to the hardest question. He is, after all, the demandeur . On the counts so far, he has always been behind. At some point he runs the risk of being seen as the pedantic and vexatious litigant who is determined to place on Florida the entire weight of electoral imperfections that could surely be turned up in every other state by anyone motivated to try hard enough to do so.</p> <p>Politically, moreover, he faces the beginnings of a split with his party. His personal interest is totally in the battle. If he doesn't win this one, after squandering huge advantages, he will not be seen again. But for the Democratic party, the gains from a president elected by nit-picking, chad-challenging legal manoeuvres are reaching expiry point. Democrats now see some advantage in the installation of Bush as the weakest president for more than a century.</p> <p>For one thing, he would be able to do very little. The signal that America was turning its back on Clintonism has already been effaced by these weeks of incorrigible ambiguity - a point, incidentally, that removes from William Hague any chance of a Bush presidency announcing a global resurrection of the right. Bush can make it to the White House only as damaged goods. He will have neither the votes nor the mandate of a plurality, which every other president since 1876 has had.</p> <p>This weakness will be made worse not better by the Republicans' control of Congress. On the face of it, a weak Republican president and a razor-thin majority for his party on the Hill should shore each other up and deliver a programme. In practice this will not happen. Moderation, to the point of impasse, will transfer from a split electorate to a hung Congress. The Republicans' hold on both the political organs of the state will deprive the party of any alibis, as it grapples with an economic downturn and fails to enact the domestic agenda, especially the tax cuts Bush promised in the campaign. He will have responsibility without power, the prerogative of the loser throughout the ages.</p> <p>So, as well as Bush's manifest personal inadequacies, gridlock beckons. The same fate would befall Gore. But it was Bush who promised the end of those terrible Washington games, and vowed to coax into being an era when politics turned clean and effective. He will get an early opportunity to feel his words being stuffed down his throat, and will find whatever healing powers he has obliterated by the clear awareness that, in these fateful circumstances, the country is likely to repay an impotent Dubya by punishing his party at the 2002 Congressional elections, with the 2004 presidency to follow. The Democrats, in short, will not play ball.</p> <p>Such is a logical Democrat calculation. Very soon it may prove to be a convenient rationalising of the inevitable. If the Florida supreme court's response to yesterday's titanic legal encounter is to invalidate any hand recounting, then Bush should be home, unless the Gore people's righteousness drives them to yet more legal challenges, or possibly to make the case for interfering with the normal protocols of the electoral college. But equally, if the court decides not to move decisively in that direction, Gore should still be thinking hard about whether victory is worth having, out of a court process that will attract enough challenges to delegitimise its outcome in the eyes of many people, whatever recount is done.</p> <p>I f the point now at issue were the several thousand votes clearly handed in error to Pat Buchanan, it might be a different story. But that is no longer the frontline battle. Instead we have those puzzled scrutinies of chad holes by good but partisan people who have been told they can do a better job than machines. The moral of this extraordinary story is plainly that there needs to be an American version of electoral reform, starting with mass re-tendering for the supply of efficient voting machines: less obviously that Al Gore will have made an unanswerable case for having overtaken George W Bush as the heir to presidential legitimacy.</p> <p>A Bush presidency, though neutered by this history, would be an unattractive prospect. As argued here before, it would be especially alarming to America's allies and counterparts in global geopolitics.

To Democrats generally this would mark a transition as bitter as it would be terminal to Gore himself.</p> <p>But little of enduring substance could happen before 2002. The presidency will lack potency as well as grandeur, which means most of its moral authority. That's true of either man for sure, and it's something the rest of the world will have as many reasons to regret as to applaud.

      "body": "<p>Coca-Cola is expected to join the bidding for food and drinks group Quaker Oats, topping an existing offer from France's Groupe Danone and an earlier move from its rival PepsiCo. </p> <p>The Coca-Cola board are meeting today to discuss an offer of around $15bn for the Quaker Oats group. </p> <p>Last night Coca-Cola shares fell 6% amid fears that it would be tempted to overpay for Quaker, which owns Gatorade, the top-selling sports drink. Quaker's shares rose to a 52-week high of $96.75 (\u00a368) yesterday, valuing the business at $12.7bn. </p> <p>The stock market value of the company has risen sharply this year as evidence emerged that it would be taken over in a rapidly consolidating industry. </p> <p>Senior executives at Chicago-based Quaker are thought to have met over the weekend to discuss proposals from Coca-Cola and Danone. Earlier this month, PepsiCo, the world's second largest soft drinks business, held talks with Quaker which are understood to have valued the target at about $13.7bn. These talks fell through without agreement. </p> <p>Management at Coca-Cola were understood to have started talks with Quaker in a bid to prevent Pepsi from taking over Gatorade, which dominates the American sports drink market. </p> <p>Analysts have questioned the ability of Quaker Oats to expand the brand aggressively overseas - doubts which have attracted rival bids from larger companies.

      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola is expected to join the bidding for food and drinks group Quaker Oats, topping an existing offer from France's Groupe Danone and an earlier move from its rival PepsiCo. The Coca-Cola board are meeting today to discuss an offer of around $15bn for the Quaker Oats group. Last night Coca-Cola shares fell 6% amid fears that it would be tempted to overpay for Quaker, which owns Gatorade, the top-selling sports drink. Quaker's shares rose to a 52-week high of $96.75 (\u00a368) yesterday, valuing the business at $12.7bn. The stock market value of the company has risen sharply this year as evidence emerged that it would be taken over in a rapidly consolidating industry. Senior executives at Chicago-based Quaker are thought to have met over the weekend to discuss proposals from Coca-Cola and Danone. Earlier this month, PepsiCo, the world's second largest soft drinks business, held talks with Quaker which are understood to have valued the target at about $13.7bn. These talks fell through without agreement. Management at Coca-Cola were understood to have started talks with Quaker in a bid to prevent Pepsi from taking over Gatorade, which dominates the American sports drink market. Analysts have questioned the ability of Quaker Oats to expand the brand aggressively overseas - doubts which have attracted rival bids from larger companies. Quaker Oats refused to comment on any talks yesterday. Several reports suggested that Coca-Cola would be willing to pay 1.9 of its own shares for every share of Quaker Oats. Before yesterday's decline wiped some $900m from this deal, this would have valued Quaker Oats at about $16bn. Investors were wary yesterday as Coca-Cola has only recently started to perform strongly after a new management team was appointed earlier this year. The company announced a $192m settlement to solve damaging race discrimination lawsuits last week. Jennifer Solomon, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, downgraded Coca-Cola, citing takeover uncertainty. John McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential, said that the market was concerned that the intense competition in the industry would drive up prices. Groupe Danone refused to comment on reports that it had made a lower offer for Quaker Oats yesterday. The French group joined with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK earlier this year in an abortive effort to buy Nabisco Holdings. Among Quaker's products are: Gatorade energy drink Cap'n Crunch cereal Quaker Oats porridge Quaker Grits grits (milled corn kernels) Aunt Jemima pancake mixes and syrup Rice A Roni rice products",

      "body": "<p>Any chance of a recount? Judith Keppel will certainly hope not, as she cheerfully tots up the \u00a31m she won on last night's jackpot episode of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? ITV will be only too happy with the result, as well. For the best part of two years, Chris Tarrant has taunted contestants by dangling that seven-figure prize before them - only to keep it just out of reach. Viewers were getting restless, wondering if the real booty would ever be given away. So ITV needed a winner - and yesterday they certainly got one.</p> <p>Still, there may well be some Florida-style rumblings of discontent with the outcome. For Ms Keppel may have been a millionaire on paper even before she was asked the question: \"Who was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine?\" Though billed as \"a gardener from Fulham\", she is, in fact, the proud owner of a three-storey home in that rather posh London neighbourhood. Her first marriage was to one of the capital's leading art dealers.</p> <p>To cap it all, Ms Keppel has blue blood. She came out as a debutante in 1959, her grandfather was the ninth Earl of Albemarle and she is the great great niece of Alice Keppel, a mistress of the future Edward VII. As if that was not enough, she is a distant cousin of Camilla Parker-Bowles.</p> <p>Now, is it only the hard core class warrior who will see something amiss in all this? Or might the great British viewing public also baulk at ITV helping an aristocrat make her already highly agreeable life \u00a31m better?

      "bodyText": "Any chance of a recount? Judith Keppel will certainly hope not, as she cheerfully tots up the \u00a31m she won on last night's jackpot episode of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? ITV will be only too happy with the result, as well. For the best part of two years, Chris Tarrant has taunted contestants by dangling that seven-figure prize before them - only to keep it just out of reach. Viewers were getting restless, wondering if the real booty would ever be given away. So ITV needed a winner - and yesterday they certainly got one. Still, there may well be some Florida-style rumblings of discontent with the outcome. For Ms Keppel may have been a millionaire on paper even before she was asked the question: \"Who was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine?\" Though billed as \"a gardener from Fulham\", she is, in fact, the proud owner of a three-storey home in that rather posh London neighbourhood. Her first marriage was to one of the capital's leading art dealers. To cap it all, Ms Keppel has blue blood. She came out as a debutante in 1959, her grandfather was the ninth Earl of Albemarle and she is the great great niece of Alice Keppel, a mistress of the future Edward VII. As if that was not enough, she is a distant cousin of Camilla Parker-Bowles. Now, is it only the hard core class warrior who will see something amiss in all this? Or might the great British viewing public also baulk at ITV helping an aristocrat make her already highly agreeable life \u00a31m better? For surely the appeal of all shows of this kind, including the national lottery, is the Robin Hood factor: this is the possibility that even the least well-off can become a millionaire in a flash. When Robin Hood gives to someone who is already rich, the thrill is not quite the same. So we congratulate Ms Keppel on her well-earned win - even as we hope that the finger of luck points in a slightly less well-heeled direction the next time round.",

It dominates the markets for routers, switches and connections that allow computers to talk to each other over the internet. Cisco says that 75% of all net traffic travels over its products. The market is one of the most important and fastest growing of the world's economy and has helped write one of the most extraordinary corporate success stories in history. </p> <p>Founded in a husband and wife's bedroom in the mid-1980s, Cisco today employs 40,000 people worldwide and in the past three months it generated revenues of $6.5bn (\u00a34.5bn).

You cannot afford to ignore it. </p> <p>The company is aiming to convert the world - and Cisco practices what it preaches. Almost every administrative procedure possible is executed over the web in the name of efficiency. Ninety per cent of orders are taken online generating $80m of product sales a day. </p> <p>Staff members book their own travel requirements on the company intranet and everyone flies economy class, even the most senior executives.

After three months I'd be going nuts.\" </p> <p>The central character at Cisco is Mr Chambers, a former IBM salesman who was promoted to the top job in 1995. Brought up in West Virginia, he likes doing things the old fashioned way. He wears a suit and tie (a rarity in Silicon Valley) and prefers a handshake to a contract. In every other respect he is the modern, egalitarian business leader who has an office the same size as his middle managers. He cannot get enough of the internet and evangelises about it constantly. </p> <p>Since Mr Chamber's arrived Cisco's market value has leapt to about $370bn, making him a billionaire in the process. While other firms have fallen by the wayside as technology has overtaken them Cisco has simply issued more shares to buy the gadgets it needs. Chief executives from America's greatest corporations flock in their droves to San Jose to drink in the Cisco culture. Presidents and prime ministers listen in awe as Mr Chambers speaks out on behalf of the internet. </p> <p>Even Wall Street has stayed loyal, as Cisco's share price rise has generated huge returns for more than 3m shareholders. But cracks have recently started to appear in the relationship, with big investors questioning whether Cisco can maintain its growth rate or afford to carry on buying the technologies it needs to stay ahead of the game. Yesterday Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its price target on Cisco to $75 from $90 - and the shares fell $2 to just above $50. </p> <p>\"Our share price is down at the moment but so is everyone else's.

A few hours later, with two of the German group found dead, the Tyrol began mourn its first avalanche victims of the season. The number of confirmed victims of the weekend's avalanches now stands at four.</p> <p>These are entries on a list that seems to be growing faster by the year, as the perils of avalanches impress themselves ever deeper on the public imagination.</p> <p>It is a terrifying litany of deaths, even taking into account only the last two winters: the toll of 38 near Galt\u00fcr in Austria; the 23 skiers killed last December, when avalanches thundered down from the mountains near Ischgl; the six tourists who died in two snowslides in Switzerland and Italy in February, one of them caused when a German man and his son ventured off into deep snow; the 11 deaths at Kaprun in March, when a group of ski instructors from across Europe were obliterated by an avalanche 150ft wide.</p> <p>And then there are the countless deaths, in ones and twos, that rarely merit even a sentence in the local newspapers, unless they happen to be friends of Prince Charles.</p> <p>Experts are divided on whether the number of avalanches really is increasing - and, in the long term, the number of deaths is actually falling, according to the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research. But one thing is indisputable: the exposure of the averagely inexperienced tourist skier to the dangers of avalanches is rapidly increasing.</p> <p>\"The snow is living material,\" says Yves D\u00e9try, a veteran mountain guide based in the French Alps with 28 years' experience of the vagaries of the mountains. \"It is always changing, from the morning to the evening, and from one day to the next. And it is very difficult to predict, even if you know the snow well.</p> <p>\"It's now very easy to go off piste even if you're a beginner, but you have to obey the rules of the mountain. They're very harsh: you get them right, you live; you get them wrong, you're dead. It's very difficult to understand the mechanics of the snow. Skiing in the powder is the best thing; the piste is dead snow for me. But you have to be safe.\"</p> <p>It seems like the most biblically implacable of natural disasters: a massive reminder to blas\u00e9 holidaymaker that life is not a climate-controlled theme park; that Nature-with-a-capital-N never misses the opportunity to underscore the frailty of human capabilities.</p> <p>And yet all the evidence seems to suggest that, in 2000, the \"white death\" of medieval folklore is at least in part a very human phenomenon. From the recklessness of individual daredevils accidentally dislodging slabs of hard-packed snow to global warming, it is too simplistic to dismiss this weekend's deaths as an act of God.</p> <p>\"Advances in ski technology, and the increase in popularity of free-ride skiing and snowboarding, mean people can get to a standard where they can venture off piste much more quickly than ever before,\" says Vanessa Haines, of the Ski Club of Great Britain.</p> <p>\"Previously, it would take years of experience to head off into the powder - but now people can put themselves in danger without necessarily knowing it, either putting themselves in the path of avalanches, or actually triggering them by disturbing the snow.\"</p> <p>But the German group struck down at the weekend were hardly beginners: they went off piste as part of a course for ski instructors. This, though, is another hazard of the explosion of popularity in skiing: instructors are being confronted more and more frequently with requests to venture into areas outside the secure pistes - often simply to avoid the weight of tourists.</p> <p>Ernst Sch\u00f6pf, mayor of the village of S\u00f6lden, near the site of this weekend's deaths, was reduced to shaking his head in despair. \"What more can we do to persuade mad skiers from skiing into such a dangerous pass?\" he asked.</p> <p>Notices had been displayed, warning that the area in question was classified as level five - the greatest danger - but these had apparently been ignored. The group was not equipped with specialist airbags, which can be inflated in the event of an avalanche to keep the skier above snow level.</p> <p>Mayor Sch\u00f6pf's frustrations are shared by alpine governments, who have developed a complex network of warning and prevention systems which seem utterly impotent in the face of a single overadventurous skier.</p> <p>Last year, authorities in the Tyrol alone spent more than \u00a312m maintaining a safety system that includes bombing mountaintops with heavy explosives, dropped from aeroplanes, in order to trigger controlled snowslides, along with an infrastructure of automatic weather stations, websites with cameras primed on the mountaintops, and tranceivers which off-piste skiers are required to carry.</p> <p>Global warming may be playing a role, too. Some blame climate change for the avalanches of last winter, when some parts of the Alps received almost four times their average snowfall. Temperatures fluctuated wildly, and heavy wet snow fell on top of newly settled lighter snow - a fatal recipe.</p> <p>But there is another side to the story, one that implicates cash-hungry developers in previously small alpine towns and villages. In the late 1970s, a strict system of danger-zone planning was introduced in the Austrian mountains, in which zones were colour-coded yellow - fairly risky, only rarely to be built on - and red: highly risky, and never to be built on.</p> <p>Since then, though, the pressure to increase accommodation in the Alps has risen as winter tourism has boomed, leading to a trend towards what has been called \"zoning with one eye closed\".</p> <p>In one case, in the early 1990s, of 130 houses found to be in the red zone near Salzburg, half had been built since the zones were introduced. Kaprun, a village in the shadow of Austria's Kitzsteinhorn glacier, now has accommodation for 14,000 people. Sure enough, avalanches in these burgeoning areas have begun to hit chalets and houses where once they struck only skiers on the most remote slopes.</p> <p>At Galt\u00fcr, in 1999, amid impending local elections, the tourist trade had become a political football, and the valley where the 38 died stood to lose \u00a35m annually if tourists stayed away. Some suggested this had led to a downplaying of safety warnings and building regulations.</p> <p>\"[We are] losing respect for nature,\" the deputy head of the local torrent and avalanche protection department said at the time. \"I'm convinced the danger-zone planning for Galt\u00fcr has to be revised.\"</p> <p>Over-development may prove as self-defeating as it is dangerous: already, reports suggest that, in the wake of this weekend's deaths and the devastating train fire near Salzburg, in which 155 died, up to 90% of forthcoming holidays to the region have been cancelled.</p> <p>The urge to place blame is strong, and quickly made itself felt in the Austrian Alps yesterday. On Sunday, a 33-year-old skier was arrested on suspicion of triggering an avalanche in south Tyrol, after skiing off piste into deep snow despite official warnings. Meanwhile, Innsbr\u00fcck prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the Obergurgl incident, which is thought to have been triggered by a 34-year-old German.</p> <p>It is still too early to say whether another season of fatal avalanches is on the way. But the Ski Club of Great Britain is forecasting fluctuating and heavy snowfalls of the kind that could make for an unstable, potentially dangerous snowbase. The white death may well claim many more lives before the winter is out.</p> <p><b>Snow sense: how to survive an avalanche</b> <b>Emma Brockes</b></p> <p>1 The best defence against an avalanche is to recognise the early signs. Scan weather conditions for the following: is snow building up at a rate of more than 2cm per hour? Has there been a recent temperature rise, heating snow to 0 degrees centigrade? Are air spaces visible between the layers of snow? A build-up of more than 30cm in one snowfall is a bad sign. Loosen your pack so that you can slip easily out of it and prepare to leave the mountain.</p> <p>2 Ninety per cent of avalanches are triggered by their victims, usually while skiing off-piste. If you decide to leave the main slopes, take a qualified guide who is equipped with the means to summon assistance, a shovel and first-aid pack, and knowledge of which areas to avoid.</p> <p>3 The average avalanche travels at 50mph, so don't attempt to outski it. Try to keep upright by manoeuvring yourself to the edge of the avalanche, where the force of the flow is less powerful.</p> <p>4 If you are knocked down, release your ski poles and try to \"swim\" with the slide. In an avalanche, snow takes on the characteristics of water and to stay afloat you should execute some sort of swimming stroke. If you are falling head first, try breast stroke; if feet first, try treading water.</p> <p>5 After half an hour, a buried victim has a 50% chance of survival, so your priority is to stay on the surface of the avalanche by grabbing a tree or rock, thrusting upward with kicking motions, or \"swimming\" to the side of the flow.</p> <p>6 When you come to a stop, assume a foetal position, with your hands in front of your face and elbows at your chest. Circulate your head to create an air pocket and hold a deep breath until the snow around you has settled. This way, you increase the chances of being able to breathe once the snow sets.</p> <p>7 Try to push one hand to the surface to attract attention, but don't waste energy thrashing about unless you can see light. Snow sets as hard as concrete and you will not be able to dig yourself out without assistance.</p> <p>8 Keep your breathing steady to try to preserve energy and oxygen. Only yell out when rescuers are immediately above you, since the snow insulates sound and they will not hear you.</p>",

Two more avalanches would be reported later in the day. A few hours later, with two of the German group found dead, the Tyrol began mourn its first avalanche victims of the season. The number of confirmed victims of the weekend's avalanches now stands at four. These are entries on a list that seems to be growing faster by the year, as the perils of avalanches impress themselves ever deeper on the public imagination. It is a terrifying litany of deaths, even taking into account only the last two winters: the toll of 38 near Galt\u00fcr in Austria; the 23 skiers killed last December, when avalanches thundered down from the mountains near Ischgl; the six tourists who died in two snowslides in Switzerland and Italy in February, one of them caused when a German man and his son ventured off into deep snow; the 11 deaths at Kaprun in March, when a group of ski instructors from across Europe were obliterated by an avalanche 150ft wide. And then there are the countless deaths, in ones and twos, that rarely merit even a sentence in the local newspapers, unless they happen to be friends of Prince Charles. Experts are divided on whether the number of avalanches really is increasing - and, in the long term, the number of deaths is actually falling, according to the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research. But one thing is indisputable: the exposure of the averagely inexperienced tourist skier to the dangers of avalanches is rapidly increasing. \"The snow is living material,\" says Yves D\u00e9try, a veteran mountain guide based in the French Alps with 28 years' experience of the vagaries of the mountains. \"It is always changing, from the morning to the evening, and from one day to the next. And it is very difficult to predict, even if you know the snow well. \"It's now very easy to go off piste even if you're a beginner, but you have to obey the rules of the mountain. They're very harsh: you get them right, you live; you get them wrong, you're dead. It's very difficult to understand the mechanics of the snow. Skiing in the powder is the best thing; the piste is dead snow for me. But you have to be safe.\" It seems like the most biblically implacable of natural disasters: a massive reminder to blas\u00e9 holidaymaker that life is not a climate-controlled theme park; that Nature-with-a-capital-N never misses the opportunity to underscore the frailty of human capabilities. And yet all the evidence seems to suggest that, in 2000, the \"white death\" of medieval folklore is at least in part a very human phenomenon. From the recklessness of individual daredevils accidentally dislodging slabs of hard-packed snow to global warming, it is too simplistic to dismiss this weekend's deaths as an act of God. \"Advances in ski technology, and the increase in popularity of free-ride skiing and snowboarding, mean people can get to a standard where they can venture off piste much more quickly than ever before,\" says Vanessa Haines, of the Ski Club of Great Britain. \"Previously, it would take years of experience to head off into the powder - but now people can put themselves in danger without necessarily knowing it, either putting themselves in the path of avalanches, or actually triggering them by disturbing the snow.\" But the German group struck down at the weekend were hardly beginners: they went off piste as part of a course for ski instructors. This, though, is another hazard of the explosion of popularity in skiing: instructors are being confronted more and more frequently with requests to venture into areas outside the secure pistes - often simply to avoid the weight of tourists. Ernst Sch\u00f6pf, mayor of the village of S\u00f6lden, near the site of this weekend's deaths, was reduced to shaking his head in despair. \"What more can we do to persuade mad skiers from skiing into such a dangerous pass?\" he asked. Notices had been displayed, warning that the area in question was classified as level five - the greatest danger - but these had apparently been ignored. The group was not equipped with specialist airbags, which can be inflated in the event of an avalanche to keep the skier above snow level. Mayor Sch\u00f6pf's frustrations are shared by alpine governments, who have developed a complex network of warning and prevention systems which seem utterly impotent in the face of a single overadventurous skier. Last year, authorities in the Tyrol alone spent more than \u00a312m maintaining a safety system that includes bombing mountaintops with heavy explosives, dropped from aeroplanes, in order to trigger controlled snowslides, along with an infrastructure of automatic weather stations, websites with cameras primed on the mountaintops, and tranceivers which off-piste skiers are required to carry. Global warming may be playing a role, too. Some blame climate change for the avalanches of last winter, when some parts of the Alps received almost four times their average snowfall. Temperatures fluctuated wildly, and heavy wet snow fell on top of newly settled lighter snow - a fatal recipe. But there is another side to the story, one that implicates cash-hungry developers in previously small alpine towns and villages. In the late 1970s, a strict system of danger-zone planning was introduced in the Austrian mountains, in which zones were colour-coded yellow - fairly risky, only rarely to be built on - and red: highly risky, and never to be built on. Since then, though, the pressure to increase accommodation in the Alps has risen as winter tourism has boomed, leading to a trend towards what has been called \"zoning with one eye closed\". In one case, in the early 1990s, of 130 houses found to be in the red zone near Salzburg, half had been built since the zones were introduced. Kaprun, a village in the shadow of Austria's Kitzsteinhorn glacier, now has accommodation for 14,000 people. Sure enough, avalanches in these burgeoning areas have begun to hit chalets and houses where once they struck only skiers on the most remote slopes. At Galt\u00fcr, in 1999, amid impending local elections, the tourist trade had become a political football, and the valley where the 38 died stood to lose \u00a35m annually if tourists stayed away. Some suggested this had led to a downplaying of safety warnings and building regulations. \"[We are] losing respect for nature,\" the deputy head of the local torrent and avalanche protection department said at the time. \"I'm convinced the danger-zone planning for Galt\u00fcr has to be revised.\" Over-development may prove as self-defeating as it is dangerous: already, reports suggest that, in the wake of this weekend's deaths and the devastating train fire near Salzburg, in which 155 died, up to 90% of forthcoming holidays to the region have been cancelled. The urge to place blame is strong, and quickly made itself felt in the Austrian Alps yesterday. On Sunday, a 33-year-old skier was arrested on suspicion of triggering an avalanche in south Tyrol, after skiing off piste into deep snow despite official warnings. Meanwhile, Innsbr\u00fcck prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the Obergurgl incident, which is thought to have been triggered by a 34-year-old German. It is still too early to say whether another season of fatal avalanches is on the way. But the Ski Club of Great Britain is forecasting fluctuating and heavy snowfalls of the kind that could make for an unstable, potentially dangerous snowbase. The white death may well claim many more lives before the winter is out. Snow sense: how to survive an avalanche Emma Brockes 1 The best defence against an avalanche is to recognise the early signs. Scan weather conditions for the following: is snow building up at a rate of more than 2cm per hour? Has there been a recent temperature rise, heating snow to 0 degrees centigrade? Are air spaces visible between the layers of snow? A build-up of more than 30cm in one snowfall is a bad sign. Loosen your pack so that you can slip easily out of it and prepare to leave the mountain. 2 Ninety per cent of avalanches are triggered by their victims, usually while skiing off-piste. If you decide to leave the main slopes, take a qualified guide who is equipped with the means to summon assistance, a shovel and first-aid pack, and knowledge of which areas to avoid. 3 The average avalanche travels at 50mph, so don't attempt to outski it. Try to keep upright by manoeuvring yourself to the edge of the avalanche, where the force of the flow is less powerful. 4 If you are knocked down, release your ski poles and try to \"swim\" with the slide. In an avalanche, snow takes on the characteristics of water and to stay afloat you should execute some sort of swimming stroke. If you are falling head first, try breast stroke; if feet first, try treading water. 5 After half an hour, a buried victim has a 50% chance of survival, so your priority is to stay on the surface of the avalanche by grabbing a tree or rock, thrusting upward with kicking motions, or \"swimming\" to the side of the flow. 6 When you come to a stop, assume a foetal position, with your hands in front of your face and elbows at your chest. Circulate your head to create an air pocket and hold a deep breath until the snow around you has settled. This way, you increase the chances of being able to breathe once the snow sets. 7 Try to push one hand to the surface to attract attention, but don't waste energy thrashing about unless you can see light. Snow sets as hard as concrete and you will not be able to dig yourself out without assistance. 8 Keep your breathing steady to try to preserve energy and oxygen. Only yell out when rescuers are immediately above you, since the snow insulates sound and they will not hear you.",

      "body": "<p>In Hollywood in the 1920s, director Marshall Neilan gave this warning to a studio workman whose foot was poised over a spider: \"Don't step on it: it may be Lon Chaney.\" Chaney's reputation as the Man of a Thousand Faces, an actor who could metamorphose into a vast array of monsters, was everywhere. </p> <p>For his most famous role in The Phantom of the Opera (1925) - the make-up for which was kept secret during the shooting - Chaney designed a device that, when inserted in the nose, tilts the tip and spreads the nostrils. Prongs attached to protruding false teeth pulled his mouth back at the corners. \"Feast your eyes - glut your soul on my accursed ugliness,\" says the Phantom as he removes his mask. </p> <p>But, as Orson Welles said, \"Chaney was a great deal more than a make-up artist. He was an actor of great power.\" Of all the so-called horror stars, Chaney reigns supreme. His acting range was wider and more naturalistic than Boris Karloff's or Bela Lugosi's. </p> <p>His transformation scenes were most often executed with no make-up changes and without the aid of trick photography. According to the writer Ray Bradbury, \"Chaney acted out our psyches: he somehow got into the shadows inside our bodies. </p> <p>He was able to nail down some of our secret fears and put them on the screen.\" (Bradbury is quoted in Kevin Brownlow's illuminating documentary Lon Chaney - A Thousand Faces, to be premiered as part of the Lon Chaney season at the National Film Theatre.) </p> <p>Principally, he created roles with a masochistic relish implicit in the title. In He Who Gets Slapped (1924), Chaney is a circus clown whose nightly routine is to be slapped and humiliated, and who has fallen hopelessly in love with the bareback rider (Chaney's love was always unrequited). </p> <p>He reversed the expression \"One must suffer to be beautiful\", by suffering in the pursuit of ugliness. In The Penalty (1920), he plays a legless gangster seeking revenge against society because a surgeon botched an operation. He decides to cut off another man's legs and have them grafted onto his own. For the part, Chaney had to walk on leather stumps, binding his ankles to his thighs and cutting off the circulation. </p> <p>\"Every moment before the camera was one of excruciating agony,\" he recalled, \"yet I must not let it show in my face. I had to be the character I was portraying, and disregard the pain. I could only wear the harness 10 minutes at a time, as the pain soon became intolerable, but after a brief rest I'd put it on again and go on with the scene. I've never gotten over the strain that I was put to in this picture. In fact, every grotesque character I've played on the screen has taken its toll of me, physically.\" </p> <p>For The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), Chaney wore a hump modelled from 40lb of rubber. The burden of carrying that extra weight was almost unbearable. \"There were times when I felt that I simply could not go on,\" Chaney admitted. \"Another terrible feature of the part was that Quasimodo has an ugly wart on his eye. I had my right eye covered for so many weeks that I had spasms in it and have been forced to wear glasses.\" </p> <p>In a way, Chaney's films are anti-horror movies, because they urge the spectator not to be repulsed by the deformed characters he portrays. In The Blackbird (1926), he plays two brothers; in a reverse of the Jekyll and Hyde theme, the physically straight man is crooked, and the physically crooked man is good. </p> <p>\"I wanted to remind people that the dwarfed, misshapen beggar of the streets may have the noblest ideals,\" explained Chaney. \"I have come in actual contact with such people, the underdogs, the very dregs of humanity. </p> <p>\"When you see a deformed, wretched creature, you instinctively shrink from him. Your children are afraid of him. Older boys may mock and taunt him. But what do you know of him, really? If I have given one person a feeling of brotherly love, of sympathy and understanding for the downtrodden creatures of the earth, I feel well repaid for all that I went through.\" </p> <p>Born Leonidas F Chaney on April Fool's Day, 1883 in Colorado Springs, Chaney was the son of deaf-mute parents. Lon didn't speak for the first four years of his life, having learned only sign language. He had to leave school aged nine to look after his mother, who had become bedridden, crippled by rheumatism and could no longer use her hands to communicate. Her son developed his pantomimic skills trying to convey the day's events to her. </p> <p>Before entering movies, Chaney started in show business as a dancer and comedian. At 23, while playing in a musical comedy, he met the 16-year-old singer Cleva Creighton. They married three months after Cleva gave birth to a son called Creighton (later to become the horror-movie actor Lon Chaney Jr). </p> <p>According to Chaney Jr, \"I was born dead. My mother gave birth to me after seven months. My father was the midwife. He took me to the edge of a frozen lake, broke the ice and dipped me in it and brought me to life.\" </p> <p>The marriage was a tempestuous one: Cleva was a flirt, Lon a jealous man. In a melodramatic suicide attempt, Cleva drank a vial of poison backstage during one of the shows. She damaged her vocal chords and her singing career was finished. Their relationship ended in divorce in 1914. </p> <p>Chaney's film career began in 1913, but his breakthrough success came in 1919 with The Miracle Man, where he played a beggar pretending to be paralysed so he could be cured by the charlatan of the title. </p> <p>The director, George Tucker, wanted to get a contortionist who was also an actor, but Chaney convinced him that he was double-jointed. After Chaney became a star, he persuaded MGM to hire director Tod Browning; it was the beginning of a hideous friendship. They made eight horror movies together between 1925 and 1929, although the term would not be coined until after Chaney's death. </p> <p>The first Chaney-Browning picture was The Unholy Three (1925); Chaney spends much of the film in drag as a kindly old lady whose baby grandchild is actually a midget. The two are working with a circus strong man as jewel thieves. The Unknown (1927), one of their best films together, was also one of the most bizarre and macabre. </p> <p>Chaney plays Alonzo the Armless, who throws knives with his feet in a circus.

A little late in the day for some punters since, according to Channel 4's A Girl's Best Friend (to be screened tonight as part of its Hidden Love series), 2m vibrators were sold in the UK last year.</p> <p>This equals the total sales of washing machines and tumble dryers and means that, when you take into account the number of housewives who use the fast spin setting for a knee-trembler, 4m quivering electrical appliances were sold to a grateful British public in 1999 - though only half of them will guarantee your safety.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the programme does little to enlighten us on the veiled world of vibrator use. It implies that most purchasers are women, but gives no evidence to back this up (the largest collection I ever saw belonged to a male journalist) and there are no statistics on the amount of vibrators bought by men for women, or by gay men. A quick wander down Brewer Street in Soho does not dispel the idea that it's middle-aged men who still number highest among the vibrator-buying public.</p> <p>This lack of hard information may not be the programme-makers' fault, however, as Kathryn Hoyle, owner of the Sh! Women's Erotic Emporium in Islington, north London, explains. \"The reason there are no statistics for vibrator sales is that the DTI doesn't compile figures for the sex industry,\" she says, which is careless when you consider the sums of money involved. Hoyle sells \"thousands and thousands\" of vibrators every year to her mainly female clientele (men are allowed in only if accompanied by a woman). Hoyle says Sh! shoppers are \"a real cross section, though the largest group are in their 30s and 40s\" which is when she says women start to feel more confident about their desires.</p> <p>Despite her booming sales, however, Hoyle is convinced that the subject of female masturbation is still taboo, citing Jonathan Green's Dictionary of Contemporary Slang which has 12 pages of terms for male manual relief and only one for women. Magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Company are almost always tilted towards partner satisfaction, she points out, so that masturbation is something a man does to a woman or a woman does for a man. \"They are terrified of showing a lonely, sad single person who might look as if they can't get the real thing.\"</p> <p>The truth is, of course, that many of us are sad and single for large periods of our life. When Cosmopolitan ran a feature on single women and sex aids which featured merchandise from Sh!, Hoyle was inundated with requests - something that hadn't happened in response to partner-based pieces. She sold 600 of the vibrators she recommended (\"Jessica\") in 10 days. She thinks the article gave legitimacy to many single women's need to assuage sexual frustration.</p> <p>Dr Petra Boynton, a psychologist who has researched the portrayal of women and sex in the media, is equally convinced that women are traditionally cast in the role of nurturer in the bedroom and that this makes it hard for them to adapt to the monomaniacal pleasure a vibrator offers. Boynton thinks most women still see sexual activity as being something you do to pleasure the man and that \"women don't have the strategies\" to claim pleasure for themselves. If you've been telling your partner he's hot stuff for 10 years, she argues, you're not suddenly going to change your tune and tell him he can't reach the parts a vibrator can.</p> <p>Despite Boynton's and Hoyle's sage words, I remain uncertain that the topic of women and masturbation is still a great taboo. We are, after all, 30 years on from the first Hite report which covered the subject in extravagant detail and are inundated with erotic fantasies from female pens such as Nancy Friday or any of the Black Lace stable.</p> <p>And it's a good 10 years or more since Betty Dodson released her female self-help masturbation video, Self-Loving, to aid orgasmically challenged women everywhere. Furthermore, our antecedents left evidence of licentious behaviour which suggests you can't keep a good woman down. Take the dancing girls of Ancient Greece who have been depicted amusing themselves with improbably large dildos.</p> <p>And those who visit the Museum of Ancient Chinese Sexual Culture in Shanghai, according to the Erotic Print Society's Illustrated Book of Gadgets, will find \"a battery of antique phalluses in stone, jade and ivory from Europe, Asia and Africa as well as China itself\". The authors admit the precise function of these phalluses remains unproven, but argue: \"You can't tell us that any self-respecting Tang Dynasty housewife could keep a giant stone cock on the mantelpiece for more than a week without taking it down, slapping on a bit of pig fat and hopping aboard.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the twin topics of female masturbation and vibrators are not so much taboo as ghettoised: perfectly appropriate for hen parties, Cosmo and Ibiza, but not for dinner parties, the Spectator or BBC dramas. Television takes its lead from the movies.</p> <p>I asked the film critic Anne Billson if she could remember any mainstream films that featured women masturbating or the appearance of a vibrator. The only one she could think of was Parenthood, in which one of Dianne Wiest's on-screen kids locates a torch during a power cut and it transpires to be Wiest's vibrator: cue embarrassment all round.</p> <p>Conversely, on the male masturbation front, we quickly rounded up Ben Stiller's jism in hair shot for There's Something About Mary, Vince Vaughn jerking off as he spies on his victim in the remake of Psycho, and pretty much all of the dysfunctional male characters in American Beauty and Happiness.</p> <p>A Girl's Best Friend presents the vibrator as women's key fight-back weapon in the sex war, the tool that will help them express their sexuality and release them from inhibitions. As evidence, six women talk enthusiastically about their favourite sex toys while sitting coyly on their beds, and the director ensures that no cliche is left unturned as she intercuts interviews with shots of a faceless woman in fluffy mules traipsing round a house in which every draining board, mouse-mat or teatray boasts a large, fluorescent vibrator.</p> <p>The implication is that this is a female utopia in which women can finally claim their tally of multiple orgasms - but I couldn't help wondering what we'd make of a similar film about men who owned blow-up dolls or vibrating pussies. Not very much, I think.</p> <p>The truth is that masturbation is a secret pleasure for both men and women, not something you share with your mates down the pub. And as for sex aids, they can act as vital substitutes for sex and can augment the sexual experience when used by couples, but as any fule kno: they're no replacement for the real thing.</p> <p>\u0095 A Girl's Best Friend is screened on Channel 4 tonight at 10.30. Rowan Pelling is editor of the Erotic Review.</p>",

Despite her booming sales, however, Hoyle is convinced that the subject of female masturbation is still taboo, citing Jonathan Green's Dictionary of Contemporary Slang which has 12 pages of terms for male manual relief and only one for women. Magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Company are almost always tilted towards partner satisfaction, she points out, so that masturbation is something a man does to a woman or a woman does for a man. \"They are terrified of showing a lonely, sad single person who might look as if they can't get the real thing.\" The truth is, of course, that many of us are sad and single for large periods of our life. When Cosmopolitan ran a feature on single women and sex aids which featured merchandise from Sh!, Hoyle was inundated with requests - something that hadn't happened in response to partner-based pieces. She sold 600 of the vibrators she recommended (\"Jessica\") in 10 days. She thinks the article gave legitimacy to many single women's need to assuage sexual frustration. Dr Petra Boynton, a psychologist who has researched the portrayal of women and sex in the media, is equally convinced that women are traditionally cast in the role of nurturer in the bedroom and that this makes it hard for them to adapt to the monomaniacal pleasure a vibrator offers. Boynton thinks most women still see sexual activity as being something you do to pleasure the man and that \"women don't have the strategies\" to claim pleasure for themselves. If you've been telling your partner he's hot stuff for 10 years, she argues, you're not suddenly going to change your tune and tell him he can't reach the parts a vibrator can. Despite Boynton's and Hoyle's sage words, I remain uncertain that the topic of women and masturbation is still a great taboo. We are, after all, 30 years on from the first Hite report which covered the subject in extravagant detail and are inundated with erotic fantasies from female pens such as Nancy Friday or any of the Black Lace stable. And it's a good 10 years or more since Betty Dodson released her female self-help masturbation video, Self-Loving, to aid orgasmically challenged women everywhere. Furthermore, our antecedents left evidence of licentious behaviour which suggests you can't keep a good woman down. Take the dancing girls of Ancient Greece who have been depicted amusing themselves with improbably large dildos. And those who visit the Museum of Ancient Chinese Sexual Culture in Shanghai, according to the Erotic Print Society's Illustrated Book of Gadgets, will find \"a battery of antique phalluses in stone, jade and ivory from Europe, Asia and Africa as well as China itself\". The authors admit the precise function of these phalluses remains unproven, but argue: \"You can't tell us that any self-respecting Tang Dynasty housewife could keep a giant stone cock on the mantelpiece for more than a week without taking it down, slapping on a bit of pig fat and hopping aboard.\" Perhaps the twin topics of female masturbation and vibrators are not so much taboo as ghettoised: perfectly appropriate for hen parties, Cosmo and Ibiza, but not for dinner parties, the Spectator or BBC dramas. Television takes its lead from the movies. I asked the film critic Anne Billson if she could remember any mainstream films that featured women masturbating or the appearance of a vibrator. The only one she could think of was Parenthood, in which one of Dianne Wiest's on-screen kids locates a torch during a power cut and it transpires to be Wiest's vibrator: cue embarrassment all round. Conversely, on the male masturbation front, we quickly rounded up Ben Stiller's jism in hair shot for There's Something About Mary, Vince Vaughn jerking off as he spies on his victim in the remake of Psycho, and pretty much all of the dysfunctional male characters in American Beauty and Happiness. A Girl's Best Friend presents the vibrator as women's key fight-back weapon in the sex war, the tool that will help them express their sexuality and release them from inhibitions. As evidence, six women talk enthusiastically about their favourite sex toys while sitting coyly on their beds, and the director ensures that no cliche is left unturned as she intercuts interviews with shots of a faceless woman in fluffy mules traipsing round a house in which every draining board, mouse-mat or teatray boasts a large, fluorescent vibrator. The implication is that this is a female utopia in which women can finally claim their tally of multiple orgasms - but I couldn't help wondering what we'd make of a similar film about men who owned blow-up dolls or vibrating pussies. Not very much, I think. The truth is that masturbation is a secret pleasure for both men and women, not something you share with your mates down the pub. And as for sex aids, they can act as vital substitutes for sex and can augment the sexual experience when used by couples, but as any fule kno: they're no replacement for the real thing. \u0095 A Girl's Best Friend is screened on Channel 4 tonight at 10.30.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Wearing a black leather jacket and lemon tie with a print of tiny leopards, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru looked like an extra from the television show Miami Vice as he swept out of his presidential palace into a cavalcade of police Jeeps.</p> <p>The convoy drove straight out of Lima, through the old centre and past working-class districts of tyre repairers and welding workshops. By the time they reached the winter holiday resort of Chaclacayo, where wealthy Peruvians have ranch-style residences overflowing with bougainvillaea, dozen of journalists and TV crews were in hot pursuit.</p> <p>Fujimori hopped out of his jeep and with officers and sniffer dogs swooped on a walled private housing estate. Two hours later he emerged. Perched on a police car and shouting through a hand-held loud-hailer, he told the press that his lightning raid had failed to capture the country's most wanted man.</p> <p>Vladimiro Montesinos was still at large. He might have been talking about his worst enemy, rather than the old friend and right-hand man who, as head of Peru's feared secret service, the Sin, had helped to keep him in power: the pair had ben so close they were known as the Siamese twins.</p> <p>Four weeks on, Fujimori's very public manhunt can be seen as the last gasp of a dying regime. The search now reads as the final eccentric chapter in the career of Latin America's longest-serving leader after Fidel Castro. Early yesterday, Fujimori announced from a hotel in Japan that he would resign the presidency within 48 hours.</p> <p>It was an ignominious end to a controversial political era. Since his election victory over the writer Mario Vargas Llosa in 1990, Fujimori had won plaudits for taming hyperinflation and eliminating the threat of leftwing guerrillas. He had reduced inflation to single digits, made peace with Ecuador after several wars, and significantly reducing both coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking.</p> <p>But his demagogic style was often undemocratic and hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent people were jailed. And Montesinos was in the background, exercising control over large parts of the country's media, courts and military. It seems unlikely that Fujimori would have been re-elected earlier this year without his friend's help. But it was precisely this string-pulling that plunged Fujimori's rule into freefall.</p> <p>The collapse began in September, when clandestine footage that appeared to show the spymaster offering \u00a310,000 in cash to an opposition politician reached the television networks. The video was the strongest evidence so far that Fujimori's election victory may have been bought.</p> <p>Attempting to win back control of the ensuing crisis, Fujimori announced new elections in which he would not stand and said he would close the SIN - signalling, for the first time, a split with his top adviser.</p> <p>The focus immediately turned to the secret service chief, considered by many to be the real power in Peru. How would he react? The military was run by friends, hand-picked by him. Would heinitiate a coup?</p> <p>The violence never came. In the political vacuum that followed, thousands of Peruvians took to the streets to celebrate what they believed would be the end of Fujimori's regime. A few days later, Montesinos fled to Panama. With Montesinos in exile, Fujimori could at least maintain the appearance that he was in control. He began to dismantle the secret service. But on Sunday October 22 there was bad news: Montesinos was flying back, his bid for asylum refused.</p> <p>In desperation, Fujimori called Guayaquil airport in Ecuador, where Montesinos's plane had stopped to refuel, and urged him to stay away. But within hours he landed at Pisco, a small military airport three hours south of Lima. The political temperature immediately shot from hot to boiling point. One of Fujimori's vice-presidents resigned in disgust. With no option but to show force, Fujimori, according to media reports, sent out an order to capture Montesinos \"dead or alive\".</p> <p>Montesinos was then charged with a string of offences ranging from paramilitary killing and torture to money laundering and extortion.

      "bodyText": "Wearing a black leather jacket and lemon tie with a print of tiny leopards, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru looked like an extra from the television show Miami Vice as he swept out of his presidential palace into a cavalcade of police Jeeps. The convoy drove straight out of Lima, through the old centre and past working-class districts of tyre repairers and welding workshops. By the time they reached the winter holiday resort of Chaclacayo, where wealthy Peruvians have ranch-style residences overflowing with bougainvillaea, dozen of journalists and TV crews were in hot pursuit. Fujimori hopped out of his jeep and with officers and sniffer dogs swooped on a walled private housing estate. Two hours later he emerged. Perched on a police car and shouting through a hand-held loud-hailer, he told the press that his lightning raid had failed to capture the country's most wanted man. Vladimiro Montesinos was still at large. He might have been talking about his worst enemy, rather than the old friend and right-hand man who, as head of Peru's feared secret service, the Sin, had helped to keep him in power: the pair had ben so close they were known as the Siamese twins. Four weeks on, Fujimori's very public manhunt can be seen as the last gasp of a dying regime. The search now reads as the final eccentric chapter in the career of Latin America's longest-serving leader after Fidel Castro. Early yesterday, Fujimori announced from a hotel in Japan that he would resign the presidency within 48 hours. It was an ignominious end to a controversial political era. Since his election victory over the writer Mario Vargas Llosa in 1990, Fujimori had won plaudits for taming hyperinflation and eliminating the threat of leftwing guerrillas. He had reduced inflation to single digits, made peace with Ecuador after several wars, and significantly reducing both coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking. But his demagogic style was often undemocratic and hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent people were jailed. And Montesinos was in the background, exercising control over large parts of the country's media, courts and military. It seems unlikely that Fujimori would have been re-elected earlier this year without his friend's help. But it was precisely this string-pulling that plunged Fujimori's rule into freefall. The collapse began in September, when clandestine footage that appeared to show the spymaster offering \u00a310,000 in cash to an opposition politician reached the television networks. The video was the strongest evidence so far that Fujimori's election victory may have been bought. Attempting to win back control of the ensuing crisis, Fujimori announced new elections in which he would not stand and said he would close the SIN - signalling, for the first time, a split with his top adviser. The focus immediately turned to the secret service chief, considered by many to be the real power in Peru. How would he react? The military was run by friends, hand-picked by him. Would heinitiate a coup? The violence never came. In the political vacuum that followed, thousands of Peruvians took to the streets to celebrate what they believed would be the end of Fujimori's regime. A few days later, Montesinos fled to Panama. With Montesinos in exile, Fujimori could at least maintain the appearance that he was in control. He began to dismantle the secret service. But on Sunday October 22 there was bad news: Montesinos was flying back, his bid for asylum refused. In desperation, Fujimori called Guayaquil airport in Ecuador, where Montesinos's plane had stopped to refuel, and urged him to stay away. But within hours he landed at Pisco, a small military airport three hours south of Lima. The political temperature immediately shot from hot to boiling point. One of Fujimori's vice-presidents resigned in disgust. With no option but to show force, Fujimori, according to media reports, sent out an order to capture Montesinos \"dead or alive\". Montesinos was then charged with a string of offences ranging from paramilitary killing and torture to money laundering and extortion. Plastic surgeons were threatened with prison if they helped the fugitive disguise himself. The cat-and-mouse search was played out as a combination of spy thriller and high farce. It transfixed Peruvians who, shocked by the revelations of the extent of Montesinos's power, realised that they were witnessing the endgame of Fujimori's regime. A fortnight ago, Fujimori orchestrated another high-publicity stunt, holding a press conference to parade the haul of a police raid on the home of Montesinos's estranged wife, Trinidad Becerra, in an apartment on one of Lima's busiest avenues, Javier Prado. The president joked that getting into Becerra's apartment was more difficult than getting into the Japanese embassy - the scene of a four-month rebel siege that ended in 1997. On a green velvet cloth were laid out six gold watches encrusted with diamonds and three heavy gold chains. The raid also yielded 120 Italian and French-made suits, more than 1,200 Christian Dior shirts (hundreds each in white, cream and pale blue), coloured silk shirts, dozens of French ties, gold cuff-links and tie pins and 16 pairs of Italian crocodile shoes. Montesinos's dandyish wardrobe was a surprising insight into a man who has cultivated almost complete media invisibility. The tall 56-year-old lawyer, who brushes the little hair he has left over his pate, has rarely been photographed. Journalists have for the first time been allowed into the SIN headquarters where he used to live, protected by 800 elite police agents. Above the front door of the building, with its neat patio and smart gardens, is a shield with the inscription \"In pursuit of knowledge\". The prime minister, Federico Salas, last week said that a corridor leading to underground cells had been discovered behind a bricked-up wall inside. He said it was not clear whether these had been used to torture detainees. \"They are barred, but not spinechilling; they are not dark and they even have air-conditioning.\" A former intelligence agent, Leonor La Rosa, has alleged that she was held in the basement of another intelligence service building and tortured by fellow agents for passing on information to the press. La Rosa was left disabled and is suing the government. Many people believe that the chase was nothing but a deceptive game of good cop-bad cop. Asked about the level of complicity between Montesinos and Fujimori, Jaime Salinas Sedo, a retired general, says: \"It's very difficult for a 10-year-long marriage to be broken.

But should he return to Peru, he could find the investigations into Montesinos's affairs that have come to light over the past frantic weeks returning to haunt him too. The Swiss justice ministry, suspecting money-laundering activities, has frozen \u00a330m in Zurich bank accounts tied to Montesinos. Reports have also surfaced alleging that Montesinos was a middleman for an arms deal between Jordan and a leftwing rebel group in Colombia. In another development, Roberto Escobar, brother of the late Colombian drug cartel boss, Pablo Escobar, has alleged that Montesinos gave him $1m (\u00a3700,000) to fund his 1990 election campaign. Montesinos has not been contactable to answer these accusations.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>TV fans suffered a double blow last week. Not only did Inspector Morse ascend to that great pub in the sky, but Ross Geller, neurotic star of Friends, revealed himself to be a liar. Having maintained for years that he lost his virginity to Caroline, his first wife, it now transpires that the lucky lady was someone else - a cleaner at Ross's university. </p> <p>What are we to make of this inconsistency? That the first time was so dreadful, Ross simply blotted it from his memory? That Ross was raised by nuns and hence had only the shakiest grasp on what constituted a sexual act? Or did the scriptwriters just screw up? </p> <p>We know the answer, of course. The illusory world created by TV shows is a fine membrane, stretched tight and constantly threatened by reality. Actors get sick and stroppy. Audiences become bored. Writers think of better ideas. </p> <p>The longer a show runs, the greater the likelihood of something occurring that is inconsistent with its past. And the more popular a show, the greater the likelihood of people watching vintage episodes at the same time as fresh ones are being screened. </p> <p>Friends is not the only sinner. Devotees of Cheers will know that psychiatrist-barfly Frasier Crane was an orphan. His deceased father was a scientist and his mother died during the series. But the lucrative prospect of a spin-off made the writers abandon this biography. Frasier's dad is now resurrected, a curmudgeonly ex-cop, whose values clash continually with his son's. </p> <p>And nobody seems to mind. The tension between Frasier and his dad is right at the heart of the show, providing a rich vein of comedy. Petty quibbles about lines spoken in old shows are successfully drowned out by the laughter. </p> <p>Viewers don't fret over details, provided that their emotions are being stretched to extremes. Frasier does it with laughter. The recent film What Lies Beneath did the same by frightening us. If Inspector Morse had ever been led to the solution of a mystery by the appearance of a ghost, then viewers would have switched off in their millions. </p> <p>Writers cannot switch genres in this way - audiences will accept things in a ghost story that they will not in a thriller, and vice versa. But this, essentially, is the stunt that What Lies Beneath pulls - and it succeeds, by scaring its viewers witless for two hours. </p> <p>Soap operas cannot hide behind fear and laughter. Consistency is all-important and the top British contenders employ archivists and script editors to ensure that no inaccuracies creep in. On EastEnders, the minutiae of every character's life are set in stone, from their birthday to their phone number. </p> <p>That does not mean inconsistencies never occur. Sometimes details are changed deliberately, to fit in with a more important story. Take Coronation Street - Mike Baldwin's son Mark was born on April 13 1983. But on his re-entry to the Street, Mark was a full two years older than that. There were good reasons for the shift. It would have been stretching credibility far more to have the hard-headed Mike entrusting key business roles to a 17 year old. </p> <p>There was no outcry about this, because the detail was buried in a colourful story about sons betraying their fathers. Soaps may not be able to perform the tricks that sitcoms and horror movies can, but they can use complex, well-drawn characters to distract us from the artificialities of the genre. That's why we accept that genteel Emily Bishop would happily sup sherry alongside Les Battersby. Or that everyone in Walford can afford the rent. </p> <p>There are limits, of course. Recall the fury with which the world greeted Dallas's attempt to re- introduce Bobby Ewing. He'd been shot in series six, but due to flagging ratings, Bobby was brought back in series eight.

      "bodyText": "TV fans suffered a double blow last week. Not only did Inspector Morse ascend to that great pub in the sky, but Ross Geller, neurotic star of Friends, revealed himself to be a liar. Having maintained for years that he lost his virginity to Caroline, his first wife, it now transpires that the lucky lady was someone else - a cleaner at Ross's university. What are we to make of this inconsistency? That the first time was so dreadful, Ross simply blotted it from his memory? That Ross was raised by nuns and hence had only the shakiest grasp on what constituted a sexual act? Or did the scriptwriters just screw up? We know the answer, of course. The illusory world created by TV shows is a fine membrane, stretched tight and constantly threatened by reality. Actors get sick and stroppy. Audiences become bored. Writers think of better ideas. The longer a show runs, the greater the likelihood of something occurring that is inconsistent with its past. And the more popular a show, the greater the likelihood of people watching vintage episodes at the same time as fresh ones are being screened. Friends is not the only sinner. Devotees of Cheers will know that psychiatrist-barfly Frasier Crane was an orphan. His deceased father was a scientist and his mother died during the series. But the lucrative prospect of a spin-off made the writers abandon this biography. Frasier's dad is now resurrected, a curmudgeonly ex-cop, whose values clash continually with his son's. And nobody seems to mind. The tension between Frasier and his dad is right at the heart of the show, providing a rich vein of comedy. Petty quibbles about lines spoken in old shows are successfully drowned out by the laughter. Viewers don't fret over details, provided that their emotions are being stretched to extremes. Frasier does it with laughter. The recent film What Lies Beneath did the same by frightening us. If Inspector Morse had ever been led to the solution of a mystery by the appearance of a ghost, then viewers would have switched off in their millions. Writers cannot switch genres in this way - audiences will accept things in a ghost story that they will not in a thriller, and vice versa. But this, essentially, is the stunt that What Lies Beneath pulls - and it succeeds, by scaring its viewers witless for two hours. Soap operas cannot hide behind fear and laughter. Consistency is all-important and the top British contenders employ archivists and script editors to ensure that no inaccuracies creep in. On EastEnders, the minutiae of every character's life are set in stone, from their birthday to their phone number. That does not mean inconsistencies never occur. Sometimes details are changed deliberately, to fit in with a more important story. Take Coronation Street - Mike Baldwin's son Mark was born on April 13 1983. But on his re-entry to the Street, Mark was a full two years older than that. There were good reasons for the shift. It would have been stretching credibility far more to have the hard-headed Mike entrusting key business roles to a 17 year old. There was no outcry about this, because the detail was buried in a colourful story about sons betraying their fathers. Soaps may not be able to perform the tricks that sitcoms and horror movies can, but they can use complex, well-drawn characters to distract us from the artificialities of the genre. That's why we accept that genteel Emily Bishop would happily sup sherry alongside Les Battersby. Or that everyone in Walford can afford the rent. There are limits, of course. Recall the fury with which the world greeted Dallas's attempt to re- introduce Bobby Ewing. He'd been shot in series six, but due to flagging ratings, Bobby was brought back in series eight. The whole of the intervening series was explained as his wife Pam's dream. This led to some real oddities. Some people who'd been introduced during Pam's \"dream\" vanished. But so did Dusty - who'd been there before Bobby was shot. And Ray and Donna's house was destroyed by floods during the dream, but remained absent after Pam woke up. But it would be wrong to blame Pam's dream for Dallas's eventual demise. The show was in ratings hell before Bobby's resurrection. The audience were already looking for an excuse to turn off. Pundits said that the shooting of Bobby was the cause, but a show's popularity never hinges on one character. Just look at how EastEnders has continued to capture huge audiences since the departure of Grant Mitchell. In a healthy show, it is never necessary to contemplate bringing back departed characters, because fresh blood has taken their place, and captured the audience's imagination. It was the pre-existing malaise - a disaffection with the characters - more than the nuttiness of the rescue attempt, which sealed the fate of Dallas. So the writers of Friends should be nervous. The \"outcry\" of fans was doubtless exaggerated in the media; and the show's ratings will probably not suffer visibly - for now. What's worrying is not what the fans noticed.

The agreement caused a serious row yesterday in the ranks of the Pakistan Muslim League, the party of Nawaz Sharif, the ousted prime minister who is serving a life sentence for hijacking. Senior members opposed to an alliance with their erstwhile opponents stormed into the party headquarters in the capital, Islamabad, ripped portraits of Mr Sharif from the wall, and burned them, cheered on by hundreds of supporters outside. But Kulsoom Sharif, Mr Sharif's wife, is in favour of the alliance and has most of the Muslim League firmly on her side. \"I will make it a national movement so that the entire political fraternity joins hands against the military rulers for the restoration of democracy,\" she said.

General Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who led the coup, has been struggling to revive the economy and is facing a growing chorus of criticism in the press. Since the coup in October last year, 14 senior civilian appointees have resigned from his government The latest, last week, was his outspoken corruption prosecutor, Farouk Adam Khan.

Others who have resigned include the information minister, Javed Jabbar, who was asked to quit by Gen Musharraf last month for failing to project a sufficiently positive image of the regime. The general said at the time that nobody was indispensable and he would accept resignations from anyone. \"Selection is on merit and continuation is on performance,\" he said. Gen Musharraf has been hoping to improve his government's image abroad by holding local elections, starting next month.

The victims of his alleged sadistic behaviour were held in a transit concentration camp set up in northern Italy by the German military authorities for prisoners en route to the death camps at Mauthausen and Dachau. Mr Seifert is accused of killing two Jewish prisoners, Giulia Leoni and her daughter Augusta: \"torturing them for about two hours, pouring ice-cold water on them and finally strangling them\". It is also alleged that he killed a young Jewish woman by striking her with the necks of broken bottles and that, together with an SS officer, Otto Sein, he tortured a 17-year-old woman to death over a period of five days. Other victims were raped, beaten to death or left to die of starvation, according to the military prosecutor.

Students in the Office to Consolidate Unity, which claims 500,000 members, accuse the president of passing up every opportunity to force the conservatives who have reasserted their control over the state to come to heel. As a result, a growing number of campus activists want to desert Mr Khatami and form an alternative organisation to promote \"civil disobedience\". That would include strikes at universities and in bazaars aimed at forcing a confrontation with the security forces, something President Khatami has tried to prevent. \"We have watched the conservatives attack civil institutions. They closed all the reformists newspapers. They shot Saeed Hajjarian [a top presidential aide who was paralysed in an attempt on his life last year],\" said a student leader in the group, who did not wish to be named. \"Now we think that anyone who [subscribes] to passivity is helping the conservatives. The government should have helped political parties develop and social organisations grow,\" he said. \"Instead, the reform movement became too passive and moved backward.\" The group, which is known in Farsi as Daftar-e Tahkim-e Vahdat, comprises Islamic student organisations on about 60 campuses. It has been a formidable force in Iranian politics since the early days of the Islamic Revolution - its forerunners helped to bring Ayatollah Khomeini to power. In 1996 Mohammad Khatami, an intellectual cleric then on the fringes of politics, appeared at the Daftar's headquarters in Tehran, produced a miniature constitution, and vowed to enforce the rule of law. With that promise, the group rallied behind his presidential bid and he won by a landslide in 1997. Since then students have sacrificed their lives in demonstrations supporting Mr Khatami's ideas of a \"civil society\", only to find that the president condemning their protests in order to avoid a showdown with conservatives. When students demonstrated in July last year after conservatives closed a leading progressive newspaper, they were beaten by the police, the Islamic militia, and the elite Revolutionary Guards. Scores were injured and an unknown number died in five days of unrest in Tehran. At the same time an even bloodier protest erupted in the town of Tabriz. The parliament prepared a detailed report exposing the culprits of the violence in Tabriz, but sources say it remains top secret because the government fears its contents will provoke a national crisis. The growing split in the ranks of the Daftar became public after Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, intervened in August to order parliament to quash a bill aimed at reviving the reformist press, said Ibrahim Sheikh, another student leader. \"Some students have reached the conclusion that elections don't matter and they want more radical solutions,\" said Mr Sheikh, who represents the half of the student movement that still supports President Khatami. But he said that only a gradual approach to reform could bring about lasting change. \"Some say no generation can tolerate two revolutions,\" he said. \"So the only recourse the reformers have is a peaceful atmosphere.\"",

These scientists and their instruments are a big con trick.\"</p> <p>Don Antonio's village, Santiago Xalitzintla, nestles about seven miles from the crater on the volcano's north-eastern flank. It would almost certainly be wiped out by the avalanche of sludge and acidic gases surging down the canyons at more than 60mph which is likely to accompany a major eruption, even before the lava reached it.</p> <p>Geologists believe that this last happened 1,200 years ago, and none of the experts are predicting a repeat. They think Popo's huffing and puffing may intensify to the point of producing incandescent material, but they do not expect the sacred mountain of the Aztecs to blow.</p> <p>But they could be wrong. The prediction that Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines would erupt in 1991 is the only significant example of accurate scientific forecasting.</p> <p>\"At Popo they just don't know what's going to happen, and it is not for want of trying; but it's the same problem we face with any volcano,\" says Jim Luhr a volcanologist from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.</p> <p>\"What we get up to is barely a science.\"</p> <p>So why bother trying? asks Don Rufino, standing in front of the 5,465-metre (17,930ft) symmetrical cone.\"If the volcano decides it's time, we won't have time to do anything about it.\"</p> <p>He is more worried about soldiers enforcing the ban on going within six miles of the crater, which prevents villagers reaching their fields to harvest their maize.</p> <p>The National Disaster Prevention Centre says that about 30,000 people living in the nearest villages are at serious risk from a major eruption. There are about 300,000 people in the second-tier danger zone, and 800,000 in the entire risk area, while the tens of millions in Mexico City to the north-west and Puebla to the east could be affected by ash clouds.</p> <p>This is why Popocatepetl is the most closely monitored of Mexico's 14 active volcanoes, with a special unit in the capital to keep a 24-hour watch on it.</p> <p>Instruments on the mountain relay the seismic activity caused by smoke exhalations and deep molten-rock movements, tiny increases in volume which could indicate the build-up of pressure, and changes in the the gases emitted.</p> <p>\"We are pretty certain to see a big one coming hours to days before it actually happens,\" says Enrique Guevara, the unit's coordinator, pointing to the automatic alarm systems which would give the signal to evacuate the area.</p> <p>But people on the volcano are often reluctant to abandon their houses and animals.</p> <p>\"They can keep their shelters and their second-hand clothes. I'm not going,\" says Dona Ines.</p> <p>She has bad memories of the last and only evacuation in December 1994, when the volcano awoke after being dormant for almost 70 years.</p> <p>\"The volcano is only breathing. It has always smoked,\" she says.</p> <p>Popocatepetl smoked for the Aztecs, in whose mythology it was a torch-bearing warrior mourning his dead love - a nearby volcano called Iztaccihuatl, which resembles a reclining woman.</p> <p>It smoked when the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes passed by on his way to the Aztec capital, and it went through several heavy puffing bouts in subsequent centuries, with the last one in 1921.</p> <p>The 1994 reawakening, the scientists say, was triggered by a new injection of molten rock into the magma chamber, and the current intensification of activity is due to the formation of a lava dome inside the crater which is obstructing the regular release of energy.</p> <p>But although Popocatepetl even means \"smoking mountain\" in the indigenous Nahuatl language, its main sacred function is its relationship to water, and it particular the pre-Colombian rain god Tlaloc.</p> <p>\"The conquest suppressed the large-scale rituals but the small community rites to bring rain or keep away bad weather continue until today,\" says Julio Glokner, an anthropologist, who has been traipsing up and down the volcano after Don Antonio and other shamans since 1989.</p> <p>Every community on Popocatepetl has its traditions and every rainmaker his or her own style.</p> <p>In Don Antonio's dreams Don Goyo asks for specific offerings that are carried up to mountain shrines. In recent years these have included a business suit, an accordion and a warrior costume.</p> <p>Don Antonio says he would be willing to talk to the scientists in Mexico City, but \"only if they are willing to listen to what I have to say too\".</p> <p>But it is not just the experts who are loathe to rely on the shaman's confidence that the volcano would not erupt without telling him first.</p> <p>\"I've been a sceptic ever since I was a little boy. I used to throw things at their rituals,\" says Raul Sanchez, whose family has lived for decades in Amecameca on the side of the volcano.</p> <p>He has worked out his own system for understanding the clouds around the summit, and has collected ash samples to investigate the probability of a major eruption.</p> <p>He believes that Popocatepetl may erupt, but not on his side of the mountain.</p> <p>\"I do this to see whether we really have to start running or not, and the truth is we don't.\"</p>",

The prediction that Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines would erupt in 1991 is the only significant example of accurate scientific forecasting. \"At Popo they just don't know what's going to happen, and it is not for want of trying; but it's the same problem we face with any volcano,\" says Jim Luhr a volcanologist from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. \"What we get up to is barely a science.\" So why bother trying? asks Don Rufino, standing in front of the 5,465-metre (17,930ft) symmetrical cone.\"If the volcano decides it's time, we won't have time to do anything about it.\" He is more worried about soldiers enforcing the ban on going within six miles of the crater, which prevents villagers reaching their fields to harvest their maize. The National Disaster Prevention Centre says that about 30,000 people living in the nearest villages are at serious risk from a major eruption. There are about 300,000 people in the second-tier danger zone, and 800,000 in the entire risk area, while the tens of millions in Mexico City to the north-west and Puebla to the east could be affected by ash clouds. This is why Popocatepetl is the most closely monitored of Mexico's 14 active volcanoes, with a special unit in the capital to keep a 24-hour watch on it. Instruments on the mountain relay the seismic activity caused by smoke exhalations and deep molten-rock movements, tiny increases in volume which could indicate the build-up of pressure, and changes in the the gases emitted. \"We are pretty certain to see a big one coming hours to days before it actually happens,\" says Enrique Guevara, the unit's coordinator, pointing to the automatic alarm systems which would give the signal to evacuate the area. But people on the volcano are often reluctant to abandon their houses and animals. \"They can keep their shelters and their second-hand clothes. I'm not going,\" says Dona Ines. She has bad memories of the last and only evacuation in December 1994, when the volcano awoke after being dormant for almost 70 years. \"The volcano is only breathing. It has always smoked,\" she says. Popocatepetl smoked for the Aztecs, in whose mythology it was a torch-bearing warrior mourning his dead love - a nearby volcano called Iztaccihuatl, which resembles a reclining woman. It smoked when the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes passed by on his way to the Aztec capital, and it went through several heavy puffing bouts in subsequent centuries, with the last one in 1921. The 1994 reawakening, the scientists say, was triggered by a new injection of molten rock into the magma chamber, and the current intensification of activity is due to the formation of a lava dome inside the crater which is obstructing the regular release of energy. But although Popocatepetl even means \"smoking mountain\" in the indigenous Nahuatl language, its main sacred function is its relationship to water, and it particular the pre-Colombian rain god Tlaloc. \"The conquest suppressed the large-scale rituals but the small community rites to bring rain or keep away bad weather continue until today,\" says Julio Glokner, an anthropologist, who has been traipsing up and down the volcano after Don Antonio and other shamans since 1989. Every community on Popocatepetl has its traditions and every rainmaker his or her own style. In Don Antonio's dreams Don Goyo asks for specific offerings that are carried up to mountain shrines. In recent years these have included a business suit, an accordion and a warrior costume. Don Antonio says he would be willing to talk to the scientists in Mexico City, but \"only if they are willing to listen to what I have to say too\". But it is not just the experts who are loathe to rely on the shaman's confidence that the volcano would not erupt without telling him first. \"I've been a sceptic ever since I was a little boy. I used to throw things at their rituals,\" says Raul Sanchez, whose family has lived for decades in Amecameca on the side of the volcano. He has worked out his own system for understanding the clouds around the summit, and has collected ash samples to investigate the probability of a major eruption. He believes that Popocatepetl may erupt, but not on his side of the mountain. \"I do this to see whether we really have to start running or not, and the truth is we don't.\"",

      "body": "<p>Charles Ruff, who, as White House counsel, presented President Bill Clinton's defence at last year's impeachment hearing, has died in an accident at his Washington home at the age of 61. His fearsome legal reputation and his unrivalled contacts across the political spectrum made him the favourite choice for almost any prominent American politician running into serious trouble.</p> <p>Ruff's past clients included Senator John Glenn, accused of political corruption, Senator Charles Robb, caught dallying with a young beauty queen, and Professor Anita Hall, who stunned the Senate judiciary committee by charging a Supreme Court nominee with sexual harassment. Ruff also fought a long and eventually successful court action for the American Tobacco Institute against claims that it had deliberately misled cigarette smokers about the risk to their health.</p> <p>Ruff's remarkable professional rise had been achieved in the face of what could have been a personal disaster. After graduating from Columbia law school in 1963, he received a grant from the Ford Foundation to run a law course in Liberia. Shortly after arriving in the country, he contracted a viral paralysis similar to poliomyelitis, which confined him to a wheelchair.</p> <p>Ruff did not, however, allow this disability to affect his career. From 1967 he gained valuable experience and contacts in the criminal division of the Justice Department. After five years there, however, he returned to teaching. He had barely settled at Georgetown University before Archibald Cox, the newly appointed Watergate special prosecutor, approached him to become a senior member of the team investigating President Richard Nixon and his White House staff. A colleague there was Hillary Rodham, who later married Bill Clinton.</p> <p>Ruff's personal role in the investigations focused on the vast range of illegal financial contributions made to Nixon's 1972 campaign. The evidence he amassed was so incontrovertible that most of those responsible, including the oil tycoon Armand Hammer, pleaded guilty.</p> <p>In 1975, with most of the key defendants convicted, Ruff took over as special prosecutor and found himself in the middle of a political storm, investigating charges that President Gerald Ford had diverted political donations to his personal use. In the highly charged final days of the 1976 presidential campaign, Ruff (well known as a Democrat) stuck firmly to his legal last, dismissed the charges and wrote finis to the special prosecution report.</p> <p>He returned to the Justice Department for a time, but was then hired by one of the most prominent Washington law firms, then acting for the tobacco institute. Its most threatening case came from the family of Rose Cipollone, who had died of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking.</p> <p>Ruff tackled it head on. In one legal conference he told the opposing lawyer: \"You've tried the front door, the back door, the side door, and now you're trying the trap door. It isn't going to work.\" And, after years of litigation, Ruff ensured that it did not, a success he later tended to omit from his biography.</p> <p>Such courtroom successes put him near the top of the Washington ladder. His argument to the Senate ethics committee got John Glenn off the hook in 1989 after he was accused of influence-peddling in return for campaign contributions. Even more remarkably, Ruff persuaded the Federal Election Commission to grant Glenn an unprecedented waiver from its stringent fundraising rules.</p> <p>Ruff's initial involvement with the Clinton White House came from defending one of Hillary Clinton's principal assistants, Ira Magaziner, who helped to prepare her ill-fated healthcare plan. Magaziner was accused of perjury, but in a complex presentation to the US attorney's office in Washington, Ruff managed to shift the blame to some unspecified White House officials and Magaziner was never charged.</p> <p>It was against this background that Ruff became President Clinton's fifth White House counsel within four years. As the ripples of the Whitewater affair widened and allegations about the president's sexual behaviour proliferated, insiders joked that Clinton needed a lawyer smart enough to do the job and dumb enough to take it. Ruff defended his recruitment with the comment: \"When the president of the United States asks you to do something, you don't say, 'Let me think about it.' You say, 'How can I help you, Mr President?' \"</p> <p>The eruption of Monica Lewinsky on to the scene and the soaring political temperature in Congress eventually left even a practised operator like Ruff with little room for manoeuvre. Impeachment by the Republican-controlled House became a virtual certainty, and the principal article, charging Clinton with lying to the grand jury about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky, sailed through.</p> <p>Ruff put up the best moral arguments he could find in his statement at the Senate hearing. He accused the prosecution of having \"a vision too little attuned to the people ... more focused on retribution, more designed to achieve partisan ends\". After 14 days of hearings he did, indeed, win his case - by a margin of nine votes on the perjury charge and by a single vote on the obstruction of justice count. But Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania could only bring himself to vote \"not proven\".</p> <p>Ruff is survived by his wife, Sue, and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Charles Frederick Carson Ruff, lawyer, born August 1 1939; died November 19 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Charles Ruff, who, as White House counsel, presented President Bill Clinton's defence at last year's impeachment hearing, has died in an accident at his Washington home at the age of 61. His fearsome legal reputation and his unrivalled contacts across the political spectrum made him the favourite choice for almost any prominent American politician running into serious trouble. Ruff's past clients included Senator John Glenn, accused of political corruption, Senator Charles Robb, caught dallying with a young beauty queen, and Professor Anita Hall, who stunned the Senate judiciary committee by charging a Supreme Court nominee with sexual harassment. Ruff also fought a long and eventually successful court action for the American Tobacco Institute against claims that it had deliberately misled cigarette smokers about the risk to their health. Ruff's remarkable professional rise had been achieved in the face of what could have been a personal disaster. After graduating from Columbia law school in 1963, he received a grant from the Ford Foundation to run a law course in Liberia. Shortly after arriving in the country, he contracted a viral paralysis similar to poliomyelitis, which confined him to a wheelchair. Ruff did not, however, allow this disability to affect his career. From 1967 he gained valuable experience and contacts in the criminal division of the Justice Department. After five years there, however, he returned to teaching. He had barely settled at Georgetown University before Archibald Cox, the newly appointed Watergate special prosecutor, approached him to become a senior member of the team investigating President Richard Nixon and his White House staff. A colleague there was Hillary Rodham, who later married Bill Clinton. Ruff's personal role in the investigations focused on the vast range of illegal financial contributions made to Nixon's 1972 campaign. The evidence he amassed was so incontrovertible that most of those responsible, including the oil tycoon Armand Hammer, pleaded guilty. In 1975, with most of the key defendants convicted, Ruff took over as special prosecutor and found himself in the middle of a political storm, investigating charges that President Gerald Ford had diverted political donations to his personal use. In the highly charged final days of the 1976 presidential campaign, Ruff (well known as a Democrat) stuck firmly to his legal last, dismissed the charges and wrote finis to the special prosecution report. He returned to the Justice Department for a time, but was then hired by one of the most prominent Washington law firms, then acting for the tobacco institute. Its most threatening case came from the family of Rose Cipollone, who had died of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. Ruff tackled it head on. In one legal conference he told the opposing lawyer: \"You've tried the front door, the back door, the side door, and now you're trying the trap door. It isn't going to work.\" And, after years of litigation, Ruff ensured that it did not, a success he later tended to omit from his biography. Such courtroom successes put him near the top of the Washington ladder. His argument to the Senate ethics committee got John Glenn off the hook in 1989 after he was accused of influence-peddling in return for campaign contributions. Even more remarkably, Ruff persuaded the Federal Election Commission to grant Glenn an unprecedented waiver from its stringent fundraising rules. Ruff's initial involvement with the Clinton White House came from defending one of Hillary Clinton's principal assistants, Ira Magaziner, who helped to prepare her ill-fated healthcare plan. Magaziner was accused of perjury, but in a complex presentation to the US attorney's office in Washington, Ruff managed to shift the blame to some unspecified White House officials and Magaziner was never charged. It was against this background that Ruff became President Clinton's fifth White House counsel within four years. As the ripples of the Whitewater affair widened and allegations about the president's sexual behaviour proliferated, insiders joked that Clinton needed a lawyer smart enough to do the job and dumb enough to take it. Ruff defended his recruitment with the comment: \"When the president of the United States asks you to do something, you don't say, 'Let me think about it.' You say, 'How can I help you, Mr President?' \" The eruption of Monica Lewinsky on to the scene and the soaring political temperature in Congress eventually left even a practised operator like Ruff with little room for manoeuvre. Impeachment by the Republican-controlled House became a virtual certainty, and the principal article, charging Clinton with lying to the grand jury about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky, sailed through. Ruff put up the best moral arguments he could find in his statement at the Senate hearing. He accused the prosecution of having \"a vision too little attuned to the people ... more focused on retribution, more designed to achieve partisan ends\". After 14 days of hearings he did, indeed, win his case - by a margin of nine votes on the perjury charge and by a single vote on the obstruction of justice count. But Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania could only bring himself to vote \"not proven\". Ruff is survived by his wife, Sue, and two daughters. \u0095 Charles Frederick Carson Ruff, lawyer, born August 1 1939; died November 19 2000",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Before 1988, all local education authorities provided instrumental tuition, usually through peripatetic teachers employed by the authorities. In 1988, the Education Reform Act allowed schools to opt out of local authority control through the local management of schools (LMS). Schools therefore have greater control over their budgets and what these are spent on. In the 1990s, many local authority music adviser posts disappeared, and LMS in effect undermined the strategic planning of instrumental services previously organised at a local level. The present government introduced the Music Standards Fund in 1999 to halt the decline in school music. This year alone \u00a350m has been allocated. This central funding is intended to ensure that every local education authority in the country offers children the chance to learn to play musical instruments. Replies: Children should have access to music tuition. Coming from an economically deprived background should not stop them learning to play an instrument. In practice, many schools do provide lessons but local music services are responsible for this provision. It's up to individual schools whether they choose to provide instrumental tuition and it's also their decision whether they pass on the fees to parents. But schools are usually asked to have a fees remission policy in place for children who also receive free school meals. So parents can apply for free music tuition from the local music service, subject to their criteria. The situation is improving because the government is increasing funding through the Standards Fund. What remains a real problem is the level of support local education authorities give to schools, ranging from nothing to \u00a31m. This is why children in some areas are losing out from the arrangement. The government is doing its best to address the problems created by the decline of music services in recent years, but this will take time and there is a long way to go. In the meantime, contact your local music service directly to clarify what should be available for your children. Richard Hickman, chief executive, the Federation of Music Services Birmingham City Council has always been very supportive of the music service, which has expanded every year since the delegation of funds to schools. Obviously, the injection of cash through the Standards Fund has had a positive effect on the range of projects we can offer schools. Because the decision of whether to \"buy in\" music tuition ultimately rests with the headteacher and the board of governors, there are schools where no instrument tuition is provided. In the Birmingham area, a minority of primary schools do not use our service. A few might buy the services of an individual, and either fund the cost or ask parents to pay. However, such individuals rarely provide free instruments, making it an expensive option. So in any one area there can be one school with no instrument tuition at all, next to one that offers a private scheme, next to one that has chosen to buy into our services, offering tuition alongside the long-term loan of a musical instrument free of charge. In addition, the music service runs many workshops and projects open to schools whether they buy into tuition provision or not. My advice would be to approach the headteacher and ask whether your children's school is taking part in such workshops. You could also ring your local music service to arrange for teachers to visit the school and raise the profile of music. Ask around other parents and see whether there is a more general desire for free tuition, which you could then discuss with the head and governors as a priority for future budgetary consideration.

Which is why the Soho Theatre in London recently introduced a new Attachment Programme for six promising playwrights. \"I had organised an MA in playwriting for a university\", says Paul Sirett, literary manager of the Soho Theatre, \"but it seemed that entrance to the course was predicated on an ability to pay. Bearing in mind that playwrights are often broke and don't necessarily even write good essays, it seemed there was room for a more practical course.\" </p> <p>But the academic model wasn't abandoned entirely with the new course being divided into three terms of eight weeks with a six-week break between. \"We felt we needed to squeeze the course in between March and November\", says Lin Coghlan, director of the programme, \"as most writers can't financially commit to being in one place for much longer.\" </p> <p>The first term focused on playwriting, and the six students, who were chosen from among 2,000 playwrights who submitted scripts for the theatre's annual competition, spent one full day per week developing the spine of a story and a central knot of characters for a new play. During the six-week break, the ideas were knocked into some kind of shape. </p> <p>In the second term, the writers received feedback on their rough draft, while taking time out to study TV and radio with Alex Perrin, a former producer on The Bill, and Lucy Hannah, head of the new writing initiative at the BBC. \"Most writers can't make a living just writing plays\", Coghlan explains, \"so they need to know how to explore other writing avenues.\" </p> <p>The second six-week break saw the rough draft mutate into a first draft, and during the third term the writers explored film scriptwriting with David Evans, producer of Fever Pitch, before each play had a rehearsed reading in front of an audience. </p> <p>The plays themselves are not always what you might call accessible. Martha Emmitt's, Mister Love, is set in a Texas cafe run by gay women, where the only male regular is a derelict homeless man until an anarchic biker rides into town. The woman who runs the community falls in love with the biker and destroys the community. \"It sounds realistic\", says Emmitt, \"but it owes more to magic realism.\" </p> <p>The writers say they learned a lot about the technical demands of playwriting. \"I've started to create stories for my characters,\" says Emmitt. \"In the past, I used to just work from images and I don't think there was a strong enough narrative structure for an audience to get a sense of the characters completing a journey.\" </p> <p>But the most valuable part of the course for all writers seems to be the feeling of being provided with a home. \"So often a writer feels unsupported in their work,\" says Chris Chidmore. \"I have a sense of belonging at Soho. I feel there are people who care about what I do and are keen to discuss it.\" It's a feeling that is unlikely to go away. All six writers will return next year as mentors for the next course.</p>",

The woman who runs the community falls in love with the biker and destroys the community. \"It sounds realistic\", says Emmitt, \"but it owes more to magic realism.\" The writers say they learned a lot about the technical demands of playwriting. \"I've started to create stories for my characters,\" says Emmitt. \"In the past, I used to just work from images and I don't think there was a strong enough narrative structure for an audience to get a sense of the characters completing a journey.\" But the most valuable part of the course for all writers seems to be the feeling of being provided with a home. \"So often a writer feels unsupported in their work,\" says Chris Chidmore. \"I have a sense of belonging at Soho. I feel there are people who care about what I do and are keen to discuss it.\" It's a feeling that is unlikely to go away. All six writers will return next year as mentors for the next course.",

Already about 40% of the English population - and more in Scotland and Northern Ireland - goes to university, a figure that always surprises those who remember the equivalent figure of 12% from the early 1960s. </p> <p>One reason why it may not be too difficult for us is that by 2009 we shall be healthier, wealthier and wiser. If the economy continues to grow as it has done for the past 40 years, we will all on average be nearly 25% better off than we are today. Even if only a small part of the hype about the internet revolution is true, normal productivity growth will see to that. </p> <p>As for health, our expectation of life continues to rise, but still has some way to go to match other European countries and Japan. Medical science has conquered or palliated many diseases, but our overall nutritional status can still improve. It is a sure sign of what is possible that Dutch young men are 5cm taller than our young men. </p> <p>Wealthier and healthier, yes, but wiser? A chorus of scepticism still greets the year-on-year improvement in A-level and GCSE passes, but there is nothing inherently improbable in it. After all, human knowledge has increased and with it, probably, our ability to teach and learn. Even in the short period before 2009, we can expect to see the full effects of the national curriculum and the Curriculum 2000 reforms to post-16 education, which have only just begun. We may even simply be getting more intelligent as our nutritional status improves; we have stopped poisoning our children with leaded petrol. </p> <p>Many of the conditions for creating more graduates are therefore in place or under way. A further necessity, however, is that the economy should need them and employers be prepared to give them jobs. Here, too, the portents are good. In Britain today the average male graduate earns \u00a3400,000 more over his lifetime than a non-graduate; the advantage for women is smaller but still substantial. Increasing the number of graduates might erode this advantage, but it has persisted despite the growth in numbers of graduates in recent years. It also still exists in countries like the US, with higher proportions than ours. </p> <p>The reason, it seems, is the insatiable ability of \"knowledge economies\" to absorb highly skilled labour. Graduates are needed, in small numbers, to create knowledge, to invent and investigate. They are needed in much larger numbers to use knowledge in the myriad of service industries - the media, banking, insurance, design - on which we spend our wealth. </p> <p>So in many ways the graduates of 2009 will be like those of today. But - and here's the tricky question - where will they come from? It will have to be from those parts of our society which \"widening participation\" has not yet reached. </p> <p>The extra graduates will come from the large areas of our inner cities and our countryside that are today still higher education-free zones. Recruiting from these areas, and particularly from the white working-class, will be difficult and expensive; the \u00a320m recently announced by the government is welcome but a drop in the ocean. Even more expensive will be helping these new students to get their degrees; it is here that the greatest changes will have to come. Universities will have to adapt to more flexible study patterns. </p> <p>Students in 2009 are even more likely than today to combine study with work. Already many students have paid work while they study, and vacation work is already near universal, as students try to reduce debt. The new foundation degrees, which the government sees as the main vehicle of expansion, are designed to merge study with work. By 2009, these trends will have made obsolete the tradition of going away to university for three years. Instead, the typical student is likely to be a commuter. Hostels will survive for overseas students and the conference trade, but the average student will live close to home. They will need to, to maintain contact with the networks that help them to get work, and to economise on travel and living costs. </p> <p>Such students will have to be good at managing time. But they will also demand tuition at times that suit them; the rigid timetables of the past, even the concepts of \"term\" and \"vacation\" will wither as internet and intranet give access to learning 24 hours a day throughout the year. Examinations, too, will have to be more frequent, even perhaps \"on demand\"; the student will decide how long to take over a course - two, five or 10 years compared with today's three years. There will be changes to university buildings which, with satellite facilities in FE colleges, will become study centres for those who have no room to study at home. </p> <p>The coming expansion, in short, will require changes in attitudes, funding and facilities. The students of 2009 will be a real challenge to a university system which, many would say, already thinks it has changed enough. </p> <p> \u0095 Roderick Floud is Provost of London Guildhall University.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>John Cavendish has something of the air of a character from Dickens. To be more specific, he reminds you of one of those driven, desperate souls in Bleak House who spend their days hanging around the High Court of Chancery waiting for a judgment that never comes. </p> <p>Grey at 38, he wears the hunted look of someone who has been through a significant ordeal. After eight years, Cavendish has finally had a judgment on his own legal struggle with East London University over an architecture MSc. It wasn't the verdict he wanted and he could fight on to appeal. But he has had enough. </p> <p>Pursuing the case has wreaked a heavy cost. His house has been repossessed and he says he will have to go bankrupt because he cannot pay the \u00a380,000 costs. It has killed off any hope he once had of qualifying as an architect. </p> <p>His preoccupation with the case caused a split with his girlfriend and affected other friendships back in Dublin where he hails from. </p> <p>\"I'm sick of hearing about the case,\" the actor Paudge Behan, adopted son of Brendan, told him, implying he could find someone else to have a pint with. </p> <p>It's all a very heavy price to pay and it begs a number of questions. Should Cavendish have had to go all the way to the high court to get an independent adjudication on his complaint? Is this another example of glaring deficiencies in higher education grievance procedures, especially in the former polys, which don't even have that creaky old curio, the Visitor system? </p> <p>It adds weight to those backing the proposal being considered by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals: independent panels to be set up with transparent procedures, to which students from the new universities may appeal if they are not satisfied with how their complaints are handled internally. </p> <p>Cavendish agrees: \"You would think there should formally be some sort of simple external arbitration system to deal with student grievances so they didn't have to go to court.\" </p> <p>Most people with a gripe against their university would not have pursued it to the lengths Cavendish went. \"I do have a tendency to get obsessive,\" he admits. </p> <p>He has other tell-tale signs of the dogged long-haul litigant: bulging lever-arch files of documentation, the faint - sometimes not so faint - suspicion that they are fighting a conspiracy, and the total immersion in the case which makes it impossible to give simple answers to questions. </p> <p>Cavendish also joined the band of \"litigants in person\", individuals in the grip of long-running legal actions who are going it alone without legal representation, although likely to have sought advice from more than one lawyer along the way. </p> <p>Cavendish didn't go to university at first. \"My school results were lousy,\" he says. While working in the architecture business as a draughtsman in 1984 he started a part-time Part 1 architecture degree at the then South Bank poly in London. The four-year course stretched to six in his case, because he took one year off and illness wiped out another. He transferred to the East London poly for his final year. He got a BSc in 1990. </p> <p>He says he was then encouraged to continue his journey towards the career he wanted by doing a new course - an MSc architecture: computing and design - that East London poly was starting up. </p> <p>Successful completion of the first year would get the MSc, and finishing the second would win a diploma and exemption from the Royal Institute of British Architects Part 2 exams - essential for anyone wanting to practise as an architect. </p> <p>Cavendish did successfully complete the first year but he and all bar one student on the course failed the second year, he says. His appeal against the failure was turned down in January 1993. The university has maintained that he was a weak student whose work in that second year was well below acceptable; nevertheless they asked him to teach undergraduates in the first MSc year. </p> <p>He says he then found out the two-year course he had done would not have exempted him from Part 2 of the professional exams anyway, because it had not been recognised by the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). </p> <p>After rooting around a bit more, he says he established that the MSc course was not included in the European Commission's list of recognised courses leading to the professional architect's qualification which would enable the holder to practise across the EU. Thus, he says, he would not have been able to go back home to work in Dublin. </p> <p>Cavendish was angry at wasting two valuable years - they had brought him no nearer his dream of becoming an architect and needlessly cost him money. He had borrowed thousands from his bank to tide him through the course and wasted the grant he had managed to get from Ealing borough. The university consistently maintained the course had necessary recognition. </p> <p>In April 1998, Cavendish got a letter from the Architects Registration Board (ARB), which had superseded ARCUK. It said the MSc/Diploma course had gained recognition in 1994, and that this was retrospective. \"That would not have been a lot of use in 1992 if I had passed the course,\" Cavendish says. </p> <p>On October 24 this year his case for breach of contract, misrepresentation and negligence began in the high court, and failed. It was struck out, he says, because the formula he had used to calculate damages for loss of earnings over the past eight years was ruled inappropriate for a breach of contract claim. </p> <p>East London University's registrar, Alan Ingle, says: \"Any student who wishes to dispute an assessment decision may appeal in accordance with the University Regulations. Mr Cavendish did submit an appeal in 1993, which was dismissed. He was advised at the time his appeal was dismissed that the responsibility for the investigation of complaints regarding course delivery resided with the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Academic Affairs).

      "bodyText": "John Cavendish has something of the air of a character from Dickens. To be more specific, he reminds you of one of those driven, desperate souls in Bleak House who spend their days hanging around the High Court of Chancery waiting for a judgment that never comes. Grey at 38, he wears the hunted look of someone who has been through a significant ordeal. After eight years, Cavendish has finally had a judgment on his own legal struggle with East London University over an architecture MSc. It wasn't the verdict he wanted and he could fight on to appeal. But he has had enough. Pursuing the case has wreaked a heavy cost. His house has been repossessed and he says he will have to go bankrupt because he cannot pay the \u00a380,000 costs. It has killed off any hope he once had of qualifying as an architect. His preoccupation with the case caused a split with his girlfriend and affected other friendships back in Dublin where he hails from. \"I'm sick of hearing about the case,\" the actor Paudge Behan, adopted son of Brendan, told him, implying he could find someone else to have a pint with. It's all a very heavy price to pay and it begs a number of questions. Should Cavendish have had to go all the way to the high court to get an independent adjudication on his complaint? Is this another example of glaring deficiencies in higher education grievance procedures, especially in the former polys, which don't even have that creaky old curio, the Visitor system? It adds weight to those backing the proposal being considered by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals: independent panels to be set up with transparent procedures, to which students from the new universities may appeal if they are not satisfied with how their complaints are handled internally. Cavendish agrees: \"You would think there should formally be some sort of simple external arbitration system to deal with student grievances so they didn't have to go to court.\" Most people with a gripe against their university would not have pursued it to the lengths Cavendish went. \"I do have a tendency to get obsessive,\" he admits. He has other tell-tale signs of the dogged long-haul litigant: bulging lever-arch files of documentation, the faint - sometimes not so faint - suspicion that they are fighting a conspiracy, and the total immersion in the case which makes it impossible to give simple answers to questions. Cavendish also joined the band of \"litigants in person\", individuals in the grip of long-running legal actions who are going it alone without legal representation, although likely to have sought advice from more than one lawyer along the way. Cavendish didn't go to university at first. \"My school results were lousy,\" he says. While working in the architecture business as a draughtsman in 1984 he started a part-time Part 1 architecture degree at the then South Bank poly in London. The four-year course stretched to six in his case, because he took one year off and illness wiped out another. He transferred to the East London poly for his final year. He got a BSc in 1990. He says he was then encouraged to continue his journey towards the career he wanted by doing a new course - an MSc architecture: computing and design - that East London poly was starting up. Successful completion of the first year would get the MSc, and finishing the second would win a diploma and exemption from the Royal Institute of British Architects Part 2 exams - essential for anyone wanting to practise as an architect. Cavendish did successfully complete the first year but he and all bar one student on the course failed the second year, he says. His appeal against the failure was turned down in January 1993. The university has maintained that he was a weak student whose work in that second year was well below acceptable; nevertheless they asked him to teach undergraduates in the first MSc year. He says he then found out the two-year course he had done would not have exempted him from Part 2 of the professional exams anyway, because it had not been recognised by the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). After rooting around a bit more, he says he established that the MSc course was not included in the European Commission's list of recognised courses leading to the professional architect's qualification which would enable the holder to practise across the EU. Thus, he says, he would not have been able to go back home to work in Dublin. Cavendish was angry at wasting two valuable years - they had brought him no nearer his dream of becoming an architect and needlessly cost him money. He had borrowed thousands from his bank to tide him through the course and wasted the grant he had managed to get from Ealing borough. The university consistently maintained the course had necessary recognition. In April 1998, Cavendish got a letter from the Architects Registration Board (ARB), which had superseded ARCUK. It said the MSc/Diploma course had gained recognition in 1994, and that this was retrospective. \"That would not have been a lot of use in 1992 if I had passed the course,\" Cavendish says. On October 24 this year his case for breach of contract, misrepresentation and negligence began in the high court, and failed. It was struck out, he says, because the formula he had used to calculate damages for loss of earnings over the past eight years was ruled inappropriate for a breach of contract claim. East London University's registrar, Alan Ingle, says: \"Any student who wishes to dispute an assessment decision may appeal in accordance with the University Regulations. Mr Cavendish did submit an appeal in 1993, which was dismissed. He was advised at the time his appeal was dismissed that the responsibility for the investigation of complaints regarding course delivery resided with the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Academic Affairs). The Pro-Vice-Chancellor investigated the complaint but found it without substance. Later that year the Academic Board approved the Student Complaint Regulations which have been in force since then.\" Cavendish says: \"It's destroyed my working life. These courses are supposed to improve your careers. It's done the opposite for me.\"",

      "body": "<p>Chickens about to be slaughtered go very silent, hold their wings to their breasts and huddle together with large sad eyes. </p> <p>We know this because, at 7.35am yesterday, a delivery of 60 of Britain's finest naturally-reared arrived at Liverpool docks in the back of several large rented vans, courtesy of well-known global poulterers Greenpeace. </p> <p>Waving tickets for the Ireland ferry, the vans sped through the perimeter wall of the docks with ease. Half a mile further they reached the gates of Cargill's, Britain's largest importer of GM soya beans, which are fed mainly to animals. </p> <p>The first two vans passed four sleepy guards, saying only that they had a \"delivery\". The third stopped on the corporate weighbridge and immobilised its air brakes blocking the route into the factory yard. </p> <p>On a co-ordinated squawk the rear doors of the vans were flung open and the chickens rushed out into the vile-smelling, steam-shrouded works. Flapping their little felt wings, tripping over their giant talons and clucking like a coach load of VIPs at the dome, the liberated flock danced their way in as Tannoys blared out from the vans the sound of an industrial poultry shed. </p> <p>Cargill's, which also happens to be the world's largest grain and food trader, turning over \u00a340bn a year, was metaphorically stuffed. \"Tossers,\" yelled one of the guards flapping his own arms in sympathy with 30 chickens who flew past him. </p> <p><strong> Fair and foul</strong><br> </p> <p> It probably helped that at this very moment, a mighty hail storm broke - summoned, it is thought, by John Prescott and environmentalists at the Hague global warming talks. What until then had been 60 passable Rhode Island reds and four cocky-looking guards became in one minute sodden, floppy-combed, wilting beaked fowl and even fouler-mouthed security men. Dry chaos, in short, became miserable farce. \"Shit, shit, shit,\" yelled a guard, cursing the weather as much as the chickens. \"Stop, stop. This is private land. Leave at once. Now!\" </p> <p>\"Chicken tonight,\" taunted a funky giant rooster leading a dash for one of the many 80ft high silos where the GM soya is stored before being crushed into oil and distributed to animal seed companies around Britain. </p> <p>Within 10 minutes eight well-seasoned climbers had locked themselves to a conveyer belt 60ft above ground, intending to roost at least two nights. Meanwhile, eight more poultry were getting broody up on the silos, while the rest of the flock was being shooed off lorries and out of buildings by whoever Cargill's could persuade to brave the storm. </p> <p>A giant alsatian barely restrained by a guard nipped the wing of one chicken; but most were led away as first the dock police, then customs and excise, and finally Liverpool's finest arrived on the scene. </p> <p>Outside the perimeter fence 10 chickens who had been prevented from entering performed for the benefit of arriving Cargill's drivers and workers. Opinions were divided on the quality of the matinee theatre. </p> <p>\"I haven't laughed so much on a Monday morning in years,\" said one. \"Chicken shit,\" said another. </p> <p>A third declared his undying respect for Greenpeace and hatred for the company where he had worked for years: \"Good on them. It's about time someone took these bastards on. They think they can get away with anything.\" He then whispered loudly that Greenpeace should try another Cargill depot. </p> <p>\"They're canny. They keep the GM well clear of this place.\" He drew a map suggesting the best way in. </p> <p>Greenpeace was positively clucking at its success following its recent acquittal for partly destroying a GM maize field last year. The 60 chickens were cock-a-hoop too. They included a vicar, teachers, an athletic coach, an accountant, and a sewing machinist. </p> <p>Having largely persuaded the super markets and food processors to ban GM soya in human foodstuff, the Cargill's attack opened up a whole new front for the anti-GM protesters. </p> <p>\"Few people know that almost every chicken and pig sold in Britain in the past three years has been fed on GM food. It is still massively in the food chain,\" said a Greenpeace spokesman yesterday. </p> <p>A recent poll, he said, suggested that 57% of people did not want animals to be fed GM food, and 90% said they wanted full labelling on all meat rearedusing GM food. No one knew the exact quantities of GM animal foodstuff imported into Britain. A 1999 agriculture minister report suggested that \"a substantial proportion of the 2m tons of soya, 1.1m tons of maize and 0.5m tons of distillers' grains used in animal feed [in Britain] could contain material derived from GM varieties\". </p> <p><strong> Segregation</strong><br> </p> <p> In April the then farms minister, Jeff Rooker, told a select committee: \"You have to assume that anything imported from America will probably be mixed up with GM organisms.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Cargill's was at a loss yesterday to understand why Greenpeace kept targeting the firm. Earlier this year the group occupied a GM soya boat, and last week it projected \"nasty\" videos on one of the firm's sheds. </p> <p>\"But we do segregate GM and non-GM soya. We are very responsible. We only respond to what our customers want. If they specify GM soya, we will provide it. If they want non-GM, we will get it for them, too.\" </p> <p>She said that more companies were specifying non-GM animal feed, even at a higher price. </p> <p>\"But we don't want to sit down to talk about it with Greenpeace. They don't seem to like us for some peculiar reason. We even work with children to educate them about the environment.\" </p> <p>Last week both McDonald's and Burger King said they would no longer sell meat from animals fed GM foods, following Sainsbury's, Iceland, Marks and Spencer, Nestle, Unilever and others. Anti-GM campaigners said there was still uncertainty as to whether commitments applied to all foods and ingredients. </p> <p>Last night police said eight people had been arrested, and Greenpeace said four people remained chained up on the silos. \"We'll continue to harass Cargill's until it ends these GM food imports and stops contaminating our food chain,\" clucked their spokesman.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chickens about to be slaughtered go very silent, hold their wings to their breasts and huddle together with large sad eyes. We know this because, at 7.35am yesterday, a delivery of 60 of Britain's finest naturally-reared arrived at Liverpool docks in the back of several large rented vans, courtesy of well-known global poulterers Greenpeace. Waving tickets for the Ireland ferry, the vans sped through the perimeter wall of the docks with ease. Half a mile further they reached the gates of Cargill's, Britain's largest importer of GM soya beans, which are fed mainly to animals. The first two vans passed four sleepy guards, saying only that they had a \"delivery\". The third stopped on the corporate weighbridge and immobilised its air brakes blocking the route into the factory yard. On a co-ordinated squawk the rear doors of the vans were flung open and the chickens rushed out into the vile-smelling, steam-shrouded works. Flapping their little felt wings, tripping over their giant talons and clucking like a coach load of VIPs at the dome, the liberated flock danced their way in as Tannoys blared out from the vans the sound of an industrial poultry shed. Cargill's, which also happens to be the world's largest grain and food trader, turning over \u00a340bn a year, was metaphorically stuffed. \"Tossers,\" yelled one of the guards flapping his own arms in sympathy with 30 chickens who flew past him. Fair and foul It probably helped that at this very moment, a mighty hail storm broke - summoned, it is thought, by John Prescott and environmentalists at the Hague global warming talks. What until then had been 60 passable Rhode Island reds and four cocky-looking guards became in one minute sodden, floppy-combed, wilting beaked fowl and even fouler-mouthed security men. Dry chaos, in short, became miserable farce. \"Shit, shit, shit,\" yelled a guard, cursing the weather as much as the chickens. \"Stop, stop. This is private land. Leave at once. Now!\" \"Chicken tonight,\" taunted a funky giant rooster leading a dash for one of the many 80ft high silos where the GM soya is stored before being crushed into oil and distributed to animal seed companies around Britain. Within 10 minutes eight well-seasoned climbers had locked themselves to a conveyer belt 60ft above ground, intending to roost at least two nights. Meanwhile, eight more poultry were getting broody up on the silos, while the rest of the flock was being shooed off lorries and out of buildings by whoever Cargill's could persuade to brave the storm. A giant alsatian barely restrained by a guard nipped the wing of one chicken; but most were led away as first the dock police, then customs and excise, and finally Liverpool's finest arrived on the scene. Outside the perimeter fence 10 chickens who had been prevented from entering performed for the benefit of arriving Cargill's drivers and workers. Opinions were divided on the quality of the matinee theatre. \"I haven't laughed so much on a Monday morning in years,\" said one. \"Chicken shit,\" said another. A third declared his undying respect for Greenpeace and hatred for the company where he had worked for years: \"Good on them. It's about time someone took these bastards on. They think they can get away with anything.\" He then whispered loudly that Greenpeace should try another Cargill depot. \"They're canny. They keep the GM well clear of this place.\" He drew a map suggesting the best way in. Greenpeace was positively clucking at its success following its recent acquittal for partly destroying a GM maize field last year. The 60 chickens were cock-a-hoop too. They included a vicar, teachers, an athletic coach, an accountant, and a sewing machinist. Having largely persuaded the super markets and food processors to ban GM soya in human foodstuff, the Cargill's attack opened up a whole new front for the anti-GM protesters. \"Few people know that almost every chicken and pig sold in Britain in the past three years has been fed on GM food. It is still massively in the food chain,\" said a Greenpeace spokesman yesterday. A recent poll, he said, suggested that 57% of people did not want animals to be fed GM food, and 90% said they wanted full labelling on all meat rearedusing GM food. No one knew the exact quantities of GM animal foodstuff imported into Britain. A 1999 agriculture minister report suggested that \"a substantial proportion of the 2m tons of soya, 1.1m tons of maize and 0.5m tons of distillers' grains used in animal feed [in Britain] could contain material derived from GM varieties\". Segregation In April the then farms minister, Jeff Rooker, told a select committee: \"You have to assume that anything imported from America will probably be mixed up with GM organisms.\" A spokeswoman for Cargill's was at a loss yesterday to understand why Greenpeace kept targeting the firm. Earlier this year the group occupied a GM soya boat, and last week it projected \"nasty\" videos on one of the firm's sheds. \"But we do segregate GM and non-GM soya. We are very responsible. We only respond to what our customers want. If they specify GM soya, we will provide it. If they want non-GM, we will get it for them, too.\" She said that more companies were specifying non-GM animal feed, even at a higher price. \"But we don't want to sit down to talk about it with Greenpeace. They don't seem to like us for some peculiar reason. We even work with children to educate them about the environment.\" Last week both McDonald's and Burger King said they would no longer sell meat from animals fed GM foods, following Sainsbury's, Iceland, Marks and Spencer, Nestle, Unilever and others. Anti-GM campaigners said there was still uncertainty as to whether commitments applied to all foods and ingredients. Last night police said eight people had been arrested, and Greenpeace said four people remained chained up on the silos. \"We'll continue to harass Cargill's until it ends these GM food imports and stops contaminating our food chain,\" clucked their spokesman.",

Detective Inspector John Boyle, 64, retired after 31 years' distinguished service, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. The serving officer who supplied him, PC James Burrell, 47, admitted the same offence and was jailed for 15 months. Boyle, of Wyke, Bradford, was instrumental in getting the Yorkshire Ripper to con fess as he interviewed him at Dewsbury police station in January 1981. Sutcliffe admitted being the serial killer after Boyle questioned him about his trips to Sheffield. The court heard how Boyle, who worked as an agent for detective agencies, got PC Burrell, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, to pass on information from vehicle registration and criminal background checks. PC Burrell, the crime evaluator in the divisional intelligence unit at West Yorkshire police, bought cheap liquor from Boyle in return for the confidential information. The court heard how Boyle earned as little as \u00a310 and \u00a320 for passing on information to Bradford-based private investigator Javid Butt, 36, who in turn passed some of the information on to Manchester-based investigator Nitin Patel, 35, between February 1998 and January 1999. PC Burrell made 121 non-authorised vehicle checks and 32 criminal record checks during the 12-month period. Two undercover police officers posing as criminals went to the respective private investigators and successfully bought information from them. The court heard how the chief constable of West Yorkshire authorised a phone tap on Burrell's line at the force's Wakefield base. When interviewed by police Boyle immediately confessed his actions. The court heard how some of the information he obtained from his police contact was used by a large company in the north east to get background information on employees engaged in a union dispute. Other people found themselves being followed by their former partners, ex-husband, co-habitee or inquiry agent and one person took out an injunction to prevent further harassment. Butt, from Idle, Bradford, was jailed for four months after admitting conspiracy to commit misconduct.

      "bodyText": "At least something was clear at the start of the hearing yesterday that just might determine the identity of the next president of the United States: the sound of an official booming \"Oyez, oyez, oyez,\" to bring the court to order. Not that this was a particularly onerous task in the Florida supreme court, with no witnesses, jury, or cross-examination but only the arguments of lawyers, 47 of whom now represent the three parties appearing before the court. Some of them must have seen the sign outside a business that might otherwise have been recommending its catfish and chicken wings: \"Lawyers go home. Take media with you.\" Vice-president Al Gore wants the seven members of the supreme court - six Democrats and one independent - to allow hand recounts in south Florida to be included in the final tally because he believes that would put him in the White House; Texas governor George W Bush wants the counts stopped for the same reason; and the state's secretary of state Katherine Harris wants the bench to rule that she is right in refusing to accept votes received after last Tuesday's deadline. But only a few of their attorneys had a role in the court, framed by palms and oak, a building seemingly plucked from Gone With The Wind and deposited at the feet of the state's 22-storey seat of government. These branches of government are separated by the constitution, but yesterday nine satellite broadcast trucks also drew a line in the street between the executive and the judiciary. Only 128 seats were available for the public, interested members of which were advised to start forming an orderly line at 8am, six hours before the hearing was to start. But the people of Tallahassee were not exactly falling over themselves at first to see \"history in the making\". By 8.45am only five people were there to claim places on the stained-wood benches, among them John Trommershausser, a 79-year-old former air force colonel. \"I never get tired of something like this,\" he said from within a beige raincoat rebuk ing the reputation of the Sunshine State. \"It's like a carnival. We want to see the supreme court in action.\" As he spoke, the band played on, or at least a woman dressed in red, white and blue and alternating between accordian and banjo. \"Put the vote back the way it's suppos'd to be/ Please put the world back in order for me,\" she sang Inside, up 10 marble steps, through metal doors and under portraits of former members of the court, the three main lawyers went about their tasks: David Boies, the $700 (\u00a3492) an hour Willie Nelson fan who was lead lawyer for the US government in its case against Microsoft, speaking for Mr Gore; Michael Carvin, a deputy assistant attorney-general during the Reagan administration, for Mr Bush; and Joseph Klock, from a Democrat-leaning Miami law firm who nonetheless represents Ms Harris, a multi-millionaire friend of the Bushes. After the legal argument, the judges met in private to consider the matter. They were expected to take up to two days mulling over the ruling. The court is regarded as independent and has clashed with Governor Jeb Bush over use of the electric chair and affirmative action. Only one voice in Tallahassee spoke with certainty about what was going to happen. Pastor J Douglas Dortch had posted his daily message outside the First Baptist Church on Adams Street a few blocks away from the court: \"Thank God it's nearly all over.\"",

The deal however immediately triggered fresh embarrassment for ministers as Parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, confirmed it is to launch a second inquiry - this time into how ministers handled the sale. The investigation follows a damning report from the auditors on the fiasco from which neither the directors of the dome company nor the cabinet office minister and sole shareholder in the project, Lord Falconer, emerged with any credit. Half the projected visitors never materialise, it had to be bailed out to the tune of \u00a3229m from the national lottery and Chris Smith, the millennium chairman and culture secretary, twice had to overrule senior civil servants to prevent it going bust.

Most curfews will require convicted youngsters to stay off the street at night. The measure follows a pilot project in 20 courts in Greater Manchester and Norfolk initiated by the last Conservative government's home secretary, Michael Howard. The powers to impose the curfew orders nationwide will be handed to courts early next year. The Home Office claimed commissioned research showed that the tagged curfew orders were popular with sentencers and that, generally, offenders and their families preferred to deal with the restrictions of the tagged curfew rather than the alternative of a custodial sentence. However, the study of the pilot programme also showed that low use of curfews stemmed from the belief that they were suitable only for a small number of young offenders. Social workers pointed out that nigthtime curfews could exacerbate tensions at home or add to a lack of familiy stability.

      "bodyText": "The NHS is considering banning anyone who has received blood transfusions from giving blood themselves amid rising concerns that they may unknowingly pass on the fatal human variant of BSE. Such a move could cut Britain's 1.9m volunteer donors by up to 10% and create such huge shortages that transfusion services would struggle to meet demand. The possibility, first secretly investigated two years ago, is being re-examined as EU scientists and officials decide whether guidance should be offered on blood safety throughout the union. But some insiders are concerned that such a drastic step could create a level of panic among the whole donor population that would threaten more lives through shortages than might be saved from what is, at present, regarded as only a theoretical risk. Seven of the 85 British victims of variant CJD, the human equivalent of BSE, have been identified as donors before they showed obvious symptoms of the disease. Recipients of their blood have not been informed but the Department of Health and ethics committees on health authorities are seeking to develop protocols for doing so in the future. There is as yet no test for detecting vCJD and many patients might not wish to know whether they had been exposed to the risk of a condition for which there is not even at present a treatment to moderate its effects, let alone cure it. White blood cells are already filtered out of blood donations because they have been thought most likely to carry the agent responsible for vCJD and there is a ban on most British-sourced plasma products. But the government is anxious to test whether red blood cells carry the agent too. Importing enough blood to meet needs in operating theatres in this country - 2.5m units a year, each about a pint - would be impossible because of its short shelf life so all options that might minimise the threat of contamination are now being reassessed. The health department confirmed last night that it had ordered the review as to whether those who had received transfusions should be eligible to be blood donors. \"The whole issue of cleanliness [of blood] is under review. This is just part of that.\" A spokesman for the national blood service said: \"We have been working on the basis [that] between 5% and 10% of blood donors have received transfusions. If it were the case that 10% were knocked off our donor data base, we would be struggling to meet the needs of the country.\" At present, potential donors are not routinely asked whether they have received blood themselves. Some donors may not even know because by no means all operations involve transfusions. But the service is to question new donors among the 10% of volunteers it has to recruit each year to replace those who can no longer donate blood, or choose not to, in an effort to assess the position more accurately. Belgium, Austria and some German states, as well as Switzerland, are already following the example of the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand in banning donations from anyone who spent more than six months in the UK between 1980 and 1996, the years in which exposure to BSE through infected meat, vaccines, cosmetics or other possible routes was highest. The blood authorities in those countries considered they could stand the loss of such donors. It is also understood that the NHS is in discussions with Jehovah's Witnesses about their experience with recycling of patients' own blood during operations and other blood-saving techniques, as officials and surgeons step up their search for alternatives to traditional donation so they can eke out supplies. Witnesses have already raised funds for several machines in NHS hospitals that wash and process blood lost in surgery for transfusion back into the same patients.",

      "body": "<p>A small item appeared in the news pages of the Daily Telegraph yesterday. Tucked away under a generous page three spread on the nuptials of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, it was reported that Victoria Gillick, the indefatigable campaigner against underage sex, was facing financial ruin after a libel action she had brought was thrown out of court.</p> <p>Gillick, it emerged, had sued her old adversary, Brook - which provides advice on sex and contraception - over a factsheet in which, she claimed, it was alleged that she was responsible for the rise in teenage pregnancies in the 80s.</p> <p>In a preliminary hearing last week, a high court judge ruled that the words about which she complained were not capable of bearing the meaning she claimed. Mr Justice Eady dismissed the case, Gillick was refused leave to appeal, and she left the court in tears. \"I don't have any money. I possess nothing and I own nothing,\" she was reported to have said. It sounded like the end of the road.</p> <p>For those women in their late 20s and 30s who reaped the rewards of battles fought by an earlier generation in the struggle for sexual liberation, Gillick has been there throughout, like a troubling spectre hovering in the wings as we indulged our sexual freedoms.</p> <p>Could it be that after more than 20 years of campaigning against such freedoms, Gillick - she of the long dark tresses and large family - had run out of steam? Would she finally admit that not only was she struggling Canute-like against the tide, but the waves had crashed up the beach and were well over the sea defences?</p> <p>In a word, no. Absolutely not. How wrong can you be? Within a couple of minutes of talking to Gillick, it becomes abundantly clear that far from reaching the end of any road, she is as unstoppable as a Terminator cyborg in her quest to enlighten the world about the dangers of sex too young.</p> <p>\"I will not let it go,\" she tells me. \"It's a dirty job, but it's a necessary one. I still think that ultimately the truth will out.\"</p> <p>Gillick, a mother of 10, first achieved notoriety in 1984 when she won an appeal court ruling that girls under 16 should not be given contraception without parental consent. She was euphoric.</p> <p>The following year, the judgement was reversed by the House of Lords. She was devastated: \"I felt like I had been stamped on by the system,\" she says. Typically she recovered sufficiently to take part in an Oxford Union debate with Germaine Greer on the evening of the judgment.</p> <p>And despite this most recent setback, she has lost none of her crusading zeal. She is already planning to appeal against Mr Justice Eady's decision to refuse her leave to appeal. She faces having to pay Brook's costs, though she says she has no money. The house is in her husband's name. \"I shall fight to clear my name by whatever means I can. The rest is in God's hands,\" she says.</p> <p>Gillick, now in her mid-50s, is committed to her work as a pregnancy counsellor on behalf of the anti-abortion group Life, and she runs a one-woman organisation called Inform, gathering statistics on contraception and pregnancy among young women, and monitoring the effects of the House of Lords ruling.</p> <p>\"I suppose I'm an old romantic. I still believe that if you present the facts, people will understand and take sensible action,\" she says, her voice deceptively soft and gentle.</p> <p>\"The free availability of contraception to young girls does not reduce underage pregnancy rates. It does encourage girls to think that sex is safe. Having been a voluntary pregnancy counsellor for nine years I now see at first hand how the policy is impacting on the young.</p> <p>\"I've seen children as young as 11 who have been put on the pill and they've forgotten to take it within a couple of weeks of being prescribed it. They are only children. Unfortunately children cannot take the pill consistently. Nor can they use condoms properly. The more youngsters that are trying to use contraceptives, the more likely we are to get pregnancies.</p> <p>\"I feel very, very sad for this younger generation who have been sold the line that sex is safe and just a form of recreation with no consequences. I think we are living in an age which is doing untold damage to women's reproductive health.\"</p> <p>And so on. As though she never went away. Which she didn't - despite the personal cost to herself and her family. \"I've been called everything under the sun, including teenage magazines calling me Mrs Pillock in the 80s. They were so cruel, really spiteful.\"</p> <p>Then there were the consequent pressures for her five sons and five daughters, who grew up in the glare of the media spotlight - thrust into the headlines themselves whenever they appeared to stray from the papers' perception of the Gillick straight and narrow. One daughter was spotted sunbathing topless on a beach to the delight of the tabloids; another had a baby out of wedlock.</p> <p>\"The distressing thing about that was the way they were pursued,\" says Gillick. \"It was difficult for them because of their high profile mother, but they don't resent me.</p> <p>\"The 80s were hard times for us as a family. If you are a mother who raises her head above the parapet you are always vulnerable. People who opposed me often said a woman who has children should not take on these issues, which I think is desperately unfair.\"</p> <p>She is now a grandmother with 16 grandchildren, aged between 11 and just a few weeks, and her children have thrived in their chosen careers, as sculptors and painters (one of her twins, Jim, painted Lady Thatcher's portrait), designers and cabinet makers</p> <p>This has been a particularly tumultuous year. In September, after 32 years of child-rearing, Gillick's youngest daughter left home - the last to fly the nest - to train as a teacher, leaving her and her artist husband, Gordon, rattling around their rambling house like a pair of dried beans in a tin. \"At first it felt very empty and peculiar,\" she says. \"Within a week Gordon and I were scampering around and thoroughly enjoying it.\"</p> <p>As far as the future is concerned, Gillick is happy to carry on swimming against the tide. \"They say that only dead fish swim with the tide. I don't want to be one of those dead bloaters.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A small item appeared in the news pages of the Daily Telegraph yesterday. Tucked away under a generous page three spread on the nuptials of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, it was reported that Victoria Gillick, the indefatigable campaigner against underage sex, was facing financial ruin after a libel action she had brought was thrown out of court. Gillick, it emerged, had sued her old adversary, Brook - which provides advice on sex and contraception - over a factsheet in which, she claimed, it was alleged that she was responsible for the rise in teenage pregnancies in the 80s. In a preliminary hearing last week, a high court judge ruled that the words about which she complained were not capable of bearing the meaning she claimed. Mr Justice Eady dismissed the case, Gillick was refused leave to appeal, and she left the court in tears. \"I don't have any money. I possess nothing and I own nothing,\" she was reported to have said. It sounded like the end of the road. For those women in their late 20s and 30s who reaped the rewards of battles fought by an earlier generation in the struggle for sexual liberation, Gillick has been there throughout, like a troubling spectre hovering in the wings as we indulged our sexual freedoms. Could it be that after more than 20 years of campaigning against such freedoms, Gillick - she of the long dark tresses and large family - had run out of steam? Would she finally admit that not only was she struggling Canute-like against the tide, but the waves had crashed up the beach and were well over the sea defences? In a word, no. Absolutely not. How wrong can you be? Within a couple of minutes of talking to Gillick, it becomes abundantly clear that far from reaching the end of any road, she is as unstoppable as a Terminator cyborg in her quest to enlighten the world about the dangers of sex too young. \"I will not let it go,\" she tells me. \"It's a dirty job, but it's a necessary one. I still think that ultimately the truth will out.\" Gillick, a mother of 10, first achieved notoriety in 1984 when she won an appeal court ruling that girls under 16 should not be given contraception without parental consent. She was euphoric. The following year, the judgement was reversed by the House of Lords. She was devastated: \"I felt like I had been stamped on by the system,\" she says. Typically she recovered sufficiently to take part in an Oxford Union debate with Germaine Greer on the evening of the judgment. And despite this most recent setback, she has lost none of her crusading zeal. She is already planning to appeal against Mr Justice Eady's decision to refuse her leave to appeal. She faces having to pay Brook's costs, though she says she has no money. The house is in her husband's name. \"I shall fight to clear my name by whatever means I can. The rest is in God's hands,\" she says. Gillick, now in her mid-50s, is committed to her work as a pregnancy counsellor on behalf of the anti-abortion group Life, and she runs a one-woman organisation called Inform, gathering statistics on contraception and pregnancy among young women, and monitoring the effects of the House of Lords ruling. \"I suppose I'm an old romantic. I still believe that if you present the facts, people will understand and take sensible action,\" she says, her voice deceptively soft and gentle. \"The free availability of contraception to young girls does not reduce underage pregnancy rates. It does encourage girls to think that sex is safe. Having been a voluntary pregnancy counsellor for nine years I now see at first hand how the policy is impacting on the young. \"I've seen children as young as 11 who have been put on the pill and they've forgotten to take it within a couple of weeks of being prescribed it. They are only children. Unfortunately children cannot take the pill consistently. Nor can they use condoms properly. The more youngsters that are trying to use contraceptives, the more likely we are to get pregnancies. \"I feel very, very sad for this younger generation who have been sold the line that sex is safe and just a form of recreation with no consequences. I think we are living in an age which is doing untold damage to women's reproductive health.\" And so on. As though she never went away. Which she didn't - despite the personal cost to herself and her family. \"I've been called everything under the sun, including teenage magazines calling me Mrs Pillock in the 80s. They were so cruel, really spiteful.\" Then there were the consequent pressures for her five sons and five daughters, who grew up in the glare of the media spotlight - thrust into the headlines themselves whenever they appeared to stray from the papers' perception of the Gillick straight and narrow. One daughter was spotted sunbathing topless on a beach to the delight of the tabloids; another had a baby out of wedlock. \"The distressing thing about that was the way they were pursued,\" says Gillick. \"It was difficult for them because of their high profile mother, but they don't resent me. \"The 80s were hard times for us as a family. If you are a mother who raises her head above the parapet you are always vulnerable. People who opposed me often said a woman who has children should not take on these issues, which I think is desperately unfair.\" She is now a grandmother with 16 grandchildren, aged between 11 and just a few weeks, and her children have thrived in their chosen careers, as sculptors and painters (one of her twins, Jim, painted Lady Thatcher's portrait), designers and cabinet makers This has been a particularly tumultuous year. In September, after 32 years of child-rearing, Gillick's youngest daughter left home - the last to fly the nest - to train as a teacher, leaving her and her artist husband, Gordon, rattling around their rambling house like a pair of dried beans in a tin. \"At first it felt very empty and peculiar,\" she says. \"Within a week Gordon and I were scampering around and thoroughly enjoying it.\" As far as the future is concerned, Gillick is happy to carry on swimming against the tide. \"They say that only dead fish swim with the tide. I don't want to be one of those dead bloaters.\"",

Whitehall has leaked to the Guardian five instances where civil servants in Brussels have been asked to feed Downing Street's strategic communications unit and the Foreign Office on \"lines to take\" on embarrassing tales of Britain appearing to be losing out to Europe. The unit, known as the Eurogrid, provides Alastair Campbell, the No 10 press secretary, with advance warning of damaging European commission and European parliament decisions which can put Britain in a bad light. The existence of the grid - which is prepared weekly for distribution by the Foreign Office - has been confirmed by Whitehall press officers in London and Brussels. It parallels a grid for domestic news, which sets the timing of government announcements. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, are embroiled in rows over the presentation of Britain's attitude towards Europe and the government is involved in large scale media planning for the European summit in Nice. The five instances where Downing Street has been reported to be alarmed about developments in Europe in the past year were a European directive demanding equal rights for gays and the disabled; the challenge from the commission about state aid to the Rover group; cuts to Britain's European Union regional aid by redrawing the UK aid map; new European rules on takeovers; and the scandal over allegations that Britain was giving away state secrets to the Americans on the Echelon spy comunications programme. According to Whitehall sources, Downing Street was alarmed that Britain would seen as being ordered by the EU to introduce equal legal rights for gays and the disabled and as being forced to replace the present code of practice. The row over the redrawing of the European regional aid map caused alarm in Downing Street because it would mean that Labour heartland areas and Labour and Liberal Democrat strongholds in Devon would be hit by the changes Similar concerns were expressed about the possibility of aid to Rover being stopped because Longbridge in Birmingham was a Labour seat. The advice sought over Echelon followed a row in the European parliament when the French accused the British of leaking secrets to the Americans. Last night John Redwood, Conservative MP for Wokingham and a former front bench industry spokesman, said: \"This is news management of the worst kind - by trying to deny or smother the existence of news that ought to be debated by both pro and anti Europeans.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago Noga Cohen's children escaped injury when a suicide bomber blew himself up near their school bus in the Gaza Strip. On Monday their luck failed Three of her seven children - a boy, Israel, seven, and two girls, Tehila, nine and Orit, 12 - were on their way to school from the Kfar Darom settlement when their bus was sprayed by shrapnel from a mortar shell fired by Palestinian militants. Israel lost a leg, Orit part of a foot, and Tehila was badly hurt in both legs. \"It looks like there are no more miracles,\" Mrs Cohen said as she waited at Soroka hospital in the Negev desert town of Beersheba for the doctors to say whether they would have to amputate Tehila's legs. Mrs Cohen, 32, and her husband Ofir, 33, have lived in Kfar Darom, a settlement of 250 families now surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas, for the past 10 years. Ideology brought the Cohens to Gaza. They wanted to claim some of the poverty-stricken strip, overcrowded by 1m Palestinians, for the Jewish people. The Cohens, who are among 6,500 settlers in Gaza, believe Gaza is part of Eretz Israel, the biblical land God promised to the Jews. Mrs Cohen said she had never imagined that she would have to pay such a heavy price \"for safeguarding our homeland\". The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, visited the Cohen children last night. \"These are children who will carry on their bodies, for the rest of their lives, the scars of this grave, criminal, barbaric act which we saw today,\" he said at a news conference at the hospital. The Cohen children, along with other youngsters and adults from Kfar Darom, boarded an armoured bus at about 7.30am yesterday for the 15-minute drive to their school in Gush Katif, a cluster of Jewish settlements in southern Gaza. About three minutes after the bus left the heavily guarded settlement a 155mm mortar shell exploded several dozen metres from the vehicle. Shrapnel tore holes into the right side of the bus, killing two adults on the spot. Nine passengers were wounded: the driver, three women and five children. Mr Cohen said that when he heard the explosion he raced to the main road, only to learn that his children had been taken to Soroka hospital. His daughter Orit, recovering in hospital after the amputation of part of her right foot, whispered \"It hurts, it hurts\" to her grandmother, watching over her. Even now, she said, she did not want to leave Kfar Darom. \"Then the Arabs would take it all.\" Israel, who lost part of a leg, was in the recovery room. His uncle Yaacov said the boy liked to rollerskate and play soccer. Mrs Cohen said Orit, who will turn 13 next month, was getting ready to mark her Bat Mitzva, the Jewish rite of passage into adulthood. The family had wondered whether to hold her party in Kfar Darom or a more accessible place. The bombing helped to make up her mind, she said. \"We decided it's dangerous everywhere, so we will do it in Kfar Darom.\" AP",

As the prosecution concluded its case, Pierre Salinger told the Scottish court in the Netherlands that he knew who was responsible for the bombing. Mr Salinger, former chief foreign correspondent at ABC News and press secretary to President Kennedy, was called as one of the crown's final witnesses only to offer testimony which appeared to undermine its case. The two Libyans accused of the biggest act of mass murder in British history, Abdelbaset Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, deny all charges relating to the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in which 270 people died on December 21, 1988. After the crown concluded its case yesterday, Richard Keen QC, counsel for Fhimah, indicated that he would ask for the charges faced by his client to be thrown out. But it is likely he will today seek an adjournment to prepare a submission that his client has no case to answer. William Taylor QC, for Megrahi, indicated that he would be seeking an adjournment to prepare his client's defence. Earlier yesterday, the presiding judge, Lord Sutherland, was forced to bring the trial to a halt as Mr Salinger insisted he wanted to tell the court who was responsible for the bombing. \"I know that these two Libyans had nothing to do with it. I know who did it and I know exactly why it was done,\" said the journalist, who was based at ABC's London office when the two accused were indicted in 1991. But, after lawyers had finished their questioning, Lord Sutherland asked Mr Salinger to leave the witness box as the journalist protested that he had not been given the opportunity to tell the truth. \"If you wish to make a point you may do so elsewhere but I'm afraid you may not do so in this court,\" said the judge. The two Libyans accused have lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming several Palestinian terrorist organisations - including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command - for the bombing.

      "bodyText": "A Royal Ulster Constabulary investigation into Bloody Sunday 28 years ago concluded that the first of the 13 civilians killed in the shooting was murdered by the army, the official inquiry into the Londonderry killings was told yesterday. Opening his submission for the families of the victims, Arthur Harvey QC said that no soldier was made accountable for the death of John \"Jack\" Duddy, 17, because the soldier could not be identified. Mr Harvey added that priests and journalists who witnessed the attack on the civil rights demonstration in Londonderry on January 30, 1972, \"all unanimously came to the conclusion that what they saw was unjustified shooting at unarmed people\". A film of Mr Duddy being carried dying through the streets with Father Edward Daly at the head of the rescuers, crouching and waving a white handkerchief became the iconic image of the day. Mr Harvey said: \"There is no explanation for the shooting ... and, indeed, the police investigation came to the conclusion that Jackie Duddy had been murdered.\" Referring to film footage, photographs and reporters' accounts, Mr Harvey said: \"When one looks independently at each of those pictures, it does tell a story, and all that one has to do is to use one's eyes and open one's mind to see it.\" Army gunfire directed towards one of the \"killing zones\" near the rubble barricade across Rossville Street was so intense that anyone there was bound to have been shot dead. Only one man survived after being shot there - Alexander Nash, who ran to the aid of his son, William, 19, who died in the street along with Michael Kelly, 17, Michael McDaid, 20, John Young, 17, Hugh Gilmour, 17, and Kevin McElhinney, 17. Mr Harvey said: \"The criss-cross of trajectories is such that anyone beyond that barricade at that time was likely to be killed.\" Mr Harvey said pictures showed that none was carrying guns or bombs - and yet the soldiers claimed that there were three riflemen, three nail bombers, one machine-gunner and three pistol men. Mr Harvey said more deaths remained unaccounted for including that of Jim Wray who had been shot in the back in Glenfada Park. He suggested that a soldier known as G, who is now dead , killed Mr Wray as well as two others, Gerald Donaghey and Gerard McKinney, in the neighbouring complex of Abbey Park. Mr Wray, 22, was calling out for help when he was shot \"despatched in a murderous way while was lay prone and injured\". Gerard McKinney \"had his arms up pleading for his life\". A bullet belonging to soldier G was recovered from the body of Gerald Donaghey. At the original Widgery inquiry in 1972, G was asked if he fired through the alleyway linking the two complexes. He was recorded in the transcript as answering \"yes\", but he was asked nothing else about it. \"The most peculiar thing about the cross-examinations ... is the simple fact that not one question was asked of Soldier G about the murder of Gerald Donaghey.\" The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "MI5 is being sued for bugging a car used by Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, security sources disclosed yesterday. A bugging and tracking device was found hidden in the roof of a Ford Mondeo carrying the two men at a highly sensitive time during the review of the Good Friday agreement last December. The owner of the car, understood to be the wife of Martin Lynch, who was convicted for arms offences in the early 1980s, is demanding exemplary damages for breach of privacy. Her lawyers originally planned to sue the Ministry of Defence in the belief that the bug was planted by military intelligence. They turned on MI5 when they discovered that agency was responsible. MI5 is vigorously contesting the claim for damages, defending its action under the 1994 Intelligence Services Act. It states: \"No entry on or interference with property ... shall be unlawful\" [in helping MI5 carry out its functions] if it is authorised by a warrant issued by the secretary of state\". In an unusual intervention - ministers rarely comment on security operations - Mo Mowlam, the former Northern Ireland secretary, admitted this summer that she had sanctioned the bugging to \"save lives\". She told BBC1's You Only Live Once in July: \"Lives were being lost. It was done to make sure we knew what was going on\". Sinn Fein described Ms Mowlam's admission as \"disappointing but not surprising\". Official sources say MI5's intention was to target Mr Lynch rather than Mr Adams or Mr McGuinness. Mr Lynch was convicted for arms offences after he was seriously injured when he was shot at by police in 1982. Police found weapons in a car. Last year's decision to place a large bugging device in the one-year-old Mondeo surprised independent security experts because of its audacity and risk of political fallout. The owner's suspicions were apparently aroused when the car was stopped by the RUC at a roadblock and the driver detained. Mr Adams described the bugging as a \"hugely serious breach of faith\" and accused the intelligence services of attempting to sabotage the peace process. The Mondeo had apparently been used regularly by Sinn Fein, suggesting that the party's counter-intelligence experts had been lulled into a false security by the developing peace process. In the past Sinn Fein leaders and the IRA have regularly switched cars to avoid detection.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, yesterday cancelled the capital's New Year's Eve celebrations leaving it as the only British city not officially marking the occasion. The mayor said he was \"caught between a rock and a hard place\" as the London Underground's reluctance to run services after 4pm meant commercial sponsors had pulled out fearing small crowds. Mr Livingstone declared that if the same \"negative atmosphere\" had prevailed at the time of the Blitz, \"we would have lost that battle as well\". London Underground had insisted that it could not cope with more than 1m revellers expected to converge on the capital on December 31. A fireworks display was moved to 5pm to help ease potential crowd congestion but the ever-changing programme had left sponsors nervous about backing the event. Emergency services said their safety plans could not be formalised without confirmation of the full details. Another use will now have to be found for approximately 500,000 fireworks which are being imported from India. Leeds, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cardiff have all unveiled plans which in some cases are being billed as parties to top the millennium while Edinburgh and Manchester will launch their festivities with similarly proud boasts in the coming days. Irish dancers, reggae artists, chart stars Daphne and Celeste, and Motown singer Edwin Starr will perform in a Countdown to Midnight concert in Birmingham's Centenary Square at the end of a day of public entertainment beginning with tea dances at the International Conference Centre. Cardiff will celebrate with three days of free entertainment beginning on December 30, featuring one of the Britain's largest winter fairgrounds and a twilight lantern procession starting at Cardiff Castle and ending in Coopers Field, Bute Park, with a 20-minute show of music and fireworks. In Glasgow, \"Scotland's second biggest Hogmanay\" will feature a Radio 1 dance party, and the Riverside Spectacular, a family-oriented music and pyrotechnics display at the city's Pacific Quay. Belfast will celebrate with an outdoor concert at the City Hall, and an indoor music performance at St George's market. There will also be a fireworks display. A new \u00a312m public space, the Millennium Square, will be opened to celebrate the new year in Leeds. Last year, Manchester celebrated with parties and performances featuring former Stone Roses singer Ian Brown, local DJs and fireworks displays. This year's celebrations will be unveiled next week. The millennium commission had earmarked \u00a31.5m for the London celebrations, and will now be looking at alternative ways to spend the money. A spokesman said that as a grant-giving body it did not have the power to run a new year's event. The capital's woes are expected to prompt an inquest which may point the finger at London Underground. Rock star Bob Geldof, whose Ten Alps company was contracted to produce the celebrations, called Mr Livingstone's efforts \"magnificent\", but said: \"The rail companies must take a huge part of the blame for this.\" Trevor Phillips, Greater London assembly chairman, said: \"People will want to know why, at this late stage, matters were not clear and had not been sorted out.

A source close to Mr Blunkett said extra funding for colleges came with an expectation that they would contribute to the local economy. \"The colleges play a very important part in the education system and yet that importance has gone without proper recognition for too long.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ministers are preparing to announce a major revamp of the new deal for the unemployed in the wake of meeting one of their five key manifesto pledges, to take 250,000 youngsters off the dole. Employment ministers hope to announce they have met the pledge next week. The announcement will trigger a wider political debate on the value of the new deal and the need to help the economically inactive into work. A more flexible new deal will be aimed at bringing over 1m people into contact with the labour market, including lone parents, the disabled and the older long term unemployed. The aim is to target the hard core unemployed, including tens of thousands put onto incapacity benefit in the 1980s. The labour force survey shows that as many as 800,000 who claim sickness and disability benefits actually want to work. As a first step, the education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, is considering requiring new incapacity benefit claimants to attend \"a work-focused interview\". At the same time the employment minister, Tessa Jowell, is determined to ensure the government reaps political benefit from its record of job creation - something the US Democrats conspicuously failed to do in the presidential elections. The government celebrated the creation of 1m extra jobs in the economy last summer with a press conference in Downing Street given by Tony Blair. A similar fanfare is planned for the new deal figures for the young unemployed. Officials say it is \"touch and go\" whether they meet the 250,000 target for the young unemployed this month, or at the end of December. Latest statistics published in October show that almost 245,000 18-24 year olds unemployed for six months or more have found work, just 5,000 short of the manifesto pledge. Critics claim 58,000 found work for less than 13 weeks and many of them would have work anyway. Ministers are confident that the announcement will be followed quickly by other achievements in job creation. Despite the surprise 3,500 rise on the unemployment count last week to 1.047m, the government expects to see this measure of unemployment fall below the politically sensitive 1m within four months, for the first time since the mid-70s. Ministers also hope that they will be able to claim Britain is becoming a full employment economy for the first time since the 60s. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, in his first full budget redefined full employment as 75% of the population of working age in jobs. At present, the figure stands at 74.7%, the second highest figure in Europe. The numbers in work, compiled on the basis of a rolling three month average, is increasing at a rate of 0.1% two or three months, suggesting Britain will reach the 75% target by the time of an election in late spring next year. Although the 75% figure, then measured annually, was reached in 1990, this temporary success was immediately followed by recession. Employment officials insist the chancellor wants to be able to project a sustained period of employment growth. The post-war peak in employment took place in 1974 when 75.7% of the working age population was in work. With the population of working age growing by 134,000 over the past year, employment will need to grow by an additional 110,000 to reach the 75% target. Key elements of the new deal mark two include from April next year transformation of the current employment service into a working age agency responsible for the administration of a much wider range of benefits. The agency will not simply be aimed at the unemployed, but all the economically inactive. Ministers are also providing tougher and longer procedures for those going through the new deal in a bid to ensure they stay in jobs longer. The 150,000 people aged 24 to 55 and unemployed for 18 months or more will be subject to the same sanctions regime as the young unemployed. They will be guaranteed a job or training place, and like those aged 16-24 could lose benefit for as long as 26 weeks if they break the sanctions regime three times. The government has already toughened the regime for 900,000 lone parents on income support by requiring them to attend initial job advice interviews, if their children are aged over five. The offer of training course or jobs will remain voluntary for the forseeable future. In two extensions of the scheme, lone parents with children as young as three will now be offered interviews. Help will also be extended to the 150,000 workless lone parents not on income support.

By early 1997, the firm was behind in performance league tables and losing accounts. But as analysts and journalists rushed to write them off, Pilgrim Baxter staged a remarkable recovery. Six of its nine growth funds returned more than 100% in 1999. Last year assets jumped from $13.1bn to $18.2bn. By the end of September, they had risen to $26bn, although this is thought to have fallen because of the downturn in the market for technology shares.",

      "body": "<p>For Ipswich, fifth place; for Coventry, five defeats in a row. Midway through two minutes of stoppage-time at the end of the game Fabian Wilnis, the Ipswich right-back, sneaked into the area and, as Paul Williams moved helpfully out of the way, dived to meet Martijn Reuser's cross and win the game. </p> <p> After dominating much of the match it was a harsh blow for Gordon Strachan's side, but such things happen when you are struggling against relegation. Coventry, by now, must know that. </p> <p> For all their possession they never offered much more than menace. Coventry flowed forward in the first half, frightening Ipswich with pace and willingness to run with the ball, but shooting opportunities were rare and, tellingly, frequently passed up in favour of over-elaboration. As the profligacy of Cedric Roussel and Craig Bellamy became apparent, the more dangerous-looking David Thompson came close to scoring, heading just over in the 83rd minute and hitting the bar with an astonishing 40-yard free-kick.

      "bodyText": "For Ipswich, fifth place; for Coventry, five defeats in a row. Midway through two minutes of stoppage-time at the end of the game Fabian Wilnis, the Ipswich right-back, sneaked into the area and, as Paul Williams moved helpfully out of the way, dived to meet Martijn Reuser's cross and win the game. After dominating much of the match it was a harsh blow for Gordon Strachan's side, but such things happen when you are struggling against relegation. Coventry, by now, must know that. For all their possession they never offered much more than menace. Coventry flowed forward in the first half, frightening Ipswich with pace and willingness to run with the ball, but shooting opportunities were rare and, tellingly, frequently passed up in favour of over-elaboration. As the profligacy of Cedric Roussel and Craig Bellamy became apparent, the more dangerous-looking David Thompson came close to scoring, heading just over in the 83rd minute and hitting the bar with an astonishing 40-yard free-kick.

      "byline": "Andrew Clements",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> <strong> Rihm and Lachenmann</strong><br> <strong> Huddersfield contemporary music festival **** </strong><br> </p> <p> Finding a successor to Richard Steinitz, who started Huddersfield's Contemporary Music Festival in 1978 and is stepping down as artistic director, will not be easy: Steinitz has unflaggingly nurtured the festival, until now it ranks with the best in Europe, and with almost saintly open-mindedness has encompassed the whole spectrum of new music in his programming. Consistently, too, Huddersfield has provided crucial opportunities to sample composers from both sides of the Atlantic whose music is otherwise hardly heard in Britain; thus the first weekend of this year's programme focused on Wolfgang Rihm and Helmut Lachenmann, pivotal figures in German music today. </p> <p>It is a piquant coupling. Each acknowledges the achievement of Luigi Nono, who died in 1990, yet each takes a very different slant on what it means. While the astonishingly prolific Rihm (born in 1952) celebrates the musical freedom with which Nono composed his late works, the polemical Lachenmann, 65 next week, studied with Nono in the late 1950s and took on not only his radical political agenda but also his rigorous approach to musical organisation, scrutinising the act of composition itself in ideologi cal terms. It makes Lachenmann's music hard to confront, and in a work such as the 1985 Ausklang, a monumental piece for piano and orchestra which Uli Wiget played with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Jac van Steen in Huddersfield Town Hall on Sunday, tough-going indeed. </p> <p>The precision of his aural imagination and subtlety of his gestures had been easier to grasp in a programme by the wonderful Ensemble Modern, conducted by Dominque My in St Paul's Hall earlier in the day. There was a delicate percussion solo Int\u00e8rieur I, from 1966 dazzlingly played by Rumi Ogawa-Helferich, and the substantial \"Zwei Gufuhle...\" Musik mit Leonardo from 1992. In the latter, a text by Leonard Da Vinci is atomised into syllables and delivered by a pair of narrators while the ensemble creates a dazzling patchwork of sounds, some conventionally produced, others obtained by striking, stroking or blowing unexpected parts of the instruments. The fragments of the text dissolve into the textures in a teasingly allusive way. </p> <p>It's all very different from Rihm's freewheeling approach. The BBC Symphony's programme coupled the Lachenmann with the superbly played British premiere of Rihm's latest big orchestral work, Vers une symphonie fleuve IV, a single movement of unstoppable momentum and power, which pays homage to the symphonic tradition yet finds territory of its own to explore too. </p> <p>The finest score of the weekend had been presented in solitary splendour on Saturday in the first of the Ensemble Modern's concerts; Rihm's Jagden und Formen is a 45-minute single-movement work, finished two months ago, of astonishing power and resource; as one idea slides into the next, and massive, heaving textures give way to the most delicate solos, the tension never slackens. </p> <p>Since the opening of the Lawrence Batley Theatre opera has become a feature of Huddersfield too, but this year's planned premiere, of John Casken's Tolstoy-based God's Liar had to be abandoned when funding collapsed. In its place came a production by the Toronto-based Autumn Leaf Company, of Claude Vivier's 1979 \"rituel de mort\" Kopernikus, which was staged at the Almeida Festival in 1985 but not seen in Britain since. For reasons that escape me, the French-Canadian Vivier (1940-83) is becoming a cult figure. Kopernikus and its mimsy story about a child's dreams and illusions, told in a mixture of nursery-speak and pseudo-philosophical posturing, is precious and ridiculous, while the naive charm of the score, heavily indebted to his teacher Stockhausen, wears thin very quickly indeed. </p> <p> Radio 3 will broadcast the BBC Symphony and the Ensemble Modern concerts over the next three weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rihm and Lachenmann Huddersfield contemporary music festival **** Finding a successor to Richard Steinitz, who started Huddersfield's Contemporary Music Festival in 1978 and is stepping down as artistic director, will not be easy: Steinitz has unflaggingly nurtured the festival, until now it ranks with the best in Europe, and with almost saintly open-mindedness has encompassed the whole spectrum of new music in his programming. Consistently, too, Huddersfield has provided crucial opportunities to sample composers from both sides of the Atlantic whose music is otherwise hardly heard in Britain; thus the first weekend of this year's programme focused on Wolfgang Rihm and Helmut Lachenmann, pivotal figures in German music today. It is a piquant coupling. Each acknowledges the achievement of Luigi Nono, who died in 1990, yet each takes a very different slant on what it means. While the astonishingly prolific Rihm (born in 1952) celebrates the musical freedom with which Nono composed his late works, the polemical Lachenmann, 65 next week, studied with Nono in the late 1950s and took on not only his radical political agenda but also his rigorous approach to musical organisation, scrutinising the act of composition itself in ideologi cal terms. It makes Lachenmann's music hard to confront, and in a work such as the 1985 Ausklang, a monumental piece for piano and orchestra which Uli Wiget played with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Jac van Steen in Huddersfield Town Hall on Sunday, tough-going indeed. The precision of his aural imagination and subtlety of his gestures had been easier to grasp in a programme by the wonderful Ensemble Modern, conducted by Dominque My in St Paul's Hall earlier in the day. There was a delicate percussion solo Int\u00e8rieur I, from 1966 dazzlingly played by Rumi Ogawa-Helferich, and the substantial \"Zwei Gufuhle...\" Musik mit Leonardo from 1992. In the latter, a text by Leonard Da Vinci is atomised into syllables and delivered by a pair of narrators while the ensemble creates a dazzling patchwork of sounds, some conventionally produced, others obtained by striking, stroking or blowing unexpected parts of the instruments. The fragments of the text dissolve into the textures in a teasingly allusive way. It's all very different from Rihm's freewheeling approach. The BBC Symphony's programme coupled the Lachenmann with the superbly played British premiere of Rihm's latest big orchestral work, Vers une symphonie fleuve IV, a single movement of unstoppable momentum and power, which pays homage to the symphonic tradition yet finds territory of its own to explore too. The finest score of the weekend had been presented in solitary splendour on Saturday in the first of the Ensemble Modern's concerts; Rihm's Jagden und Formen is a 45-minute single-movement work, finished two months ago, of astonishing power and resource; as one idea slides into the next, and massive, heaving textures give way to the most delicate solos, the tension never slackens. Since the opening of the Lawrence Batley Theatre opera has become a feature of Huddersfield too, but this year's planned premiere, of John Casken's Tolstoy-based God's Liar had to be abandoned when funding collapsed. In its place came a production by the Toronto-based Autumn Leaf Company, of Claude Vivier's 1979 \"rituel de mort\" Kopernikus, which was staged at the Almeida Festival in 1985 but not seen in Britain since. For reasons that escape me, the French-Canadian Vivier (1940-83) is becoming a cult figure. Kopernikus and its mimsy story about a child's dreams and illusions, told in a mixture of nursery-speak and pseudo-philosophical posturing, is precious and ridiculous, while the naive charm of the score, heavily indebted to his teacher Stockhausen, wears thin very quickly indeed. Radio 3 will broadcast the BBC Symphony and the Ensemble Modern concerts over the next three weeks.",

But almost half the employers thought this would be regarded as unfair by the rest of their staff. </p> <p>The government billed the survey as the first and largest research into work-life balance in Britain.

      "bodyText": "Workaholic habits are damaging productivity and playing havoc with families' attempts to improve their work-life balance, the government warned yesterday in the first official report on the social consequences of excessive overtime. One in nine full-time employees works more than 60 hours every week - mostly men with children. And one in eight regularly works both Saturdays and Sundays. The survey found most men wanted more flexible arrangements such as job-sharing and a reduced working week. But two-thirds thought working part time would damage their careers. Most women said they would rather work more flexibly after the birth of a child than have longer maternity leave. But almost half the employers thought this would be regarded as unfair by the rest of their staff. The government billed the survey as the first and largest research into work-life balance in Britain. It was based on interviews with 7,500 employees, 2,500 employers and 250 company head offices. Margaret Hodge, the equal opportunities minister, said the problem facing industry was not absenteeism but presenteeism. \"The long hours culture is alive and kicking ...

He points to the fact that 80% of motor insurers have already agreed to participate in the first study as proof. But as the results of the benchmarking will not be released to the public - consumers will only see a general report looking at standards across the industry - it is difficult to see why companies will care about their own score.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Consumer's Association said: \"The code goes someway towards setting standards for policyholders, but the issue of how the code is policed is a major concern.

Member companies will be asked to provide their own information on recent claims so the ABI can benchmark their performance against the code, but are under no obligation to co-operate. This begs obvious questions about how the code can be binding if companies don't have to release information on their compliance. The ABI's Malcolm Tarling said companies would want to provide the information of their own accord because getting a good benchmarking score would give them a competitive advantage. He points to the fact that 80% of motor insurers have already agreed to participate in the first study as proof. But as the results of the benchmarking will not be released to the public - consumers will only see a general report looking at standards across the industry - it is difficult to see why companies will care about their own score. A spokesperson for the Consumer's Association said: \"The code goes someway towards setting standards for policyholders, but the issue of how the code is policed is a major concern. I expect we'll have to wait and see what happens when claims written since the code's launch start coming in.\" Insurance Ombudsman Reidy Flynn agrees it will be some time before the code's effectiveness can be evaluated, but says she hopes it will work, helping to cut the number of complaints received by her office. Around 25% of the complaints that reach the Ombudsman relate to problems with the claims and administration procedures. The code requires that insurers deal fairly and promptly with you claims. More specifically it states that: \u0095 When a customer first makes a claim, they can expect a response and a response and action from the insurer within five working days \u0095 While a claim is being processed, the customer can expect replies to letters within 10 working days \u0095 Once a claim has been agreed, payment, repair or replacement should take place within 10 days \u0095 On making a written complaint, a customer can expect a written acknowledgement within five working days and a final response within 40.",
