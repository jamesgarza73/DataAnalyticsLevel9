But then if you ask about a fairer voting system they also say yes - indignant that parties elected on around 40% of the vote rule with absolute authority. If you suggest checks and balances or fundamental rights beyond the reach of politicians, they say yes again.</p> <p>This serious intellectual dilemma lies at the heart of all three constitutional issues. Many on the centre left have been wobbling since 1997. It looked so obvious in the days of the Thatcher dictatorship. Of course she should have been forced by PR into consensual politics by having to work with other parties in a rainbow-hued Commons of many parties and opinions. Of course a stronger second chamber should have saved us from the madness of the poll tax or the knee-jerk hysteria of Section 28 and dangerous dogs laws. Of course Europe offered the best protection against the worst outrages of Michael Howard. But now it's no longer quite so clear. Why share power when you can have it all?</p> <p>Why let go when we have one of the best governments in modern times? Listen to the Tories unseductive offer of cross-party agreement on the future funding of the NHS (letting the private sector take over by degrees) and wonder why any government should voluntarily share with the enemy. The enemy might be Schr1/3oder and Jospin demanding we impose unfavourable new taxes on the City. The enemy might be Lib Dems demanding tax rises for the ideological sake of it. Or the enemy might be a powerful House of Lords insisting that the ancient right to trial by jury is not diluted. Who needs all that aggravation? Why share more power with Europe, with other British parties or with a second chamber when you can keep it all yourself?</p> <p>In that recess of Tony Blair's brain where he keeps his `project', where he thinks about history and the new century, where he plans armageddon for the forces of conservatism, he believes that power should be better spread. But between the thought and the action falls the shadow. That shadow is the fierce opposition of many in his own party and his own cabinet. There is the even longer shadow of public opinion profoundly uninterested in constitutional reform - and when bounced, instinctively against change.</p> <p>Unlike France, Germany or Italy, in Britain there is scant tradition of intellectual debate in politics. The public is never invited to engage in serious thought about the nature of power, who holds it or where it should reside. No amount of David Blunkett's citizenship studies in schools will compensate for the dearth of deep discussion by our politicians. Lack of any debate about where power is best exercised for which function has let the Eurosceptics run away with public opinion. It's easy to frighten people about losing sovereignty when they have never had any discussion about who has it anyway. In living memory the rest of Europe has drawn up constitutions and amended them. We have just bumbled along hanging on to Black Rod and mumbling about tradition.</p> <p>And so Wakeham's report lands in a political wasteland. Who cares? A few anoraks and the Lib Dems. There was no great outcry when Labour caved in on its manifesto pledge: `The right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords will be ended by statute'. Nothing there about the 92 remaining - or about the right of any old hereditary to come and go as they please in the place and even to sit at the foot of the woolsack whenever they want to make trouble. These concessions were forced from the government under threat of losing two years' legislation. Presumably it didn't cross Labour 's mind that if they'd faced the old buffers down bravely the people would have risen up to support their government and chase the ermines away. No, the government has no great faith in the people. And that is why we shall not get a mainly elected second chamber.</p> <p>Yesterday's report on the Lords is full of good Wakehamisms - I particularly liked `radical evolutionary change' - and it does make an elegant case for doing as little as possible. It lays out the awkward problem of creating a carbon copy Commons, replicating the same old party-political debates with a tired second team. Wakeham says the public voiced their distaste for yet another group of politicians `banging on at each other' - they have a point. Consider what damage `checks and balances' have done to the US presidency: Clinton's health policy and all his best endeavours were wrecked by a hostile congress. There is a lot to be said for strong one-party government with one party to blame if they get it wrong. The report found that in most democracies the second chamber is a constant subject of complaint and criticism. So the question looks finely balanced.</p> <p>Oddly enough, it is not in the big idea but in the small print that Wakeham loses the argument. He takes his readers almost all the way on the undesirability of a wholly elected second chamber until we hit the old Churchill problem: `Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time'. Once it is revealed how the 500 great and good are to be selected, the game is up. The more elaborately explained, the more absurd it becomes. Eight Commissioners (three from the political parties) with the judgment of Solomon will miraculously conjure up a chamber of equal gender, representing every walk of life, reflecting exact regional and ethnic balance, plus all professions and occupations, plus a religious, moral and philosophical balance, not forgetting the lords of appeal in ordinary and all the bishops. All these must add up to an exact party political balance. (Get me a Lib Dem Catholic woman chartered accountant with one leg from Cardiff! Never mind what she's like!)</p> <p>It's impossible. Step by sensible step, somewhere along the way the commission lost the plot. I refer anyone who doubts it to chapter 15 - the Representation of Religious Faiths - because it is extremely funny. (The Rosicrucians have a pillar in the Dome's faith zone, do they get in here too?) Democracy has a lot going for it but if Labour doesn't think so they'd do better abolishing a second chamber altogether than creating this brand new anachronism.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Wakeham report goes straight to the heart of the big question - do we want any constitutional reform or are we happy as we are? If there are problems with how we are governed, are the alternatives worse? All the great issues of the day - Europe and the euro, proportional representation and now the role of the second chamber - depend on the single question: is one-party dictatorship in an all-powerful Commons the best of all possible governments? If you ask the people in that crude way the answer is mainly yes. They like `strong' government. But then if you ask about a fairer voting system they also say yes - indignant that parties elected on around 40% of the vote rule with absolute authority. If you suggest checks and balances or fundamental rights beyond the reach of politicians, they say yes again. This serious intellectual dilemma lies at the heart of all three constitutional issues. Many on the centre left have been wobbling since 1997. It looked so obvious in the days of the Thatcher dictatorship. Of course she should have been forced by PR into consensual politics by having to work with other parties in a rainbow-hued Commons of many parties and opinions. Of course a stronger second chamber should have saved us from the madness of the poll tax or the knee-jerk hysteria of Section 28 and dangerous dogs laws. Of course Europe offered the best protection against the worst outrages of Michael Howard. But now it's no longer quite so clear. Why share power when you can have it all? Why let go when we have one of the best governments in modern times? Listen to the Tories unseductive offer of cross-party agreement on the future funding of the NHS (letting the private sector take over by degrees) and wonder why any government should voluntarily share with the enemy. The enemy might be Schr1/3oder and Jospin demanding we impose unfavourable new taxes on the City. The enemy might be Lib Dems demanding tax rises for the ideological sake of it. Or the enemy might be a powerful House of Lords insisting that the ancient right to trial by jury is not diluted. Who needs all that aggravation? Why share more power with Europe, with other British parties or with a second chamber when you can keep it all yourself? In that recess of Tony Blair's brain where he keeps his `project', where he thinks about history and the new century, where he plans armageddon for the forces of conservatism, he believes that power should be better spread. But between the thought and the action falls the shadow. That shadow is the fierce opposition of many in his own party and his own cabinet. There is the even longer shadow of public opinion profoundly uninterested in constitutional reform - and when bounced, instinctively against change. Unlike France, Germany or Italy, in Britain there is scant tradition of intellectual debate in politics. The public is never invited to engage in serious thought about the nature of power, who holds it or where it should reside. No amount of David Blunkett's citizenship studies in schools will compensate for the dearth of deep discussion by our politicians. Lack of any debate about where power is best exercised for which function has let the Eurosceptics run away with public opinion. It's easy to frighten people about losing sovereignty when they have never had any discussion about who has it anyway. In living memory the rest of Europe has drawn up constitutions and amended them. We have just bumbled along hanging on to Black Rod and mumbling about tradition. And so Wakeham's report lands in a political wasteland. Who cares? A few anoraks and the Lib Dems. There was no great outcry when Labour caved in on its manifesto pledge: `The right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords will be ended by statute'. Nothing there about the 92 remaining - or about the right of any old hereditary to come and go as they please in the place and even to sit at the foot of the woolsack whenever they want to make trouble. These concessions were forced from the government under threat of losing two years' legislation. Presumably it didn't cross Labour 's mind that if they'd faced the old buffers down bravely the people would have risen up to support their government and chase the ermines away. No, the government has no great faith in the people. And that is why we shall not get a mainly elected second chamber. Yesterday's report on the Lords is full of good Wakehamisms - I particularly liked `radical evolutionary change' - and it does make an elegant case for doing as little as possible. It lays out the awkward problem of creating a carbon copy Commons, replicating the same old party-political debates with a tired second team. Wakeham says the public voiced their distaste for yet another group of politicians `banging on at each other' - they have a point. Consider what damage `checks and balances' have done to the US presidency: Clinton's health policy and all his best endeavours were wrecked by a hostile congress. There is a lot to be said for strong one-party government with one party to blame if they get it wrong. The report found that in most democracies the second chamber is a constant subject of complaint and criticism. So the question looks finely balanced. Oddly enough, it is not in the big idea but in the small print that Wakeham loses the argument. He takes his readers almost all the way on the undesirability of a wholly elected second chamber until we hit the old Churchill problem: `Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time'. Once it is revealed how the 500 great and good are to be selected, the game is up. The more elaborately explained, the more absurd it becomes. Eight Commissioners (three from the political parties) with the judgment of Solomon will miraculously conjure up a chamber of equal gender, representing every walk of life, reflecting exact regional and ethnic balance, plus all professions and occupations, plus a religious, moral and philosophical balance, not forgetting the lords of appeal in ordinary and all the bishops. All these must add up to an exact party political balance. (Get me a Lib Dem Catholic woman chartered accountant with one leg from Cardiff! Never mind what she's like!) It's impossible. Step by sensible step, somewhere along the way the commission lost the plot. I refer anyone who doubts it to chapter 15 - the Representation of Religious Faiths - because it is extremely funny. (The Rosicrucians have a pillar in the Dome's faith zone, do they get in here too?) Democracy has a lot going for it but if Labour doesn't think so they'd do better abolishing a second chamber altogether than creating this brand new anachronism.",

Though the panel agreed on a mainly appointed chamber, with a minority of regional members chosen by selection or election, it failed to reach consensus on the number and selection method of regional members and instead offers three options.</p> <p>After consultation and exploring options, the commission recommended a chamber of around 550 members - smaller than the unreformed house but not as small as many wished - with most appointed by an independent commission and a minority of between 65 and 195 to be elected or selected on a regional basis. Appointed members would serve for 15 year terms, and regional members for three electoral terms, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further period of up to 15 years.</p> <p>An honours list peerage would no longer mean a place in the upper chamber, and members of the upper house would no longer be known as peers.</p> <p>There would be an end to political patronage, the commission claimed, with the prime minister and government excluded from the appointments process ,and selection based on merit. The resulting house would be required to be broadly representative of British society, and would be free of domination by any one party, thanks to a statutory minimum proportion of crossbenchers. It would have to reflect the voting preferences of the electorate at the most recent general election.</p> <p><b> Appointed members</b><br> There should be a \"totally independent\" appointments commission, the report argued, with no association with the prime minister or government. It would appoint all members bar the regional members, lords of appeal, and representatives of the Church of England, and there would be no parliamentary approval of appointments.</p> <p>There would be eight members of the commission, each appointed according to the Nolan principles and serving a maximum of 10 years. Three would be nominees from the main political parties, one nominated by cross benchers, and four independents, of whom one should be the chairman.</p> <p>This commission would be responsible for keeping the proportion of independents, or cross benchers, at around a fifth of the chamber's membership. It would be obliged to encourage appointments and nominations from under-represented groups, and report regularly to parliament on gender balance and minority ethnic groups. Commissioners would be charged with a \"pro-active approach\" to finding appointees, and the commission would be expected to consoutvocational, professional, cultural, sporting and other bodies, as well as publish criteria for appointment.</p> <p>The panel, normally making appointments on a half-yearly cycle, would have a statutory duty to ensure that at least 30% of new members are women (and at least 30% men), with the aim of \"steady progress\" towards a 50:50 balance.</p> <p>Among the politically affiliated members, it would secure an overall balance matching the political opinion of the country as a whole, based on share of the vote (not seats won) at the last general election.</p> <p>According to the Wakeham commission, it should be impossible for any one party to secure a majority.</p> <p><b> Regional members</b><br> Three options are proposed. Under Model A, 65 members selected by dividing up a regional allocation of seats according to each party's share of the vote in that region at general elections; one third of the regions would select regional members at each general election.</p> <p>Model B (favoured by the majority of the commission) would see 87 members, directly elected at the time of each European parliament election according to PR similar to Euro elections.</p> <p>Model C would provide for 195 regional members directly elected at the time of each European parliament election.</p> <p><b> Existing life peers and hereditaries </b><br> Existing life peers should remain for life, the commission concluded, which means the new-look house reflecting every sector of society will be slow to be implemented; however, it predicted that only a handful of life peers will still be sitting in 20 years' time. The 92 remaining hereditaries would be dispensed with, but could return as appointees or regional members.</p> <p><b> Religious faiths </b><br> A large majority of the commission recommended that religious representation be \"broader and deeper\" than in the existing Lords. Though the Church of England should continue to be explicitly represented, so too should other Christian denominations and other faiths.</p> <p>The commission proposed 16 places for Anglican representatives, five for other Christian denominations in England, and five for Christian denominations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At least five more should be selected to be \"broadly representative\" of non-Christian faiths.</p> <p><b> Roles and powers</b><br> The commission concluded the current balance between the two houses is \"about right and should not be radically disturbed\".</p> <p>It argued that the Commons should retain final say in respect of all public policy, while the second chamber should have sufficient power and authority to require the government and the Commons to reconsider proposed legislation and take account of cogent objections to it.</p> <p>The chamber would retain the so-called \"suspensory veto\" set out in the parliament acts, giving it power to delay legislation but not permanently to block it. As now, the upper house would be unable to prevent the passage of a Commons bill backed by the Commons in two successive sessions of parliament.</p> <p>While maintaining its right to delay flawed legislation, the second chamber would however continue to be obliged to consider government business within a reasonable time, and to observe the \"Salisbury conventions\" - the underlying principles obeyed by peers. As now, it would respect legislation in a governing party's manifesto, and would be expected to be sensible in using its powers to challenge the will of MPs.</p> <p>The upper house would lose its absolute power to veto statutory instruments, on the grounds it was never used by peers. Instead, though the Commons would gain the final say, the chamber would gain more moderate but usable powers to delay, and demonstrate its concern about, specific statutory instruments.</p> <p><b> Making law</b><br> The commission argued there should be no significant changes in the law-making functions. However, to prevent bad legislation rushed through the house thanks to limited parliamentary time, the report argues for more pre-legislative scrutiny of draft bills. It also suggests the second chamber should look at how to speed up consideration of law reform bills drawn up by the law commission.</p> <p>In recognition of the growing volume of secondary legislation, the chamber should maintain and extend its power to scrutinise statutory instruments, the report said.</p> <p><b> Protecting the constitution</b> <br> The chamber's role in protecting the constitution should be \"maintained and enhanced\", the commission recommended.

      "bodyText": "The Wakeham commission's blueprint for the reformed House of Lords sets out the case for what it argues is \"radical evolutionary change which will contribute to better government for all\". Its 216-page report, A House for the Future, contains 132 recommendations that the commission claimed to be \"persuasive and intellectually coherent but also workable, durable and politically realistic\". If implemented, the document says, no new member of the second chamber would arrive there on the same basis as any existing member of the upper house. The royal commission proposes a second chamber of around 550 members - the majority of whom would be chosen by an independent appointments commission, and the rest drawn from the regions by selection or direct election. Members would no longer be known as peers, and those who have been made peers through the honours list would not be members. The composition of the chamber as a whole would be regularly adjusted to reflect the balance of political opinion within the country. There would also be targets to reflect more closely the UK's gender, ethnic and faith mix, with the goal of including members from all over the country and \"all walks of life\". The commission recommends the reformed chamber should be \"at least as powerful as the present House of Lords\" in providing a check upon the executive, with scope to examine human rights and constitutional issues. Its elected element should \"provide a voice\" for the UK's nations and regions. Overall the recommended upper house would be \"authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the United Kingdom\". Guide to the new power house Composition The make-up, in particular the balance between elected and appointed members, was the most significant and most contentious issue the commission had to consider. Though the panel agreed on a mainly appointed chamber, with a minority of regional members chosen by selection or election, it failed to reach consensus on the number and selection method of regional members and instead offers three options. After consultation and exploring options, the commission recommended a chamber of around 550 members - smaller than the unreformed house but not as small as many wished - with most appointed by an independent commission and a minority of between 65 and 195 to be elected or selected on a regional basis. Appointed members would serve for 15 year terms, and regional members for three electoral terms, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further period of up to 15 years. An honours list peerage would no longer mean a place in the upper chamber, and members of the upper house would no longer be known as peers. There would be an end to political patronage, the commission claimed, with the prime minister and government excluded from the appointments process ,and selection based on merit. The resulting house would be required to be broadly representative of British society, and would be free of domination by any one party, thanks to a statutory minimum proportion of crossbenchers. It would have to reflect the voting preferences of the electorate at the most recent general election. Appointed members There should be a \"totally independent\" appointments commission, the report argued, with no association with the prime minister or government. It would appoint all members bar the regional members, lords of appeal, and representatives of the Church of England, and there would be no parliamentary approval of appointments. There would be eight members of the commission, each appointed according to the Nolan principles and serving a maximum of 10 years. Three would be nominees from the main political parties, one nominated by cross benchers, and four independents, of whom one should be the chairman. This commission would be responsible for keeping the proportion of independents, or cross benchers, at around a fifth of the chamber's membership. It would be obliged to encourage appointments and nominations from under-represented groups, and report regularly to parliament on gender balance and minority ethnic groups. Commissioners would be charged with a \"pro-active approach\" to finding appointees, and the commission would be expected to consoutvocational, professional, cultural, sporting and other bodies, as well as publish criteria for appointment. The panel, normally making appointments on a half-yearly cycle, would have a statutory duty to ensure that at least 30% of new members are women (and at least 30% men), with the aim of \"steady progress\" towards a 50:50 balance. Among the politically affiliated members, it would secure an overall balance matching the political opinion of the country as a whole, based on share of the vote (not seats won) at the last general election. According to the Wakeham commission, it should be impossible for any one party to secure a majority. Regional members Three options are proposed. Under Model A, 65 members selected by dividing up a regional allocation of seats according to each party's share of the vote in that region at general elections; one third of the regions would select regional members at each general election. Model B (favoured by the majority of the commission) would see 87 members, directly elected at the time of each European parliament election according to PR similar to Euro elections. Model C would provide for 195 regional members directly elected at the time of each European parliament election. Existing life peers and hereditaries Existing life peers should remain for life, the commission concluded, which means the new-look house reflecting every sector of society will be slow to be implemented; however, it predicted that only a handful of life peers will still be sitting in 20 years' time. The 92 remaining hereditaries would be dispensed with, but could return as appointees or regional members. Religious faiths A large majority of the commission recommended that religious representation be \"broader and deeper\" than in the existing Lords. Though the Church of England should continue to be explicitly represented, so too should other Christian denominations and other faiths. The commission proposed 16 places for Anglican representatives, five for other Christian denominations in England, and five for Christian denominations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At least five more should be selected to be \"broadly representative\" of non-Christian faiths. Roles and powers The commission concluded the current balance between the two houses is \"about right and should not be radically disturbed\". It argued that the Commons should retain final say in respect of all public policy, while the second chamber should have sufficient power and authority to require the government and the Commons to reconsider proposed legislation and take account of cogent objections to it. The chamber would retain the so-called \"suspensory veto\" set out in the parliament acts, giving it power to delay legislation but not permanently to block it. As now, the upper house would be unable to prevent the passage of a Commons bill backed by the Commons in two successive sessions of parliament. While maintaining its right to delay flawed legislation, the second chamber would however continue to be obliged to consider government business within a reasonable time, and to observe the \"Salisbury conventions\" - the underlying principles obeyed by peers. As now, it would respect legislation in a governing party's manifesto, and would be expected to be sensible in using its powers to challenge the will of MPs. The upper house would lose its absolute power to veto statutory instruments, on the grounds it was never used by peers. Instead, though the Commons would gain the final say, the chamber would gain more moderate but usable powers to delay, and demonstrate its concern about, specific statutory instruments. Making law The commission argued there should be no significant changes in the law-making functions. However, to prevent bad legislation rushed through the house thanks to limited parliamentary time, the report argues for more pre-legislative scrutiny of draft bills. It also suggests the second chamber should look at how to speed up consideration of law reform bills drawn up by the law commission. In recognition of the growing volume of secondary legislation, the chamber should maintain and extend its power to scrutinise statutory instruments, the report said. Protecting the constitution The chamber's role in protecting the constitution should be \"maintained and enhanced\", the commission recommended. One of the most important functions should be to act as a \"constitutional long-stop\", ensuring changes are made to the consitution only with full debate and a clear idea of the consequences. A restriction on further amendments to the parliament acts would reinforce the right of the upper house to veto any bill to extend the life of a parliament - preventing any government voting itself into permanent power. The chamber would gain no extra powers over constitutional or human rights issues or legislation, but would set up a constitutional committee to scrutinise constitutional implications of all legislation. There would also be a human rights committee to look at bills with such implications.With the imminent implementation of the 1998 human rights act, the report points out, parliament will need such a scrutiny procedure. Representing the nations and regions Whatever future developments in devolution or decentralisation, the chamber should \"give a voice\" to people from throughout the United Kingdom, the commission said. Under proposals for a minority of elected members, the reformed house would have representatives from all over the UK, but these would not be drawn from the devolved administrations, or from the Scottish parliament and the other devolved assemblies. However, the report stressed that the reformed chamber should not become a \"federal legislature\" supporting a \"federal government\", nor a forum for liasion be tween the government and the executives of the devolved Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The house would not meet outside London, but some committees could meet in regional centres \"from time to time\". Holding the government to account The commission argued that ministers should continue to be drawn from, and be directly accountable to, the second chamber. It recommended increasing ministerial accountability by requiring senior ministers based in the Commons to make statements to and take questions from second chamber committees when appropriate. There should be more scrutiny of ministers' handling of European Union business, with additional resources for the European Union committee. Though British MEPs would not be represented in the chamber, it should promote greater cooperation between MEPs and parliament. More broadly, the commission recommended that the chamber continue to be \"a relatively non-polemical forum for national debate\", and that specialist committee work, drawing on the broad spread of expertise held by members, should continue. It also proposes a committee to scrutinise treaties laid before parliament and to draw attention to any implications which might deserve consideration by parliament before the treaties are ratified. The law lords The commitee was asked to judge whether the chamber should continue to carry out judicial functions through committees of law lords. It concluded that, as long as certain basic conventions were observed, there was no reason to change the present arrangements. The report argued there were advantages in having senior judges in the legislature where they could be made aware of social developments and political balances that underlay most legislation. However, in the light of controversy over the law lords' vote on the case of General Pinochet (which threw up concerns over the failure of one law lord involved in the judgment to declare his association with the human rights pressure group Amnesty International) the commission proposed requiring lords of appeal to set out in writing and publish a statement of the principles they intended to observe when participating in debates and votes and when considering their eligibility to sit on related cases. Characteristics The commission concluded that, taking account of its role and functions, the chamber should \"above all, be authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the whole of British society\". Its members, according to the report, should have a breadth of experience and expertise outside the world of politics; particular skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment of constitutional and human rights issues; personal distinction; and the ability to bring a philosophical, moral or spiritual perspective and freedom from party domination. Nevertheless, though authoritative, the reformed second chamber should not challenge the ultimate democratic authority of the Commons. Titles and pay The commission concludes that, since the link between the honours list and the Lords would be broken, members of the upper chamber would no longer be known as peers. It floated the options of using the suffix LP (for Lord/Lady of Parliament) or the title senator, but made no recommendation. The report also stopped short of proposing a name for the second chamber, concluding that both titles \"should be left to evolve\". The commission proposed increasing the remuneration received by members of the second chamber to ensure they were able to afford to attend from all over the country and not only from the south-east of England. It argued that a clear link should be made between attendance and financial support, so that those who wished to devote significant time to parliamentary duties could afford to do so - without subsidising those who had a career and attended less frequently.",

      "bodyText": "Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, [leader of the opposition PSOE], said today [on Canal Sur Radio] that political groups \"must react democratically and in unison\" against ETA. ? \"We must not allow this subject to become part of the electoral debate, and we must remain united.\" He also expressed his hope that the PNV and EH \"speak out against violence, because nationalists are very important when they're on the side of the democrats, but if they hesitate about whose side they're on, they become an instrument of fracture, and attempt to find arguments for killers.\" El Pais Rafael Hernando, spokesman for the ruling Partido Popular condemned the murder and said that \"the only culprit is ETA, and the political wing of ETA, Herri Batasuna. He re-affirmed \"the confidence which the PP has in the State's security forces in their struggle agianst the criminal terrorism of ETA\" and expressed the repulsion he felt at \"the savage methods used by these psychopaths? Those responsible for this outrage are going to end up paying for it\" ABC Ruiz Gallard\u00f3n, President of the Autonomous Community of Madrid, talking to Spanish national radio RNE \"The most important values we can display at these times are calm and a fighting unity among all political forces, above ideas and territorial claims, since we all share a conception of what a person is - and according to that conception, the thought that it is permissible to take someone's life for a political objective is truly sickening.\" PNV (Basque Nationalist Party) MP Jos\u00e9 Juan Gonz\u00e1lez de Txabarri Also on RNE \"For us, this murder is a failure on all our parts, a failure of sorts of strategies, the strategies of some and the strategies of others. Now, in the heat of the moment, everyone will be looking for someone to blame ? Now more than ever we must underline that the only people to blame in these situations are the terrorists themselves. Perhaps the voice that should sound most clearly and most insistently today is that of the MPs of Herri Batasuna [ETA's political wing] ? making it clear to ETA that we can't go on like this, and that this must be the last time. ETA and HB are preaching abstention in this electoral campaign ? they have been active in the campaign in the only way in which they should have abstained.\" Miguel Sanz, President of the Government of Navarra Diario de Navarra Sanz pointed out that \"the democratic parties must respond to the demands of society\" and emphasised that \"PNV and EA [Basque nationalist parties] are also to be counted\" among these. He reproached both parties for the \"equidistance\" they keep between \"what they call the immobility of the central government and the ETA's attitude after calling an end to the ceasefire? They will have to make a public declaration that they were wrong. The president of the PP in the Basque Country, Carlos Iturgaiz, said that the members of the terrorist group are \"University Professors in doing harm to the Spanish people? I ask the Basque Government and the lehendakari [Basque first minister] Ibarretxe not to give one more second of political support to Herri Batasuna. Ibarretxe and the PNV cannot co-operate for a second longer with these murderers.\" ABC",

So when a senior academic in the field puts his hands in the air and acknowledges that the industry has missed a trick, it\u00cds time to pay attention. </p> <p>Over the past 10 years the MBA market has expanded massively both in this country and abroad, breeding a new race of management technocrats, whose salaries are measured in telephone numbers and who can downsize a multinational in a matter of minutes.

A distance learning MBA is often a long, hard and lonely road, so the prospect of meeting up with other students can act as a great stimulus. Working on your own for weeks on end can make your enthusiasm wane. On average, I devoted about three evenings a week, plus a whole day over the weekend, to my studies \u0084 maybe 20 hours in all. The sheer quantity of research was something of a surprise, especially the breadth of reading required for a subject like strategic management. But, on the whole, the programme was much as I expected because the induction process was very thorough and gave a very accurate account of what to look forward to. I particularly enjoyed the module on the international business environment, which covered topics such as the problems of dealing with subsidiary companies in different countries. I chose to do my project on the management of learning groups and undertook some research-based experiments involving about 100 fire officers. Some of the findings have since been adopted by the Fire Service College on programmes such as its divisional command course. There is no doubt that the MBA has helped me progress to principal officer level \u0084 it's an important qualification to have on your CV. Much of the MBA programme was about interacting with others on the course, and any future students should make sure they capitalise on that element from the very start.",

      "bodyText": "The government effectively abandoned any pretence of maintaining an ethical foreign policy yesterday when it confirmed it will give the go-ahead for the sale of spare parts for Hawk fighter jets to Zimbabwe. The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, at a Downing Street briefing, insisted there was a commercial obligation to stand by contracts in all but \"extreme circumstances\". He said that if the contract was revoked, the taxpayer would have to foot the bill for the compensation involved. The Guardian disclosed yesterday that Tony Blair had sanctioned the supply of spares for BAE Systems Hawk jet fighters being used by Zimbabwe in the Congolese civil war. Facing a mountain of criticism from inside the Labour party and out, Mr Campbell spelled out what the government meant by an ethical foreign policy. \"Our export criteria do not say, and have never said, you cannot export to countries involved in conflicts. What they do say is you cannot export any equipment that might be used for external aggression,\" he said. But Zimbabwe, which has 7,000 troops, is involved in external aggression by playing a major part in keeping alive the conflict in Congo and destabilising the entire region. President Robert Mugabe also stands accused of widespread human rights abuses inside Zimbabwe - a breach of the ethical foreign policy guidelines set out by Labour after the general election which Mr Campbell pointedly failed to mention. Labour figures such as Donald Anderson, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, and Glenys Kinnock, the Euro MP, joined in widespread condemnation of the sale. Other Labour figures, such as Martin O'Neill, the Labour chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, which has been investigating how Britain funds the arms trade, adopted a more cautious approach, stressing the needs of the British defence industry. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who privately opposed the sale to Zimbabwe, yesterday loyally supported the new government line while on a visit to Egypt. Echoing Mr Campbell, Mr Cook implied the government's hands had been tied by the previous Tory administration, which had given the go-ahead for the sale of the Hawks in the 1980s. He said: \"We have inherited a commitment from the sale of the Hawks to Zimbabwe which is a commitment to continue to provide spare parts. \"That was suspended for a while during the fighting. We are now in a position in which there is no fighting and there is progress on the peace track.\" But Mr Cook's assertion that fighting had stopped is contradicted by several recent reports from the Zimbabwean government of battles raging in eastern Congo. The Zimbabwean army triumphantly reported last week that it had broken the siege of the eastern town of Ikela, where some 2,000 troops had been trapped. The Hawks are important to Zimbabwe's war effort. Reports from Harare have thrown up doubts about the continued airworthiness of some of the planes, which explains the desperation for the spare parts. Questions remain over how Zimbabwe, which is near bankruptcy, will pay for the spares, which are estimated at \u00a35m to \u00a310m. Sales of British arms are usually underwritten by the government's export credits guarantee department, which said yesterday Zimbabwe had just paid the last instalment on the Hawks. Zimbabwe defaulted on \u00a31.7m in loans from the department but a spokesman said Harare had since paid back \u00a31m.",

The Labour chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, Donald Anderson, who is normally restrained in his criticism of the government, said he understood the need for British companies to meet contractual obligations, but added that in this case he thought the supply of spare parts should not be resumed. He described the Congo war as futile and considered export inappropriate on the eve of peace talks at the UN. In an indication of the extent to which the decision has divided the Labour party, Glenys Kinnock, the Labour Euro MP and wife of the former Labour leader, expressed concern that the sales could contribute to \"exacerbating the tragic misery caused by the Congo conflict\". She said it was untenable and incomprehensible that the British government should assist the president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, in waging a war when his country was in such severe economic difficulty. She also questioned whether the decision might put Britain in breach of the European code on arms exports.

Every one knows it is almost bankrupt and defaulting on loans and, in the circumstances, we should not only withhold the Hawk spares but any parts.\" Rachel Harford of the pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \"It is lamentable that ultimately the buck stops with a prime minister who feels more obligation to do the bidding of arms companies than to uphold any commitment to human rights. \"He is enabling Zimbabwe to continue its military campaign by providing components for Hawk aircraft. \"We are now witness to several occasions when the prime minister has intervened personally on behalf of his powerful friends in the arms industry. \"This is at the cost of exacerbating division in his own government, creating embarrassment on the world stage for the UK, but most importantly fuelling conflict in war regions and aiding the abuse of human rights in Indonesia, the Congo, and several other countries.\" The case for and against The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell \"The supply of Hawk spares is covered by a contract approved by the last government before the war in the Congo started. \"Such contracts can only be revoked in extreme circumstances. The taxpayer would be liable for compensation to be paid and [it would] undermine the credibility of British contractors and British suppliers. \"Our export criteria do not say, and have never said, you cannot export to countries involved in conflicts. What they do say is you cannot export any equipment that might be used for external aggression.\" Donald Anderson, Labour chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee \"My judgment, certainly on the reports we have had thus far, is that there should be delay, for this reason - at the moment, Zimbabwe is involved in a futile foreign war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"Over 10,000 soldiers are involved. There are going to be peace talks, brokered by the US, starting on Monday. Now is not the time to supply those spare parts. \"Certainly my judgment is that it would be wrong to resume the supply of spare parts at this time.\"",

      "body": "<p>The incoming director-general of the BBC, Greg Dyke, yesterday averted a row which threatened to overshadow his first week in the job by bowing to increasing pressure to sell his shares in Granada. But he insisted it was entirely his own decision. </p> <p>Mr Dyke, who takes over formally on January 31, disposed of his \u00a36m holding because he did not want his early days as director-general to be dominated by controversy, he said in a statement. </p> <p>Sources close to Mr Dyke added that he had been unwilling to comply with demands that he sell in case it seemed he had acted unethically. </p> <p>The Conservative culture spokesman, Peter Ainsworth, earlier this week accused Mr Dyke of a conflict of interest by holding shares in a rival television company. </p> <p>By pre-empting a meeting of the BBC board of governors due to be held next week, Mr Dyke has avoided being compelled to sell his holding. Although he had a written agreement with the governors that he would have until April to dispose of his various shareholdings, several were reported to feel that circumstances had changed significantly. </p> <p>Last night a BBC spokesman confirmed that the governors had been informed of Mr Dyke's action and emphasised that they were \"pleased\" that he would be able to carry on unencumbered by any further embarrassment. </p> <p>Calls for Mr Dyke to sell more promptly arose when the outgoing director-general, Sir John Birt, announced he would depart at the end of next week to take up a peerage, leaving his successor to take control two months earlier than planned. </p> <p>The BBC code of ethics requires senior executives to declare and, where appropriate, relinquish any shareholdings which represent a conflict of interest. </p> <p>The former BBC chairman, Lord Hussey, said earlier this week that one of his first acts on being appointed to the BBC was to sell all his shares in a commercial radio station. The chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, also sold millions of pounds worth of shares in Granada on joining the corporation. </p> <p>Mr Dyke, whose personal wealth is estimated at \u00a314m, declared several different shareholdings to the BBC board of governors during the appointment process, including stakes in Manchester United Football Club, Carlton Communications and Pearson which have all since been sold. </p> <p>He said: \"I have not sold these shares because I was asked to do so by the BBC, nor because I have in any way behaved unethically. I have scrupulously followed the terms of the agreement I reached with the BBC when I was appointed last June.\" </p> <p>Mr Ainsworth, who wrote to Sir Christopher to protest about Mr Dyke's shares, said: \"I am delighted that Greg Dyke has sold his shares but sorry that it took so much prompting to get him to do so. All in all it adds up to a pretty rocky start. I hope things get better from now on.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The incoming director-general of the BBC, Greg Dyke, yesterday averted a row which threatened to overshadow his first week in the job by bowing to increasing pressure to sell his shares in Granada. But he insisted it was entirely his own decision. Mr Dyke, who takes over formally on January 31, disposed of his \u00a36m holding because he did not want his early days as director-general to be dominated by controversy, he said in a statement. Sources close to Mr Dyke added that he had been unwilling to comply with demands that he sell in case it seemed he had acted unethically. The Conservative culture spokesman, Peter Ainsworth, earlier this week accused Mr Dyke of a conflict of interest by holding shares in a rival television company. By pre-empting a meeting of the BBC board of governors due to be held next week, Mr Dyke has avoided being compelled to sell his holding. Although he had a written agreement with the governors that he would have until April to dispose of his various shareholdings, several were reported to feel that circumstances had changed significantly. Last night a BBC spokesman confirmed that the governors had been informed of Mr Dyke's action and emphasised that they were \"pleased\" that he would be able to carry on unencumbered by any further embarrassment. Calls for Mr Dyke to sell more promptly arose when the outgoing director-general, Sir John Birt, announced he would depart at the end of next week to take up a peerage, leaving his successor to take control two months earlier than planned. The BBC code of ethics requires senior executives to declare and, where appropriate, relinquish any shareholdings which represent a conflict of interest. The former BBC chairman, Lord Hussey, said earlier this week that one of his first acts on being appointed to the BBC was to sell all his shares in a commercial radio station. The chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, also sold millions of pounds worth of shares in Granada on joining the corporation. Mr Dyke, whose personal wealth is estimated at \u00a314m, declared several different shareholdings to the BBC board of governors during the appointment process, including stakes in Manchester United Football Club, Carlton Communications and Pearson which have all since been sold. He said: \"I have not sold these shares because I was asked to do so by the BBC, nor because I have in any way behaved unethically. I have scrupulously followed the terms of the agreement I reached with the BBC when I was appointed last June.\" Mr Ainsworth, who wrote to Sir Christopher to protest about Mr Dyke's shares, said: \"I am delighted that Greg Dyke has sold his shares but sorry that it took so much prompting to get him to do so. All in all it adds up to a pretty rocky start. I hope things get better from now on.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> Jemima Fitzgerald </strong> shops from a remote island <br> </p> <p>It's grim up north. Well, it is when it comes to clothes shopping. There are chain stores in abundance, but not a Pineal Eye, Tokio or Voyage in sight (and don't say Harvey Nichols in Leeds, I don't live near Leeds). So imagine my delight when I heard that trendier-than-thou, London-based Browns has a new website. Hurrah - I can be truly fashionable and live in the Shetlands. </p> <p>What I want, what I really, really want, is a pair of brown and white slippers-cum-shoes, seen on everyone worth their salt. Logging on is easy: <a href=\"http://www.brownsfashion.com\">www.brownsfashion.com</a>. Immediately I am faced with not only my dream slippers but Cambodian silk cushions, Miu Miu trainers and oh my God a Fendi baguette bag. </p> <p>I click the \"buy\" button for the slippers and fill in my details. In five minutes, I get an email confirming my request, then in an hour a call taking my Switch number and saying I'll have my slippers in three days. And I do. Hurrah! I kiss the postman and try them on. Damn. I am a size four. I got a four, but they don't fit. Apparently they come up small. Don't you think someone should have told me? Don't you think it a vital detail for someone in the Shetlands? </p> <p>Anyway they are nice and apologetic, and once I have sent the four back, they send me size five. I have to pay for postage to London, then wait a week, but it's worth it when you love a pair of slippers this much. Now, about that baguette bag ... </p> <p><strong> Jess Cartner-Morley </strong> seeks inspiration </p> <p>Call me a dinosaur throwback, but I like shopping. At 5 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, there is no sweeter sound than the rustle of tissue paper in a carrier bag. But that does not mean I have any desire to spend unproductive afternoons trawling miserably from shop to shop, feeling too hot in my winter coat, buying something that's, say, a six out of 10 and going home exhausted. No sirree. I wouldn't dream of going shopping without a picture in my mind of exactly what I'm looking for. I don't do browsing, just search, pay and go. </p> <p>Shopping success is all in the preparation and this, I reasoned, is where the net would come in handy: it is an unbeatable tool for finding oddball reference material. Designers are renowned for coming up with the weirdest \"inspirations\" for their collections: no catwalk show is complete without a statement from the designer explaining that the clothes represent \"Jackie O meets Snow White\" or \"Grace Kelly in Ibiza\". Which can sorely test your knowledge of the details of sartorial history. </p> <p>Deciding to start with something simple, I set about looking for pictures of three women who were clearly a major inspiration for two of the most influential Paris shows for spring/summer: Charlie's Angels. Both Louis Vuitton and Celine showed visored, lip-glossed, deep-tanned looks that had the theme tune running through the minds of the audience straight away, so swotting up on the look is clearly essential. The hair, of course, everyone knows, but the rest is surprisingly hazy. I think maybe one of them had a red satin blouson jacket - but that might have been my mum. And did they really wear white jeans, or is my memory playing tricks on me after all the white denim at Chloe? </p> <p>I started with the lazy option, simply typing in <a href=\"http://www.charliesangels.com\">www.charliesangels.com</a>. This turns out to be a fan site, Angelic Heaven Online. There are just a few pictures, including one of Jaclyn Smith in jodhpurs, which just shows what a selective memory I have. But a link to the official Sony site (<a href=\"http://www.spe.sony.com/\">www.spe.sony.com</a>) comes up trumps with no fewer than 49 pictures of the girls. In a few moments, I've got the Charlie's Angels look sorted. I think we can safely bypass the shirt-and-jacket wide-lapel fest, but those tight jeans are perfect. As are the chiffon scarves, which I'd forgotten about but which tie in beautifully with Prada's new bourgeois chic. Now I'm ready for some real shopping.</p> <p><strong> Peter Lyle </strong> looks for obscure trainers <br> </p> <p>Tired of the superior attitudes of snooty friends in reissued trainers, I had a simple task: find vintage tennis shoes from the early 80s. </p> <p>First stop was the British version of vast online auctioneer ebay (<a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk\">www.ebay.co.uk</a>). After miserable results, I headed to the American HQ (<a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\">www.ebay.com</a>) where I knew there would be more lots, more trainer freaks, more clarity around what to key in (\"sneakers\"). I clicked through to \"Kev's WORN shoes\". Not only were the pair of Adidas in question too modern and for running, they were also \"far less clean than they look in the picture\". I felt unable to top the existing best bid of $9.95. </p> <p>The next pair that caught my eye, a nice pair of old Nikes, came with the affectionate comment: \"They may smell of cats.\" I moved on. Vintage USA ( <a href=\"http://www.vintageusa.com\">www.vintageusa.com</a>) specialise in classic trainers, so navigating the site is easier. Plus the product looks cleaner (and dearer). Still no Adidas Stan Smiths, though. I follow a link to Shoe Trends ( <a href=\"http://www.shoetrends.com\">www.shoetrends.com</a>), but find the site entirely dedicated to the sale and study of Nike culture, so I go back to ebay. Each lot's deadline countdown clock adds an air of risk to browsing and the thrill of watching, waiting and wondering whether to bid or wait for a better lot to turn up has become addictive. Those Stan Smiths haven't turned up, but I'm sure, if I'm here for five more minutes, they will ... </p> <p><strong> Ruby Singh </strong> buys an outsize bra <br> </p> <p> The mission: to buy a bra for the larger lady, ill-served by the choice on offer in British department stores. And to buy it in half an hour. First stop: the altavista search engine. Type in \"very large bras\". Wait three minutes, then get bored. Exit to new window. Decide to \"make up\" bra website addresses in the hope that they're accurate. <a href=\"http://www.charnos.co.uk\">www.charnos.co.uk</a> isn't up and running yet; <a href=\"http://www.triumph.co.uk\">www.triumph.co.uk</a> throws up a motorbike website and <a href=\"http://www.janetreger.co.uk\">www.janetreger.co.uk</a> suggests you contact the store by telephone - hardly the point of a website. </p> <p>Try altavista again, this time opting for \"clothing and accessories\". This offers the Victoria's Secret website (<a href=\"http://www.victoriassecret.com\">www.victoriassecret.com</a>). Excellent, I think: a chance to find a broader range of bras not available in Britain. Opt to search \"by bra size\" and am told my search \"found 17 bras in 40DD\". Click on option to view said bras.

      "bodyText": "Jemima Fitzgerald shops from a remote island It's grim up north. Well, it is when it comes to clothes shopping. There are chain stores in abundance, but not a Pineal Eye, Tokio or Voyage in sight (and don't say Harvey Nichols in Leeds, I don't live near Leeds). So imagine my delight when I heard that trendier-than-thou, London-based Browns has a new website. Hurrah - I can be truly fashionable and live in the Shetlands. What I want, what I really, really want, is a pair of brown and white slippers-cum-shoes, seen on everyone worth their salt. Logging on is easy: www.brownsfashion.com. Immediately I am faced with not only my dream slippers but Cambodian silk cushions, Miu Miu trainers and oh my God a Fendi baguette bag. I click the \"buy\" button for the slippers and fill in my details. In five minutes, I get an email confirming my request, then in an hour a call taking my Switch number and saying I'll have my slippers in three days. And I do. Hurrah! I kiss the postman and try them on. Damn. I am a size four. I got a four, but they don't fit. Apparently they come up small. Don't you think someone should have told me? Don't you think it a vital detail for someone in the Shetlands? Anyway they are nice and apologetic, and once I have sent the four back, they send me size five. I have to pay for postage to London, then wait a week, but it's worth it when you love a pair of slippers this much. Now, about that baguette bag ... Jess Cartner-Morley seeks inspiration Call me a dinosaur throwback, but I like shopping. At 5 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, there is no sweeter sound than the rustle of tissue paper in a carrier bag. But that does not mean I have any desire to spend unproductive afternoons trawling miserably from shop to shop, feeling too hot in my winter coat, buying something that's, say, a six out of 10 and going home exhausted. No sirree. I wouldn't dream of going shopping without a picture in my mind of exactly what I'm looking for. I don't do browsing, just search, pay and go. Shopping success is all in the preparation and this, I reasoned, is where the net would come in handy: it is an unbeatable tool for finding oddball reference material. Designers are renowned for coming up with the weirdest \"inspirations\" for their collections: no catwalk show is complete without a statement from the designer explaining that the clothes represent \"Jackie O meets Snow White\" or \"Grace Kelly in Ibiza\". Which can sorely test your knowledge of the details of sartorial history. Deciding to start with something simple, I set about looking for pictures of three women who were clearly a major inspiration for two of the most influential Paris shows for spring/summer: Charlie's Angels. Both Louis Vuitton and Celine showed visored, lip-glossed, deep-tanned looks that had the theme tune running through the minds of the audience straight away, so swotting up on the look is clearly essential. The hair, of course, everyone knows, but the rest is surprisingly hazy. I think maybe one of them had a red satin blouson jacket - but that might have been my mum. And did they really wear white jeans, or is my memory playing tricks on me after all the white denim at Chloe? I started with the lazy option, simply typing in www.charliesangels.com. This turns out to be a fan site, Angelic Heaven Online. There are just a few pictures, including one of Jaclyn Smith in jodhpurs, which just shows what a selective memory I have. But a link to the official Sony site (www.spe.sony.com) comes up trumps with no fewer than 49 pictures of the girls. In a few moments, I've got the Charlie's Angels look sorted. I think we can safely bypass the shirt-and-jacket wide-lapel fest, but those tight jeans are perfect. As are the chiffon scarves, which I'd forgotten about but which tie in beautifully with Prada's new bourgeois chic. Now I'm ready for some real shopping. Peter Lyle looks for obscure trainers Tired of the superior attitudes of snooty friends in reissued trainers, I had a simple task: find vintage tennis shoes from the early 80s. First stop was the British version of vast online auctioneer ebay (www.ebay.co.uk). After miserable results, I headed to the American HQ (www.ebay.com) where I knew there would be more lots, more trainer freaks, more clarity around what to key in (\"sneakers\"). I clicked through to \"Kev's WORN shoes\". Not only were the pair of Adidas in question too modern and for running, they were also \"far less clean than they look in the picture\". I felt unable to top the existing best bid of $9.95. The next pair that caught my eye, a nice pair of old Nikes, came with the affectionate comment: \"They may smell of cats.\" I moved on. Vintage USA ( www.vintageusa.com) specialise in classic trainers, so navigating the site is easier. Plus the product looks cleaner (and dearer). Still no Adidas Stan Smiths, though. I follow a link to Shoe Trends ( www.shoetrends.com), but find the site entirely dedicated to the sale and study of Nike culture, so I go back to ebay. Each lot's deadline countdown clock adds an air of risk to browsing and the thrill of watching, waiting and wondering whether to bid or wait for a better lot to turn up has become addictive. Those Stan Smiths haven't turned up, but I'm sure, if I'm here for five more minutes, they will ... Ruby Singh buys an outsize bra The mission: to buy a bra for the larger lady, ill-served by the choice on offer in British department stores. And to buy it in half an hour. First stop: the altavista search engine. Type in \"very large bras\". Wait three minutes, then get bored. Exit to new window. Decide to \"make up\" bra website addresses in the hope that they're accurate. www.charnos.co.uk isn't up and running yet; www.triumph.co.uk throws up a motorbike website and www.janetreger.co.uk suggests you contact the store by telephone - hardly the point of a website. Try altavista again, this time opting for \"clothing and accessories\". This offers the Victoria's Secret website (www.victoriassecret.com). Excellent, I think: a chance to find a broader range of bras not available in Britain. Opt to search \"by bra size\" and am told my search \"found 17 bras in 40DD\". Click on option to view said bras. Very nice they look, too, devoid of the thick straps and clumsy styling so often found on the larger boulder holder and down from $25 to a bargain $12.50 (you'd never find a bra this cheap in Britain). When I try to drag the two nicest ones into the shopping basket icon, a panel flashes up: \"There is a problem with the security certificate from that site. The identity certificate has expired. The information you send will be readable to others while in transit and may not go to the intended party\". I quit the site. Richard Benson buys a present for his dad My dad is a big man, 6ft 2in tall with a 56-inch chest, and he has good taste, so it's hard to find clothes he likes in the shops. I had an idea the net was good for such unusual items.

      "body": "<b>Top stories</b> <p><b>Bowled over</b><br> Probably the most exciting event in the history of indoor bowls - possibly the only exciting event in the history of indoor bowls - occurred this week at Potters holiday and leisure centre in Hopton-on-Sea, Suffolk, when a match at the world bowls championships was interrupted by a streaker. After a sedate morning watching wooden balls rolling slowly back and forth along a length of green carpet, spectators were treated to something altogether more stimulating when 22 year old Tracy Seargeant stripped off and sprinted across the playing enclosure.</p> <p> \"Bowls has a reputation as a boring game,\" explained Miss Seargeant, a waitress at the leisure centre, \"So I thought I'd liven it up a bit. I was due to leave my job anyway so I had nothing to lose.\"</p> <p> Her display was greeted with cheers from the audience, several of whom later said it was the best match they'd ever seen. The players, however, were less enthusiastic.</p> <p>Said Scotsman David Gourlay: \"I ended up losing a double at the next end.\"</p> <p><b>Doner goner</b><br> A piece of living history died this week in the form of centenarian Harry Jones, of Worcester. Mr. Jones, 103, was the final survivor of the last ever cavalry charge made by the British army. As a trooper in the Worcestershire Yeomanry Regiment in 1917, he took part in a mounted attack on a Turkish artillery position at Huj, Palestine. </p> <p>\"It was great fun,\" he later recalled. \"We went at them with swords drawn, galloping at full pace. I was too excited to be scared.\" </p> <p>After an eventful life, which included a spell with the Royal Flying Corps, he died peacefully in his sleep at a retirement home in Hungerford.</p> <p>\"He was never one to bear a grudge,\" commented one tearful care assistant. \"He enjoyed a kebab just like the rest of us.\"</p> <p><b>Scousers scuppered</b><br> These are not good days for Beatles fans. George Harrison is still recovering from a pre-Christmas stabbing attack. Paul McCartney has just brought out another album. And now, to top it all, the government has banned a series of motorway signs announcing: \"Liverpool: The Birthplace of the Beatles.\" The signs, comprising white lettering on a brown background, were due to be erected on motorways leading into the city, but were rejected by the department of the environment on the grounds that they would distract drivers.</p> <p> \"It's ridiculous,\" fumed councillor Frank Doran of Liverpool's tourism committee. \"If Stratford can be proclaimed Shakespeare Country, what's wrong with Liverpool highlighting the Fab Four.\"</p> <p>Alternative signs will now be installed carrying the somewhat less inspiring logo 'Liverpool: Historic Waterfront'.</p> <p>\"We said to them if we come together we can work it out,\" sighed one council insider. \"But they just wouldn't let it be.\"</p> <p><b>Keeping up with the gnomes</b> <br>It's been a traumatic week for garden gnomes. In Bolton retired policeman Bill Gilbertson woke up to find his entire collection of over 40 gnomes had been stolen, including a 3ft high fisherman and all the Seven Dwarfs.</p> <p>\"To a lot of people they're probably just garden ornaments,\" he said, \"But to me they're part of the family.\" </p> <p>In Keighley, meanwhile, thieves are the least of the little people's problems. Here they are facing an altogether more formidible adversary - giant fibre-glass dinosaurs. The dinosaurs are the creation of sculptor Bill Jordan, 56, who thinks they make a far more fitting garden ornament than fat little men on toadstools.</p> <p>\"There's nothing better than having a great big dinosaur's head popping out of the shrubbery,\" he enthused. \"An Antasauraus really can do wonders for the hydrangeas.\" </p> <p>Demand for his creations has been steadily growing, and he is now designing a flagstone dinosaur footprint for incorporation into garden paths.</p> <p>\"What would you rather have on your garden lawn?\" he asked. \"A concrete midget with a fishing rod, or a fifteen-foot high glow-in-the-dark Tyrannosaurus Rex?\"</p> <p><b>Weekly bestiary</b> </p> <p><b>Now fetch Rover his slippers\u0085</b><br> Chihuahuas on zimmer frames, poodles with bed pans, macrami for dachshunds - it could all become a reality with the opening this March of Britain's first ever retirement home for pets. Based at a farm in Great Shefford, Berkshire, the home will be run by the National Animal Welfare Trust and offer accommodation to up to 60 dogs and 40 cats. Lucky residents, as well as having their own room/kennel, will experience a level of comfort that puts most human retirement homes to shame, including breakfast-in-basket, and a special \"oldies unit\" with a TV, armchair and carpets so the ageing animals can while away their twilight years in a genuine home environment. Although designed exclusively for cats and dogs, it is hoped at a later date to welcome other Old Aged Pets to the farm, including, no doubt, geriatric gerbils, senile sheep and pensionable pot-bellied pigs. </p> <p>\"We want their final days to be happy ones,\" said a Trust representative. \"They'll have the best creature comforts life can offer.\"</p> <p><b>Breast left well alone</b><br> Customs officers at Glasgow Airport made a dramatic bust this week, intercepting a woman with a three-foot long reticulated python concealed inside her bra. The woman, a Dutch national, was boarding a KLM flight to Amsterdam when officials became suspicious at an unnatural rippling motion in the chest area of her blouse. Closer investigation revealed a four-month old python snuggled inside her brassiere. </p> <p>\"It gave us all a bit of a turn,\" admitted one customs officer. \"It's just not the sort of thing you expect to find in Scotland in January.\" </p> <p>Snake experts declared the animal harmless and it's owner was duly let off with an official warning, although the python itself was confiscated and has since begun a new, and doubtless less interesting life at Glasgow Zoo.</p> <p>\"You get some strange things coming through here,\" admitted one airport insider. \"A couple of years ago we stopped a man with a suitcase full of baboon testicles.\"</p> <p><b>Crows' feat</b><br> The term \"Birdie\" has assumed unexpected significance for a golf club in North Wales, where players are being terrorised by a squadron of delinquent crows. The feathered fiends have, apparently, taken to hovering above the fairway of Anglesey Golf Club waiting for a shot to be played. As soon as the ball has landed they then swoop down and steal it. To date several hundred pounds worth of golf balls have been lost in this manner, although one club member has come up with a novel solution to the problem. </p> <p>\"I've started painting my balls with pepper solution,\" he explained. \"That keeps the birds away.\"</p> <p> <b>Pensioner of the week</b></p> <p><b>WI wiggle it</b><br> The Women's Institute continues to confound those who regard it as an organisation dedicated solely to flower-arranging and baking sponge cakes. Last year the Rylstone and District branch caused a furore when members allowed themselves to be photographed naked for a saucy calendar. Now members of the Flackwell Heath Women's Institute, in Buckinghamshire, have taken to belly dancing. With their oldest member well into her eighties, they are being initiated into the arts of eastern eroticism by a professional teacher. </p> <p>\"People think that all we do is make jam,\" said president Elizabeth Dinnage, 61. \"But there's more to us than that. Last year the vicar's wife gave a brilliant talk on the history of underwear.\" </p> <p>The gyrating grannies are practising once a week, and hope in the future to be able to give public displays of their new-found skills. </p> <p>\"I don't have a diamond to stick in my belly button,\" admitted pensioner Joy Medland, 65. \"But I'm sure I can find an old earring.\"</p> <p><b> Letter of the week</b></p> <p><b>Continental rift</b><br> When are the people in this country going to become aware that the French do not have our tastes for anything? My father fought in France in the first world war and he never had a good thing to say about them. He mainly referred to them as a treacherous bunch of so-and-sos who would throw anything in the pot as long as it didn't cost too much. He was a very honest and intelligent man who would never comment on anything unless he knew it to be true. </p> <p>It seems that things haven't changed much since 1916. The best thing they could do would be to fill in the Channel tunnel with concrete. <br>VJ Fox, <br>Redfield, Bristol</p>",

In Bolton retired policeman Bill Gilbertson woke up to find his entire collection of over 40 gnomes had been stolen, including a 3ft high fisherman and all the Seven Dwarfs. \"To a lot of people they're probably just garden ornaments,\" he said, \"But to me they're part of the family.\" In Keighley, meanwhile, thieves are the least of the little people's problems. Here they are facing an altogether more formidible adversary - giant fibre-glass dinosaurs. The dinosaurs are the creation of sculptor Bill Jordan, 56, who thinks they make a far more fitting garden ornament than fat little men on toadstools. \"There's nothing better than having a great big dinosaur's head popping out of the shrubbery,\" he enthused. \"An Antasauraus really can do wonders for the hydrangeas.\" Demand for his creations has been steadily growing, and he is now designing a flagstone dinosaur footprint for incorporation into garden paths. \"What would you rather have on your garden lawn?\" he asked. \"A concrete midget with a fishing rod, or a fifteen-foot high glow-in-the-dark Tyrannosaurus Rex?\" Weekly bestiary Now fetch Rover his slippers\u0085 Chihuahuas on zimmer frames, poodles with bed pans, macrami for dachshunds - it could all become a reality with the opening this March of Britain's first ever retirement home for pets. Based at a farm in Great Shefford, Berkshire, the home will be run by the National Animal Welfare Trust and offer accommodation to up to 60 dogs and 40 cats. Lucky residents, as well as having their own room/kennel, will experience a level of comfort that puts most human retirement homes to shame, including breakfast-in-basket, and a special \"oldies unit\" with a TV, armchair and carpets so the ageing animals can while away their twilight years in a genuine home environment. Although designed exclusively for cats and dogs, it is hoped at a later date to welcome other Old Aged Pets to the farm, including, no doubt, geriatric gerbils, senile sheep and pensionable pot-bellied pigs. \"We want their final days to be happy ones,\" said a Trust representative. \"They'll have the best creature comforts life can offer.\" Breast left well alone Customs officers at Glasgow Airport made a dramatic bust this week, intercepting a woman with a three-foot long reticulated python concealed inside her bra. The woman, a Dutch national, was boarding a KLM flight to Amsterdam when officials became suspicious at an unnatural rippling motion in the chest area of her blouse. Closer investigation revealed a four-month old python snuggled inside her brassiere. \"It gave us all a bit of a turn,\" admitted one customs officer. \"It's just not the sort of thing you expect to find in Scotland in January.\" Snake experts declared the animal harmless and it's owner was duly let off with an official warning, although the python itself was confiscated and has since begun a new, and doubtless less interesting life at Glasgow Zoo. \"You get some strange things coming through here,\" admitted one airport insider. \"A couple of years ago we stopped a man with a suitcase full of baboon testicles.\" Crows' feat The term \"Birdie\" has assumed unexpected significance for a golf club in North Wales, where players are being terrorised by a squadron of delinquent crows. The feathered fiends have, apparently, taken to hovering above the fairway of Anglesey Golf Club waiting for a shot to be played. As soon as the ball has landed they then swoop down and steal it. To date several hundred pounds worth of golf balls have been lost in this manner, although one club member has come up with a novel solution to the problem. \"I've started painting my balls with pepper solution,\" he explained. \"That keeps the birds away.\" Pensioner of the week WI wiggle it The Women's Institute continues to confound those who regard it as an organisation dedicated solely to flower-arranging and baking sponge cakes. Last year the Rylstone and District branch caused a furore when members allowed themselves to be photographed naked for a saucy calendar. Now members of the Flackwell Heath Women's Institute, in Buckinghamshire, have taken to belly dancing. With their oldest member well into her eighties, they are being initiated into the arts of eastern eroticism by a professional teacher. \"People think that all we do is make jam,\" said president Elizabeth Dinnage, 61. \"But there's more to us than that. Last year the vicar's wife gave a brilliant talk on the history of underwear.\" The gyrating grannies are practising once a week, and hope in the future to be able to give public displays of their new-found skills. \"I don't have a diamond to stick in my belly button,\" admitted pensioner Joy Medland, 65. \"But I'm sure I can find an old earring.\" Letter of the week Continental rift When are the people in this country going to become aware that the French do not have our tastes for anything? My father fought in France in the first world war and he never had a good thing to say about them. He mainly referred to them as a treacherous bunch of so-and-sos who would throw anything in the pot as long as it didn't cost too much. He was a very honest and intelligent man who would never comment on anything unless he knew it to be true. It seems that things haven't changed much since 1916. The best thing they could do would be to fill in the Channel tunnel with concrete. VJ Fox, Redfield, Bristol",

Kohl, 69, was Germany's conservative chancellor for 16 unbroken years before being defeated by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's social democrats in Germany's 1998 general election. The part he played in reunifying the two Germanys after the 1989 collapse of communism turned him into a universally respected figure and earned him the nicknames \"unification chancellor\" and \"elder statesman of Europe\". But now Kohl is an ex-chancellor in disgrace after being forced to resign from his post as \"honorary chairman\" of the CDU. Leading party figures have also demanded that he quit politics altogether by resigning as an MP.

The members would be elected from Britain's 12 regions - probably at the same time as the next European elections, due in June 2004. But radicals fear the Blairites might just pitch for the minimalist model A: 65 regional members elected indirectly from party lists on the base of votes cast for their party at the general election. That would outrage the Tories, who would lose their last 92 hereditary peers if the plan were implemented. Life peers may stay on if they want to, an insurance policy to discourage any attempt to wreck the bill. Most of the 550 members - \"not just another bunch of professional politicians\" said Lord Wakeham - would be picked by an independent appointments commission, the report suggested. The 12-strong royal commis sion even ducked the question of a new name for the House of Lords once the last 92 hereditary peers' depart and membership is no longer tied to the peerage. But Lord Wakeham defended the package as a practical answer to a \"constitutional puzzle\" than has defied reform for 100 years. That cut little ice with critics. \"This is probably the least persuasive royal commission report to have been issued in my political lifetime,\" said the Lib Dems' constitutional spokesman, Robert Maclennan. \"It is neither informed by democratic principle nor a practical concern to strengthen parliament's capability to oversee the work of central government.\" Lord Strathclyde, the Tory leader in the Lords, was also critical, but agreed that he would have to work to implement it. Labour leftwingers were dismayed, but not surprised. Well aware of a century of stalemate, Lord Wakeham told his critics to grab what they could. \"If interested parties choose to hold out for what they would ideally like, the opportunity may pass for another generation, maybe another century,\" he said. But the signal that mattered to the former Tory cabinet minister and his colleagues was the one from Downing Street, where all speculation that his recommendations would join the electoral reform agenda in the long grass were emphatically denied. \"There is no question of shelving this report. The prime minister regards it as a sensible way forward,\" his spokesman said. But the leader of the Lords, Lady Jay, said the government would need time to consider the recommendations. Mr Blair is wary of what Lord Wakeham promises would be an \"authoritative and confident\" second chamber, but is anxious not to fulfil Tory jibes that he has replaced the ancient hereditary house with a version based on patronage, filled with \"Tony's cronies\". The main points \u0095Second chamber of about 550 members \u0095Majority to be chosen by an independent commission \u0095The rest - 65, 87, or 195 - to be elected from the 12 regions of the UK \u0095Composition of the second chamber to be regularly adjusted to reflect political voting patterns \u0095New targets to reflect the UK's gender, ethnic and faith mix \u0095Link between the honours list and membership of the second chamber no longer to exist \u0095Reformed chamber should be 'at least as powerful as the present House of Lords'",

      "body": "<p>Two car bombings shook the centre of Madrid today, killing a Spanish army officer in an apparent resumption of terror attacks by the Basque separatist group ETA after it ended its ceasefire in early December.</p> <p>\"There have been two explosions and there is one victim killed and a girl slightly injured,\" a police spokesman said. There was no warning for the attack. The dead officer was identified as Lieutenant Colonel Pedro Antonio Blanco Garcia, 48.</p> <p>He was blown to pieces as he walked past one of the cars - apparently detonated by remote control - on his way to work. About half-hour later another car exploded between about 400 yards away. It would be the worst ETA bombing since 21 people were killed in a Barcelona shopping centre in June 1987.</p> <p>The blasts occurred during morning rush hour near a school in a neighbourhood where military personnel are housed. Timed for maximum political effect, the explosions came just four days after prime minister Jose Maria Aznar called a general election for March 12. They represented a lethal message to the Spanish government on its vulnerability to terrorist action.</p> <p>Four people were reported injured including the girl hurt in the first explosion. No injuries were reported for the second blast. Authorities said they found a third car in the area believed to be booby-trapped and planned to blow it up in a controlled explosion.</p> <p>It was the first action attributed to ETA since June 1998, when a Basque town councillor was killed in a car bombing in northern Spain. The Spanish government had been bracing itself for a renewed cycle of ETA violence ever since the guerrillas ended their 14-month ceasefire and told their fighters to prepare for action.</p> <p>\"This is what we had feared,\" said Jose Maria Alvarez de Manzano, Madrid's mayor. \"We were on the alert. We are not surprised that it happened but we are surprised by the date and the location.\" Today's car bombings followed several attempted attacks by the guerrillas that were foiled by police. Civil Guards intercepted two vans loaded with almost two tons of explosive on their way to Madrid just before Christmas.</p> <p>One car was completely destroyed in the first explosion and two others were set on fire, The blasts, which took place 30 to 40 minutes apart in southern Madrid, were heard in offices several miles away. The explosions rocked the south-eastern part of the capital where there are a number of military barracks and close to a school connected with the military, police said.</p> <p>They immediately cordoned off the zone. Just two hours after the blasts, a man was shot and injured by police near the scene, but officials said it involved a crime unrelated to the car bombings. Spanish government officials had warned that ETA was likely to mount an attack before election day.</p> <p>In announcing the end of their unilateral truce, the guerrillas accused the government of intransigence in its refusal to consider ETA's demands for Basque self-determination. Mr Aznar, in his election announcement on Monday, had promised to maintain a hardline stance against Basque separatists.</p> <p>ETA frequently exploded car bombs in Madrid during the morning rush when it was more active in the early 1990s. The group has usually hit political and military targets in its 31-year campaign of shootings and bombings to back its demands for an independent Basque state. It has been blamed for more than 800 deaths.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two car bombings shook the centre of Madrid today, killing a Spanish army officer in an apparent resumption of terror attacks by the Basque separatist group ETA after it ended its ceasefire in early December. \"There have been two explosions and there is one victim killed and a girl slightly injured,\" a police spokesman said. There was no warning for the attack. The dead officer was identified as Lieutenant Colonel Pedro Antonio Blanco Garcia, 48. He was blown to pieces as he walked past one of the cars - apparently detonated by remote control - on his way to work. About half-hour later another car exploded between about 400 yards away. It would be the worst ETA bombing since 21 people were killed in a Barcelona shopping centre in June 1987. The blasts occurred during morning rush hour near a school in a neighbourhood where military personnel are housed. Timed for maximum political effect, the explosions came just four days after prime minister Jose Maria Aznar called a general election for March 12. They represented a lethal message to the Spanish government on its vulnerability to terrorist action. Four people were reported injured including the girl hurt in the first explosion. No injuries were reported for the second blast. Authorities said they found a third car in the area believed to be booby-trapped and planned to blow it up in a controlled explosion. It was the first action attributed to ETA since June 1998, when a Basque town councillor was killed in a car bombing in northern Spain. The Spanish government had been bracing itself for a renewed cycle of ETA violence ever since the guerrillas ended their 14-month ceasefire and told their fighters to prepare for action. \"This is what we had feared,\" said Jose Maria Alvarez de Manzano, Madrid's mayor. \"We were on the alert. We are not surprised that it happened but we are surprised by the date and the location.\" Today's car bombings followed several attempted attacks by the guerrillas that were foiled by police. Civil Guards intercepted two vans loaded with almost two tons of explosive on their way to Madrid just before Christmas. One car was completely destroyed in the first explosion and two others were set on fire, The blasts, which took place 30 to 40 minutes apart in southern Madrid, were heard in offices several miles away. The explosions rocked the south-eastern part of the capital where there are a number of military barracks and close to a school connected with the military, police said. They immediately cordoned off the zone. Just two hours after the blasts, a man was shot and injured by police near the scene, but officials said it involved a crime unrelated to the car bombings. Spanish government officials had warned that ETA was likely to mount an attack before election day. In announcing the end of their unilateral truce, the guerrillas accused the government of intransigence in its refusal to consider ETA's demands for Basque self-determination. Mr Aznar, in his election announcement on Monday, had promised to maintain a hardline stance against Basque separatists. ETA frequently exploded car bombs in Madrid during the morning rush when it was more active in the early 1990s. The group has usually hit political and military targets in its 31-year campaign of shootings and bombings to back its demands for an independent Basque state. It has been blamed for more than 800 deaths.",

The chairman of the British Medical Association's medical ethics committee, Michael Wilks, said the results of the medical tests on General Pinochet should be made public and scrutinised in court. \"In the case of General Pinochet the experts appointed by the home secretary acted in a forensic capacity,\" Mr Wilks said in a letter to the Times this morning. \"In being asked to provide an opinion on the general's fitness to stand trial, the reports compiled should be disclosable in any judicial procedures, and the opinion therein tested in court.\" An Amnesty spokesman said: \"This letter appears to support what we've said in our submission to the home secretary. \"The debate over the rights and wrongs of the medical tests has only underlined what we've said that they should have been conducted with proper judicial oversight and by medical specialists appointed by the courts.\" But the home secretary remained unmoved. \"I've made the decisions I've made in respect of senator Pinochet on the basis of very careful legal advice,\" Mr Straw told the Today programme this morning. The home secretary is still studying submissions from human rights groups and Pinochet supporters before making a final decision on whether the former Chilean dictator can return to Chile. He has been urged to order new tests on Gen Pinochet, amid criticism of the test's secrecy and warnings there could have been serious flaws in the examination conducted by a team of experts on 5 January. One of the senior medical experts who examined Gen Pinochet, Oxford university professor Sir John Grimley Evans, told the Observer that the former dicatator could make a full recovery from the medical condition that has prevented his extradition to Spain to face torture charges. Meanwhile, the Chilean military jet poised to fly Gen Pinochet home remains grounded on a runway in Bermuda, where it is not expected to take off until the home secretary gives his final decision on the 84-year-old's future.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Historically, writers and critics have recorded the development of the music industry in terms of its most significant artists. The Beatles, Madonna or the Artist have been lauded for the way they transformed pop or triggered fresh musical directions. Genres like rap or grunge have been hailed for their galvanising sociological or political impact. </p> <p>But suddenly, that traditional perspective has been upended by the arrival of the internet era. The creeping corporatisation of the entertainment industry has been steadily relegating artists to the status of mere software, as noted by an aggrieved George Michael in his legal struggle against Sony. </p> <p>But the eruption of the internet and e-commerce is making George's servitude at Sony look like the good old days. With stunning speed, the emphasis has swung away from the performers who make music towards the companies and delivery systems which package and market it. The most hotly debated topics in today's record industry aren't which musical genres are going to be big in 2001, but how will record companies cope with the challenge of music that can be downloaded over the internet, and will it mean the end of retailing? </p> <p>Which current acts can command the kind of sustained news coverage lavished on the merger of internet service provider AOL and multi-media conglomerate Time-Warner? Not even George Harrison's encounter with a knife-wielding intruder, or the Jennifer Lopez/Puff Daddy firearms arrest, came close. </p> <p>In this new era, the stars seem tame and anonymous.\"In the record company environment, the real stars are the technical people and the marketers,\" claims Charly Prevost of Liquid Audio, a company which has developed its own online digital audio software to challenge the popular MP3 digital audio format which first made it possible to make music downloadable from the web. \"They're like the artists now. The artists are almost secondary. The marketers are media artists.\" </p> <p>Technological change and shifts in consumer behaviour are forcing the business to rethink its entire commercial strategy. Since the music business began, record companies and retailers have been mutually supportive in the quest to lure more buyers to the tills, and they've been careful to preserve generous profit margins. Far too generous, as they're discovering. </p> <p>The rules are being rewritten. Online retailers are taking advantage of low overheads to offer CDs at prices closer to their real worth. Record companies are panicking about illegal websites offering pirate copies of their own copyrighted material. And musicians are beginning to wonder if they need record companies. </p> <p>\"I think what the record companies are being short-sighted about is not that they're losing control of the distribution, but about the demystification of what was once a tool against the establishment,\" postulates Malcolm McLaren, pop manager turned cyber-age soothsayer and renegade candidate for mayor of London. \"That was where pop culture all emanated from and that has already gone. There's no game left. There's no need for managers any more. Rock 'n' roll bands can make music and put it on their own website.\" </p> <p>McLaren's rockbiz apocalypse won't come to pass for a while yet. Record companies were caught on the hop by internet-frenzy, but it's impossible to over-estimate their ferocious instinct for self-preservation. The companies are well aware of catalogue copyrights. They have no plans to let some pesky technological revolution stop them now.</p> <p>The net offers them ever-expanding opportunities to make yet more profit. For instance, they're countering the threat from available-to-all MP3 downloads by embracing more sophisticated digitised music formats like Liquid Audio or Microsoft's Windows Media Audio. These enable files to self-destruct after a pre-set period unless customers pay the required download fee. The companies can make their catalogues available online and ensure they get paid for doing so. </p> <p>While it's true that the net offers access to all, and lets you distribute music without A&amp;R men, that creates its own problems. Click on a site like peoplesound.com and you're confronted with a barrage of unknown names like Prince Albert, Lazydog, 750cc, the Cheetahs and the Dukes of Hang-Gliding. </p> <p>How much time have you got to spend ploughing through a phone-directory of acts you've never seen or read about? It looks suspiciously like the post-punk era of esoteric independent labels, who made music mostly for themselves and a coterie of friends. Superstardom requires investment and promotional machinery to push you there. Only a big record label that can supply these. </p> <p>Hence, there still hasn't been a major artist launched exclusively via the web. Public Enemy was the first act to make a whole album, There's a Poison Goin On, downloadable from the net, but try finding it on the Billboard charts. The Artist's attempts to circumvent record companies and distribute his music online have merely assisted his steady commercial decline. David Bowie's online release of Hours stirred up more media interest than actual sales. Tori Amos and Puff Daddy, however, have used the net more selectively and more successfully, by making singles available for download to whet the punters' appetites for a subsequent album release. </p> <p>Yet it's change-or-die time for the industry. The Top Internet Album Sales chart in Billboard magazine at the end of October had Honky Tonk Union by Roger Clyne &amp; The Peacemakers at number one. When they come to write the history of what happened when the net met the music biz, Roger Clyne will get his very own footnote, because he's one of rock 'n' roll's online pioneers. </p> <p>\"This is a guy from Ohio who recorded his little bar band in a club, made a record that sounds just like a bar band in a club, and sold it as digital downloads,\" explains Charly Prevost. \"But every T-shirt Roger Clyne had, and every card he handed out, had Liquid Audio's URL [internet address] on it. I think the album only picked up about 1,200 internet sales, but Clyne marketed himself using the internet. I think the fact that at the same time he kept touring and had a physical CD released gave him visibility and allowed him to start a career.\" </p> <p>Clyne's story illustrates the rise of the net as a marketing tool. Merely plonking yourself on the internet won't make you a star, but internet plus touring plus TV plus press interviews might. It's when major artists start getting net-smart that the hysteria begins.This may be OK for record companies, whose position as copyright-owners ensures they'll take their cut of sales in whatever medium they're achieved, but it puts the wind up retailers, who could rapidly become surplus to requirements. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, HMV Europe's managing director Brian McLaughlin - in his role as chairman of the retailers' association, Bard - was strongly critical of record labels who make music available for download from the internet before the product is on sale in stores. The focus of his ire was David Bowie's latest album, Hours, which was offered to American internet customers two weeks before its official release date. \"We're obviously responsive to the huge opportunities offered by e-commerce,\" McLaughlin argued, \"but we must be alert to record companies possibly paying no regard to the relationship between suppliers and retailers in the UK.\" </p> <p>McLaughlin's humour won't have been improved by the news that EMI is proposing to sell its stake in HMV, as it plans for an increasingly internet-orientated future. Already, EMI has entered an agreement with Liquid Audio to digitise its catalogue for potential download. This makes perfect sense for a record company, which can make its archive of material available on demand without having to keep manufacturing copies on CD. This could prove particularly attractive in classical music, where there's a rich tradition of historic recordings stretching back to the beginning of the century. </p> <p>There may even be benefits for retailers, too. Record stores could become the access point for customers wanting to order so-called \"deep catalogue\" material, not currently available but accessible as digital downloads from a central database. The material could be recorded on to CD on demand, or transferred to any number of emerging new audio formats. American company Digital On-Demand has been testing download kiosks in selected locations, enabling customers to walk in, order catalogue material and have it burned on to a recordable CD while they wait. New Media Network plans to start a similar venture this year. </p> <p>It's going to be a risky, unpredictable process. Charly Prevost remembers the furore which greeted the arrival of MP3. </p> <p>\"There was a great fear that the internet would cannibalise physical record sales, and that people would stop going to record stores,\" Prevost remembers. \"Overnight, human nature would change! But when you explain it to people, and give them examples of how the net has helped sell more records and launched careers, then suddenly they don't see it as a threat any more.\" </p> <p>The Americans responded to the net invasion with a characteristic display of hard-nosed entrepreneurialism. Internet retailers - most famously Amazon.com - sprang up and began to get rich quick. Existing stores started their own net operations and adapted their businesses accordingly. The giant retail chain Musicland originally refused to stock albums with a URL listed, but last June it launched four websites of its own and has been marketing them aggressively in its stores. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Best Buy chain has invented a fresh sales strategy with its Find 'Em First line of albums which it sells both online and in-store, and boosts with its own TV ads. These aren't necessarily new releases, just ones which Best Buy has decided it likes and can promote effectively. Among its current favourites are Robbie Williams, Kelly Willis, Rufus Wainwright, Mercury Rev and The Freestylers, which Best Buy insists are \"incredible musicians that aren't well known but who deserve more press and a place in your music collection!\" </p> <p>Yet the net is by no means the preserve of the hippest and youngest operators. Veteran music fans have found it a perfect place to track down obscure albums, while the freakish success of Cliff Richard's Millennium Prayer was fuelled not only by the net, but also by making the song downloadable from the remotemusic.com website at 99p a throw. </p> <p>\"The net is going to be an interesting additional means of delivering music in the future,\" commented Malcolm Smith, managing director of the Cliff Richard Organisation. \"It won't replace any of the traditional outlets, but it will supplement them.\" Which is a refreshingly unhysterical way of looking at it.</p> <p>\u0095 Comprehensive guide to how to get the most out of the net: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeonline\">Life Online</a></p> <p> <strong>10 music websites</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.liquidaudio.com\">Liquid Audio</a></p> <p>Excellent quality streaming and try-before-you-buy downloads.

For instance, they're countering the threat from available-to-all MP3 downloads by embracing more sophisticated digitised music formats like Liquid Audio or Microsoft's Windows Media Audio. These enable files to self-destruct after a pre-set period unless customers pay the required download fee. The companies can make their catalogues available online and ensure they get paid for doing so. While it's true that the net offers access to all, and lets you distribute music without A&amp;R men, that creates its own problems. Click on a site like peoplesound.com and you're confronted with a barrage of unknown names like Prince Albert, Lazydog, 750cc, the Cheetahs and the Dukes of Hang-Gliding. How much time have you got to spend ploughing through a phone-directory of acts you've never seen or read about? It looks suspiciously like the post-punk era of esoteric independent labels, who made music mostly for themselves and a coterie of friends. Superstardom requires investment and promotional machinery to push you there. Only a big record label that can supply these. Hence, there still hasn't been a major artist launched exclusively via the web. Public Enemy was the first act to make a whole album, There's a Poison Goin On, downloadable from the net, but try finding it on the Billboard charts. The Artist's attempts to circumvent record companies and distribute his music online have merely assisted his steady commercial decline. David Bowie's online release of Hours stirred up more media interest than actual sales. Tori Amos and Puff Daddy, however, have used the net more selectively and more successfully, by making singles available for download to whet the punters' appetites for a subsequent album release. Yet it's change-or-die time for the industry. The Top Internet Album Sales chart in Billboard magazine at the end of October had Honky Tonk Union by Roger Clyne &amp; The Peacemakers at number one. When they come to write the history of what happened when the net met the music biz, Roger Clyne will get his very own footnote, because he's one of rock 'n' roll's online pioneers. \"This is a guy from Ohio who recorded his little bar band in a club, made a record that sounds just like a bar band in a club, and sold it as digital downloads,\" explains Charly Prevost. \"But every T-shirt Roger Clyne had, and every card he handed out, had Liquid Audio's URL [internet address] on it. I think the album only picked up about 1,200 internet sales, but Clyne marketed himself using the internet. I think the fact that at the same time he kept touring and had a physical CD released gave him visibility and allowed him to start a career.\" Clyne's story illustrates the rise of the net as a marketing tool. Merely plonking yourself on the internet won't make you a star, but internet plus touring plus TV plus press interviews might. It's when major artists start getting net-smart that the hysteria begins.This may be OK for record companies, whose position as copyright-owners ensures they'll take their cut of sales in whatever medium they're achieved, but it puts the wind up retailers, who could rapidly become surplus to requirements. A few weeks ago, HMV Europe's managing director Brian McLaughlin - in his role as chairman of the retailers' association, Bard - was strongly critical of record labels who make music available for download from the internet before the product is on sale in stores. The focus of his ire was David Bowie's latest album, Hours, which was offered to American internet customers two weeks before its official release date. \"We're obviously responsive to the huge opportunities offered by e-commerce,\" McLaughlin argued, \"but we must be alert to record companies possibly paying no regard to the relationship between suppliers and retailers in the UK.\" McLaughlin's humour won't have been improved by the news that EMI is proposing to sell its stake in HMV, as it plans for an increasingly internet-orientated future. Already, EMI has entered an agreement with Liquid Audio to digitise its catalogue for potential download. This makes perfect sense for a record company, which can make its archive of material available on demand without having to keep manufacturing copies on CD. This could prove particularly attractive in classical music, where there's a rich tradition of historic recordings stretching back to the beginning of the century. There may even be benefits for retailers, too. Record stores could become the access point for customers wanting to order so-called \"deep catalogue\" material, not currently available but accessible as digital downloads from a central database. The material could be recorded on to CD on demand, or transferred to any number of emerging new audio formats. American company Digital On-Demand has been testing download kiosks in selected locations, enabling customers to walk in, order catalogue material and have it burned on to a recordable CD while they wait. New Media Network plans to start a similar venture this year. It's going to be a risky, unpredictable process. Charly Prevost remembers the furore which greeted the arrival of MP3. \"There was a great fear that the internet would cannibalise physical record sales, and that people would stop going to record stores,\" Prevost remembers. \"Overnight, human nature would change! But when you explain it to people, and give them examples of how the net has helped sell more records and launched careers, then suddenly they don't see it as a threat any more.\" The Americans responded to the net invasion with a characteristic display of hard-nosed entrepreneurialism. Internet retailers - most famously Amazon.com - sprang up and began to get rich quick. Existing stores started their own net operations and adapted their businesses accordingly. The giant retail chain Musicland originally refused to stock albums with a URL listed, but last June it launched four websites of its own and has been marketing them aggressively in its stores. Meanwhile, the Best Buy chain has invented a fresh sales strategy with its Find 'Em First line of albums which it sells both online and in-store, and boosts with its own TV ads. These aren't necessarily new releases, just ones which Best Buy has decided it likes and can promote effectively. Among its current favourites are Robbie Williams, Kelly Willis, Rufus Wainwright, Mercury Rev and The Freestylers, which Best Buy insists are \"incredible musicians that aren't well known but who deserve more press and a place in your music collection!\" Yet the net is by no means the preserve of the hippest and youngest operators. Veteran music fans have found it a perfect place to track down obscure albums, while the freakish success of Cliff Richard's Millennium Prayer was fuelled not only by the net, but also by making the song downloadable from the remotemusic.com website at 99p a throw. \"The net is going to be an interesting additional means of delivering music in the future,\" commented Malcolm Smith, managing director of the Cliff Richard Organisation. \"It won't replace any of the traditional outlets, but it will supplement them.\" Which is a refreshingly unhysterical way of looking at it. \u0095 Comprehensive guide to how to get the most out of the net: Life Online 10 music websites Liquid Audio Excellent quality streaming and try-before-you-buy downloads.

Here are 10 things that England supporters can reasonably demand of their team in the one-day series against South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p> <p><strong>1. Reach the final</strong><br> England's last one-day appearance was in the World Cup, when they crashed out against India at Edgbaston on that shamefaced Sunday morning. Their last outing in South Africa, four years ago, was a 6-1 drubbing. So mere respectability would be a major advance. It's too much to ask that they beat South Africa, who are the world's most effective one-day team outside of major tournaments. But they must see off Zimbabwe, who have history on their side (five wins out of seven in one-dayers against England) but not form - England beat them comfortably, too comfortably as it turned out, at Trent Bridge in May, and although Zimbabwe squeezed into the Super Six stage of the World Cup, they have done nothing since except lose their captain, Alastair Campbell.</p> <p><strong>2. Bed in a new opening pair</strong><br> England discovered a new one-day opener in the World Cup: fellow by the name of Hussain. Unfortunately this was at the expense of Nick Knight, the one batsman in the team with a world-class one-day record. Now, with Alec Stewart apparently consigned to history, these two must form a partnership. They have all the balance you could ask for: left and right hander, blaster and barnacle. But does Hussain have any runs left in him at the end of a long tour, and will he manage to refrain from running Knight out?</p> <p><strong>3. Field as well as...</strong><br> I was going to say the South Africans, but some observers, amazingly, felt that England had the edge in this department as the Test series went on. Knight, Hussain, Vikram Solanki and Craig White are all outstanding fielders, but if England play all three of their strike bowlers (Gough, Caddick, Mullally), which looks necesary from the penetration point of view, that will put the donkey among the gazelles.</p> <p><strong>4. Get runs out of Chris Read</strong><br> The forgotten man of the Test tour - well, one of the many - is a strange choice for this game, and I say that as a Read fan. Read for the Tests and Rob Turner for the one-dayers would have made more sense. But he's there, he's the only keeper, and so he should get the run in the side that he has been denied at Test level. And Duncan Fletcher has got to find a way of squeezing some runs out of him. He will be batting at No.8 or 9, and while he is clearly no Boucher, he mustn't be a front-line tailender either. Needs to improvise like his glove-mentors, Alan Knott and Jack Russell, and be good for a bustling 20. </p> <p><strong>5. Set attacking fields</strong><br> The one disappointment of Nasser Hussain's captaincy in the Tests was a tendency to go onn the defensive. It may have been an infection picked up from Hansie Cronje (until he suddenly turned into Father Christmas). But with captaincy, the old when-in-Rome rule does not apply. When in Rome, behave in a way the Roman isn't used to. Keep a slip in throughout a one-day innings. For one thing, it will save the most annoying kind of runs. For another, it will cut out the dreaded open-face push. And it worked for most teams in the World Cup.</p> <p><strong>6. Get Gough's reverse-swing going again</strong><br> Darren Gough's bowling don't mean a thing if it ain't got that late jag in. South Africa ought to be made for reversing: the grounds are hard (torrential rain permitting) and the grass is crunchy. But Gough got less reverse-swing in the Tests than Hansie Cronje, and the result was that the South African tail wagged like Shaun Pollock's finger. The England bowling coach, Bob Cottam, is still out there: they didn't know what reverse-swing was in his day, but it's part of his job to be able to locate it now.</p> <p><strong>7. Name a vice-captain</strong><br> President Nasser has a poor record in this area, having already shared the job out between Graham Thorpe, Mark Butcher and Alec Stewart in the space of nine Tests, as well as giving Graeme Hick a go, on the pusillanimous grounds that it might go to Michael Vaughan's head if he was groomed for the captaincy. Of the above, only Hick is in the one-day squad, and whatever future he has with England, it sure isn't as captain. So come on Nasser, stop messing about and give the job to someone who is articulate, assertive and hard to faze: Nick Knight. </p> <p><strong>8. Add two players to the core of the team</strong><br> Turning novices into established members of the side is a slow process, as Hussain and Fletcher learned, the hard way, during the Tests. Once again, they are going into battle with a team that Alan Hansen would say you can't win anything with. Ten of England's players - Chris Adams, Darren Maddy, Solanki, White, Mark Alleyne, Gavin Hamilton, Read, Ashley Giles, Graeme Swann and Caddick - have 42 one-day caps between them. Even Mark Boucher has more than that, after two years in international cricket. Cronje said recently that he doesn't want to go into the next World Cup with a single player who has less than 50 caps. The experience gulf is a very wide one. If one batsman (preferably Solanki) and one bowler (preferably an allrounder) bridge that gulf and join the nucleus of the team, England will be doing well.</p> <p><strong>9. Get a run, a wicket or a catch out of Gavin Hamilton</strong><br> He didn't manage one in the Test series, poor man: his debut made Graham Gooch's look handy. But he had a great World Cup, in a star-of-a-hopeless-team kind of way. So he should be fully equipped to pull on the mid-blue shirt of England. </p> <p><strong>10. Have meaningful numbers</strong><br> One of England's many crimes in the World Cup was to do their numbering alphabetically, so that the number was meaningless. This was bovine in itself, and plain rude to the spectator, who is entitled to think that if a man has No.6 on his shirt, then there is at least some chance that he will come in to bat after No.5. As Hussain is opening, there is no problem with him wanting to look after No.1 by wearing it on his back.</p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com and Wisden Cricket Monthly.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "England expects ... not very much these days on the cricket field, if it has any sense. And especially when it comes to one-day cricket and a foreign field: England have won no one-day series or trophy overseas since 1992 apart from the Sharjah tournament of 1997-98, a triumph which was subsequently tarnished by rumours of alleged match-fixing. But we can still hope. Here are 10 things that England supporters can reasonably demand of their team in the one-day series against South Africa and Zimbabwe. 1 Reach the final England's last one-day appearance was in the World Cup, when they crashed out against India at Edgbaston on that shamefaced Sunday morning. Their last outing in South Africa, four years ago, was a 6-1 drubbing. So mere respectability would be a major advance. It's too much to ask that they beat South Africa, who are the world's most effective one-day team outside of major tournaments. But they must see off Zimbabwe, who have history on their side (five wins out of seven in one-dayers against England) but not form - England beat them comfortably, too comfortably as it turned out, at Trent Bridge in May, and although Zimbabwe squeezed into the Super Six stage of the World Cup, they have done nothing since except lose their captain, Alastair Campbell. 2 Bed in a new opening pair England discovered a new one-day opener in the World Cup: fellow by the name of Hussain. Unfortunately this was at the expense of Nick Knight, the one batsman in the team with a world-class one-day record. Now, with Alec Stewart apparently consigned to history, these two must form a partnership. They have all the balance you could ask for: left and right hander, blaster and barnacle. But does Hussain have any runs left in him at the end of a long tour, and will he manage to refrain from running Knight out? 3 Field as well as ... I was going to say the South Africans, but some observers, amazingly, felt that England had the edge in this department as the Test series went on. Knight, Hussain, Vikram Solanki and Craig White are all outstanding fielders, but if England play all three of their strike bowlers (Gough, Caddick, Mullally), which looks necesary from the penetration point of view, that will put the donkey among the gazelles. 4 Get runs out of Chris Read The forgotten man of the Test tour - well, one of the many - is a strange choice for this game, and I say that as a Read fan. Read for the Tests and Rob Turner for the one-dayers would have made more sense. But he's there, he's the only keeper, and so he should get the run in the side that he has been denied at Test level. And Duncan Fletcher has got to find a way of squeezing some runs out of him. He will be batting at No.8 or 9, and while he is clearly no Boucher, he mustn't be a front-line tailender either. Needs to improvise like his glove-mentors, Alan Knott and Jack Russell, and be good for a bustling 20. 5 Set attacking fields The one disappointment of Nasser Hussain's captaincy in the Tests was a tendency to go on the defensive. It may have been an infection picked up from Hansie Cronje (until he suddenly turned into Father Christmas). But with captaincy, the old when-in-Rome rule does not apply. When in Rome, behave in a way the Roman isn't used to. Keep a slip in throughout a one-day innings. For one thing, it will save the most annoying kind of runs. For another, it will cut out the dreaded open-face push. And it worked for most teams in the World Cup. 6 Get Gough's reverse-swing going again Darren Gough's bowling don't mean a thing if it ain't got that late jag in. South Africa ought to be made for reversing: the grounds are hard (torrential rain permitting) and the grass is crunchy. But Gough got less reverse-swing in the Tests than Hansie Cronje, and the result was that the South African tail wagged like Shaun Pollock's finger. The England bowling coach, Bob Cottam, is still out there: they didn't know what reverse-swing was in his day, but it's part of his job to be able to locate it now. 7 Name a vice-captain President Nasser has a poor record in this area, having already shared the job out between Graham Thorpe, Mark Butcher and Alec Stewart in the space of nine Tests, as well as giving Graeme Hick a go, on the pusillanimous grounds that it might go to Michael Vaughan's head if he was groomed for the captaincy. Of the above, only Hick is in the one-day squad, and whatever future he has with England, it sure isn't as captain. So come on Nasser, stop messing about and give the job to someone who is articulate, assertive and hard to faze: Nick Knight. 8 Add two players to the core of the team Turning novices into established members of the side is a slow process, as Hussain and Fletcher learned, the hard way, during the Tests. Once again, they are going into battle with a team that Alan Hansen would say you can't win anything with. Ten of England's players - Chris Adams, Darren Maddy, Solanki, White, Mark Alleyne, Gavin Hamilton, Read, Ashley Giles, Graeme Swann and Caddick - are going into this series with 42 one-day caps between them. Even Mark Boucher has more than that, after two years in international cricket. Cronje said recently that he doesn't want to go into the next World Cup with a single player who has less than 50 caps. The experience gulf is a very wide one. If one batsman (preferably Solanki) and one bowler (preferably an allrounder) bridge that gulf and join the nucleus of the team, England will be doing well. 9 Get a run, a wicket or a catch out of Gavin Hamilton He didn't manage one in the Test series, poor man: his debut made Graham Gooch's look handy. But he had a great World Cup, in a star-of-a-hopeless-team kind of way. So he should be fully equipped to pull on the mid-blue shirt of England. 10 Have meaningful numbers One of England's many crimes in the World Cup was to do their numbering alphabetically, so that the number was meaningless. This was bovine in itself, and plain rude to the spectator, who is entitled to think that if a man has No.6 on his shirt, then there is at least some chance that he will come in to bat after No.5.

Adsmart has worked on more than 400 websites, while Flycast measures the effectiveness of online ads. CMGI only bought San Francisco-based Flycast last week. Engage has compiled profiles of 35m web users based on which sites they visit. The company has said that it does not store personal information such as credit card numbers, a privacy issue which has exercised American regulators. Kevin O'Connor, chief executive of Doubleclick, said in New York this week that the web-based ads could be more effective than television ones. The acquisitions, which are expected to close in the spring, pushed the market value of Engage to more than $4bn yesterday. Paul Schaut will remain as president and chief executive of the combined company, while the respective heads of Flycast and Adsmart will join the president's office to oversee strategic operations.",

The health minister, Allan Rock, proposed regulations yesterday that would require cigarette companies to cover 50% of each pack with colour photos of cigarette-damaged organs or the image of a drooping cigarette to symbolise the impotence that smoking can cause. \"Canadians who use tobacco products need to fully understand the serious health hazard inherent in this lethal product,\" Mr Rock said. \"Let's take on smoking for the national evil that it is.

It would be the first time cigarette makers have been required to put graphic photos on their packages. Dom Caruso of a Toronto-based advertising agency said the current batch of health warnings have become invisible to smokers because everyone is used to them. \"The graphic impact [of the new messages] is probably going to have a lot more life than what they did before,\" Mr Caruso said. Canada has stiffened anti-smoking regulations in recent years. Health warnings on cigarette packages were required until the supreme court in 1995 struck down portions of the Tobacco Products Control Act as unconstitutional. But cigarette makers have continued including health warnings voluntarily, and a new tobacco act passed in 1997 left it to the government to impose any regulations on health warnings. A tobacco industry spokesman said cigarette-makers may choose to challenge the new regulations proposed by Mr Rock, but have not made a final decision.

      "trailText": "<p>He specialises in brutal male dramas. But in The Insider Michael Mann's protagonists aren't gunslingers, angry Mohicans or serial killers - they're corporate Americans</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There's a scene midway through Michael Mann's new movie The Insider where would-be whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, played as a sombre obsessive-compulsive by Russell Crowe, is walking around a lawn, locked in internal debate as to whether or not he should testify that his former employers, tobacco giant Brown &amp; Williamson, knowingly added cancer-causing chemicals to its cigarettes. Attorneys and police look on; the atmosphere is hushed; the tension excruciating. Eventually, Wigand walks up to his confidante, 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (played by Al Pacino), and says simply: \"Let's go to court\". </p> <p>This, in many ways, is a quintessential Michael Mann moment, as heartstopping as any death-defying Die Hard or Bond stunt. It's also a perfect illustration of the singular genre that Mann has carved out for himself - the cerebral action movie. True, he's as adept at choreographing bullet ballets as any number of John Woos - those who cowered and flinched through the protracted heist in Heat will testify to that. But the key scene in that movie was the verbal face-off between Robert De Niro's career criminal and Al Pacino's driven cop; two men painted into opposite but complementary corners by the force of their passions and their determination to pursue them, at whatever cost. </p> <p>Mann has been called a \"hard-boiled sensualist\", a sort of feng-shui'd Hemingway, and the term could equally apply to any of his anti-heroes, from James Caan's high-class burglar in 1981's Thief; through William Petersen's empathic detective in Manhunter, Mann's 1986 take on Thomas Harris's Red Dragon; to the cigarette-industry deep throat Wigand. Though, as Mann says in his throaty Chicago rasp, \"Jeffrey has to be the most confused and unclear character I've ever worked with.\" </p> <p>The Insider is based on the real events sparked when Wigand, former head of research and development at Brown &amp; Williamson, violated the confidentiality clause in his severance agreement by going public with his knowledge of the carcinogenic properties of B&amp;W's products to Bergman; Bergman then put his devastating testimony on tape in an interview with 60 Minutes' silky anchor Mike Wallace (played with brilliantined brio by Christopher Plummer).</p> <p>However, by the time the segment was due to air, Wigand had become a central witness in the lawsuits filed by Mississippi and 49 other states against the tobacco industry, and his marriage had fallen apart in the face of intimidation and threats of imprisonment from his former employers; at the 11th hour, CBS, fearing litigation, decided to pull the interview, to Bergman's dismay and Wigand's disgust. Eventually, the opprobrium heaped on the network forced them to backtrack, but not before Bergman had resigned, Wigand had succumbed to a near-breakdown, and 60 Minutes' vaunted journalistic ethics were left in tatters. </p> <p>It's far from a classic two-line Hollywood pitch: a Vanity Fair article on the case ran to 24 pages, and was filled with arcane references to tobacco industry practice and obscure points of law. </p> <p>What, then, did Mann see in it? He clasps his hands and furrows his already knotted brow. \"I thought the story was less about big tobacco,\" he says, \"than the effect on your life when someone decides to go after you, though in this case it was a large corporation rather than a gunslinger. Way back in Thief, you had James Caan getting into these mob-sponsored heists, and when he wants out, the don says he can't; he, the don, now owns the paper on this guy's life. That's also what you have here; the company owns the paper on Wigand, and is trying to destroy him, completely legally. It's brutal, and it's terribly dramatic.\" </p> <p> Mann locates the film in paranoid political thriller territory; a kind of sweatier-palmed All the President's Men, with Pacino's Bergman standing in for Woodward &amp; Bernstein. It's one of the few major Hollywood products of recent years that's actually about something - morality, conscience, culpability - and which also has the temerity to prod American apathy in the face of corporate condescension. </p> <p>Given that it's also a drama about credibility - Can Bergman trust the insular and tormented Wigand? Can Wigand trust the story-fixated Bergman? Can anyone trust 60 Minutes not to bottle out? - some of the film's de facto participants have criticised Mann for being too close to Bergman, the one-time radical firmly ensconced among the New York media elite. Bergman acted as \"consultant\" on the movie, and, while Pacino forgoes his usual grandstanding theatrics, Mann admits that certain events have been re-jigged in Bergman's favour - while, for instance, Wallace is seen to capitulate at CBS's decision to kill the interview, it was actually he, and not Bergman as the film has it, who called Wigand to break the traumatic news. </p> <p>Mann concedes that \"there may be something\" in these criticisms. \"I've known Lowell for a long time, and he would occasionally bring me stories. In fact, we started thinking about a movie based on this arms merchant in Marbella that he knew. Then he began living through the Wigand thing, and it was my idea to do this film rather than his. You know, Lowell's integrity as a journalist is a function of his accuracy and his refusal to compromise, and that doesn't make for a real pleasant guy to be around sometimes. He's not real negotiable, and he can be a little irritating. We may have skimped on the irritation, but I was introduced to him by someone in law enforcement, who said Lowell was one of the three journalists in America that he trusted, because of that integrity. He could have stayed at 60 Minutes and cut himself a good deal, but he's now freelance, because he didn't want to tell his next source: 'Hang with me, you'll be fine - maybe.' Comparatively, everyone around him is shameless.\" </p> <p>It's safe to say that The Insider will not be on heavy rotation in Mike Wallace's home cinema - the veteran newsman has already informed the likes of the Los Angeles Times of his displeasure at scenes such as the one where he watches, rapt, a recording of one of his own interviews. \"I respect Mike Wallace,\" Mann insists. \"But a crisis like this throws what you're made of into high relief and, you know, even Mike Wallace makes mistakes, and guess what, there's nothing wrong with that. I think he doesn't like the film because it makes him seem too human; he has this idea of what his image ought to be which is very adamantine and two-dimensional. </p> <p>\"Actually,\" he continues, \"the thinness of these people's skins surprised me. I was like, what, they never faced a little criticism? They stick cameras in people's faces every day for the last 32 years and they don't like the attention turned back on them.\" </p> <p>More important, he says, was Wigand's reaction. \"That was the real responsibility, because Jeffrey is complex and awkward, and we had to construct his character on all these disharmonious elements. Like, he loves his wife, but can't bring himself to say as much; there's a lot of dysfunctionality in him. He's a proud man, which I think is why he did what he did. \"Brown and Williamson leaned on him like thugs, whereas if they'd finessed him, offered him a couple of hundred thousand dollars never to tell, I think they could have bought him. They challenged his dignity and his image of himself; they manufactured him to some degree. So the day of reckoning came when I screened the film for him; if he could say that that was how he felt, that the intensity of what he felt was captured, then that was my baseline. Same thing with Lowell. And they were both positive, which was gratifying. Because every other character is kind of secondary.\" </p> <p>Maybe so, but nothing is extraneous in Mann-land; the director likes to refer to a movie's \"genetic coding\" - an all-embracing helix of image and sound, character and story, that fuses everything, from the way a character dabs sweat off his forehead to the lighting of a suburban street to the music on the soundtrack, into a seamless whole. This exacting scrutiny elevates the pulpy, noirish elements of his material into something more elemental.</p> <p>Can you think of South Beach without thinking of the pastel slacks, avant-garde vehicles and skittish Harold Faltermeyer soundtrack Mann layered over it in Miami Vice? Can you hear In-a-Gadda-da-Vida without recalling the bleached-out, brutalist architecture of Manhunter and running to bolt the doors? The Insider's visual architecture is fittingly dense; blizzards of coded messages racing through buzzing networks, and portentous decisions taken in claustrophobic boardrooms (though they're not smoke-filled; this could be the most conspicuously cigarette-free movie about the tobacco industry yet made). </p> <p>\"Everything in a film is a part of the whole and acts on it, every colour, every object,\" Mann enthuses. \"You've got to get it right. To research this film, Al and I hung with reporters from Time magazine, and spent time inside a news operation: ABC, actually,\" - he smiles wryly - \"to imbibe that excitement, the way they'll put tapes on the air in minutes and field their worldwide correspondents on conference calls. And I had Russell do chemistry experiments,\" he chortles. </p> <p>Mann and his actors are a mutual admiration society.

      "bodyText": "There's a scene midway through Michael Mann's new movie The Insider where would-be whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, played as a sombre obsessive-compulsive by Russell Crowe, is walking around a lawn, locked in internal debate as to whether or not he should testify that his former employers, tobacco giant Brown &amp; Williamson, knowingly added cancer-causing chemicals to its cigarettes. Attorneys and police look on; the atmosphere is hushed; the tension excruciating. Eventually, Wigand walks up to his confidante, 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (played by Al Pacino), and says simply: \"Let's go to court\". This, in many ways, is a quintessential Michael Mann moment, as heartstopping as any death-defying Die Hard or Bond stunt. It's also a perfect illustration of the singular genre that Mann has carved out for himself - the cerebral action movie. True, he's as adept at choreographing bullet ballets as any number of John Woos - those who cowered and flinched through the protracted heist in Heat will testify to that. But the key scene in that movie was the verbal face-off between Robert De Niro's career criminal and Al Pacino's driven cop; two men painted into opposite but complementary corners by the force of their passions and their determination to pursue them, at whatever cost. Mann has been called a \"hard-boiled sensualist\", a sort of feng-shui'd Hemingway, and the term could equally apply to any of his anti-heroes, from James Caan's high-class burglar in 1981's Thief; through William Petersen's empathic detective in Manhunter, Mann's 1986 take on Thomas Harris's Red Dragon; to the cigarette-industry deep throat Wigand. Though, as Mann says in his throaty Chicago rasp, \"Jeffrey has to be the most confused and unclear character I've ever worked with.\" The Insider is based on the real events sparked when Wigand, former head of research and development at Brown &amp; Williamson, violated the confidentiality clause in his severance agreement by going public with his knowledge of the carcinogenic properties of B&amp;W's products to Bergman; Bergman then put his devastating testimony on tape in an interview with 60 Minutes' silky anchor Mike Wallace (played with brilliantined brio by Christopher Plummer). However, by the time the segment was due to air, Wigand had become a central witness in the lawsuits filed by Mississippi and 49 other states against the tobacco industry, and his marriage had fallen apart in the face of intimidation and threats of imprisonment from his former employers; at the 11th hour, CBS, fearing litigation, decided to pull the interview, to Bergman's dismay and Wigand's disgust. Eventually, the opprobrium heaped on the network forced them to backtrack, but not before Bergman had resigned, Wigand had succumbed to a near-breakdown, and 60 Minutes' vaunted journalistic ethics were left in tatters. It's far from a classic two-line Hollywood pitch: a Vanity Fair article on the case ran to 24 pages, and was filled with arcane references to tobacco industry practice and obscure points of law. What, then, did Mann see in it? He clasps his hands and furrows his already knotted brow. \"I thought the story was less about big tobacco,\" he says, \"than the effect on your life when someone decides to go after you, though in this case it was a large corporation rather than a gunslinger. Way back in Thief, you had James Caan getting into these mob-sponsored heists, and when he wants out, the don says he can't; he, the don, now owns the paper on this guy's life. That's also what you have here; the company owns the paper on Wigand, and is trying to destroy him, completely legally. It's brutal, and it's terribly dramatic.\" Mann locates the film in paranoid political thriller territory; a kind of sweatier-palmed All the President's Men, with Pacino's Bergman standing in for Woodward &amp; Bernstein. It's one of the few major Hollywood products of recent years that's actually about something - morality, conscience, culpability - and which also has the temerity to prod American apathy in the face of corporate condescension. Given that it's also a drama about credibility - Can Bergman trust the insular and tormented Wigand? Can Wigand trust the story-fixated Bergman? Can anyone trust 60 Minutes not to bottle out? - some of the film's de facto participants have criticised Mann for being too close to Bergman, the one-time radical firmly ensconced among the New York media elite. Bergman acted as \"consultant\" on the movie, and, while Pacino forgoes his usual grandstanding theatrics, Mann admits that certain events have been re-jigged in Bergman's favour - while, for instance, Wallace is seen to capitulate at CBS's decision to kill the interview, it was actually he, and not Bergman as the film has it, who called Wigand to break the traumatic news. Mann concedes that \"there may be something\" in these criticisms. \"I've known Lowell for a long time, and he would occasionally bring me stories. In fact, we started thinking about a movie based on this arms merchant in Marbella that he knew. Then he began living through the Wigand thing, and it was my idea to do this film rather than his. You know, Lowell's integrity as a journalist is a function of his accuracy and his refusal to compromise, and that doesn't make for a real pleasant guy to be around sometimes. He's not real negotiable, and he can be a little irritating. We may have skimped on the irritation, but I was introduced to him by someone in law enforcement, who said Lowell was one of the three journalists in America that he trusted, because of that integrity. He could have stayed at 60 Minutes and cut himself a good deal, but he's now freelance, because he didn't want to tell his next source: 'Hang with me, you'll be fine - maybe.' Comparatively, everyone around him is shameless.\" It's safe to say that The Insider will not be on heavy rotation in Mike Wallace's home cinema - the veteran newsman has already informed the likes of the Los Angeles Times of his displeasure at scenes such as the one where he watches, rapt, a recording of one of his own interviews. \"I respect Mike Wallace,\" Mann insists. \"But a crisis like this throws what you're made of into high relief and, you know, even Mike Wallace makes mistakes, and guess what, there's nothing wrong with that. I think he doesn't like the film because it makes him seem too human; he has this idea of what his image ought to be which is very adamantine and two-dimensional. \"Actually,\" he continues, \"the thinness of these people's skins surprised me. I was like, what, they never faced a little criticism? They stick cameras in people's faces every day for the last 32 years and they don't like the attention turned back on them.\" More important, he says, was Wigand's reaction. \"That was the real responsibility, because Jeffrey is complex and awkward, and we had to construct his character on all these disharmonious elements. Like, he loves his wife, but can't bring himself to say as much; there's a lot of dysfunctionality in him. He's a proud man, which I think is why he did what he did. \"Brown and Williamson leaned on him like thugs, whereas if they'd finessed him, offered him a couple of hundred thousand dollars never to tell, I think they could have bought him. They challenged his dignity and his image of himself; they manufactured him to some degree. So the day of reckoning came when I screened the film for him; if he could say that that was how he felt, that the intensity of what he felt was captured, then that was my baseline. Same thing with Lowell. And they were both positive, which was gratifying. Because every other character is kind of secondary.\" Maybe so, but nothing is extraneous in Mann-land; the director likes to refer to a movie's \"genetic coding\" - an all-embracing helix of image and sound, character and story, that fuses everything, from the way a character dabs sweat off his forehead to the lighting of a suburban street to the music on the soundtrack, into a seamless whole. This exacting scrutiny elevates the pulpy, noirish elements of his material into something more elemental. Can you think of South Beach without thinking of the pastel slacks, avant-garde vehicles and skittish Harold Faltermeyer soundtrack Mann layered over it in Miami Vice? Can you hear In-a-Gadda-da-Vida without recalling the bleached-out, brutalist architecture of Manhunter and running to bolt the doors? The Insider's visual architecture is fittingly dense; blizzards of coded messages racing through buzzing networks, and portentous decisions taken in claustrophobic boardrooms (though they're not smoke-filled; this could be the most conspicuously cigarette-free movie about the tobacco industry yet made). \"Everything in a film is a part of the whole and acts on it, every colour, every object,\" Mann enthuses. \"You've got to get it right. To research this film, Al and I hung with reporters from Time magazine, and spent time inside a news operation: ABC, actually,\" - he smiles wryly - \"to imbibe that excitement, the way they'll put tapes on the air in minutes and field their worldwide correspondents on conference calls. And I had Russell do chemistry experiments,\" he chortles. Mann and his actors are a mutual admiration society. Crowe, in particular, respects his bravery, both in his refusal to glamourise the truth, putting all Wigand's ambivalence up on screen - \"We're programmed to accept the guy in the white hat as the hero and the guy in the black hat as the villain,\" he says, \"and that's just not the reality of the human condition\" - and his creative approach to casting. At an initial meeting, Crowe was painfully aware that he was a 34-year-old Australian reading for the part of a 52-year-old American; on telling Mann that he thought it was a waste of time, the director stared at him, before leaning forward and jabbing his finger into the actor's chest, saying: \"I'm talking to you because of what you've got in here.\" For his part, Mann is modest. \"I've got tremendous respect for actors,\" he says, \"but I don't know if that's unusual among directors, because I don't know how any other director operates. But no, I love actors; they produce incredible stuff.\" Actresses, however, are a thornier question. Mann has been castigated for relegating his female characters to anaemic secondary roles - usually that of Frustrated Wife, as played by Ashley Judd to Robert De Niro in Heat, and Diane Venora to Crowe in The Insider - particularly when there are few directors as good at catching the seesawing rhythms of male-female intimacy. Perhaps it's a legacy of his upbringing in The Patch, one of the roughest areas of Chicago, which he describes as \"very aggressive, very masculine and very heterosexual\" (Mann has a certain Norman Mailer-esque academic pugilist feel about him); or his penchant for guy milieux, from the Chicago PD of Crime Story to the wild frontier of Last of the Mohicans. A mooted future project, a biopic of Howard Hughes starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is unlikely to redress the gender imbalance. \"I just go with things that consume my interest,\" he shrugs. \"It's not something I even think about.\" Whoever's peopling them, however, there's no denying the power of Mann's movies; now that the US tobacco industry is on its knees - the state lawsuits were eventually settled for $246bn, and others are pending - does he feel vindicated? \"This was never about getting the tobacco industry,\" he says, a little testily. \"This was about telling the very human story of these guys caught up in extraordinary circumstances. Hell, I haven't even given up smoking, much as I'd like to.\" He laughs. \"In fact, Eric Roth and I spent a year and a half writing this screenplay in the bar at the Broadway Deli in Santa Monica, because it's one of the few places left in California where you can smoke.\" And the world's foremost action auteur breaks into a deep, tobacco-stained laugh. \u0095 The Insider opens on March 10.",

      "body": "<p>It's not hard to see why movie-makers are periodically drawn to the story of Joan of Arc. There have been, by our count, 18 Joan films (starting in 1899) - probably more than there are about all the other saints combined. (And it's not for lack of thrills and dramatic punch. Pick up a History of the Saints some day, and you'll get a faceful of persecutions, executions, miracles, heroism and medieval intrigue.) St Bernadette has had a few shots at matinee infamy (and won an Oscar for Jennifer Jones), St Therese had a low-grade moment or two in the projector beam, and the apostles have played second banana in scores of Christ films. </p> <p>But in terms of pure allure, generational cool, sex appeal, bloodshed and merciless injustice, the Maid rules. Luc Besson's new Joan of Arc movie is simply the most visually hellzapoppin of the saintly subgenre, and the frankest when it comes to many of Joan's more puzzling aspects. As in, how could she have been canonised after she'd engineered and spearheaded so many episodes of limb-hacking warfare? Not to mention, as Joan's own conscience asks, why would God touch down and grace her for France's benefit? </p> <p>The Joan story is as familiar to us as G\u00e9rard Depardieu's nose, but for some reason no Joan film has asked these questions before. Most famously, Joan was a beatific martyr (in Carl Dreyer's still-great 1928 film The Passion of Joan of Arc); as a fiery pre-feminist battling the masculine ramparts (a little-too-long-in-the-tooth Ingrid Bergman in 1948's Joan of Arc), and a teenager in way over her head (Jean Seberg in Preminger's 1957 bungling of Shaw's Saint Joan). </p> <p>In each, Catholic ardour was a given, as was Joan's righteousness. Besson updates the scenario considerably and withholds any inkling of inherent spirituality and saintliness: he gives Joan a motive (the sister Joan may or may not have had is killed and raped, in that order, in front of her). He makes the battles hurt; he makes her heavenly visions subjective and palpable; and he ends up trying to settle the big questions once and for all by presenting Joan as a ranting, fiery-eyed zealot. </p> <p>After all, having visions can only mean two things: you're touched by God, or you're as daft as a shithouse rat. But we'll never know for sure what happened, how she was motivated, why the armies followed her, whether she was indeed mad. Besson's answers, despite all the Sturm und Drang , are hardly satisfying (though Milla Jovovich's hyperventilating performance remains startling and convincing). The problem might lie in the Joan story itself. Despite a flow of dramatic incident that would shame Stephen King, Joan's saga builds to a dead end, and if the crisis isn't spiritual (and here Catholic readers may leave us), it amounts to power run amok, piles of corpses, court betrayals and a final auto da f\u00e9. In Besson's movie, Joan is simply a runaway bus, and it takes an awfully long time for her to crash. </p> <p>Biopics often run into this dilemma - nobody would film the life of Christ or Frances Farmer or Buddy Holly or Michael Collins or Malcolm X or Andy Kaufman or whomever - unless it ended with a crucifixion of one kind or another. Thus, we know going in that a brick wall is in the offing, and we're headed straight toward it. Joan lived hard, died young and left a bad-looking corpse, which is the required arc of all pop biography. (Had Elvis died young, there would be a helluva lot more than a puny handful of TV movies about his life.) </p> <p>This formula is all fine and good, but also predictable - each of these martyr stories is, essentially, the same - and, finally, questionable: is tragic death the only justification we need to erect another pious narrative monument to Fate, Injustice and Humanity? Is that all a life needs to become a movie-story? More to the point, Joan seems to fascinate film-makers in directly inverse proportion to how much she fascinates audiences. In France, of course, she has humongous cachet, but elsewhere she's just a French-fried waif with a celestial twinkle in her eye. From a film producer's point of view, the hope that Besson's movie would fly in the US was foolhardy. All Joan films have been, outside of France, box-office stinkers. The American ones stank everywhere. (Poor Jean Seberg never recovered from the derision her debut garnered.) </p> <p>As a figure emblematic of French history and culture, Joan is unique; but since when did figures emblematic of French history and culture mean much to the rest of the world? (You must wonder, in addition, if the French recognise the irony of identifying with a 500-year-old warrior virgin either plagued by Christian fanaticism or old-school lunacy, or both.) Her story is indisputably juicy, but does it mean anything? Is it just another Middle Ages freak tale? (Take St Edmund Arrowsmith who, after renouncing an incestuous marriage, was named to the anti-Catholic British government as a priest, and was drawn and quartered for his trouble. Or St Wenceslas, an evangelising Slavic duke murdered by his own throne-hungry brother. Both of which, incidentally, have been forgotten by their nations, and neither of which has been portrayed in a single movie.) </p> <p>The popular opinion about French culture in the US, at least, falls into two categories: who cares; and who cares less. French movies are of little interest except for remakes; the market for foreign films in general has all but dissolved into the ether. French films - the reigning fashion in the 60s and 70s thanks to Godard, Truffaut and co - are in even less demand now than movies made in Belgium. English-speaking readers in the US have as much use for French authors as they do for French pop music. If you ask the average American to locate France on a map, you'd probably get pointed toward Moldova. Not that this is to his or her credit, God knows, but it certainly is a question the producers of Joan of Arc might have asked before writing out that deep-eight-figure check. </p> <p>Not that Joan of Arc is even, by any strict definition, a French movie. Besson is the most spectacular current task-master of the \"international film\", which has come a long way since David Lean took over Saudi Arabia with British actors for a year. Lawrence of Arabia was indisputably a British movie, but what is The Fifth Element? A Metal Hurlant -derived piece of nuttiness strangely, hypnotically, peopled with American actors, most conspicuously Bruce Willis with a gay bleach job. Besson's sci-fi epic had more French money in it than American. It was in every other way as French as garlicked snails, and while it made money everywhere, the freakiness of the thing did not go unnoticed. (That long interlude featuring the opera-singing blue octopus lady wasn't what most Texans expected to see in a Bruce Willis sci-fi movie.) Joan is just as scrambled: a French movie about a sacred French subject, with American, Russian and French actors, spoken in English. Who is Besson making the film for, exactly? </p> <p>Everyone and therefore no one, of course, just as his countryman Jean-Jacques Annaud has made a number of his \"international\" epics (The Bear, The Lover) without original soundtracks, all the better to be dubbed into every market. (It's a prevalent casualty of the pan-European film industries; there is no version of, say, Bertolucci's 1900 in which Robert De Niro, G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Stefania Sandrelli are all speaking with their own voices.) One cannot imagine the French appreciating the fact that most of the key roles in this newest and most lavish Joan movie have to be dubbed into French. </p> <p>Besson's movies (think La Femme Nikita and L\u00e9on, too) aren't French, and they're not quite wannabe-Hollywood, either. They're a lost hybrid, a prototype for a global commodity, designed to answer the entertainment needs of the whole planet. (Joan, seen this way, is even more of an uneasy choice of subject.) By the same token, the fact that Hollywood depends upon export markets for 50% of its profits has deracinated and homogenised its product as well. In the future, movies may have no country of origin and reflect no culture with integrity. Outfitted with cultural specifications from around the globe, they will have the featureless universality and acultural accessibility of rubber balls. (Or the Big Mac.) </p> <p>The irony of the matter is that film once naturally had a universal accessibility - before talkies. Silent films needed to switch only the title cards as they travelled from culture to culture. Otherwise, it was a matter of people and cinematic fluency, which is in its essence universal. In their desperate bid for commerce, the world's overgrown film industries are trying to return to the womb. Compare Besson's new film with Dreyer's old one; while the former struggles to sell its iconography to a world that's not buying, the latter tells us a simple, graceful truth we'll always need to hear.</p>",

Besson's sci-fi epic had more French money in it than American. It was in every other way as French as garlicked snails, and while it made money everywhere, the freakiness of the thing did not go unnoticed. (That long interlude featuring the opera-singing blue octopus lady wasn't what most Texans expected to see in a Bruce Willis sci-fi movie.) Joan is just as scrambled: a French movie about a sacred French subject, with American, Russian and French actors, spoken in English. Who is Besson making the film for, exactly? Everyone and therefore no one, of course, just as his countryman Jean-Jacques Annaud has made a number of his \"international\" epics (The Bear, The Lover) without original soundtracks, all the better to be dubbed into every market. (It's a prevalent casualty of the pan-European film industries; there is no version of, say, Bertolucci's 1900 in which Robert De Niro, G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Stefania Sandrelli are all speaking with their own voices.) One cannot imagine the French appreciating the fact that most of the key roles in this newest and most lavish Joan movie have to be dubbed into French. Besson's movies (think La Femme Nikita and L\u00e9on, too) aren't French, and they're not quite wannabe-Hollywood, either. They're a lost hybrid, a prototype for a global commodity, designed to answer the entertainment needs of the whole planet. (Joan, seen this way, is even more of an uneasy choice of subject.) By the same token, the fact that Hollywood depends upon export markets for 50% of its profits has deracinated and homogenised its product as well. In the future, movies may have no country of origin and reflect no culture with integrity. Outfitted with cultural specifications from around the globe, they will have the featureless universality and acultural accessibility of rubber balls. (Or the Big Mac.) The irony of the matter is that film once naturally had a universal accessibility - before talkies. Silent films needed to switch only the title cards as they travelled from culture to culture. Otherwise, it was a matter of people and cinematic fluency, which is in its essence universal. In their desperate bid for commerce, the world's overgrown film industries are trying to return to the womb. Compare Besson's new film with Dreyer's old one; while the former struggles to sell its iconography to a world that's not buying, the latter tells us a simple, graceful truth we'll always need to hear.",

As before, Mike Myers's spoof of a spoof is awash with bad puns, movie parodies and huge affection for all things 60s and silly. In addition to the return of his early Kinks outfit, Myers dons a lard suit in his third incarnation, Fat Bastard. This is one of many instances of familiar Brit humour - did Alexei Sayle and Paul Gascoigne forget to copyright the phrase? - which will be as novel to Americans as the word \"shag\".

Less jokes against British dentistry and a lot less Liz Hurley - whose replacement Heather Graham is always a plus - and the addition of Mini-Me, the miniature clone Dr Evil lives with in his inactive volcano - a new rival to Scott Evil, the \"Diet Coke of evil\" according to his dad.

There's another strategically-obscured nude sequence for Myers to display his Ryan Giggs chest-wig and the penis gag leading up to a celebrity cameo is funny once, but not twice in the same movie. And the product placement is shockingly blatant.

If that isn't enough verbal nudges for you, it's The Taming of the Shrew 90s-style, slyly mixing bits of original text (\"I burn, I pine, I perish\") with teenspeak: \"Put her in your spank bank. Move on.\" And why not? Shakespeare nicked all his plots. It's deftly done by two female writers and director Gil Junger, a TV regular on Ellen.

In a career that began script-writing for schlock producer Roger Corman, Sayles has turned his hand to a variety of stories in a myriad of genres. He's worked on alligator films, cockroach films, sci-fi pictures and Oirish fairytales. Yet at heart the man remains a sober and high-minded social chronicler: John Steinbeck with a dose of Bruce Springsteen. His most accomplished films (City of Hope, Lone Star) map out American tensions with a painstaking attention to detail, but with little in the way of filmic frivolity. Limbo, likewise, can seem a shade stiff and earnest at times, its cumbersome liberal agenda dragging behind. </p> <p>What loosens Limbo up is the undeniable authenticity of Sayles's vision (all framed by Haskell Wexler's ice-chip cinematography), plus some startlingly red-blooded acting from the two leads. Mastrantonio's bright, brittle singer moves as if her shoes are on too tight. Meantime, Strathairn's brilliantly subtle, soulful performance turns his odd-jobbing hero into a man choked by a perpetual low-lying grief.</p> <p>Most crucially, the director saves the best 'til last. His Limbo bows out with a devastating coup-de-grace - a cruel, dangling ending that sends you out of the cinema in a funk of mixed emotions. Does it mean triumph or disaster? The lady or the tiger?

Each of his recent comedic offerings has, in its own distinctively spine-chilling way, been remarkable. There was Patch Adams, in which Mr Williams suggested that gravely ill children can be cured by the healing power of laughter. Then there was Jakob the Liar, a sort of Mork-in-Auschwitz turn from Robin, about how the Jews in the Polish ghetto awaiting deportation to the death camps were able to keep their peckers up on account of Mr Williams's gregarious flights of iridescent fancy - rather than, say, because of their religious faith. </p> <p>Now, with his comedy Bicentennial Man, Robin has topped everything. He's gone one shattering step beyond. When the house lights came up at the end, the audience I was in just sat there, slack-jawed with silent horror, like the man in Edvard Munch's The Scream. I am virtually having to write this on an IV drip. Because Robin plays a cute android robot - that face dismayingly recognisable, though cased in metal - serving as a household butler in the year 2005, in whom manufacturing blips have induced lovely, quirky human character traits that make this cyber-Jeeves simply adorable. But he lives for ever, being a robot, and has to see all the people he loves, and who love him, grow old and die. This makes him real sad. </p> <p>Eventually, at the end of 200 long, long years, Robin has gained a sleek, realistic ultra hi-tech latex face and the great-granddaughter of his original owner falls in love with him, and just for her, Robin has a quasi-human corporeal obsolescence hard-wired into him so that, wrinkled and snowy-haired at last, they can shuffle off this mortal coil together on a his'n'hers death bed. That's right, everyone. He renounces his immortality for humanity: for you and me . </p> <p>The time has come to admit the truth: Robin Williams is the Antichrist of sentimental screen comedy. At the beginning of the picture, it all seemed so modest, just a little household drama. Sam Neill unveils this tin helpmeet to his suspicious family, and Robin starts clanking hilariously around, his limbs making those hydraulic whirring noises as he puckishly questions authority. The brattish daughter com mands him to throw himself out of an upstairs window; he instantly obeys, and then comes back in through the front door - but his motor functions are all screwed up! This is the cue for a bravura display of unfunny robotic acting from Robin: eyes blinking out of synch, jerking round, buzzy voice. It's a masterclass in being supremely irritating. </p> <p>A word about Robin's metal facial expressions. Basically, these denotations of sweetness, compassion, sorrow, and impish mischief, are all achieved by having his metal eyebrows arch quizzically upwards. This is unfortunate because it actually has the effect of underscoring how robotic Robin's expressions are in reality. </p> <p>As time goes on, Robin the sweetly non-paranoid android is allowed to make money making and selling wooden handicrafts, and then wants to buy his freedom from the master of the house. This is met primarily with gruff refusal, and perhaps it is some tiny unexpected restraint which stops director Chris Columbus putting a tin whistle rendition of Dixie on the soundtrack here. But, eventually, he's allowed his freedom, because the grown-up children shout things like: \"He's every bit as complex as we are!\" </p> <p>The real moment of horror arrives when technical innovations mean that Robin, who has hitherto had only a smooth Action Man-type groin, is allowed to be a \"com plete\" man. So he is allowed to get it on with Portia, his one true love. In the afterglow of robot-human love-making, they lie in one another's arms, and Robin farts, and they both giggle, babes in the post-coital wood. It is the kind of heart-warming, life-affirming moment that made me want to put my fist in my mouth and bite it off.

One very much hopes not.) </p> <p>And, all the while, 200 years go by, with no obvious historical upheavals such as war or plague, just futuristic cars whizzing over tall buildings in establishing shots. So Robin bestrides time and fate like a colossus, transcending the human condition, only to make a magnificent gesture for love. </p> <p>What next for Robin Williams? Perhaps, with a large moustache, he could be Friedrich Nietzsche, sobbing and embracing that horse in the final scene with many an acid quip. Or maybe he could portray Stephen Hawking's tragic decline from walking stick to motorised wheelchair, that uproarious routine buzzing out of the voicebox, using laughter as a solvent for the unified field theory.

But if you've watched him you'll remember that luminous energy. When he's out of shot you miss him like a lover. </p> <p>It was his year of screen in 1999. He was with Kathy Burke and Jennifer Ehle in David Kane's Camden-set comedy of sexual manners This Year's Love and starred in Peter Mullan's award-winning Orphans as Michael Flynn, one of four siblings embarking on a night of destruction and redemption. </p> <p>On the small screen, he made distinctive contributions to two of Channel 4's flagship drama series, playing the mercurial Dr Danny Nash in Psychos, set in a Glasgow psychiatric ward, and in Tony Marchant's Kid in the Corner, as the father of a child with severe behavioural problems. </p> <p>Today he looks like a hero. The suit fits. Fresh back from Warsaw, where he is filming Channel 4's Anna Karenina, in which he plays the Tolstoy alter ego Levin, his broad features and fierce eyes are all but obscured by a sooty flame beard. His pale red hair is probably softer than it looks.</p> <p>When he tells a story, his whole body animates. His hands were made for sweeping glasses off tables. \"I tell you what, I had a fab night...\" Two Polish bit-parters on Anna Karenina had taken him along to their drama school show. \"It was a smashing thing to go and see, because drama school in this country is such a microcosm of the business itself, really nasty and bitter and backbiting, but there it was really supportive. It touched me, just the warmth and respect they had for what they did.\" </p> <p>His own recollections of drama school are clear of rosy tint. More by accident than design, Henshall ended up at Mountview college in north London, after originally applying for courses in journalism and then art in Scotland. He was disappointed by the petty jealousies of the people there, he says. It taught him what not to expect. \"And also that I wasn't as bad as I thought I was.\" </p> <p>After six months of industry indifference following graduation, he headed north again, broke and unemployed. Following a stint with Glasgow-based touring company 7:84, he returned to London, basing himself in Brixton, where he earned a redoubtable reputation for his stage work. </p> <p>At the Royal Shakespeare Company, he says, there were \"great plays, two directors I wanted to kill\". He describes the RSC as \"a cross between an ivory tower and a sausage factory. I went up there with great aspirations and it's nothing like that. Bring 'em in, roll 'em out, directors who have been there too long and are too comfortable, or are purely there trying to make a name for themselves, which is no bad thing so long as its not at the expense of everything else.\" </p> <p>He prefers company work on films, he says. \"You get your joiners, your electricians, your painters, folk from the whole social spectrum, and I like going in every day and just being a member of the crew. I like the feeling that we're all working towards the same thing.\" </p> <p>That acting is his deep passion is palpable. Talking about his stage work, the vowels become rounder, as though they were almost too huge for his mouth. \"When you've got an audience, there's a silence in there that you don't find anywhere else. And it's really powerful. People are there listening with you and you're affecting them in some way.\" That passion for engagement, and the energy, confidence and control that it demands mark him as an actor. </p> <p>The son of a salesman and a nurse, Henshall grew up in Barrhead, south of Glasgow. \"Where I was brought up, if you were walking down the street and you looked at someone and they looked at you, you acknowledged them. I used to do that when I came down here and people would look at me like I'd just got out of somewhere. I hated losing that and now when I get back up to Scotland it takes me a couple of weeks before I stop being a wanker.\" Why didn't he stay? \"Because I didn't want to be in Barrhead for the rest of my life; nothing against the place but it was just limiting.\" The words explode in a torrent. </p> <p>There are two kinds of Scot, those of us who stay and those of us who leave. Henshall's is no heart-tugging tale of the lad o' pairts who departed the kailyard to toil and triumph before the southern footlights. It is about the size of the dreams your childhood gives you. </p> <p>Like many who refuse to subscribe to the notion of incorporeal, mythologised \"Scottishness\", he doesn't believe in a national identity. </p> <p>\"I do believe in my national identity. I'm very proud,\" he stresses, \"of what I come from and where I come from, and there are values up there that I like and that I hold on to: loyalty I suppose, and a sense of humour, and a lack of self pity. I've thought about being Scottish a lot since I left. I still find this incredible racism - you open up the [Evening] Standard or the Daily Mail on any given day and if you put black or Jewish there'd be a public outcry but because it's Scottish, it's OK.\" Does it make you angry? \"Yeah. But then I think anger's a good thing.\" It depends how you use it, I suggest. \"I put it in my work.\" he says lightly. </p> <p>His voice is the most beautiful thing about him. It is surprising like a landscape, it rolls from heathery to heinous in the same phrase. Henshall does not take kindly to having his personality interrogated. I am used to that peculiarly Glaswegian combativeness in conversation - I grew up with it. But with Henshall there is something more that is difficult to describe, although the things that make him angry - ego, stupidity, lack of imagination, most of my questions - are fairly easy to enumerate. It's not about power. Honesty can be violent. When he engages, it's like electricity in its focus and immediacy. When he doesn't, it's like a cuff round the ear. </p> <p>Henshall's latest cinematic excursion is the low-budget fable Fast Food. He plays Benny - \"someone who's doing his best\" - who returns to his childhood stamping ground and becomes embroiled in thuggery and thwarted redemptions. Henshall took the role on the strength of the screenplay and one meeting with director and writer Stewart Sugg. It's a revealing choice. \"There's something about Dougie that's very raw and very personal,\" Sugg says. \"He has a deep-thinking side to him and when you look at him, there is an anger. He likes to look for answers, he likes to be challenged, and he really engages with you. That's unusual in a person and even more unusual in an actor.\" </p> <p>\"Raw\" isn't always a compliment: there is a subtext of out-of-control. But those who have worked with him praise his professionalism to the skies. Screenwriter Simon Ings remembers Henshall recording the over-dubbed soundtrack to a short film: \"He had absolute control over his voice, like a singer. He would change a single inflection and it would be the right one. He's very economical.\" </p> <p>Raw is also about where he comes from. Over the past five years, there has been a growing metropolitan media interest in an alleged \"new breed\" of young Scottish actor. \"With Shallow Grave people realised that you could set a film in Scotland and it didn't have to be about leaky boats in the Highlands,\" he explains. \"Then Trainspotting made it fashionable. But then you started seeing actors not because of fashion, because they're great. Look at Peter Mullan - fucking fantastic.\" </p> <p>Henshall first acted with Mullan in 1990 when William Boyd directed the pair in an acclaimed double-hander based on the Ted Hughes poem Crow at Glasgow's Tron theatre. Now associate director of the RSC, Boyd remembers Henshall as \"Very quick, very sharp, very brave and very confident. Outrageously confident. He knows the effect he's creating.\" </p> <p>But ask Henshall about \"the Scotpack\" and you'll be lucky to finish the question uninterrupted. \"That's just a divisive thing made up by the media. It used to be Tim Roth, Gary Oldman, Dan Day-Lewis were called the Brit pack, then suddenly because they weren't all English any more they became the Jock pack, or the Taff pack, or the Mick pack. I've always wondered 'Where's the Sassenach pack?' or are there just not enough of them around to make one?\" </p> <p>How much of it is an accent thing? \"How much of it is a class thing?\" he counters. \"Scottish accents are still rough hewn beasts down here. I grew up watching EastEnders and Coronation Street and I never had a problem understanding a Manchester accent or a Geordie accent. I always thought it was my job to and if you're not quite catching it, then you listen harder,\" he spits. \"Whereas people down here say 'oh sorry can't understand it', and it's not my fault, it's your fault. But people always seem to understand 'Go fuck yourself', they understand that really easily.\" He leans forward. He's menacing. </p> <p>But there remains an expectation that Scottish actors are somehow edgier? \"That's a generalisation.\" He sighs. \"I can't believe you think that.\" I don't think it, I'm putting it to you. \"Well, I don't think it for the same reasons as you don't. Why would you be edgier because you're Scottish? Fuck 'em. I don't care.\" He could sound defeated, but he's not. </p> <p>There is a line in Mel Gibson's faux-Scots folly Braveheart that really rankles this man.

      "bodyText": "Charisma is too wee a word for it: his is a vertiginous presence. There is a violence about him that changes the quality of the air. He's not acting. Douglas Henshall is stormy weather. After a decade of notable stage work, it is in the last 12 months that the 32-year-old Scot has enjoyed mainstream success. But if you've watched him you'll remember that luminous energy. When he's out of shot you miss him like a lover. It was his year of screen in 1999. He was with Kathy Burke and Jennifer Ehle in David Kane's Camden-set comedy of sexual manners This Year's Love and starred in Peter Mullan's award-winning Orphans as Michael Flynn, one of four siblings embarking on a night of destruction and redemption. On the small screen, he made distinctive contributions to two of Channel 4's flagship drama series, playing the mercurial Dr Danny Nash in Psychos, set in a Glasgow psychiatric ward, and in Tony Marchant's Kid in the Corner, as the father of a child with severe behavioural problems. Today he looks like a hero. The suit fits. Fresh back from Warsaw, where he is filming Channel 4's Anna Karenina, in which he plays the Tolstoy alter ego Levin, his broad features and fierce eyes are all but obscured by a sooty flame beard. His pale red hair is probably softer than it looks. When he tells a story, his whole body animates. His hands were made for sweeping glasses off tables. \"I tell you what, I had a fab night...\" Two Polish bit-parters on Anna Karenina had taken him along to their drama school show. \"It was a smashing thing to go and see, because drama school in this country is such a microcosm of the business itself, really nasty and bitter and backbiting, but there it was really supportive.

      "body": "<p>As a public holiday, Martin Luther King Day gets treated like a second-class citizen. Half the states in the old Confederacy ignore it altogether, and so do many employers, or at least many white employers. I've spent MLK Day at home only once in the last nine years - and that was because the 1994 Northridge Earthquake demolished my office (remember when the school got bombed in Hope and Glory? This was better).</p> <p>Similarly, every major city has a street named Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, but you - and the people who have to live there - wouldn't want to walk down it after dark. And next month, February - the Tuesday of the year - is Black History Month. As any black comedian worth their salt will point out: \"February - the shortest month. Same old shit.\" </p> <p>So it's encouraging to report that the star, screenwriter and producer of this week's straight-outta-nowhere chart-topper, Next Friday, is Compton's own Doughboy, ex-Nigga With Attitude and rapper Ice Cube. Cube once opened one of his solo albums with a dramatisation of himself being strapped into the electric chair. Just before he gets juiced, the Man asks if he has anything to say before he's dispatched into the hereafter. I imagine Cube reading last weekend's box-office figures, raising a glass and saying exactly the same words: \"Yeah. Fuck alla y'all!\" </p> <p>No one expected this last Friday, that's for sure. Next Friday is the sequel to the middling hit Friday, which cleaned up a couple of years ago, especially on video. Neither of them exactly got rave reviews, but then again its intended audience, junior high school kids, is one that rarely if ever genuflects in the general direction of Pauline Kael, so big deal on that score. Next Friday is genially dirty-minded fun, following the laid-back Craig (Cube) as he moves from South Central to the white suburbs to live with his lottery-winning uncle and cousin, and to get away from the bad guy from Friday, who's now out of jail and in a vengeful mood. </p> <p>Ice Cube is settling comfortably into dual roles as an actor. On the one hand he appears in big budget movies as a mid-cast character actor (last time I saw him he was getting squeezed to death in Anaconda), and on the other he finances, stars in and even directs small, amiable movies likely to make a quick return if marketed right, particularly to the young urban audiences who already know him through his albums. This one made $17m on a minuscule $9.5m outlay - how's that for black economic self-determination? </p> <p>Cube also directed The Players Club last year and Next Friday's success may encourage him further in that direction. Players and both Fridays are part of that ribald, party-hearty, booty-chasin' genre whose inelegant, but very lovable line of descent can be traced back to the Hudlin brothers' House Party movies of the late eighties. Common ingredients are parties, dancing, shit jokes, fat people, hip hop, hugely libidinous homeboys, and girls with remarkably prominent buttocks and only a thong bikini standing between themselves and outright civil disorder. In short, all the essential elements of great Saturday night cinema (uh-oh, there goes my job at Sight &amp; Sound). </p> <p>Appropriately enough, the other big success of the weekend was also on an African-American theme.

      "bodyText": "As a public holiday, Martin Luther King Day gets treated like a second-class citizen. Half the states in the old Confederacy ignore it altogether, and so do many employers, or at least many white employers. I've spent MLK Day at home only once in the last nine years - and that was because the 1994 Northridge Earthquake demolished my office (remember when the school got bombed in Hope and Glory? This was better). Similarly, every major city has a street named Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, but you - and the people who have to live there - wouldn't want to walk down it after dark. And next month, February - the Tuesday of the year - is Black History Month. As any black comedian worth their salt will point out: \"February - the shortest month. Same old shit.\" So it's encouraging to report that the star, screenwriter and producer of this week's straight-outta-nowhere chart-topper, Next Friday, is Compton's own Doughboy, ex-Nigga With Attitude and rapper Ice Cube. Cube once opened one of his solo albums with a dramatisation of himself being strapped into the electric chair. Just before he gets juiced, the Man asks if he has anything to say before he's dispatched into the hereafter. I imagine Cube reading last weekend's box-office figures, raising a glass and saying exactly the same words: \"Yeah. Fuck alla y'all!\" No one expected this last Friday, that's for sure. Next Friday is the sequel to the middling hit Friday, which cleaned up a couple of years ago, especially on video. Neither of them exactly got rave reviews, but then again its intended audience, junior high school kids, is one that rarely if ever genuflects in the general direction of Pauline Kael, so big deal on that score. Next Friday is genially dirty-minded fun, following the laid-back Craig (Cube) as he moves from South Central to the white suburbs to live with his lottery-winning uncle and cousin, and to get away from the bad guy from Friday, who's now out of jail and in a vengeful mood. Ice Cube is settling comfortably into dual roles as an actor. On the one hand he appears in big budget movies as a mid-cast character actor (last time I saw him he was getting squeezed to death in Anaconda), and on the other he finances, stars in and even directs small, amiable movies likely to make a quick return if marketed right, particularly to the young urban audiences who already know him through his albums. This one made $17m on a minuscule $9.5m outlay - how's that for black economic self-determination? Cube also directed The Players Club last year and Next Friday's success may encourage him further in that direction. Players and both Fridays are part of that ribald, party-hearty, booty-chasin' genre whose inelegant, but very lovable line of descent can be traced back to the Hudlin brothers' House Party movies of the late eighties. Common ingredients are parties, dancing, shit jokes, fat people, hip hop, hugely libidinous homeboys, and girls with remarkably prominent buttocks and only a thong bikini standing between themselves and outright civil disorder. In short, all the essential elements of great Saturday night cinema (uh-oh, there goes my job at Sight &amp; Sound). Appropriately enough, the other big success of the weekend was also on an African-American theme. The Hurricane, which had already been in limited release for a couple of weeks, went all the way to number three (Stuart Little's still no.2) after opening wide last week. It's the story of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter (Denzel Washington), the early 60s welter- and middleweight contender who was railroaded into jail for 20 years after being framed for three murders he couldn't have committed. Director Norman Jewison cuts back and forth between the story of Carter's nightmarish experiences and their impact on Lazra, a young black Bronx teenager adopted by an idealistic group of Canadians. The first book the newly lettered Lazra reads is Carter's autobiography, which he picks up for 25c. By that time it's been out of print for years, and Carter has lost two appeals, despite the intervention of celebrities like Ellen Burstyn and Bob Dylan, whose 1975 song Hurricane features on the movie's soundtrack. Lazra and the Canadians are so appalled at Carter's story and, after visiting him in jail, so impressed by his gravitas and stamina that they move to New Jersey and work to turn up new evidence on which to base a third appeal. Whenever this thread of the narrative flags, Jewison cuts back to crucial events from Carter's biography: his stabbing of a child-molester when he's eleven, for which he's sentenced to an unimaginably harsh ten years in reform school; his persecution by a racist detective (Dan Hadaya, always wonderful, but occasionally lumbered here with lines like, \"I'm gonna take your black ass down, Carter!\"): the whole cheap, sorry cycle of frame-ups, lies and all-white juries that land him in prison for \"the remainder of your natural life.\" This dual framework serves the material well. The story of an idealistic black teenager provides a necessary contrast to the misery that was the Hurricane's lot for most of his life outside the ring.

      "bodyText": "A government bill was wrecked last night when the Lords voted by 222 to 126 to keep defendants' right to choose trial by jury. The vote came during debate on the criminal justice (mode of trial) bill, despite a warning from the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who said the bill would be ruined if the rebel amendment was passed. \"This isn't really a wrecking amendment - it's a torpedo amendment and there's nothing left of the bill ... if this amendment is passed there's nothing left at all at this stage.\" He insisted he himself would have been unable to support the bill if it did not include a right of appeal. But he shared the \"overwhelming, virtually unanimous view\" of the judiciary that it was a \"proportionate outcome in difficult circumstances\". He urged peers to consider the issue \"in a way that is unencumbered by professional, social and historical baggage\". Opponents of the change were operating on the \"unspoken, insidious basis\" that magistrates courts automatically provided lower quality justice, he declared. But the foremost Labour critic of the bill, Lady Kennedy, told peers: \"This bill is wrong. It's wrong in principle and that is why it is opposed even by those who are friends of the government.\" The Conservative home affairs spokesman, Lord Cope of Berkeley , opening the debate, argued that the partly reformed House of Lords, comprising appointed peers and elected hereditaries, had the authority to vote down the bill. Lord Cope, a life peer and former MP, added: \"Perhaps in due course there will be a different second chamber in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile we must do our duty for which we were selected, and each of us must decide the issue and vote accordingly.\" Lord Jenkins of Hillhead attacked the home secretary for claiming the Liberal Democrat peer had endorsed the ending of trial by jury. He said Mr Straw had \"called in aid\" the 1967 criminal justice act - which brought in majority verdicts for criminal trials - that Lord Jenkins piloted through parliament when home secretary in the Wilson government. That was done because trials were being undermined by the growing practice of criminals targeting the most \"vulnerable or amenable\" members of a jury in order to ensure there was no unanimous verdict, Lord Jenkins told peers. \"I cannot allow, I'm afraid, Jack Straw to claim my endorsement for this ill-conceived little bill so directly contradictory to everything which he and his spokesmen said in opposition,\" he said. \"I utterly reject the view that this proposal is in any way the equivalent of my majority verdict proposals.\" Mr Straw did not have much of a reputation as a liberal, Lord Jenkins noted. But he added: \"If he will accept the defeat of this measure ... with a good grace, if he will be less grudging on freedom of information, and if he will take less of a knee-jerk Daily Mail attitude to the whole complex issue of crime and punishment, then maybe by the end of this parliament his reputation for humane sagacity might begin to gleam a little bit more brightly.\" Labour's Lord Lipsey said the case for the government's proposals was \"overwhelming - not from a lawyerly perspective but from a wider perspective\". On the argument that \"black people do not trust magistrates\", Lord Lipsey said: \"Some of them at least may opt for jury trial in the hope that they will get an OJ Simpson. \"What they hope is that there will be enough black jurors who are fundamentally hostile to the criminal justice system. In my view they will be disappointed in this because I think all black jurors are absolutely as fair as white jurors but I think there is a tendency to do that and I don't think we should encourage it.\" Lady Kennedy accepted the need for more efficiency and cost effectiveness \"while protecting the rights of defendants\". Steps should be taken to crack down on abusers of the system - although Lady Kennedy questioned whether \"they are in anything like the number being suggested\". \"The aims I agree with are laudable.

Magistrates would be put in the \"invidious\" position of having to \"pick and choose those deserving of trial, so that trial becomes a privilege\". Lady Kennedy suggested there were administrative changes that could be made to the legal system to produce the same result the government wanted from the bill. She said: \"The reason why the amendment is put in this form is because we would have wanted to find another way but there is no other way. This bill is wrong.

They are relics of a habitat which emerged at the end of the second world war, became set in concrete during the cold war and is now gone.</p> <p>Kohl liked to be known as the chancellor of unity. He saw himself as the man who overcame the cold war and re-united the German state, in the teeth of doubts from Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterrand, though with strong help from the Americans. Yet now, as the system which he incarnated begins to implode in a welter of evidence of secret donations and campaign slush funds, we may come to see him, more accurately, as a figure of the past just as much as Egon Krenz. Far from being the first chancellor of a united Germany, Kohl's enduring label in history may be as the last leader of the Bonn republic and the last chancellor of West Germany.</p> <p>As the huge scandal unfolds some commentators in Germany are predicting that the party which Kohl led, the Christian Democratic Union, may be so damaged that it will split into a thousand pieces. They look to the fate of the CDU's sister party in Italy, which fell apart seven years ago under the weight of corruption. In the Italian case, the party was revealed to have taken cash for contracts in a mountainous tangle of kick-backs and influence-peddling, in some cases linked to the mafia.</p> <p>The allegations surrounding the German CDU have not yet gone that far. The fact of secret donations to the party from wealthy businessmen is clear, but inquiries are under way into who made them and what, if any, the paybacks were. The tag of \"Don Kohleone\" which some are sticking on the former chancellor may turn out to be justified, but it is too early to be sure.</p> <p>Already, though, two things stand out. In today's Europe parties with a religious or confessional identity at their core will have an increasingly hard time surviving. In its 50 years of existence the CDU has done too little to reform either its internal structures or the 1945-era ideology with which it began life. Like the Italian Christian Democrats, the CDU was cobbled together as a party of the centre right by the victorious western allies under Washington's leadership as an instrument to contain the threat of communism.</p> <p>The German Social Democrats, by contrast, had a long pedigree from which to grow when democratic politics revived in 1945. So too did the Free Democrats, the heirs of the old pre-war liberal parties. But the CDU's line of descent from the Weimar Republic's largely Catholic Centre party was tenuous. When the allies plucked the elderly former mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, out of retirement to run the CDU and become West Germany's first chancellor, they were giving him a new machine with little institutional memory and few other cadres with a genuine anti-fascist past.</p> <p>From the beginning the CDU was a party without a strong membership base, which relied on business donations for most of its finances. That remained the pattern to this day. The CDU's assigned task was to reintegrate Germany's Nazi-tainted corporate elite and tame the danger of nationalistic resentment in defeat, something which the right was thought more likely to be able to pull off. With the allies' help, Adenauer steered West Germany towards a revival of close ties with France as well as a totally new concept for Germany: subservient Atlanticism.</p> <p>The underpinning was Adenauer's almost obsessive suspicion of Russia, his hatred of communism, and fear of \"the east\". In this, Helmut Kohl was always Adenauer's child. He was the last western politician to recognise Gorbachev's reforms were serious. When even Reagan was beginning to understand they were not just cosmetic, Kohl was calling Gorbachev, in a monumentally insensitive comparison, \"a propagandist as good as Goebbels\". In the last months before German unification, Kohl had to be pressed by the Americans to accept the post-1945 settlement of Poland's western frontier at the expense of ancient German territory in definitive treaty form. Otherwise Washington would not support his drive for unity.</p> <p>The old instincts clung to Kohl. At a campaign rally in Rostock in the election of autumn 1994 I watched him in disbelief. While the rest of the world was preparing to celebrate a half century since the liberation from fascism, Kohl told his audience it would soon be 50 years since Russian forces broke through on to German territory in East Prussia \"with all the terror and rapes that you know\".</p> <p>Just as the CDU began life and, as we now see, continued it on the basis of secret campaign donations Kohl the statesman, like Kohl the party manager, based his power on the use of money. If some of the undeclared funds went on building up CDU structures in East Germany, in a larger and more significant sense Kohl bought German unity. In the 80s he had already bought the East German leadership with a series of governmental loans, rightly suspecting that the flood of West German marks into the economy would create distortions and jealousies that would undermine what loyalty remained to the communist system.</p> <p>In the spring of 1990 he bribed East German voters with the chance to change their Ostmarks for Westmarks at a rate of one to one, a policy of financial recklessness which shocked the then chairman of the Bundesbank and put a huge burden on West Germans. Later that year Kohl bought Gorbachev's assent to united Germany's membership in Nato by offering millions of marks to relocate Soviet troops back to Russia.</p> <p>It was crude, and it worked. But Kohl failed to transcend this mechanical unification of Germany and create a mutually reconciled society in which East Germans would not feel they had been simply annexed. In the first pan-German poll of December 1990 the unity chancellor's CDU got a smaller share of the votes than at any election since 1949.</p> <p>As time went on, his promise of \"flourishing landscapes\" in East Germany became increasingly hollow. Kohl was not the only West German to behave with arrogance towards the East, but he was the man in charge and deserves the blame. As CDU leader he failed to modernise his party's inner workings by finding new and transparent sources of finance just as, when chancellor, he failed to understand the social and psychological legacy of East Germany. On both issues he will be remembered as a prisoner of the past.</p>",

Otherwise Washington would not support his drive for unity. The old instincts clung to Kohl. At a campaign rally in Rostock in the election of autumn 1994 I watched him in disbelief. While the rest of the world was preparing to celebrate a half century since the liberation from fascism, Kohl told his audience it would soon be 50 years since Russian forces broke through on to German territory in East Prussia \"with all the terror and rapes that you know\". Just as the CDU began life and, as we now see, continued it on the basis of secret campaign donations Kohl the statesman, like Kohl the party manager, based his power on the use of money. If some of the undeclared funds went on building up CDU structures in East Germany, in a larger and more significant sense Kohl bought German unity. In the 80s he had already bought the East German leadership with a series of governmental loans, rightly suspecting that the flood of West German marks into the economy would create distortions and jealousies that would undermine what loyalty remained to the communist system. In the spring of 1990 he bribed East German voters with the chance to change their Ostmarks for Westmarks at a rate of one to one, a policy of financial recklessness which shocked the then chairman of the Bundesbank and put a huge burden on West Germans. Later that year Kohl bought Gorbachev's assent to united Germany's membership in Nato by offering millions of marks to relocate Soviet troops back to Russia. It was crude, and it worked. But Kohl failed to transcend this mechanical unification of Germany and create a mutually reconciled society in which East Germans would not feel they had been simply annexed. In the first pan-German poll of December 1990 the unity chancellor's CDU got a smaller share of the votes than at any election since 1949. As time went on, his promise of \"flourishing landscapes\" in East Germany became increasingly hollow. Kohl was not the only West German to behave with arrogance towards the East, but he was the man in charge and deserves the blame. As CDU leader he failed to modernise his party's inner workings by finding new and transparent sources of finance just as, when chancellor, he failed to understand the social and psychological legacy of East Germany. On both issues he will be remembered as a prisoner of the past.",

      "bodyText": "Chechen rebels claimed yesterday to have captured one of Russia's most powerful generals in charge of leading the assault on Grozny, inflicting an acute new humiliation on the struggling Russian army. If confirmed, the capture of Major-General Mikhail Malofeyev will mark one of the gravest setbacks yet for the Russian campaign. The general is said to have fallen into the hands of guerrillas as he led a reconnaissance trip into Grozny late on Tuesday. Announcing the capture on a rebel television station, the Chechen warlord, Shamil Basayev, said Gen Malofeyev had been taken to a secret location outside the besieged capital where he was being questioned. Military sources said last night that they did not know whether the general was alive or dead. Officials revealed that he had been wounded by sniper fire when his division was ambushed in the north-west of the capital, but said his subsequent fate was unknown; he has been classified missing in action and the army has already launched a search mission for him. One of Russia's top 10 generals in Chechnya, Gen Malofeyev was the deputy commander of the northern front in Chechnya. His disappearance came as Chechen rebels offered fierce resistance against the Russian onslaught on Grozny. New pictures emerging from the city show the true, graphic extent of the devastation caused by the battle for control of the city. Bitter street fighting raged throughout the capital yesterday as Russian infantry advanced from several directions, struggling to drive out rebels from the city centre. The fierce Russian ground attack was being backed by heavy artillery and Russian warplanes that bombarded the city centre. A cloud of dust hung over the city as buildings crumbled into rubble beneath the onslaught, while Chechen and Russian fighters spent the day exchanging fire from neighbouring buildings in the north-west of Grozny. Highly contradictory information has emerged about the success of the Russian advance; some Russian officers claimed that rebels were running out of ammunition and attempting to break out of the city, while other military sources said it was impossible even to inch forward under the heavy Chechen fire from rebel snipers, firing from positions high up in the buildings that were still standing. Early reports that Russian forces had managed to seize the strategic and symbolically crucial landmark, Minutka Square, later proved unfounded, and guerrillas continued to be active in areas of the capital nominally under Russian control. While Russia claimed to have taken several important tactical targets, the Chechen rebel spokesman, Movladi Udugov, indicated that Russian advances had been slight and losses huge. Bislan Gantamirov, the commander of a pro-Moscow division of Chechen fighters, described yesterday's fighting as \"extremely heavy\" and reported that control of the city was in constant flux, with some areas frequently changing hands. As many as 40,000 civilians, experiencing extremely restricted access to food or clean water, are believed to remain trapped inside the besieged capital. With aid agencies denied access and prevented from dispatching supplies through Russian lines into the capital, their plight remains severe. After a day of intense fighting, both sides admitted unusually high casualty levels. One Russian officer said that about 20 members of a single regiment had been killed overnight by rebels who had made their way through sewage tunnels to strike the conscripts from behind as they tried to advance through north-west Grozny. Chechen rebel sources revealed that 45 guerrillas had been killed and 60 wounded in the latest assault on Grozny, far more than reported on one occasion since the fighting began in September. The military is under increased pressure to seize the capital soon, in order to distract public attention from the mounting casualty levels, and also to ensure that some kind of victory can be announced to the electorate ahead of Russia's presidential elections on March 26. Fighting also continued yesterday in the mountain re gions of Chechnya south of the capital. With casualties among local residents reported to be high, elders from the village of Duba-Yurt yesterday pleaded with Russian officers for an end to the shelling. Meanwhile, after a two-day fact-finding mission into human rights abuses in the region, a delegation from the Council of Europe urged Russia to call a ceasefire and to find a political solution to the conflict. The resident of the council's parliamentary assembly, Lord Russell-Johnston, said Russia's suspension from the human rights body as a result of its offensive in Chechnya would be discussed in Strasbourg next week. \"We are not ready to recommend any such action as far as I know,\" Lord Russell-Johnston said. \"But it is something which continues to be an option... while the fighting goes on.\"",

A choking, grey steam rose as shopkeepers dug through the rubble of 87 market stalls burned to the ground the night before.</p> <p>Residents and merchants in Pattan said Indian army troops had set fire to their market in anger after two soldiers were shot by guerrillas. The troops stopped fire engines from approaching for five hours, witnesses said. By the time the firefighters arrived, there was nothing left.</p> <p>Thirteen people died recently in a bomb blast at a vegetable market in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city, 15 miles south-east of Pattan.</p> <p>In Pattan, the rebels were targeting soldiers who came to buy food there. But once again, it was ordinary Kashmiris who bore the brunt of a ruthless war between Indian forces and separatist Islamic guerrillas.</p> <p>Hardly a week goes by in the Kashmir valley without fresh violence. The body count rises almost daily.</p> <p>Just six months ago, Indian authorities claimed they had vanquished the guerrilla movement. A decade of counter-insurgency campaigns had left most Kashmiri rebels dead or behind bars.</p> <p>Today, a newly revived rebel movement has Indian forces on the defensive. It is better armed, better trained and more daring.</p> <p>The operating methods of these new guerrillas are secretive and spectacular. In the past, armed squads would ambush military patrols or hurl grenades at police posts and run away. Now, they force their way into security facilities with guns blazing, seemingly prepared to die. Since November, they have attacked half a dozen security compounds in the region, leaving more than 50 people dead.</p> <p>\"For the first time in 10 years, the army is on the receiving end,\" said Tahir Mohideen, a newspaper editor.</p> <p>Indian military officials say that now the rebels are mostly \"foreigners\" from Pakistan and other Muslim countries.</p> <p>They belong to Islamic fundamentalist groups which aim not only to liberate Kashmir but to impose Islamic rule across the region.</p> <p>The security forces have responded with a vengeance. Counter-insurgency troops raid villages and urban neighbourhoods daily. Military facilities are being fortified with extra barricades and weapons.</p> <p>Popular anger against the Indian government is intensifying with incidents such as the burning of Pattan's market. And support for the guerrillas, however alien their origins and ideology, is spreading.</p> <p>\"This new militancy is very good for us,\" said Shabbir Dar, who owns a bakery in Srinagar. \"We Kashmiris have been sitting in our houses for so long, feeling lost and afraid. But we all want our freedom. So we say, welcome Pakistanis, welcome Afghans, welcome Lebanese, welcome anyone who can help us.\"</p> <p>Not everyone shares this enthusiasm. Political opposition leaders are uncomfortable about the \"guest\" rebels in their midst.</p> <p>This is because of the guerrillas' radical Islamic agenda; because their aggressive tactics rob Kashmiris of their victim status; and because their Pakistani origins reinforce India's longstanding contention that Kashmir's independence movement is a tool of Pakistan.</p> <p>\"We are working on the same battle, and if someone says they want to help my cause, it's hard to object,\" said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a senior Muslim cleric in Srinagar and chairman of the main opposition party, the All Parties Hurriyet Conference.</p> <p>But he added: \"It has come as a shock. A Kashmiri would never have thought of attacking a security brigade. These people are willing to do anything. It's a fully-fledged war.\"</p> <p>Indian military officials here insist that the new rebels cannot win against the 700,000 Indian troops in the region. They claim that most Kashmiris - who practice a moderate Islam - are repelled by the militants' violent tactics and radical agenda.</p> <p>But while many Kashmiris are wary of the foreign guerrillas, their bitterness toward Indian forces appears to be far deeper.</p> <p>\u0095 Washington Post</p>",

Residents and merchants in Pattan said Indian army troops had set fire to their market in anger after two soldiers were shot by guerrillas. The troops stopped fire engines from approaching for five hours, witnesses said. By the time the firefighters arrived, there was nothing left. Thirteen people died recently in a bomb blast at a vegetable market in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city, 15 miles south-east of Pattan. In Pattan, the rebels were targeting soldiers who came to buy food there. But once again, it was ordinary Kashmiris who bore the brunt of a ruthless war between Indian forces and separatist Islamic guerrillas. Hardly a week goes by in the Kashmir valley without fresh violence. The body count rises almost daily. Just six months ago, Indian authorities claimed they had vanquished the guerrilla movement. A decade of counter-insurgency campaigns had left most Kashmiri rebels dead or behind bars. Today, a newly revived rebel movement has Indian forces on the defensive. It is better armed, better trained and more daring. The operating methods of these new guerrillas are secretive and spectacular. In the past, armed squads would ambush military patrols or hurl grenades at police posts and run away. Now, they force their way into security facilities with guns blazing, seemingly prepared to die. Since November, they have attacked half a dozen security compounds in the region, leaving more than 50 people dead. \"For the first time in 10 years, the army is on the receiving end,\" said Tahir Mohideen, a newspaper editor. Indian military officials say that now the rebels are mostly \"foreigners\" from Pakistan and other Muslim countries. They belong to Islamic fundamentalist groups which aim not only to liberate Kashmir but to impose Islamic rule across the region. The security forces have responded with a vengeance. Counter-insurgency troops raid villages and urban neighbourhoods daily. Military facilities are being fortified with extra barricades and weapons. Popular anger against the Indian government is intensifying with incidents such as the burning of Pattan's market. And support for the guerrillas, however alien their origins and ideology, is spreading. \"This new militancy is very good for us,\" said Shabbir Dar, who owns a bakery in Srinagar. \"We Kashmiris have been sitting in our houses for so long, feeling lost and afraid. But we all want our freedom. So we say, welcome Pakistanis, welcome Afghans, welcome Lebanese, welcome anyone who can help us.\" Not everyone shares this enthusiasm. Political opposition leaders are uncomfortable about the \"guest\" rebels in their midst. This is because of the guerrillas' radical Islamic agenda; because their aggressive tactics rob Kashmiris of their victim status; and because their Pakistani origins reinforce India's longstanding contention that Kashmir's independence movement is a tool of Pakistan. \"We are working on the same battle, and if someone says they want to help my cause, it's hard to object,\" said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a senior Muslim cleric in Srinagar and chairman of the main opposition party, the All Parties Hurriyet Conference. But he added: \"It has come as a shock. A Kashmiri would never have thought of attacking a security brigade. These people are willing to do anything. It's a fully-fledged war.\" Indian military officials here insist that the new rebels cannot win against the 700,000 Indian troops in the region. They claim that most Kashmiris - who practice a moderate Islam - are repelled by the militants' violent tactics and radical agenda. But while many Kashmiris are wary of the foreign guerrillas, their bitterness toward Indian forces appears to be far deeper. \u0095 Washington Post",

Even if this is only partly true it represents a sublime piece of impertinence. Who do they think is going to fall for a tactic like that? True, this government listens too readily to Rupert Murdoch, but it surely knows naked self-interest when it rears up in front of its face. </p> <p>No one pretends that News 24 has been a runaway success. But it is barely two years old. It took CNN and Sky the best part of a decade to establish themselves. BSkyB was so bad in its early years as to be laughable but it gradually built up into the slick, professional (though still loss-making) organisation it is today. Good: in the media world variety really is the spice of life (in the view of all except BSkyB, whose idea of competition seems to be to get rid of it). BSkyB says it opposes the use of licence payers' money \"to prop up a 24-hour news channel in an area where there is no market failure\", ignoring the fact that if the BBC withdrew there would be no market at all in this sector since CNN is globally orientated. </p> <p>Critics of News 24 argue that its \u00a354m a year cost is wasteful compared with BSkyB's \u00a330m (though it is not clear they are comparing like with like). They may have a point. Certainly the national audit office ought to monitor News 24 closely to assure the taxpayers they are getting value for money. Yet is \u00a354m so very much for a 24-hour news service? If one of the fashionable web start-up companies proposed a 24-hour rolling news service with input from a network of correspondents around the world for that amount, no one would believe them. One such startup has $100m allocated for marketing alone. Perhaps Greg Dyke, the new director-general of the BBC, should rename it News 24.com. </p> <p>The subtext of all this is that BSkyB and other commercial broadcasters are lobbying strongly against the government allowing the BBC either to raise its present licence fee (hardly a rip-off at \u00a3101 a year) or to add a temporary digital levy. A decision is expected next month and the government is wobbling like jelly because of its desperate desire not to subject itself to a double whammy by alienating the Murdoch press in the run-up to the election and giving the Conservatives the chance to call the digital levy a stealth tax. Tony Blair should rise above this and accept that the BBC for all its faults has to be properly funded to prepare for the new age when digital TV sets will vie with computers to deliver TV and the products of the internet. </p> <p>The argument is not whether the BBC needs the extra money - it does, it does - but whether it would be better to increase the licence fee (still cheap compared with subscriptions to Sky) rather than sanction the digital levy, which may slow down the take-up of digital TV. If Britain is to exploit the worldwide potential of the digital revolution then we should switch over as quickly as possible (with poorer people subsidised from the money gained from selling off the old spectrum). News 24 has huge potential as more people switch to digital channels. And though it is getting better, Greg Dyke would be well advised to make sure it is good and cost effective. Meanwhile, those with doubts about the BBC need only think of the Murdoch alternative to start to see things straight.</p>",

Good: in the media world variety really is the spice of life (in the view of all except BSkyB, whose idea of competition seems to be to get rid of it). BSkyB says it opposes the use of licence payers' money \"to prop up a 24-hour news channel in an area where there is no market failure\", ignoring the fact that if the BBC withdrew there would be no market at all in this sector since CNN is globally orientated. Critics of News 24 argue that its \u00a354m a year cost is wasteful compared with BSkyB's \u00a330m (though it is not clear they are comparing like with like). They may have a point. Certainly the national audit office ought to monitor News 24 closely to assure the taxpayers they are getting value for money. Yet is \u00a354m so very much for a 24-hour news service? If one of the fashionable web start-up companies proposed a 24-hour rolling news service with input from a network of correspondents around the world for that amount, no one would believe them. One such startup has $100m allocated for marketing alone. Perhaps Greg Dyke, the new director-general of the BBC, should rename it News 24.com. The subtext of all this is that BSkyB and other commercial broadcasters are lobbying strongly against the government allowing the BBC either to raise its present licence fee (hardly a rip-off at \u00a3101 a year) or to add a temporary digital levy. A decision is expected next month and the government is wobbling like jelly because of its desperate desire not to subject itself to a double whammy by alienating the Murdoch press in the run-up to the election and giving the Conservatives the chance to call the digital levy a stealth tax. Tony Blair should rise above this and accept that the BBC for all its faults has to be properly funded to prepare for the new age when digital TV sets will vie with computers to deliver TV and the products of the internet. The argument is not whether the BBC needs the extra money - it does, it does - but whether it would be better to increase the licence fee (still cheap compared with subscriptions to Sky) rather than sanction the digital levy, which may slow down the take-up of digital TV. If Britain is to exploit the worldwide potential of the digital revolution then we should switch over as quickly as possible (with poorer people subsidised from the money gained from selling off the old spectrum). News 24 has huge potential as more people switch to digital channels. And though it is getting better, Greg Dyke would be well advised to make sure it is good and cost effective. Meanwhile, those with doubts about the BBC need only think of the Murdoch alternative to start to see things straight.",

How does that add up? At present there are roughly that number of life peers around, and Wakeham elsewhere suggests these unelected folk should retain their seats in a reformed chamber until the day they die. In other words, there will be no vacancies for the appointers to fill until the grim reaper has created them. It could take decades for the selection methods outlined yesterday to kick in. Or, to name another flaw, the three selection models set out in the report (proof that the commissioners could not agree among themselves) have elected members chosen not all at once, but in thirds.

      "body": "<b>'Filthy' prison infested with vermin</b> <br> The chief inspector of prisons reported yesterday that nearly 70 young offenders aged 17 to 21 were living in a wing of Rochester prison in Kent that was \"filthy, vandalised, infested with vermin and subjected to an impoverished regime in which the only constant was unpredictability\". <p>Sir David Ramsbotham also expressed \"deep concern\" at the poor treatment and conditions of asylum seekers, immigration detainees and other foreigners making up nearly half the prison population. Sir David said he had made a \"dreadful report\", and conditions at the jail had worsened since it was inspected five years ago. </p> <p>The prison became the first Borstal, named after a nearby village, early this century, but now houses a range of prisoners including young offenders, adult prisoners and detainees. Inmates reported mice and cockroaches throughout the wing, the staff rest room \"reeked of dead vermin\" and there was a \"foul smell\" in the TV room. Young prisoners had to wash their plates in two buckets of water just before mealtimes and had nothing to dry them with. </p> <p>Sir David also criticised the lack of clear guidelines on how the immigration detainees should be treated. A hotline which staff could ring to secure access to a translator had never been used, said the report, and it cited an Albanian put in a cell with a Pole, who was told to pass on information about the regime \"because both names ended in an 'i' \". </p> <p>The report did praise work done in the prison with sex offenders and a resettlement strategy which provided work opportunities for inmates after their release. Sir David said he would be returning in a year to monitor progress. </p> <p>In reply, the director general of the prison service, Martin Narey, categorically denied the jail was a \"filthy establishment\" and said he had recently made a lightning visit and found conditions \"entirely satisfactory\". </p> <p><b>12 years for \u00a350m fake cash plot</b><br> The owner of a printing plant was jailed yesterday for 12 years for leading a gang that printed fake banknotes and stamps worth \u00a350m. </p> <p>Two out of every three fake notes circulating between 1993 and 1998 were produced by the gang led by Kenneth Mainstone, 61, of Upminster in Essex, Winchester crown court had been told. Mainstone and his partner, Anthony Wilkie, 60, who was sentenced to three years and nine months, were convicted of counterfeiting and conspiracy charges following a three month trial in Winchester last year. </p> <p>Three others had admitted their part in the plot: one, Bernard Farrier, 67, died in prison of cancer, while Stephen Jory, 50, was given eight years yesterday and Martin Watmough, 47, was jailed for three years. Edward Burns, 67, a paper supplier, accused of being involved with the gang, was acquitted by the jury last year. </p> <p>Stephen Parish, prosecuting, told the court how Main stone was an \"outwardly respectable\" businessman who, together with Jory, ran the gang, which police nicknamed the Lavender Hill Mob. The fake notes were printed on a sophisticated four colour printing press at Mainstone's home. Wilkie supplied equipment for making perforations in fake stamps as a sideline to printing notes; he and Farrier had also intended to fake \u00a31 coins.The counterfeiting ring began to crack when sheets of fake \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes were seized at Farrier's home in 1998. </p> <p>Judge Michael Brodrick yesterday ordered that Mainstone and Jory's assets were to be seized to account for some of the \u00a31.5m they gained between them from the conspiracy. He also ordered seizure of the press used to print the notes, and the destruction of the notes themselves. </p> <p>Inspector Clive Merrett, of Hampshire police, said they were still looking for a man called Baron Menzel, 31, who was thought to be in the United States. </p> <p> <b>Jailed drugs workers begin appeal</b><br> Two charity workers jailed for nine years after refusing to name drug dealers operating at their homeless centre yesterday launched a fight to have their convictions overturned. </p> <p>In a case which has sparked outrage among homelessness and drugs charities, Ruth Wyner and her colleague John Brock, both 49, of the government-backed Wintercomfort centre in Cambridge, were jailed in December for five years and four years respectively for allowing the supply of heroin. </p> <p>About 50 supporters, carrying placards, gathered outside the court of appeal in London where their lawyers sought leave to appeal against the conviction and the sentences and tried to secure bail pending an appeal. Mr Justice Richards, hearing the application in chambers, reserved judgment to a later date. </p> <p>Outside the court, Brock's wife, Louise, said she remained hopeful of at least getting the sentences reduced. Her husband had suffered such extreme depression in prison that he was under constant watch to prevent him harming himself. \"It's been such a shock for him, a total disbelief at being put in prison,\" she said. </p> <p>The campaign to release the pair has gathered support from thousands of people across the country. </p> <p>The Wintercomfort charity's patron, the Cambridge university vice-chancellor Sir Alec Broers, said yesterday: \"I am deeply shocked and I do not understand the rationale of the conviction, let alone the sentencing. There appears to be a lack of understanding about the realities of looking after the homeless and I only hope that this injustice can be corrected as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>Stuart Turner, a former heroin addict who has been receiving treatment through the centre for two years, said: \"Banging up two people who were just trying to help people is a disgrace. Wherever there are drug addicts you are going to get dealers; that is a fact of life and you can't stop that.\" </p> <p><b>Lakeside elegy: Memory of Ruskin still burns bright</b><br> A ceremony to mark the centenary of the death of John Ruskin, the most influential art critic of the 19th century, brought together locals and literary pilgrims yesterday at his home in the Lake District. After the elegiac ceremony at Coniston Water, a lantern was left burning in the room where Ruskin went mad, seeing faces in the wallpaper, before dying of flu on January 20 1900. </p> <p>The lantern was lit in the church in Coniston where Ruskin is buried and then brought to the lakeside by schoolchildren following his carriage.

      "bodyText": "'Filthy' prison infested with vermin The chief inspector of prisons reported yesterday that nearly 70 young offenders aged 17 to 21 were living in a wing of Rochester prison in Kent that was \"filthy, vandalised, infested with vermin and subjected to an impoverished regime in which the only constant was unpredictability\". Sir David Ramsbotham also expressed \"deep concern\" at the poor treatment and conditions of asylum seekers, immigration detainees and other foreigners making up nearly half the prison population. Sir David said he had made a \"dreadful report\", and conditions at the jail had worsened since it was inspected five years ago. The prison became the first Borstal, named after a nearby village, early this century, but now houses a range of prisoners including young offenders, adult prisoners and detainees. Inmates reported mice and cockroaches throughout the wing, the staff rest room \"reeked of dead vermin\" and there was a \"foul smell\" in the TV room. Young prisoners had to wash their plates in two buckets of water just before mealtimes and had nothing to dry them with. Sir David also criticised the lack of clear guidelines on how the immigration detainees should be treated. A hotline which staff could ring to secure access to a translator had never been used, said the report, and it cited an Albanian put in a cell with a Pole, who was told to pass on information about the regime \"because both names ended in an 'i' \". The report did praise work done in the prison with sex offenders and a resettlement strategy which provided work opportunities for inmates after their release. Sir David said he would be returning in a year to monitor progress. In reply, the director general of the prison service, Martin Narey, categorically denied the jail was a \"filthy establishment\" and said he had recently made a lightning visit and found conditions \"entirely satisfactory\". 12 years for \u00a350m fake cash plot The owner of a printing plant was jailed yesterday for 12 years for leading a gang that printed fake banknotes and stamps worth \u00a350m. Two out of every three fake notes circulating between 1993 and 1998 were produced by the gang led by Kenneth Mainstone, 61, of Upminster in Essex, Winchester crown court had been told. Mainstone and his partner, Anthony Wilkie, 60, who was sentenced to three years and nine months, were convicted of counterfeiting and conspiracy charges following a three month trial in Winchester last year. Three others had admitted their part in the plot: one, Bernard Farrier, 67, died in prison of cancer, while Stephen Jory, 50, was given eight years yesterday and Martin Watmough, 47, was jailed for three years. Edward Burns, 67, a paper supplier, accused of being involved with the gang, was acquitted by the jury last year. Stephen Parish, prosecuting, told the court how Main stone was an \"outwardly respectable\" businessman who, together with Jory, ran the gang, which police nicknamed the Lavender Hill Mob. The fake notes were printed on a sophisticated four colour printing press at Mainstone's home. Wilkie supplied equipment for making perforations in fake stamps as a sideline to printing notes; he and Farrier had also intended to fake \u00a31 coins.The counterfeiting ring began to crack when sheets of fake \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes were seized at Farrier's home in 1998. Judge Michael Brodrick yesterday ordered that Mainstone and Jory's assets were to be seized to account for some of the \u00a31.5m they gained between them from the conspiracy. He also ordered seizure of the press used to print the notes, and the destruction of the notes themselves. Inspector Clive Merrett, of Hampshire police, said they were still looking for a man called Baron Menzel, 31, who was thought to be in the United States. Jailed drugs workers begin appeal Two charity workers jailed for nine years after refusing to name drug dealers operating at their homeless centre yesterday launched a fight to have their convictions overturned. In a case which has sparked outrage among homelessness and drugs charities, Ruth Wyner and her colleague John Brock, both 49, of the government-backed Wintercomfort centre in Cambridge, were jailed in December for five years and four years respectively for allowing the supply of heroin. About 50 supporters, carrying placards, gathered outside the court of appeal in London where their lawyers sought leave to appeal against the conviction and the sentences and tried to secure bail pending an appeal. Mr Justice Richards, hearing the application in chambers, reserved judgment to a later date. Outside the court, Brock's wife, Louise, said she remained hopeful of at least getting the sentences reduced. Her husband had suffered such extreme depression in prison that he was under constant watch to prevent him harming himself. \"It's been such a shock for him, a total disbelief at being put in prison,\" she said. The campaign to release the pair has gathered support from thousands of people across the country. The Wintercomfort charity's patron, the Cambridge university vice-chancellor Sir Alec Broers, said yesterday: \"I am deeply shocked and I do not understand the rationale of the conviction, let alone the sentencing. There appears to be a lack of understanding about the realities of looking after the homeless and I only hope that this injustice can be corrected as soon as possible.\" Stuart Turner, a former heroin addict who has been receiving treatment through the centre for two years, said: \"Banging up two people who were just trying to help people is a disgrace. Wherever there are drug addicts you are going to get dealers; that is a fact of life and you can't stop that.\" Lakeside elegy: Memory of Ruskin still burns bright A ceremony to mark the centenary of the death of John Ruskin, the most influential art critic of the 19th century, brought together locals and literary pilgrims yesterday at his home in the Lake District. After the elegiac ceremony at Coniston Water, a lantern was left burning in the room where Ruskin went mad, seeing faces in the wallpaper, before dying of flu on January 20 1900. The lantern was lit in the church in Coniston where Ruskin is buried and then brought to the lakeside by schoolchildren following his carriage. The lantern was carried across the water in the Jumping Jenny, the boat built for Ruskin, to Brantwood on the opposite bank, his last home. Yesterday was the first in a series of centenary events, including recitals, plays, television programmes and an exhibition at the Tate Gallery. His admirers at yesterday's ceremony included David Barrie, director of the National Art Collections Fund, and the art historian Robert Hewison. Monkeys kiss and make up Feuding couples are not alone in kissing and making up after an argument, research at Chester zoo has found. Primates do it too. Filippo Aureli, an animal behaviour specialist at Liverpool John Moores university, made the discovery in studying groups of chimpanzees and spider monkeys.

At Chester zoo the males, while patrolling their communities because of the fierce competition for females, formed strong bonds with their fellow primates. But Dr Aureli said conflicts over food, mates or space could escalate to aggression. \"It's all about how much you need the others in your group.

Doctors seek wider use of IVF Many more women could receive infertility treatment on the NHS if measures were taken to prevent triplet births, specialists said yesterday at the launch of new guidelines. At present, IVF clinics place up to three embryos in the womb after fertilisation with the partner's sperm in the laboratory. The Royal College of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians said that that could be reduced to two without lessening most women's chances of a baby. If the savings to the NHS were ploughed back into the IVF programme, some of the inequities in fertility treatment - which is available on the NHS in some areas - could be removed. Allan Templeton, secretary of the college, which has spent three years putting together the guidelines at the request of the department of health, said the changes would dramatically cut the unacceptably high multiple birth rate. \"Triplets cost the NHS nine times as much as a single or a twin birth. The financial, social and psychological impact on the parents is also very high and triplets have a considerably higher mortality and disability rate. \"The saving from reducing the triplet birth rate would pretty well pay for all the IVF treatment carried out in this country on the NHS at this time.\" One in seven couples in the UK have problems conceiving a child.

Judy Owen, 39, resigned three weeks into her job as a training manager at the PGA's Sutton Coldfield headquarters after being told by her manager that \"women don't wear trousers at the PGA\". An industrial tribunal in Birmingham found that the association had discriminated against Mrs Owen by applying standards of dress to women that it did not equally apply to men.

Detectives, who said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the killing, would not confirm that the boy is a brother or half brother of the murdered infant. The baby suffered severe stab injuries, according to ambulance staff. Police officers tried to revive the child after they were called to his home in the Hartcliffe area of Bristol on Wednesday afternoon but the boy was certified dead on arrival at Bristol children's hospital. A postmortem was being carried out yesterday by a home office pathologist. Forensic experts were carrying out a search of the bereaved family's three storey housing association home. The house was sealed off with blue and white tape as detectives carried out their examination. The family moved into the modern, brick-built property from another part of Bristol last summer. They do not appear to have been particularly well known in the area. The family's next door neighbours were too upset to talk about the tragedy. But other local residents talked of their horror at what had happened. \"I have felt physically sick all day,\" one woman said. \"It's just so tragic and appalling.\" A woman living a few houses away said the first she knew that anything was wrong was when she left her house to see police cars and an ambulance outside the family's home. \"It made me feel sick when I heard about what had happened. \"It was was like I had lost one of my own children.\" One young mother, who asked not to be named, said: \"It must be every mother's nightmare. \"I just can't begin to imagine how I would cope if it happened to me.\" Police are understood to have discovered the baby in an upstairs room of the four bedroom property. A weapon was later recovered from the scene. Hartcliffe, on the south western fringes of Bristol, is a mix of prewar and modern council and housing association properties. The estate hit the headlines in July 1992 when the death of two joyriders who had stolen a police motorbike sparked several days of rioting. The two men died after colliding head on with a police car following a high-speed chase. Locals blamed the police for their deaths and took to the streets, looting shops and fighting running battles with riot police.",

      "body": "<p>The Wakeham commission's blueprint for the reformed House of Lords sets out the case for what it argues is \"radical evolutionary change which will contribute to better government for all\".</p> <p>Its 216-page report, A House for the Future, contains 132 recommendations that the commission claimed to be \"persuasive and intellectually coherent but also workable, durable and politically realistic\".</p> <p>If implemented, the document says, no new member of the second chamber would arrive there on the same basis as any existing member of the upper house.</p> <p>The royal commission proposes a second chamber of around 550 members - the majority of whom would be chosen by an independent appointments commission, and the rest drawn from the regions by selection or direct election.</p> <p>Members would no longer be known as peers, and those who have been made peers through the honours list would not be members.</p> <p>The composition of the chamber as a whole would be regularly adjusted to reflect the balance of political opinion within the country.</p> <p>There would also be targets to reflect more closely the UK's gender, ethnic and faith mix, with the goal of including members from all over the country and \"all walks of life\".</p> <p>The commission recommends the reformed chamber should be \"at least as powerful as the present House of Lords\" in providing a check upon the executive, with scope to examine human rights and constitutional issues.</p> <p>Its elected element should \"provide a voice\" for the UK's nations and regions.</p> <p>Overall the recommended upper house would be \"authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the United Kingdom\".</p> <p><b>Guide to the new power house</b></p> <p><b> Composition</b><br> The make-up, in particular the balance between elected and appointed members, was the most significant and most contentious issue the commission had to consider. Though the panel agreed on a mainly appointed chamber, with a minority of regional members chosen by selection or election, it failed to reach consensus on the number and selection method of regional members and instead offers three options.</p> <p>After consultation and exploring options, the commission recommended a chamber of around 550 members - smaller than the unreformed house but not as small as many wished - with most appointed by an independent commission and a minority of between 65 and 195 to be elected or selected on a regional basis. Appointed members would serve for 15 year terms, and regional members for three electoral terms, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further period of up to 15 years.</p> <p>An honours list peerage would no longer mean a place in the upper chamber, and members of the upper house would no longer be known as peers.</p> <p>There would be an end to political patronage, the commission claimed, with the prime minister and government excluded from the appointments process ,and selection based on merit. The resulting house would be required to be broadly representative of British society, and would be free of domination by any one party, thanks to a statutory minimum proportion of crossbenchers. It would have to reflect the voting preferences of the electorate at the most recent general election.</p> <p><b> Appointed members</b><br> There should be a \"totally independent\" appointments commission, the report argued, with no association with the prime minister or government. It would appoint all members bar the regional members, lords of appeal, and representatives of the Church of England, and there would be no parliamentary approval of appointments.</p> <p>There would be eight members of the commission, each appointed according to the Nolan principles and serving a maximum of 10 years. Three would be nominees from the main political parties, one nominated by cross benchers, and four independents, of whom one should be the chairman.</p> <p>This commission would be responsible for keeping the proportion of independents, or cross benchers, at around a fifth of the chamber's membership. It would be obliged to encourage appointments and nominations from under-represented groups, and report regularly to parliament on gender balance and minority ethnic groups. Commissioners would be charged with a \"pro-active approach\" to finding appointees, and the commission would be expected to consoutvocational, professional, cultural, sporting and other bodies, as well as publish criteria for appointment.</p> <p>The panel, normally making appointments on a half-yearly cycle, would have a statutory duty to ensure that at least 30% of new members are women (and at least 30% men), with the aim of \"steady progress\" towards a 50:50 balance.</p> <p>Among the politically affiliated members, it would secure an overall balance matching the political opinion of the country as a whole, based on share of the vote (not seats won) at the last general election.</p> <p>According to the Wakeham commission, it should be impossible for any one party to secure a majority.</p> <p><b> Regional members</b><br> Three options are proposed. Under Model A, 65 members selected by dividing up a regional allocation of seats according to each party's share of the vote in that region at general elections; one third of the regions would select regional members at each general election.</p> <p>Model B (favoured by the majority of the commission) would see 87 members, directly elected at the time of each European parliament election according to PR similar to Euro elections.</p> <p>Model C would provide for 195 regional members directly elected at the time of each European parliament election.</p> <p><b> Existing life peers and hereditaries </b><br> Existing life peers should remain for life, the commission concluded, which means the new-look house reflecting every sector of society will be slow to be implemented; however, it predicted that only a handful of life peers will still be sitting in 20 years' time. The 92 remaining hereditaries would be dispensed with, but could return as appointees or regional members.</p> <p><b> Religious faiths </b><br> A large majority of the commission recommended that religious representation be \"broader and deeper\" than in the existing Lords. Though the Church of England should continue to be explicitly represented, so too should other Christian denominations and other faiths.</p> <p>The commission proposed 16 places for Anglican representatives, five for other Christian denominations in England, and five for Christian denominations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At least five more should be selected to be \"broadly representative\" of non-Christian faiths.</p> <p><b> Roles and powers</b><br> The commission concluded the current balance between the two houses is \"about right and should not be radically disturbed\".</p> <p>It argued that the Commons should retain final say in respect of all public policy, while the second chamber should have sufficient power and authority to require the government and the Commons to reconsider proposed legislation and take account of cogent objections to it.</p> <p>The chamber would retain the so-called \"suspensory veto\" set out in the parliament acts, giving it power to delay legislation but not permanently to block it. As now, the upper house would be unable to prevent the passage of a Commons bill backed by the Commons in two successive sessions of parliament.</p> <p>While maintaining its right to delay flawed legislation, the second chamber would however continue to be obliged to consider government business within a reasonable time, and to observe the \"Salisbury conventions\" - the underlying principles obeyed by peers. As now, it would respect legislation in a governing party's manifesto, and would be expected to be sensible in using its powers to challenge the will of MPs.</p> <p>The upper house would lose its absolute power to veto statutory instruments, on the grounds it was never used by peers.

      "bodyText": "The Wakeham commission's blueprint for the reformed House of Lords sets out the case for what it argues is \"radical evolutionary change which will contribute to better government for all\". Its 216-page report, A House for the Future, contains 132 recommendations that the commission claimed to be \"persuasive and intellectually coherent but also workable, durable and politically realistic\". If implemented, the document says, no new member of the second chamber would arrive there on the same basis as any existing member of the upper house. The royal commission proposes a second chamber of around 550 members - the majority of whom would be chosen by an independent appointments commission, and the rest drawn from the regions by selection or direct election. Members would no longer be known as peers, and those who have been made peers through the honours list would not be members. The composition of the chamber as a whole would be regularly adjusted to reflect the balance of political opinion within the country. There would also be targets to reflect more closely the UK's gender, ethnic and faith mix, with the goal of including members from all over the country and \"all walks of life\". The commission recommends the reformed chamber should be \"at least as powerful as the present House of Lords\" in providing a check upon the executive, with scope to examine human rights and constitutional issues. Its elected element should \"provide a voice\" for the UK's nations and regions. Overall the recommended upper house would be \"authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the United Kingdom\". Guide to the new power house Composition The make-up, in particular the balance between elected and appointed members, was the most significant and most contentious issue the commission had to consider. Though the panel agreed on a mainly appointed chamber, with a minority of regional members chosen by selection or election, it failed to reach consensus on the number and selection method of regional members and instead offers three options. After consultation and exploring options, the commission recommended a chamber of around 550 members - smaller than the unreformed house but not as small as many wished - with most appointed by an independent commission and a minority of between 65 and 195 to be elected or selected on a regional basis. Appointed members would serve for 15 year terms, and regional members for three electoral terms, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further period of up to 15 years. An honours list peerage would no longer mean a place in the upper chamber, and members of the upper house would no longer be known as peers. There would be an end to political patronage, the commission claimed, with the prime minister and government excluded from the appointments process ,and selection based on merit. The resulting house would be required to be broadly representative of British society, and would be free of domination by any one party, thanks to a statutory minimum proportion of crossbenchers. It would have to reflect the voting preferences of the electorate at the most recent general election. Appointed members There should be a \"totally independent\" appointments commission, the report argued, with no association with the prime minister or government. It would appoint all members bar the regional members, lords of appeal, and representatives of the Church of England, and there would be no parliamentary approval of appointments. There would be eight members of the commission, each appointed according to the Nolan principles and serving a maximum of 10 years. Three would be nominees from the main political parties, one nominated by cross benchers, and four independents, of whom one should be the chairman. This commission would be responsible for keeping the proportion of independents, or cross benchers, at around a fifth of the chamber's membership. It would be obliged to encourage appointments and nominations from under-represented groups, and report regularly to parliament on gender balance and minority ethnic groups. Commissioners would be charged with a \"pro-active approach\" to finding appointees, and the commission would be expected to consoutvocational, professional, cultural, sporting and other bodies, as well as publish criteria for appointment. The panel, normally making appointments on a half-yearly cycle, would have a statutory duty to ensure that at least 30% of new members are women (and at least 30% men), with the aim of \"steady progress\" towards a 50:50 balance. Among the politically affiliated members, it would secure an overall balance matching the political opinion of the country as a whole, based on share of the vote (not seats won) at the last general election. According to the Wakeham commission, it should be impossible for any one party to secure a majority. Regional members Three options are proposed. Under Model A, 65 members selected by dividing up a regional allocation of seats according to each party's share of the vote in that region at general elections; one third of the regions would select regional members at each general election. Model B (favoured by the majority of the commission) would see 87 members, directly elected at the time of each European parliament election according to PR similar to Euro elections. Model C would provide for 195 regional members directly elected at the time of each European parliament election. Existing life peers and hereditaries Existing life peers should remain for life, the commission concluded, which means the new-look house reflecting every sector of society will be slow to be implemented; however, it predicted that only a handful of life peers will still be sitting in 20 years' time. The 92 remaining hereditaries would be dispensed with, but could return as appointees or regional members. Religious faiths A large majority of the commission recommended that religious representation be \"broader and deeper\" than in the existing Lords. Though the Church of England should continue to be explicitly represented, so too should other Christian denominations and other faiths. The commission proposed 16 places for Anglican representatives, five for other Christian denominations in England, and five for Christian denominations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At least five more should be selected to be \"broadly representative\" of non-Christian faiths. Roles and powers The commission concluded the current balance between the two houses is \"about right and should not be radically disturbed\". It argued that the Commons should retain final say in respect of all public policy, while the second chamber should have sufficient power and authority to require the government and the Commons to reconsider proposed legislation and take account of cogent objections to it. The chamber would retain the so-called \"suspensory veto\" set out in the parliament acts, giving it power to delay legislation but not permanently to block it. As now, the upper house would be unable to prevent the passage of a Commons bill backed by the Commons in two successive sessions of parliament. While maintaining its right to delay flawed legislation, the second chamber would however continue to be obliged to consider government business within a reasonable time, and to observe the \"Salisbury conventions\" - the underlying principles obeyed by peers. As now, it would respect legislation in a governing party's manifesto, and would be expected to be sensible in using its powers to challenge the will of MPs. The upper house would lose its absolute power to veto statutory instruments, on the grounds it was never used by peers. Instead, though the Commons would gain the final say, the chamber would gain more moderate but usable powers to delay, and demonstrate its concern about, specific statutory instruments. Making law The commission argued there should be no significant changes in the law-making functions. However, to prevent bad legislation rushed through the house thanks to limited parliamentary time, the report argues for more pre-legislative scrutiny of draft bills. It also suggests the second chamber should look at how to speed up consideration of law reform bills drawn up by the law commission. In recognition of the growing volume of secondary legislation, the chamber should maintain and extend its power to scrutinise statutory instruments, the report said. Protecting the constitution The chamber's role in protecting the constitution should be \"maintained and enhanced\", the commission recommended. One of the most important functions should be to act as a \"constitutional long-stop\", ensuring changes are made to the consitution only with full debate and a clear idea of the consequences. A restriction on further amendments to the parliament acts would reinforce the right of the upper house to veto any bill to extend the life of a parliament - preventing any government voting itself into permanent power. The chamber would gain no extra powers over constitutional or human rights issues or legislation, but would set up a constitutional committee to scrutinise constitutional implications of all legislation. There would also be a human rights committee to look at bills with such implications.With the imminent implementation of the 1998 human rights act, the report points out, parliament will need such a scrutiny procedure. Representing the nations and regions Whatever future developments in devolution or decentralisation, the chamber should \"give a voice\" to people from throughout the United Kingdom, the commission said. Under proposals for a minority of elected members, the reformed house would have representatives from all over the UK, but these would not be drawn from the devolved administrations, or from the Scottish parliament and the other devolved assemblies. However, the report stressed that the reformed chamber should not become a \"federal legislature\" supporting a \"federal government\", nor a forum for liasion be tween the government and the executives of the devolved Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The house would not meet outside London, but some committees could meet in regional centres \"from time to time\". Holding the government to account The commission argued that ministers should continue to be drawn from, and be directly accountable to, the second chamber. It recommended increasing ministerial accountability by requiring senior ministers based in the Commons to make statements to and take questions from second chamber committees when appropriate. There should be more scrutiny of ministers' handling of European Union business, with additional resources for the European Union committee. Though British MEPs would not be represented in the chamber, it should promote greater cooperation between MEPs and parliament. More broadly, the commission recommended that the chamber continue to be \"a relatively non-polemical forum for national debate\", and that specialist committee work, drawing on the broad spread of expertise held by members, should continue. It also proposes a committee to scrutinise treaties laid before parliament and to draw attention to any implications which might deserve consideration by parliament before the treaties are ratified. The law lords The commitee was asked to judge whether the chamber should continue to carry out judicial functions through committees of law lords. It concluded that, as long as certain basic conventions were observed, there was no reason to change the present arrangements. The report argued there were advantages in having senior judges in the legislature where they could be made aware of social developments and political balances that underlay most legislation. However, in the light of controversy over the law lords' vote on the case of General Pinochet (which threw up concerns over the failure of one law lord involved in the judgment to declare his association with the human rights pressure group Amnesty International) the commission proposed requiring lords of appeal to set out in writing and publish a statement of the principles they intended to observe when participating in debates and votes and when considering their eligibility to sit on related cases. Characteristics The commission concluded that, taking account of its role and functions, the chamber should \"above all, be authoritative, confident and broadly representative of the whole of British society\". Its members, according to the report, should have a breadth of experience and expertise outside the world of politics; particular skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment of constitutional and human rights issues; personal distinction; and the ability to bring a philosophical, moral or spiritual perspective and freedom from party domination. Nevertheless, though authoritative, the reformed second chamber should not challenge the ultimate democratic authority of the Commons. Titles and pay The commission concludes that, since the link between the honours list and the Lords would be broken, members of the upper chamber would no longer be known as peers. It floated the options of using the suffix LP (for Lord/Lady of Parliament) or the title senator, but made no recommendation. The report also stopped short of proposing a name for the second chamber, concluding that both titles \"should be left to evolve\". The commission proposed increasing the remuneration received by members of the second chamber to ensure they were able to afford to attend from all over the country and not only from the south-east of England. It argued that a clear link should be made between attendance and financial support, so that those who wished to devote significant time to parliamentary duties could afford to do so - without subsidising those who had a career and attended less frequently.",

The biggest teaching union, the National Union of Teachers, said trainees were already required to hold good grades in English language and maths to get on the course, and the requirement might deter entrants. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"We warmly welcome these tests. We are not talking rocket science here.\" Students who fail at the first sitting can retake the tests, but if they fail again they will not be allowed to qualify and will be unable to work in the state sector. Around 25,000 trainees will take the first tests in June using paper and pen. From February next year candidates will be able to take all three tests at any stage of their teaching course, using a computer. The standard of the numeracy test is midway between GCSE and A-level maths. The agency said that it had not yet decided on the pass mark, but hinted that, as the test was designed to measure \"competence\", it would be on the high side. Introduction of the tests was ordered by the education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, and was included in his green paper designed to modernise and raise standards within the profession. The questions in all three tests will relate directly to day to day work in the classroom. The agency's head of teacher training, Frankie Sulke, said yesterday: \"There is an increasing need for all teachers to be proficient in their application of numeracy, literacy and information and communications technology in their everyday work.\" The NUT general secretary, Doug McAvoy, said: \"What will happen to the potentially brilliant music and arts teachers who may not be brilliant at adding up?\" Mr Hart said: \"It is difficult to understand how anyone could remotely object to trainee teachers who will be handling numeracy in various forms every day in the classroom being required to show a basic understanding of maths.\" Out for the count or back to school Mental arithmetic 1.In a year group of 125 pupils, 80% achieved full attendance. How many pupils were absent on at least one occasion? 2. A teacher wants to show a 20 minute video, which must finish exactly five minutes before the end of the lesson. The lesson will end at 10 minutes past 11 o'clock. At what time must the video start? 3. A pupil scores 36 out of a possible 60. What percentage score is this? 4. A computer has an 800 megabyte hard drive. Some 435 megabytes are already used. A program is installed and occupes a further 120 megabytes. How many megabytes are available? 5. The entrance fee to a French museum is 12 francs. If the exchange rate is eight francs to the pound, how much is the entrance fee in pounds? Written questions 6. A teacher arranged for five groups of pupils to give short presentations in a session lasting 1 hours. The pupils were given 15 minutes to prepare at the start of the session. Each presentation lasted 10 minutes. There was a changeover time of two minutes between presentations. How much of the session remained after the last presentation? 7. For a GCSE subject, 20% of the marks were for coursework and 80% for the exam. Coursework was marked out of 95 and the exam out of 75. A pupil scored 68 for coursework and 65 for the exam. What was final percentage mark to the nearest whole number? a 74%; b 75%; c 83%; d 84% Answers 1. 25; 2. 10.45 am or 1045 hrs; 3. 60%; 4. 245; 5. \u00a31.50 or 150p; 6. 17 mins; 7. d.",

Only staff and accredited visitors are given access to the department, which contains 1m works. The museum admitted that nobody had seen the paintings since an audit in August 1998. The first clues to the paintings' whereabouts came last week when an informer tipped off the squad that they were being touted around by figures in the underworld.

These 27 officers spent the night in the prison. \"The next day [September 7] they were brought out after the work parties, that is to say 7.30 [am] and led off immediately down the path which led to the quarry where they were shot down by tommy guns and light machine guns. By 8 o'clock all was over.\" Lord Janner, secretary of the all party war crimes group which reconvened yesterday after two years, said: \"If he was a guard in the camp at the time, he should be asked if he has any knowledge of who murdered these British troops.\" Peter Black, of the US Holocaust museum, who has studied how Mauthausen worked, said: \"Mr Schweidler, like the others, is responsible for keeping the prisoners in the camp. He, like others, may have been aware that captured soldiers were shot.\" Perimeter guards, which Mr Schweidler claims to have been, were known to have escorted prisoners to their place of execution. Mr Schweidler admitted to the Guardian that he had been an SS guard at Mauthausen. He said a report filed to the SS, bearing his signature, in which he details gunning down two escaping Russian prisoners, was \"falsified\". In another document seen by the Guardian an SS guard says prisoners were chased towards the camp fence so that they could be used as live target practice.",

      "bodyText": "Government inspectors were appointed last night to investigate TransTec, the collapsed engineering group founded by the former Labour treasury minister Geoffrey Robinson. Chartered accountant Hugh Alous and barrister Roger Kaye QC have been armed with sweeping powers to investigate the troubled company's past - stretching back, if they so choose, to its birth in the 1980s. The pair are known as veteran investigators capable of dealing with sensitive and complex cases - conducting the probes into Mohamed Al Fayed's purchase of Harrods and the Anglia share dealing affair involving Lord Archer. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, has ordered them to complete their inquiry as quickly as possible and has, uniquely, given a commitment to publish their report. The dramatic move was being seen in Westminster as a bid by supporters of the prime minister - of whom Mr Byers is one - to get a grip on an embarrassing episode blamed on Mr Robinson, a close ally of the chancellor, Gordon Brown. Mr Robinson may face not only compulsory questioning by the inspectors but possible disqualification as a company director should his conduct at TransTec be called into question. TransTec collapsed just before Christmas with debts of about \u00a3200m. Bankers pulled the plug after it emerged TransTec had concealed from investors both a \u00a312m claim from motor giant Ford and the fact that \u00a38m of this claim had been secretly paid to the car company. Mr Robinson, who owns 16% of TransTec, has seen the value of his investment fall from \u00a336m three years ago to less than \u00a32m when the shares were suspended on Christmas Eve. The Labour MP for Coventry north-west resigned from the company in May 1997 when he entered office as a government minister, and the concealment of the \u00a312m claim took place after that date. But the first indications of Ford's unhappiness with TransTec would have emerged during 1996, when Mr Robinson was still chairman. Mr Byers has asked the inspectors to concentrate their inquiry in two areas: the concealment in the accounts of a \u00a312m claim from Ford for alleged late delivery of motor parts TransTec produced for the group; and the reasons for TransTec's collapse. Mr Byers said last night: \"There are clearly a number of serious issues regarding the collapse of TransTec which the public interest requires to be investigated by independent inspectors. \"I have emphasised to the inspectors that their prime objective must be to provide me with a full report as quickly as possible, consistent with the need to undertake a fair, thorough and professional investigation.\" The results of the inquiry can be passed to professional bodies and to the crown prosecution service. The investigators are empowered under section 432 of the companies act, which covers circumstances that suggest to the DTI that a company's affairs have been conducted so as to defraud creditors or for another fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or that shareholders have been deprived of information, or that officers of the company have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct. Inspectors can examine the entire history of TransTec, founded by Mr Robinson in the 1980s as a vehicle for turning academic ideas into money-making propositions. It was transformed in 1990 under a deal with a Maxwell-controlled engineering group, Central &amp; Sherwood. TransTec in its present form was created after a \u00a35.5m deal between Mr Robinson and Mr Maxwell. Mr Robinson has been a generous donor to the Labour party, and his generosity cost him his job as paymaster general 13 months ago, when it emerged he had made a \u00a3373,000 home loan to the then trade and industry secretary, Peter Mandelson, who also resigned.",

      "bodyText": "The government has underspent on disability benefits by precisely the amount it set out to save through the controversial cuts that triggered the biggest backbench revolt since Labour took office, it is today revealed. The underspending last year of just over \u00a3750m was half as much again as ministers eventually achieved by the cuts after they were forced to make concessions to minimise a second revolt. Disability campaigners are angrily questioning why Labour went ahead with the cuts, which were deeply unpopular and soured relations with leading charities, when it was heading for savings of such a scale. Lorna Reith, chief executive of the Disability Alliance umbrella group, said: \"They must have known this when they were cutting benefits and not increasing benefits for disabled children by as much as they ought.\" The underspending is disclosed in the national audit office's annual report on the social security accounts. The report, for 1998-99, shows that the government saved almost \u00a31.7bn of what it planned to spend that year on benefits adminstered centrally. By far the largest area of saving was disability benefits, where the \u00a3754m unspent was equivalent to 7.7% of the cash that was paid out. Soon after Labour took office, it identified disability benefits as a key target for reform. It said that it was \"one of the fastest growing areas of social security\" and that \"current trends indicate a continuation of this growth\". In October, 1998, Alistair Darling, social security secretary, published the plans for disability benefit changes designed to achieve an ultimate net cut in spending of \u00a3750m a year. Today's NAO report says Mr Darling's department had identified \"a large underspending\" two months before his announcement because \"customer levels rose less than was anticipated\". It had then been too late to revise the budget allocation. Ms Reith said it would not have been too late to abandon the cuts, as they had not even been tabled, or to do something to promote disability benefits where take up was low. According to latest official figures, take up of the care component of disability living allowance is only 30-50%. Take up of the mobility component is 50-70% and of attendance allowance 40-60%. The cuts will affect mainly future claimants of incapacity benefit, tightening eligibility criteria and clawing back benefit from people with private pensions or insurance payments. Following the concessions, the eventual net saving will be \u00a3530m-\u00a3550m a year. More than 80 Labour MPs rebelled when the cuts went before the commons last May and more than 50 joined the second revolt last November. A department of social security spokeswoman said the changes were not about saving money, but ensuring that benefit went to the right people and did what was intended. The spending forecast for disability benefits had been \"prudent\", but had overestimated the numbers of claimants. The total underspending of \u00a31.7bn identified by the NAO in 1998-99 means that the government saved \u00a33.5bn on benefits in the first two years after the general election as unemployment fell steeply. The report says that Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, has for the 11th successive year declined fully to approve the social security accounts because of the level of errors in payments of income support benefit.",

In a letter to the Times, Michael Wilks, chairman of the BMA's medical ethics committee, said the details of the examination should have been released in court following medical and legal precedents. He said Mr Straw should not give in to pressure from the general over patient confidentiality because the doctors who carried out the report were acting in a forensic capacity and had a responsibility to the organisation asking them to carry out the examination. In his letter he said: \"In being asked to provide an opinion on the general's fitness to stand trial, the reports compiled should be disclosable in any judicial procedures, and the opinion therein tested in court.\" The criticism will increase pressure on Mr Straw to release the report, which led to the home secretary saying that he was \"minded\" to release General Pinochet because he was mentally unfit to stand trial. Human rights groups, Labour MPs and Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon have all requested access to the report. However, in what amounts to Spain avoiding further embarrassment over the Pinochet case, the Spanish government yesterday blocked Judge Garzon's bid to file an immediate appeal if Britain frees the former dictator. The foreign minister, Abel Matutes, said he had turned down Judge Garzon's request to ask British prosecutors to challenge any move by Mr Straw to send the 84-year-old general home. \"There will be no further appeals,\" Mr Matutes told reporters.",

PDO, a theory of climate cycles, is a system in which ocean temperature changes indicate a shift that happens every 20 or 30 years and, for unknown reasons, change the weather. \"The persistence of warmer and colder than average ocean temperatures shows us there is much more than an isolated La Ni\u00f1a ocurring in the Pacific ocean,\" said Mr Patzert. \"We're coming out of a warm PDO pattern, and if it continues into a cold PDO, certain tendencies that we've seen for the past 20 years could potentially reverse themselves, changing temperature and rainfall patterns around the planet.\"",

In his strongest attack on the two \"big beasts\", who have recently stepped up their attacks on the Tory leadership, Mr Hague dismissed Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine as spent forces who would never hold office under his leadership. Underlining his determination to stamp out dissent, Mr Hague said: \"They will have to like it or lump it.\" Mr Hague's outburst, which came during an appearance on BBC Radio 2's Jimmy Young Show, was provoked by a series of stinging attacks on his leadership from party grandees who include John Major and the former chancellors Ken Clarke and Geoffrey Howe. Mr Clarke, who infuriated Mr Hague last year when he made a joint appearance with Tony Blair to promote Europe, warned over the new year that the Tory party was in danger of making itself unelectable after its recent \"lurch to the right\". His criticisms were echoed by Lord Howe who said that the Tory party was not seen as a \"credible alternative\" government. Mr Hague struck back yesterday, saying that he would not bow to pressure to abandon his hardline stance on Europe or his rightwing Common Sense revolution. \"Nobody is going to put me off - I don't care who criticises me on things like that,\" he said. \"That is what we are going to do, and they will have to like it or lump it.\" Mr Hague sent a clear signal that he will do his best to freeze out the grandees. \"The remaining people who still cause some difficulties within the party no longer hold positions of influence or power in the Conservative party, and clearly nor are they going to do so,\" he said. \"When you've made a generational change within a party, some of the people who are no longer in the leadership of the party of course harbour some resentments and grudges.

Brendan Gleeson is superb as the volatile Cahill, and among other excellent acts are Adrian Dunbar as his lieutenant, Maria Doyle Kennedy his wife, and Jon Voight as Irish cop, Ned Kenny.</p>",

Ambition and curiosity gradually draw her into Sheedy's upstairs demi-monde of druggy companions, including an outstanding Patricia Clarkson as a washed-up German actress. A Man For All Seasons (Fred Zinnemann, 1966) 6pm, Sky Cinema Paul Scofield, stars as Thomas More. He is the film's centre, no dull cleric but a flesh-and-blood, good-humoured man of principle who pays with his head for crossing Henry VIII. A moving chunk of history. Robert Shaw is Henry; Wendy Hiller is Alice More; Vanessa Redgrave Anne Boleyn; Orson Welles and Leo McKern the heavyweight troublemakers. Ball Of Fire (Howard Hawks, 1942) 7pm, Carlton Cinema Hard to imagine Barbara Stanwyck as Snow White, but Hawks' super screwball-comedy version of the fairy tale has been filtered through the sly imagination of scriptwriter Billy Wilder. So Stanwyck is nightclub floozy Sugarpuss O'Shea, gatecrashing the dusty academic world of seven aged professors, pursued by hoodlum Joe Lilac (Dana Andrews). The General (John Boorman, 1998) 11.30pm, Sky Premier This may be Boorman's anthem to Ireland, his adopted home, but in tone it's a throwback to his brutal Lee Marvin thriller, Point Blank. Shot in stark black-and-white, it opens with the slaying of Dublin crime boss Martin Cahill in 1994, then backtracks to follow his life, rising from petty theft to Godfather. Brendan Gleeson is superb as the volatile Cahill, and among other excellent acts are Adrian Dunbar as his lieutenant, Maria Doyle Kennedy his wife, and Jon Voight as Irish cop, Ned Kenny.",

      "body": "<p>The former Welsh secretary, Ron Davies, could face disciplinary action by the Labour party in Wales after heaping further public criticism on the embattled Labour leadership in the national assembly.</p> <p>Mr Davies, whose own hopes of assuming the mantle of devolved power were dashed as a result of his \"moment of madness\" on Clapham common, has incensed members of the minority Labour administration with an outspoken attack on the way it is running the assembly.</p> <p>His comments, in a speech to an invited audience in Cardiff on Wednesday night, came only days after he criticised Labour's \"inept\" handling of European funding for west Wales and the valleys and have led to accusations that he is acting like a member of the opposition.</p> <p>His strictures come at a particularly testing time for the first secretary, Alun Michael, whose performance could soon become the subject of a motion of no confidence by the opposition parties. Speaking of the assembly \"limping on, day to day, issue to issue\" Mr Davies claimed in a speech at the Institute of Welsh Affairs that many of the problems it faced were due to a political culture that was not inclusive. \"As a result,\" he said, \"we have unstable government which can't build a long-term strategy and is unable, therefore, to provide effective leadership.\"</p> <p>His comments provoked fierce criticism from the secretary of the Caerphilly Labour party, Martin Mansfield, who announced he was bringing forward his planned resignation from the post. He claimed Mr Davies expected total loyalty and discipline from local party officers but had shown neither of those qualities himself. \"The Labour party gave Ron Davies a second and even a third chance to rebuild his political career and he has repaid us with a stream of attacks designed to help the nationalists. In seeking to build alliances with the nationalists against our own Labour administrations in Cardiff and Westminster he has shown the worst sort of disloyalty.\"</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said last night said the party in Wales was not ruling out disciplinary action against Mr Davies. \"Many party members have phoned to say that someone who stands for election on the Labour party ticket should spend their time promoting policies on which they were elected and not constantly echo the criticisms of our electoral opponents.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Plaid Cymru set out the demands Mr Michael will have to satisfy if he is to avoid the long-threatened motion of no confidence in his running of the assembly.

      "bodyText": "The former Welsh secretary, Ron Davies, could face disciplinary action by the Labour party in Wales after heaping further public criticism on the embattled Labour leadership in the national assembly. Mr Davies, whose own hopes of assuming the mantle of devolved power were dashed as a result of his \"moment of madness\" on Clapham common, has incensed members of the minority Labour administration with an outspoken attack on the way it is running the assembly. His comments, in a speech to an invited audience in Cardiff on Wednesday night, came only days after he criticised Labour's \"inept\" handling of European funding for west Wales and the valleys and have led to accusations that he is acting like a member of the opposition. His strictures come at a particularly testing time for the first secretary, Alun Michael, whose performance could soon become the subject of a motion of no confidence by the opposition parties. Speaking of the assembly \"limping on, day to day, issue to issue\" Mr Davies claimed in a speech at the Institute of Welsh Affairs that many of the problems it faced were due to a political culture that was not inclusive. \"As a result,\" he said, \"we have unstable government which can't build a long-term strategy and is unable, therefore, to provide effective leadership.\" His comments provoked fierce criticism from the secretary of the Caerphilly Labour party, Martin Mansfield, who announced he was bringing forward his planned resignation from the post. He claimed Mr Davies expected total loyalty and discipline from local party officers but had shown neither of those qualities himself. \"The Labour party gave Ron Davies a second and even a third chance to rebuild his political career and he has repaid us with a stream of attacks designed to help the nationalists. In seeking to build alliances with the nationalists against our own Labour administrations in Cardiff and Westminster he has shown the worst sort of disloyalty.\" A Labour spokesman said last night said the party in Wales was not ruling out disciplinary action against Mr Davies. \"Many party members have phoned to say that someone who stands for election on the Labour party ticket should spend their time promoting policies on which they were elected and not constantly echo the criticisms of our electoral opponents.\" Meanwhile Plaid Cymru set out the demands Mr Michael will have to satisfy if he is to avoid the long-threatened motion of no confidence in his running of the assembly. The party is pressing for an extra \u00a385m for the assembly's budget this year and a guarantee from the treasury that the full \u00a31.2bn of structural funds from Europe will be handed over to the assembly.",

      "body": "<p>Francis Haskell, who has died of cancer aged 71, was one of the most distinguished and internationally admired art historians of his generation, and for many years professor of the history of art at Oxford.</p> <p>The son of Arnold Haskell, the well-known writer on ballet, and his Russian wife, Vera Saitzoff, he was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. His first job was as a junior library clerk in the House of Commons, but he was already engaged on art historical research.</p> <p>After meeting him for the first time at dinner in the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne in Rome, I ran into an elderly fellow-guest, deep in the catacombs of San Clemente. Impressed by Haskell's erudition and seriousness, he prophesied that \"that young man will go far.\" A year later, in 1954, Haskell was elected a fellow of King's, Cambridge, where he remained for over a decade, also serving as librarian of the fine arts faculty.</p> <p>In 1967, he was elected as professor of the history of art at Oxford, only the second person to occupy the chair, and a fellow of Trinity College. As far as teaching and furthering the cause of art history were concerned, his experience was frustrating. Oxford, probably the last major university in the world to recognise art history as a serious academic discipline, was not prepared to go as far as introducing an undergraduate degree.</p> <p>But Haskell did succeed in transforming and developing the one-year diploma course, which proved very popular with graduates. He also made a major contribution by the quality and originality of his research and publications.</p> <p>His first book, Patrons and Painters: a Study of the Relations between Art and Society in the Age of the Baroque (1963), established the direction of his interests.

      "bodyText": "Francis Haskell, who has died of cancer aged 71, was one of the most distinguished and internationally admired art historians of his generation, and for many years professor of the history of art at Oxford. The son of Arnold Haskell, the well-known writer on ballet, and his Russian wife, Vera Saitzoff, he was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. His first job was as a junior library clerk in the House of Commons, but he was already engaged on art historical research. After meeting him for the first time at dinner in the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne in Rome, I ran into an elderly fellow-guest, deep in the catacombs of San Clemente. Impressed by Haskell's erudition and seriousness, he prophesied that \"that young man will go far.\" A year later, in 1954, Haskell was elected a fellow of King's, Cambridge, where he remained for over a decade, also serving as librarian of the fine arts faculty. In 1967, he was elected as professor of the history of art at Oxford, only the second person to occupy the chair, and a fellow of Trinity College. As far as teaching and furthering the cause of art history were concerned, his experience was frustrating. Oxford, probably the last major university in the world to recognise art history as a serious academic discipline, was not prepared to go as far as introducing an undergraduate degree. But Haskell did succeed in transforming and developing the one-year diploma course, which proved very popular with graduates. He also made a major contribution by the quality and originality of his research and publications. His first book, Patrons and Painters: a Study of the Relations between Art and Society in the Age of the Baroque (1963), established the direction of his interests. It was a brilliant choice of theme, which became personally associated with him; although others had written on patronages, collecting and taste, none had done so with such intensity and depth of research as Haskell was to do over the next 37 years. What might have been a dry academic exercise was invariably brought vividly to life by his deft evocation of the personality and idiosyncrasies of his varied cast of characters. Such was the wide-ranging nature of his field that he was able to match \"consumer\" and \"art\" in any chronological configuration which was pertinent.

But the very fact that it has begun is a victory for nationalists.</p> <p>Two parliamentary committees, one in each chamber, have been set up to study the existing constitution and propose revisions. Changes would require a two-thirds majority in both houses and the approval of the electorate in a national referendum.</p> <p>The committees will scrutinise a document that was drafted in just one week by General Douglas MacArthur's occupation authorities in the wake of the second world war.</p> <p>Based on recommendations from Washington, the constitution was designed to prevent a recurrence of Japanese aggression by promoting democracy and emasculating the country's military.</p> <p>Article nine - certain to be the most contentious area of the panel's deliberations - renounces war and \"the threat or use of force as a means to settle international disputes\".</p> <p>For decades, nationalists in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, including Yasuhiro Nakasone, Japan's prime minister from 1982 to 1987, have called for a reform or annulment of what they describe as an alien, badly written and contradictory constitution.</p> <p>Even the constitution's supporters admit that several of its goals have failed. Article nine declares that the potential for war will never be maintained - but Japan has one of the most powerful military forces in the world. The constitution is also supposed to guarantee sexual equality, much to the incredulity of many Japanese women.</p> <p>In the past, any talk of reform was blocked by leftwing parties, who saw it as a step back towards Japan's militaristic past. But their influence has waned.</p> <p>\"The ideological era has passed, along with the cold war,\" said Norihiko Akagi, a Liberal Democrat MP. \"Now everything is open for debate, including article nine.\"</p> <p>Proponents of the review, which has broad cross-party support, have sought to reassure the public and neighbouring nations that change will not mean a more aggressive Japan.</p> <p>They say that reform will fill gaps in the constitution on the environment and other contemporary concerns, and enable the country to play a more active role in international peacekeeping operations.</p> <p>But many Japanese are proud of the country's pacifist constitution, and surveys show opinion is split down the middle on the need for reform.</p> <p>Opponents say the review is a sign of resurgent nationalism in Japan, following the passage last year of new defence guidelines and legislation to recognise the national flag and anthem.</p> <p>\"This debate plays into the hands of revisionists whose only interest is to discard article nine,\" said Takako Doi, the leader of the Social Democratic party. \"But now that it has started, we must take part to protect the constitution.\"</p> <p>Japan's neighbours are also paying close attention to the review. \"We would like Japan to continue very clearly on the course of peace,\" said Li Wen Liang, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Tokyo.</p> <p>Anxieties about the growing strength of revisionism in Japan were fuelled yesterday when approval was given in Osaka for a conference describing the Nanking massacre as \"the biggest lie in the 20th century\". Up to 300,000 people, including prisoners of war and civilians, were slaughtered by Japanese troops in the 1937-38 occupation of the Chinese city.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Japan's parliament broke its strictest postwar taboo yesterday by launching the first review of the country's pacifist constitution since it was imposed by the United States in 1947. The outcome of the process, which is expected to take at least five years, is far from certain. But the very fact that it has begun is a victory for nationalists. Two parliamentary committees, one in each chamber, have been set up to study the existing constitution and propose revisions. Changes would require a two-thirds majority in both houses and the approval of the electorate in a national referendum. The committees will scrutinise a document that was drafted in just one week by General Douglas MacArthur's occupation authorities in the wake of the second world war. Based on recommendations from Washington, the constitution was designed to prevent a recurrence of Japanese aggression by promoting democracy and emasculating the country's military. Article nine - certain to be the most contentious area of the panel's deliberations - renounces war and \"the threat or use of force as a means to settle international disputes\". For decades, nationalists in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, including Yasuhiro Nakasone, Japan's prime minister from 1982 to 1987, have called for a reform or annulment of what they describe as an alien, badly written and contradictory constitution. Even the constitution's supporters admit that several of its goals have failed. Article nine declares that the potential for war will never be maintained - but Japan has one of the most powerful military forces in the world. The constitution is also supposed to guarantee sexual equality, much to the incredulity of many Japanese women. In the past, any talk of reform was blocked by leftwing parties, who saw it as a step back towards Japan's militaristic past. But their influence has waned. \"The ideological era has passed, along with the cold war,\" said Norihiko Akagi, a Liberal Democrat MP. \"Now everything is open for debate, including article nine.\" Proponents of the review, which has broad cross-party support, have sought to reassure the public and neighbouring nations that change will not mean a more aggressive Japan. They say that reform will fill gaps in the constitution on the environment and other contemporary concerns, and enable the country to play a more active role in international peacekeeping operations. But many Japanese are proud of the country's pacifist constitution, and surveys show opinion is split down the middle on the need for reform. Opponents say the review is a sign of resurgent nationalism in Japan, following the passage last year of new defence guidelines and legislation to recognise the national flag and anthem. \"This debate plays into the hands of revisionists whose only interest is to discard article nine,\" said Takako Doi, the leader of the Social Democratic party. \"But now that it has started, we must take part to protect the constitution.\" Japan's neighbours are also paying close attention to the review. \"We would like Japan to continue very clearly on the course of peace,\" said Li Wen Liang, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. Anxieties about the growing strength of revisionism in Japan were fuelled yesterday when approval was given in Osaka for a conference describing the Nanking massacre as \"the biggest lie in the 20th century\". Up to 300,000 people, including prisoners of war and civilians, were slaughtered by Japanese troops in the 1937-38 occupation of the Chinese city.",

There are 27,000 detainees in France awaiting trial, nearly half its 55,000 prisoners.</p> <p>After Dr Vasseur spoke out against nine-square-metre (100 sq ft) cells housing six prisoners, poisonous food and corridors running with rats and cockroaches, Jean-Michel Bouch-eron, a former Socialist mayor jailed for corruption who said his cell was above La Sant\u00e9's punishment block, added: \"My eyes have been stung regularly by tear gas thrown into isolation cells by warders. In another prison, I paddled through blood left by a prisoner who committed suicide after banging on his cell door all night without getting help.\"</p> <p>Pierre Botton, a businessman convicted of fraud, said he was saved from suicide by Dr Vasseur.</p> <p>At La Sant\u00e9, no one was allowed to talk to the best known detainee, the terrorist, Carlos \"the Jackal\". Every night, Mr Botton heard him wailing in solitary confinement: \"I'm Carlos - doesn't anyone want to talk to me?\"</p> <p>While some of the press mocked \"the revolt of middle- class prisoners\", the International Prison Observatory which organised the petition said VIP support had probably advanced the campaign by 10 years.</p> <p>Bernard Tapie, a Socialist former minister jailed for fraud and now released, refused to sign the petition. He said that despite finding 200 cockroaches in his bed, \"life in clink is better than life in the rundown suburbs for 90% of detainees It's that life outside which is truly unbearable.\"</p>",

A petition to the justice ministry printed in Le Nouvel Observateur yesterday, led by Loik le Floch-Prigent, former head of the state petrol company, Elf, described horrifying conditions to support a campaign by V\u00e9ronique Vasseur, chief doctor at La Sant\u00e9 prison in Paris. Foul cells, systematic rape, humiliation of visiting families, crude health care, drug dealing by warders and detention of young offenders with seasoned criminals had turned jails into factories of crime and misery, the petition said. Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, the environmentalist leader held for allegedly wrecking a McDonald's outlet, signed alongside Christine De viers-Joncours, one-time companion of the former foreign minister Roland Dumas, being questioned about fraud. They are joined by such Sant\u00e9 residents as the mercenary colonel Bob Denard and the former prefect in Corsica accused of illegal police operations, Bernard Bonnet. Many signatories have yet to be tried. There are 27,000 detainees in France awaiting trial, nearly half its 55,000 prisoners. After Dr Vasseur spoke out against nine-square-metre (100 sq ft) cells housing six prisoners, poisonous food and corridors running with rats and cockroaches, Jean-Michel Bouch-eron, a former Socialist mayor jailed for corruption who said his cell was above La Sant\u00e9's punishment block, added: \"My eyes have been stung regularly by tear gas thrown into isolation cells by warders. In another prison, I paddled through blood left by a prisoner who committed suicide after banging on his cell door all night without getting help.\" Pierre Botton, a businessman convicted of fraud, said he was saved from suicide by Dr Vasseur. At La Sant\u00e9, no one was allowed to talk to the best known detainee, the terrorist, Carlos \"the Jackal\". Every night, Mr Botton heard him wailing in solitary confinement: \"I'm Carlos - doesn't anyone want to talk to me?\" While some of the press mocked \"the revolt of middle- class prisoners\", the International Prison Observatory which organised the petition said VIP support had probably advanced the campaign by 10 years. Bernard Tapie, a Socialist former minister jailed for fraud and now released, refused to sign the petition. He said that despite finding 200 cockroaches in his bed, \"life in clink is better than life in the rundown suburbs for 90% of detainees It's that life outside which is truly unbearable.\"",

And you're the one who's telling me what to do?\"</p> <p>DiCaprio and I are sipping lemonade at the Chateau Marmont, a few blocks from where he grew up in Los Angeles, discussing his latest film, The Beach. For DiCaprio, it is a change of direction. The film was, he says, \"the first film where I really wanted to take more responsibility for what I was doing as far as steering the story in the right direction. And Danny [Boyle, the director] was unbelievably open to my doing that.\"</p> <p>What was the hardest thing about The Beach? Well, DiCaprio was badly stung by jellyfish during the water scenes. He tried wearing tights to protect himself but they didn't help much. And he worked 70 days with only four days off.</p> <p>And what about Titanic? What was the hardest thing about that?</p> <p>\"Everything. Every day. The hardest thing I've ever had to do was make that movie.\"</p> <p>Physically? Emotionally?</p> <p>\"Everything.\"</p> <p>\"He gets in quite a lot of fistfights,\" says Cheryl Rixon Davis, co-owner of the Playroom nightclub in LA. \"But he's very friendly. Very sweet.

He's an exhibitionist like she is.\"</p> <p>DiCaprio's fame has left him wanting something real. Something pre-Titanic. \"It was so unreal to me when it all happened,\" he says. \"It was almost like a joke.\" A part of him longs for a world untouched by movies. Especially his movies. In his new movie, Leo's character Richard doesn't want to see the beach overrun by tourists. In his new life as a megastar, Leo himself doesn't want to be overrun by fans.</p> <p>\"People slag him off for Titanic,\" Danny Boyle tells me. \"But you have to try to separate him from the publicity, that crazy balloon.\"</p> <p>\"What's the nature of his appeal?\"</p> <p>\"He has a feminine side that all great actors have access to. It's what makes women fancy him.\"</p> <p>\"There was a moment when I was at an airport somewhere,\" says DiCaprio. \"This girl grabbed my leg. It was like one of those things I had seen in a Beatles documentary. She was this fanatical fan. I wanted to say to her, 'Look, it's just me. I'm really, truly a regular guy. You don't need to do this.' But there was nothing I could say.</p> <p>\"My attitude to fame was some thing different. I was going to be who I was, and I was going to lead my normal life and do what I was going to do no matter what people say.\"</p> <p>How has that worked out?</p> <p>\"The more you try to do something like that - well, the more you have to compromise.\"</p> <p>Does he think he's grown up a bit since Titanic?</p> <p>\"Certainly. There is obviously a whole adjustment process. I have learned to trust myself more. I think I take more responsibility for what I need to do. I really try to control a little more where I want things to go. But I would not want to become an adult in every sense of the word. Who the hell does?\"</p> <p>DiCaprio has just bought a house in Hollywood, which suggests growing up. I tell him about a scene a friend of mine once witnessed: Greta Garbo and Montgomery Clift having a loneliness contest. Garbo said: \"I am so lonely that I only ever have one dish in my dishwasher.\" Clift said: \"I'm so lonely that I only ever have paper plates.\"</p> <p>DiCaprio interjects immediately, \"I'm so lonely that I don't have any dishes at all.\"</p> <p>Lonely? Does that mean he doesn't have a girlfriend?</p> <p>That's right, no girlfriend - \"Nope\" - at the moment.</p> <p>Later we watch The Beach together in a preview theatre. Afterwards I tell DiCaprio I liked it very much.</p> <p>\"Really?\" he asks.</p> <p>He seems to lack confidence. He knows this movie, this career move, is risky. His character begins light and grows steadily darker. Will his Titanic fans like this very different DiCaprio? Surely not all of them. But the movie works. It is about something. It says something. It is part of a straight line that goes from This Boy's Life to What's Eating Gilbert Grape to the Basketball Diaries to Total Eclipse to Romeo and Juliet to The Beach. Titanic is the aberration.</p> <p>\u0095 The Beach opens on February 11.</p>",

In his new life as a megastar, Leo himself doesn't want to be overrun by fans. \"People slag him off for Titanic,\" Danny Boyle tells me. \"But you have to try to separate him from the publicity, that crazy balloon.\" \"What's the nature of his appeal?\" \"He has a feminine side that all great actors have access to. It's what makes women fancy him.\" \"There was a moment when I was at an airport somewhere,\" says DiCaprio. \"This girl grabbed my leg. It was like one of those things I had seen in a Beatles documentary. She was this fanatical fan. I wanted to say to her, 'Look, it's just me. I'm really, truly a regular guy. You don't need to do this.' But there was nothing I could say. \"My attitude to fame was some thing different. I was going to be who I was, and I was going to lead my normal life and do what I was going to do no matter what people say.\" How has that worked out? \"The more you try to do something like that - well, the more you have to compromise.\" Does he think he's grown up a bit since Titanic? \"Certainly. There is obviously a whole adjustment process. I have learned to trust myself more. I think I take more responsibility for what I need to do. I really try to control a little more where I want things to go. But I would not want to become an adult in every sense of the word. Who the hell does?\" DiCaprio has just bought a house in Hollywood, which suggests growing up. I tell him about a scene a friend of mine once witnessed: Greta Garbo and Montgomery Clift having a loneliness contest. Garbo said: \"I am so lonely that I only ever have one dish in my dishwasher.\" Clift said: \"I'm so lonely that I only ever have paper plates.\" DiCaprio interjects immediately, \"I'm so lonely that I don't have any dishes at all.\" Lonely? Does that mean he doesn't have a girlfriend? That's right, no girlfriend - \"Nope\" - at the moment. Later we watch The Beach together in a preview theatre. Afterwards I tell DiCaprio I liked it very much. \"Really?\" he asks. He seems to lack confidence. He knows this movie, this career move, is risky. His character begins light and grows steadily darker. Will his Titanic fans like this very different DiCaprio? Surely not all of them. But the movie works. It is about something. It says something. It is part of a straight line that goes from This Boy's Life to What's Eating Gilbert Grape to the Basketball Diaries to Total Eclipse to Romeo and Juliet to The Beach. Titanic is the aberration. \u0095 The Beach opens on February 11.",

      "body": "<p>There are times when Eddie George must wonder why he bothers. He decamps virtually the whole Bank of England to Scotland, including two-thirds of the monetary policy committee, for a two-day bonding session and what happens? He gets into a slanging match with Alex Salmond of the Scottish Nationalist Party over whether Scotland would be better off if it could set its own interest rates at the same level as those inside the eurozone. </p> <p>On the face of it, cutting interest rates north of the border from 5.5% to 3% sounds like a wonderful idea. Mr George thinks not. He said Mr Salmond's policy ideas were \"naive and shallow\", pointing out that euroland may have interest rates at half the level of Scotland but has double the level of unemployment. </p> <p>The governor is right. Mr Salmond appears to think that his party's policy of independence in Europe would mean a monetary policy better tailored to Scotland's needs, but this is sloppy thinking of the worst kind. First, there is little evidence that Scotland's economic performance over the past few years has been out of line with the rest of the UK. Growth has been 2.6% a year on average during the eight-year recovery for Britain, 2.4% for Scotland. </p> <p>Second, the SNP believes that London is remote from Scotland, with the monetary policy committee knowing little about what economic conditions are like in the industrial belt of the lowlands or in the crofts of the highlands. This may be true, but it is hard to see how the situation would be improved by having monetary policy set in Frankfurt by the European Central Bank. To be sure, an independent Scotland might have a seat on the board, but it would command around 4% of the vote. Frankly, it is probably better off with Mr George in charge. </p> <p>Finally, there is the example of Ireland. The SNP appears to think that Scotland, removed from the dead hand of English control, can be the next Celtic tiger. This is moonshine. Figures yesterday showed that inflation in Ireland is climbing alarmingly fast, primarily because interest rates that are good for a weak German economy are bad for a booming Ireland.

      "bodyText": "There are times when Eddie George must wonder why he bothers. He decamps virtually the whole Bank of England to Scotland, including two-thirds of the monetary policy committee, for a two-day bonding session and what happens? He gets into a slanging match with Alex Salmond of the Scottish Nationalist Party over whether Scotland would be better off if it could set its own interest rates at the same level as those inside the eurozone. On the face of it, cutting interest rates north of the border from 5.5% to 3% sounds like a wonderful idea. Mr George thinks not. He said Mr Salmond's policy ideas were \"naive and shallow\", pointing out that euroland may have interest rates at half the level of Scotland but has double the level of unemployment. The governor is right. Mr Salmond appears to think that his party's policy of independence in Europe would mean a monetary policy better tailored to Scotland's needs, but this is sloppy thinking of the worst kind. First, there is little evidence that Scotland's economic performance over the past few years has been out of line with the rest of the UK. Growth has been 2.6% a year on average during the eight-year recovery for Britain, 2.4% for Scotland. Second, the SNP believes that London is remote from Scotland, with the monetary policy committee knowing little about what economic conditions are like in the industrial belt of the lowlands or in the crofts of the highlands. This may be true, but it is hard to see how the situation would be improved by having monetary policy set in Frankfurt by the European Central Bank. To be sure, an independent Scotland might have a seat on the board, but it would command around 4% of the vote. Frankly, it is probably better off with Mr George in charge. Finally, there is the example of Ireland. The SNP appears to think that Scotland, removed from the dead hand of English control, can be the next Celtic tiger. This is moonshine. Figures yesterday showed that inflation in Ireland is climbing alarmingly fast, primarily because interest rates that are good for a weak German economy are bad for a booming Ireland. Lower does not necessarily mean better. An old wheeze It is impossible to avoid a cackle at the situation-comedy of Stephen Byers' calling in a full-dress department of trade and industry inquiry into Geoffrey Robinson's collapsed engineering concern, TransTec. Faced with a political problem that just would not go away, some bright spark has remembered the inspector-thingies of the 1980s.

Given the association of the former paymaster general with the company - he was its non-executive chairman until his appointment to the government in May 1997 - anything less would have attracted criticism. But while the decision to appoint outside inspectors clearly meets the independence test, it is not sufficient. As Mr Byers's statement indicates, it is important that the probe into TransTec is done quickly and its results made public. For the DTI inspectors, being thorough and impartial in their deliberations does not mean they have to work at the traditional speed of law. And this, of course, brings us to the question of what exactly will be done with evidence gathered. The inspectors have wide powers to demand information but that information can no longer be used in any subsequent criminal proceedings, thanks to the European court of human rights ruling in the case of Ernest Saunders v United Kingdom. This is not to say the inspections themselves are now worthless exercises. Not only can material gathered be used to press for disqualification of directors, and may be cited in civil suits by creditors seeking to lift the protection of limited liability, but inspectors produce reports that, as Messrs Maxwell, Fayed and others have discovered, stay on the record and can be quoted thereafter.

Because these courses are non-competitive they are a great breeding ground for mutual support and co-operative learning. Theory can immediately be backed up, or not, by your colleagues, and you don't need to spend so much time trawling through the grammar books, trying to grapple with the wisdom of the linguistics experts. For trainers, too, the benefits are clear - mixed candidates add spice and the opportunity to pursue mutual learning. Rather than fear the professors and multi-lingual language experts as trainees, we can all look forward to the unexpected.

But those who are thinking about enrolling on a English-language course in Britain may be surprised to find that multimedia has been slow to catch on in some institutions. </p> <p>Some schools lack extensive computer resources and those that do often experience problems networking multimedia programs. Furthermore software written specifically for English language teaching is still limited. Teachers often favour more \"authentic\" materials such as on-line encyclopaedias and other reference works, rather than testing out more innovative interactive programs.</p> <p>Add to this the attitude of students themselves who are often resistant to the idea of spending time in front of a computer rather than with their teacher, and you get a clearer picture of why the uptake of multimedia has been so slow. Most schools do, however, provide computer-based resources for self study, such as access to the internet, and attempt some kind of integration with classroom learning. Learners can expect to spend some time in a self-access centre using multimedia as a research tool to enliven classroom work, as follow-up activities to lessons or as homework. </p> <p>Glyn Jones is pedagogical consultant in Britain for Eurocentres, the international schools chain. He says that students respond positively to combining class activities with time in the computer room, and those teachers who do not make use of the facilities soon find themselves under pressure from students to do so.</p> <p>One institution that has gone further than most in exploiting the full potential of multimedia is the University of Wolverhampton. \"What works best for us is to formally integrate multimedia into the syllabus, making it a standard part of the course,\" says Paul Brett, a senior lecturer in EFL. He has played a key role in the development of a business English multimedia course for students preparing to enrol on degree courses at the university. </p> <p>So how useful is multimedia to students studying in an English speaking country? It cannot develop free speech and extended writing, nor can language generated by a machine ever be as truly authentic as communication with another person. But multimedia can increase students' exposure to the target language by creating authentic contexts for language practice which simulate real situations. </p> <p>As a self-access resource, multimedia is also easy to administer, user-friendly, efficient and caters for individual learning styles and preferences. In the safety of this multimedia world, students can study at their own pace, in a non-judgmental learning environment, repeating things as many times as they like and receiving instantaneous feedback. Learners are encouraged to explore the materials, take risks and make choices. The resulting shift in control from teacher to learner can help build confidence.</p> <p>Speed of delivery and corrective feedback means that computers can provide practice of the more routine side of language learning, such as the use of instant gap fills to practise grammar or vocabulary, and can make the most mundane language tasks dynamic and challenging. This saves on class time and, if used as part of a lesson, it can free the teacher from routine tasks and allows more time for individual teaching. </p> <p>\"Language learning requires intensive time on tasks, something not possible in the classroom where factors such as class size mean that most pupils will only get a few opportunities to interact on a one-to-one basis in the foreign language,\" says Dr Roberta Stock, a publisher of multimedia language courses. So if you want to get the most out of the multimedia facilities your school may offer, it's worth experimenting with it before your trip abroad. When considering schools in Britain that offer computer-based learning, find out exactly how it will be integrated into the syllabus. </p> <p>As tools for language learning become more sophisticated, multimedia offers an exciting alternative to more traditional materials, and while it cannot and should not replace a teacher, if selected carefully and used appropriately, multimedia can be of enormous benefit to the learner.</p> <p><strong>Multimedia updates</strong></p> <p>These are the most popular multimedia packages currently in use in British schools:</p> <p><strong>The Grammar Rom</strong> (Longman, <a href=\"http://www.awl-elt.com\">www.awl-elt.com</a>) <br> Intermediate. <br> Features video, sound, animated graphics and over 300 interactive exercises.

He has played a key role in the development of a business English multimedia course for students preparing to enrol on degree courses at the university. So how useful is multimedia to students studying in an English speaking country? It cannot develop free speech and extended writing, nor can language generated by a machine ever be as truly authentic as communication with another person. But multimedia can increase students' exposure to the target language by creating authentic contexts for language practice which simulate real situations. As a self-access resource, multimedia is also easy to administer, user-friendly, efficient and caters for individual learning styles and preferences. In the safety of this multimedia world, students can study at their own pace, in a non-judgmental learning environment, repeating things as many times as they like and receiving instantaneous feedback. Learners are encouraged to explore the materials, take risks and make choices. The resulting shift in control from teacher to learner can help build confidence. Speed of delivery and corrective feedback means that computers can provide practice of the more routine side of language learning, such as the use of instant gap fills to practise grammar or vocabulary, and can make the most mundane language tasks dynamic and challenging. This saves on class time and, if used as part of a lesson, it can free the teacher from routine tasks and allows more time for individual teaching. \"Language learning requires intensive time on tasks, something not possible in the classroom where factors such as class size mean that most pupils will only get a few opportunities to interact on a one-to-one basis in the foreign language,\" says Dr Roberta Stock, a publisher of multimedia language courses. So if you want to get the most out of the multimedia facilities your school may offer, it's worth experimenting with it before your trip abroad. When considering schools in Britain that offer computer-based learning, find out exactly how it will be integrated into the syllabus. As tools for language learning become more sophisticated, multimedia offers an exciting alternative to more traditional materials, and while it cannot and should not replace a teacher, if selected carefully and used appropriately, multimedia can be of enormous benefit to the learner.

      "bodyText": "Versailles, the trade finance group which is at the centre of a serious fraud office investigation, collapsed into receivership yesterday. Bankers owed up to \u00a355m pulled the plug after investigating auditors discovered what are thought to be large holes in the accounts. The company's receivership brings down the curtain on the rise to remarkable business success of founder Carl Cushnie, the only black entrepreneur to register in the list of the top 100 wealthiest people. Mr Cushnie now faces the possibility of legal action from creditors if it can be proved he allowed Versailles to trade when insolvent. The accountant investigating Versailles on behalf of its banks, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has also been appointed its receivers, and is taking charge of Versailles and whatever assets it can find. PwC is at present running the company as a going concern, and is thought to be hoping to find a buyer. But it seemed last night that a wind-down of the group's affairs was the most likely outcome. The company requested on December 8 that its shares should be suspended because it had found its treatment of some trade finance deals may have breached accountancy rules in that they \"double counted\" transactions. This, said Versailles, may have inflated turnover by as much as 30%, but would have no effect on profits. Two days later, the company admitted it had lied on December 8 when it claimed to have uncovered the accounts problems itself. In fact, it had been a department of trade and industry inquiry into an insolvent Versailles client which had first thrown light on the double-counting problem. At the DTI's instigation, Versailles asked for an opinion from accountant Baker Tilly. When it was unable to give the books a clean bill of health, Versailles asked for its shares to be suspended. But in the interim Mr Cushnie sold shares equivalent to 5% of the company - worth \u00a329m - at a time when he knew and the market did not that Versailles was under a DTI-prompted inquiry. The sale still left him with about 53% of Versailles. But whereas the double-counting problem would have wiped perhaps \u00a380m off turnover, thought to be about \u00a3250m, it would not have affected profits. The new accounting gaps, understood to have been uncovered by PwC earlier this week, are of a different order of magnitude, threatening the solvency of the company. PwC reported the problem at the start of this week. On Tuesday the SFO announced a full-blown criminal investigation into Versailles, and on Wednesday the Versailles board suspended its long-serving finance director, Fred Clough. But so large are the holes that Versailles is believed to be in danger of trading while insolvent. Bankers NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays yesterday withdrew their support from the management and put in PwC as receiver. Versailles specialised in lending to companies with weak balance sheets, and was one of the fastest growing finance firms of the 1990s. Mr Cushnie lives in Surrey with his wife Angela and their four children. Should he be found to have traded while insolvent, he could face disqualification as a director and civil action by creditors.",

But its menswear sales dived 7.1%, and six percentage points were wiped off profit margins.</p> <p>There has been mounting speculation that chief executive John Hoerner was on the brink of being ousted, but yesterday chairman Adam Broad bent threw his weight behind Mr Hoerner.</p> <p>Oasis and Moss Bros issued full profits warnings. Moss Bros - which also operates the Cecil Gee and Savoy Taylors Guild chains - said that, as at Arcadia, men were proving hard to part from their money. The group's shares dropped to a five-year low, closing down 13p at 61p.</p> <p>Oasis had displayed some immunity to the problems which engulfed its rivals last year, but no longer. The group said there was nothing wrong with its goods - just too much competition and no sign of it abating. Its shares, which were changing hands at 282p last year, ended down 25p at a new low of 95p.</p>",

Shares in Arcadia, Britain's second largest clothing company, with shops such as Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, fell to a record low of 52p, valuing the entire 2,800-store chain at only \u00a398m as the company warned it was unlikely to be able to maintain its dividend this year. Only six months ago Arcadia paid \u00a3151m to take control of the former Sears womenswear business - which brought Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Warehouse into the group - and little more than a year earlier Arcadia was valued at about \u00a31bn. The company, which is now expected to slump into the red this year, said it had increased its womenswear sales by 4% - at the expense of a 0.7% reduction in margins. But its menswear sales dived 7.1%, and six percentage points were wiped off profit margins. There has been mounting speculation that chief executive John Hoerner was on the brink of being ousted, but yesterday chairman Adam Broad bent threw his weight behind Mr Hoerner. Oasis and Moss Bros issued full profits warnings. Moss Bros - which also operates the Cecil Gee and Savoy Taylors Guild chains - said that, as at Arcadia, men were proving hard to part from their money. The group's shares dropped to a five-year low, closing down 13p at 61p. Oasis had displayed some immunity to the problems which engulfed its rivals last year, but no longer. The group said there was nothing wrong with its goods - just too much competition and no sign of it abating. Its shares, which were changing hands at 282p last year, ended down 25p at a new low of 95p.",

It went up again when I walked out.\" Mrs Owen, who has two daughters, was only in her \u00a328,000-a-year job for a matter of weeks before resigning.",

She was still reeling from bouts of flu and laryngitis, and her voice often staggered fitfully around the contours of her songs, trying to find some semblance of pitch. Occasionally, she gave up altogether and mimed the words. Her singing and songwriting partner Annie Roboff, a dead ringer for actress Sarah Jessica Parker, did a discreet job on keyboards, but her efforts at harmony singing frequently resulted only in terrifying discord. Roboff's solo effort on a song called We All Fall Down was a masterclass in stage fright and insecurity. </p> <p>It was best, then, to try to concentrate on the inherent qualities of Chapman's songwriting rather than on the vagaries of this performance. While there was a little too much inter-song self-therapy (\"This is called Deeper Still and it's about forgiveness\"), her best songs can unleash sudden surges of powerful emotion. Most conspicuous among them is Sand and Water, a song she wrote after her husband died of cancer and which was adopted by Elton John as an alternative to his post-Diana version of Candle In The Wind. It is one of those four-square emotional blockbusters which could stop a speeding train. </p> <p>Picking one's way carefully through a surfeit of winsome, folky stuff on guitar or piano, which conspired to give the impression that Chapman spends far too much time pressing flowers and writing poetry in copperplate longhand, one was rewarded with other nuggets, such as All I Have, the stirring Every December Sky, and the refreshingly up-tempo clapalong of Happy Girl. Chapman and Roboff co-wrote Faith Hill's exuberant hit This Kiss, though their rendition of it here sadly left almost everything to be desired.</p>",
