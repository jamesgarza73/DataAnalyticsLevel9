Unless public perceptions change, and soon, all the performance data in the world will not change its political fate. *www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/performance_info **Better policy delivery and design, a discussion paper: www.cabinet-office.gov.uk david.walker@theguardian.com",

Starting on New Year's Eve, Clockwatching explores the discontents of a northern family who make the house of Atreus look jolly. Dad is indifferent to his dying, off-stage wife.

Her brother, Paul, is a loutish would-be pop-star whose marriage to actress Sarah is sabotaged by the latter's love for Duncan, which leads to catastrophic violence. </p> <p>Tolstoy said that \"all happy families resemble each other but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\". Betts implies that it is our unhappiness that is universal. He is good at conveying the lies and embarrassments of domestic life - there's a funny moment when Duncan finds himself unwittingly reading soft porn to his mother-in-law. </p> <p>While Betts has a sharp ear for the bruising banalities of family life, he rarely lets the outside world impinge. He could learn from his own A Listening Heaven, which interwove art, science, religion and ecology into a study of domestic desperation. Plays succeed in so far as they show the complex interaction of the individual with society. </p> <p>But Sam Walters' production has the right pressure-cooker quality, and the performances are outstanding.

Starting on New Year's Eve, Clockwatching explores the discontents of a northern family who make the house of Atreus look jolly. Dad is indifferent to his dying, off-stage wife. Daughter Anna has to cope with an autistic child and her hapless husband, Duncan. Her brother, Paul, is a loutish would-be pop-star whose marriage to actress Sarah is sabotaged by the latter's love for Duncan, which leads to catastrophic violence. Tolstoy said that \"all happy families resemble each other but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\". Betts implies that it is our unhappiness that is universal. He is good at conveying the lies and embarrassments of domestic life - there's a funny moment when Duncan finds himself unwittingly reading soft porn to his mother-in-law. While Betts has a sharp ear for the bruising banalities of family life, he rarely lets the outside world impinge. He could learn from his own A Listening Heaven, which interwove art, science, religion and ecology into a study of domestic desperation. Plays succeed in so far as they show the complex interaction of the individual with society. But Sam Walters' production has the right pressure-cooker quality, and the performances are outstanding. Betts writes with naturalistic exactness; what he needs to do is show that even the unhappiest family is subject to periodic social invasion. \u0095 Until May 5. Box office: 020-8940 3633.",

Unemployment will go back up, if only temporarily, this spring, as a result of the loss of jobs in the tourist industry, and economic growth will slow. The one crumb of economic comfort for a government with one wary eye on the febrile global stock markets is that the Bank of England may cut interest rates this week. It should. </p> <p>Despite the desperate attempts by the opposition to call this Blair's spring of discontent, Labour's biggest problem will be getting its supporters out to vote on election day. It is not that voters believe the government has screwed up, rather that having Labour in power with a 179-seat majority has made precious little difference. Britain now is remarkably similar to Britain on May 1, 1997. </p> <p>Perhaps the single most depressing statistic is that spending on the nation's infrastructure has been lower in each of Labour's four years than in the final 12 months of John Major's administration and only 25% of what it was in the dying months of Jim Callaghan's luckless government. To be spending less than 0.5% of the economy's annual output on restoring the tattered remnants of the public realm is scandalous. Gordon Brown blames spending departments for this, but the chancellor cannot shuffle off responsibility so easily. He holds the purse strings. He imposed the cuts in Labour's first two years. The buck stops with him. </p> <p>Labour's response to the charge that it has been a do-nothing government is two-fold. First, it points to some solid achievements - the minimum wage, extra money for low-income earners through a host of tax credits, help to some pensioners, extra billions for health and education - as evidence of work in progress. </p> <p>There are good things delivered by Blair that would not have been delivered by Hague. Any Labour supporters toying with the idea that there is no difference between left and right in the modern world should have been speedily disabused last week when George Bush decided that America's right to go on polluting the planet took precedence over the Kyoto agreement to cut CO-2 emissions. In retrospect, voting for Ralph Nader in Florida was not such a good idea after all. </p> <p>The second strand of the argument is that Labour's first term was all about showing competence and that things will get a lot better in a second term, honest. Only then will we see a full flowering of the government's progressive vision. Margaret Thatcher's radical phase was her second term between 1983 and 1987, which saw her take on and defeat the miners, sell off chunks of state-owned industry, and abolish the GLC and the metropolitan councils. </p> <p>Before that she had enough on her plate bringing down inflation from 20%, coping with mass unemployment and fighting the Falklands war, without heeding those in her government and in the free-market think-tanks peddling the ideas that would lay the foundations for the second term revolution. With Labour a demoralised rump of a party in 1983, she had the ideas and the opportunity to get radical. </p> <p>It is possible that Blair has merely been biding his time, storing up all his radical ideas for a second term. Did you see a pink, four-legged creature with wings and trotters float past your window? </p> <p>The reality is that politics now is more like the 1950s than the 1980s. In the 50s, the Conservatives were in power but did not do very much. They took over from Labour in 1951 at a time when the economic climate turned benign, when inflationary pressure was minimal and world demand strong. They accepted the status quo inherited from the Attlee government - that large chunks of the economy should be in state hands, that full employment should be the centrepiece of economic policy, that capital should shoulder some of the responsibility for building up the welfare state - and stayed in charge for 13 years, making only incremental changes. </p> <p>In some respects, the Conservatives did some of the things that Labour had never quite got round to doing; the mass expansion of council housing, for example, took place only after 1951. There were regular periods of breast-beating when it became clear that Britain, despite the favourable economic background, was performing far less well than Germany or France, but for the most part it was a time when the Conservative party thought that the point of politics was for it to stay in power rather than to change things. </p> <p>Like the Conservatives, this Labour government took over when the economic climate was set fair. For the first time in decades it is possible to run the economy at about 3% growth without stoking up inflation. Full employment, if not yet a reality, is a definite possibility. Of the four big macroeconomic indicators, only the balance of payments, the Achilles' heel of the British economy, gives cause for concern. </p> <p>Moreover, Labour accepts the traditional consensus. It believes low inflation is the prime objective of economic policy, that the balance of power in the workplace is just about right, that the industries privatised by the Conservatives should remain privatised, with a couple of new ones thrown in for good measure, it idolises business (the bigger the better). It seems to have no trouble, either, with 50s-style social authoritarianism. This is not a government that, even were it to be in power for 50 years, looks interested in rocking the boat. It just wants to change course by a couple of degrees. </p> <p>Such an approach may be justified. It may be that much of what happened in the final quarter of the 20th century was necessary, right and irreversible. It may be that capitalism has now reached a point of near perfection so tinkering with the machine is all that is necessary. Labour's pollsters would argue that anything more radical would risk alienating the contented masses of Middle England, driving them back into the arms of the Conservatives. </p> <p>But there is a different way of looking at things. Despite the good macro-economic numbers, Labour is so cocooned in its micro-management of the country that it fails to see the bigger picture. The global economy spends its time veering from one crisis to another, with the bursting of the hi-tech bubble only the latest in a series of disturbances. </p> <p>As those people in southern England who have spent the past 12 months on flood alert could testify, something weird is happening to the world's weather. When people die in train crashes because the private sector has skimped on safety, there are legitimate questions to ask about ownership. </p> <p>But there's the rub. Where Thatcher had both the opportunity and the ideas, Labour just has the opportunity. Yet the challenges are real and urgent. If the democratic left is not willing to provide a lead, history suggests there will be plenty of others with crackpot panaceas who will. George Bush for one. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Breakfast: Every morning, staff at The Fourth Room, a marketing company in Bloomsbury, are welcomed with free breakfast - filter coffee, drinking chocolate, croissants and cherry jam, fruit and toast - all served on white porcelain. The company's housekeeper, Annie Bradbery, prides herself on the spread. \"It's high-quality, simple and stylish,\" she says. \"The chocolate is organic, and I select all the food and drinks carefully. People just help themselves as they come in, and it creates a very good atmosphere - people enjoy working here.\" </p> <p>It seems that more and more thoughtful companies are offering free, or nearly-free, breakfast to hungry staff - so if your office boasts only a clapped-out kettle, or a vending machine selling custard creams or long-life Cornish pasties, don't read on. Every survey known to man - and woman - shows that a good brekkie sets you up for the day: productivity is increased, you feel better and aren't faint with hunger by lunchtime. And, today, many of us eat that meal at work rather than at home. </p> <p>\"I prefer picking up breakfast when I arrive at work, it saves me time and effort in the morning. I don't have time to make myself anything, but I know that when I get in I can choose from cereals, fresh fruit, or a croissant and tea, to set me up for the day,\" says PA Mary McCabe. </p> <p>Companies now offer everything - from fried breakfasts at the Abbey National head office to herbal teas at the ICL head office in Slough. </p> <p>If you choose to take in your own breakfast, try to avoid cereal bars, crisps and sugary snacks, or mayo-loaded sandwiches. According to Carol Charlton, of the Organic Cafe, the perfect office breakfast to buy or make is \"organic yoghurt, a piece of fruit, a flapjack (preferably organic) and a wholemeal sandwich - sardines are good, so is avocado and tomato on brown bread. </p> <p>\"If you include all of these,\" Charlton says, \"you'll keep going for ages and need little at lunch.\" However, she admits that office workers flock to the Organic Cafes for their famous \"meat breakfast\" - \u00a36 for organic sausage, bacon, eggs, and potatoes. </p> <p>Once a month, the chief executive of Consolidated Communications, a PR company in London, takes six staff to breakfast at a Soho coffee house at 8am - eggs and bacon and espresso all round. All the 100 staff are treated in turn - this is the company that also offers two \"duvet days\" a year for those times when you can't face getting up. Sadly, breakfast in bed is not provided.<br><strong>Diana Cambridge</strong></p> <p><strong>Lunch: </strong>Grab your sandwich and kiss it, kids. Today, Office Hours is celebrating lunchtime, and we're all going to have a proper lunch for once. </p> <p>\"Lunch?\" I hear you yelp. \"Everyone will sneer, and call me a part-timer if I shirk off for a lunch break. No, I'll sit here, frowning at my monitor, and hope no one minds the chewing noises I'm making.\" </p> <p>Well, comrades, we do mind. Not because you should be able to eat without sounding like the boiling muds of New Zealand. Or because you might catch nasty bugs from your grubby old keyboard. Those are bad noises to hear because you should take that lunch break and get out of the office. And if you won't listen to us, take Virginia Woolf's advice: \"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.\" </p> <p>\"Loving\" and \"sleeping\" on the job can get you fired, but \"thinking well\" should be a priority for us all. And, as the lady says, that means eating well. </p> <p>If you make sandwiches, you can eat what you like - some people make five rounds every Sunday and freeze the blighters, removing them before leaving for work. By lunchtime, they're either ready to eat - or ready for emergency dental surgery. </p> <p>Buying sarnies each day, though, means you have to leave the office - and maybe sit in the park, taking some air. But to stop you feeding the ducks with shoddy sandwiches, we tested three of Britain's most popular sarnie shops to sort the ciabattas from the cheese and pickles: Starbucks, Boots and Pret a Manger. </p> <p>For \u00a32.85, Starbucks lets you cart off a \"Mediterranean granary bloomer\" stuffed with humous, roast vegetables and pinenuts. It even throws in soothing jazz and the comforting aroma of brewing coffee while you wait. </p> <p>At the other end of your wallet, Boots does tomato, rocket and parmesan on tomato bread for a bargain \u00a31.70. But it turns out to be too cheap to be true. The bread is a frighteningly vivid orange and the filling little more than an effect, containing \"parmesan-style cheese\". </p> <p>The best buy is Pret's Chicken Caesar. For \u00a32.39, the fresh granary bread, tender chicken, and generous salad in lovely blobs of dressing is about as good as lunch can be. </p> <p>With options such as these, we say lunch should be for ever, not just for Christmas. So today let's make a stand. Office Hours is out to lunch. And come 1 o'clock, so should you be. <br><strong>Tim Ross</strong></p> <p><strong>Dinner: </strong>It's 7.46pm. You've missed East-Enders. In fact you've never even seen EastEnders. It's one of those things, like daylight, TV dinners and your children, that you never see, because you're always stuck working late in the office. Half an hour later you're so hungry you can't even think straight; you're gnawing the empty polystyrene cup on your desk and fantasising about halibut. Sadly, the only thing available at this hour is a packet of Monster Munch and a withered old Cornish pasty from Mr Cheapo's 24 hour Cheapomarket down the road. Or is it? </p> <p>Is it heck. Why make do with a warty old hand of a dinner when you could be devouring scrumptious gourmet concoctions in the comfort of your own office? </p> <p>Simon works for a management consultancy firm in the City. \"We have a microwave in our office, but no one uses it,\" he says, mournfully, \"and facilities for making soup, and a coffee machine, which is broken. Plus a toaster.\" </p> <p>But an oxtail soup and a couple of rounds of sliced white ain't gonna see you through 'til the wee small hours. So if Simon's working late, his company will fork out for his dinner - he can pop out for noodles or, more usually, have food delivered to the office. Most of his colleagues are used to ordering in their evening meals, but it's an art-form that takes a bit of practice. \"Ordering from Pizza Hut is generally seen as a sign of inexperience,\" says Simon, with disdain. </p> <p>Food delivery services are booming. We're not talking about your local Golden Monkey Chinese takeaway here, but companies that provide quality grub and much more.

      "bodyText": "Breakfast: Every morning, staff at The Fourth Room, a marketing company in Bloomsbury, are welcomed with free breakfast - filter coffee, drinking chocolate, croissants and cherry jam, fruit and toast - all served on white porcelain. The company's housekeeper, Annie Bradbery, prides herself on the spread. \"It's high-quality, simple and stylish,\" she says. \"The chocolate is organic, and I select all the food and drinks carefully. People just help themselves as they come in, and it creates a very good atmosphere - people enjoy working here.\" It seems that more and more thoughtful companies are offering free, or nearly-free, breakfast to hungry staff - so if your office boasts only a clapped-out kettle, or a vending machine selling custard creams or long-life Cornish pasties, don't read on. Every survey known to man - and woman - shows that a good brekkie sets you up for the day: productivity is increased, you feel better and aren't faint with hunger by lunchtime. And, today, many of us eat that meal at work rather than at home. \"I prefer picking up breakfast when I arrive at work, it saves me time and effort in the morning. I don't have time to make myself anything, but I know that when I get in I can choose from cereals, fresh fruit, or a croissant and tea, to set me up for the day,\" says PA Mary McCabe. Companies now offer everything - from fried breakfasts at the Abbey National head office to herbal teas at the ICL head office in Slough. If you choose to take in your own breakfast, try to avoid cereal bars, crisps and sugary snacks, or mayo-loaded sandwiches. According to Carol Charlton, of the Organic Cafe, the perfect office breakfast to buy or make is \"organic yoghurt, a piece of fruit, a flapjack (preferably organic) and a wholemeal sandwich - sardines are good, so is avocado and tomato on brown bread. \"If you include all of these,\" Charlton says, \"you'll keep going for ages and need little at lunch.\" However, she admits that office workers flock to the Organic Cafes for their famous \"meat breakfast\" - \u00a36 for organic sausage, bacon, eggs, and potatoes. Once a month, the chief executive of Consolidated Communications, a PR company in London, takes six staff to breakfast at a Soho coffee house at 8am - eggs and bacon and espresso all round. All the 100 staff are treated in turn - this is the company that also offers two \"duvet days\" a year for those times when you can't face getting up. Sadly, breakfast in bed is not provided. Diana Cambridge Lunch: Grab your sandwich and kiss it, kids. Today, Office Hours is celebrating lunchtime, and we're all going to have a proper lunch for once. \"Lunch?\" I hear you yelp. \"Everyone will sneer, and call me a part-timer if I shirk off for a lunch break. No, I'll sit here, frowning at my monitor, and hope no one minds the chewing noises I'm making.\" Well, comrades, we do mind. Not because you should be able to eat without sounding like the boiling muds of New Zealand. Or because you might catch nasty bugs from your grubby old keyboard. Those are bad noises to hear because you should take that lunch break and get out of the office. And if you won't listen to us, take Virginia Woolf's advice: \"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.\" \"Loving\" and \"sleeping\" on the job can get you fired, but \"thinking well\" should be a priority for us all. And, as the lady says, that means eating well. If you make sandwiches, you can eat what you like - some people make five rounds every Sunday and freeze the blighters, removing them before leaving for work. By lunchtime, they're either ready to eat - or ready for emergency dental surgery. Buying sarnies each day, though, means you have to leave the office - and maybe sit in the park, taking some air. But to stop you feeding the ducks with shoddy sandwiches, we tested three of Britain's most popular sarnie shops to sort the ciabattas from the cheese and pickles: Starbucks, Boots and Pret a Manger. For \u00a32.85, Starbucks lets you cart off a \"Mediterranean granary bloomer\" stuffed with humous, roast vegetables and pinenuts. It even throws in soothing jazz and the comforting aroma of brewing coffee while you wait. At the other end of your wallet, Boots does tomato, rocket and parmesan on tomato bread for a bargain \u00a31.70. But it turns out to be too cheap to be true. The bread is a frighteningly vivid orange and the filling little more than an effect, containing \"parmesan-style cheese\". The best buy is Pret's Chicken Caesar. For \u00a32.39, the fresh granary bread, tender chicken, and generous salad in lovely blobs of dressing is about as good as lunch can be. With options such as these, we say lunch should be for ever, not just for Christmas. So today let's make a stand. Office Hours is out to lunch. And come 1 o'clock, so should you be. Tim Ross Dinner: It's 7.46pm. You've missed East-Enders. In fact you've never even seen EastEnders. It's one of those things, like daylight, TV dinners and your children, that you never see, because you're always stuck working late in the office. Half an hour later you're so hungry you can't even think straight; you're gnawing the empty polystyrene cup on your desk and fantasising about halibut. Sadly, the only thing available at this hour is a packet of Monster Munch and a withered old Cornish pasty from Mr Cheapo's 24 hour Cheapomarket down the road. Or is it? Is it heck. Why make do with a warty old hand of a dinner when you could be devouring scrumptious gourmet concoctions in the comfort of your own office? Simon works for a management consultancy firm in the City. \"We have a microwave in our office, but no one uses it,\" he says, mournfully, \"and facilities for making soup, and a coffee machine, which is broken. Plus a toaster.\" But an oxtail soup and a couple of rounds of sliced white ain't gonna see you through 'til the wee small hours. So if Simon's working late, his company will fork out for his dinner - he can pop out for noodles or, more usually, have food delivered to the office. Most of his colleagues are used to ordering in their evening meals, but it's an art-form that takes a bit of practice. \"Ordering from Pizza Hut is generally seen as a sign of inexperience,\" says Simon, with disdain. Food delivery services are booming. We're not talking about your local Golden Monkey Chinese takeaway here, but companies that provide quality grub and much more. Sadly the majority are London-based. www.roomservice.co.uk collects your grub from restaurants in the city, and delivers them to your desk for a piffling \u00a34. There's a vast range of menus, including Mexican, Japanese, Greek and Italian, and it will also bring you a bottle of vino, should you feel in need of \"inspiration\". Call 020-7644 6666 for details. Claiming to be \"fresh, authentic, delicious and hot\" (don't we all, baby) is www.deliverance.co.uk, which delivers food cooked in its own kitchens. You can sample such delights as kedgeree, Moroccan lamb tagine, orange cheesecake and H\u00e4agen Dazs. Delivery is free on orders over \u00a312.

Staff love it,\" explains co-founder George Michaelides. </p> <p>Hot-desking is the latest extension of the \"open-plan\" style of working, with e-business ICL being the latest company to use the practice, which involves everyone agreeing to sit and work wherever there's a space available that day. </p> <p>But hot-desking does not suit everyone, cautions occupational psychologist Bridget Hogg. \"If it is not the employees' choice to get rid of their desks, they may feel they have no space to call their own and suffer quite a severe loss. Without any territory, many people feel unstable and undervalued. In turn, they may be less productive. I would advise any secretary thinking about taking a job where hot-desking is the norm to carefully consider their suitability to this way of working.\" </p> <p>\"Even open-plan offices where there is no hot-desking can have an adverse effect on some secretaries,\" warns organisational psychologist Dr Terry Kellard. \"Studies show that rather than interacting well, people who are naturally 'private' instinctively put up clear barriers to create their own territory\" </p> <p>The result? Your desk neighbour doesn't have much chance of being chatted to, let alone of becoming your new best friend. Secretaries, he says, should think about their behaviours around space in their home lives. \"If you're fanatical about needing your own space at home, the chances are you'll be the same at work.\" </p> <p>Open-plan offices may cause some workers high levels of stress, adds Gary Evans, an environmental psychologist from Cornell University, New York. He divided a group of 40 female clerical workers between a quiet office and one with low office noise and then monitored their behaviour for three hours. </p> <p>He found that workers in the noisy office had significantly higher stress levels and made 40% fewer attempts to solve an unsolvable puzzle. \"We're unsure as to why there is such a dramatic reduction in work performance, but the lack of motivation is probably due to the uncontrollability of noise which can lead some workers to feel that they cannot control their surroundings,\" he explains. </p> <p>Again, consider your tolerance levels at home. Does it drive you mad when the television is on, the kids are playing and your partner is mumbling away to you? Or do you thrive on it? \"Historically, secretaries have worked in isolation and so those who feel that suits them best need not feel like freaks,\" says Eileen Hill. \"In fact, one of the best things about secretarial work is that - unlike many other jobs - they have the choice of working in all kinds of environments.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>The next public engagement for Julia Roberts and Russell Crowe following their recent Oscar successes could be with thousands of fellow actors on picket lines around Hollywood. </p> <p>Los Angeles is becoming used to blackouts as California is hit by a series of power cuts. But if blank screens are not exactly on the agenda, audiences may soon be confronted by extensive repeats and a lot more \"reality TV\". </p> <p>From May 2, the Writers Guild of America's 11,000 members plan to go on strike. They may well be joined by the 135,000-strong Screen Actors Guild from the end of June, as contracts both unions have with the studios come to an end. This follows an unprecedented six-month strike last spring, aimed at the commercials sector. </p> <p>The economic impact of a combined strike would be enormous: 10% of employment in Los Angeles is tied directly or indirectly to the film and TV production industries. The action could easily cost $1.8bn per month. </p> <p>The media will inevitably focus on the likes of Harrison Ford, paid $25m for 20 days' work on K-19: The Widowmaker. Less obvious, however, will be the impact on the tens of thousands of jobbing actors and actresses whose average income hovers close to the US minimum wage. </p> <p>Also badly hit will be the hundreds of thousands who make, or scrape, a living in one of the scores of technical and ancillary jobs, from camera to catering, on which the movie industry is built. </p> <p>The dispute is about residuals, the royalty payments actors receive for repeat showings.

      "bodyText": "The next public engagement for Julia Roberts and Russell Crowe following their recent Oscar successes could be with thousands of fellow actors on picket lines around Hollywood. Los Angeles is becoming used to blackouts as California is hit by a series of power cuts. But if blank screens are not exactly on the agenda, audiences may soon be confronted by extensive repeats and a lot more \"reality TV\". From May 2, the Writers Guild of America's 11,000 members plan to go on strike. They may well be joined by the 135,000-strong Screen Actors Guild from the end of June, as contracts both unions have with the studios come to an end. This follows an unprecedented six-month strike last spring, aimed at the commercials sector. The economic impact of a combined strike would be enormous: 10% of employment in Los Angeles is tied directly or indirectly to the film and TV production industries. The action could easily cost $1.8bn per month. The media will inevitably focus on the likes of Harrison Ford, paid $25m for 20 days' work on K-19: The Widowmaker. Less obvious, however, will be the impact on the tens of thousands of jobbing actors and actresses whose average income hovers close to the US minimum wage. Also badly hit will be the hundreds of thousands who make, or scrape, a living in one of the scores of technical and ancillary jobs, from camera to catering, on which the movie industry is built. The dispute is about residuals, the royalty payments actors receive for repeat showings.

A particularly attractive cottage that has come up for rent over Easter is in <strong> St Agnes </strong> on the north coast. The good thing about this double-fronted, oak-beamed cottage (it sleeps six) is that you can walk to the beach and there's a good pub and shop nearby. Available from 13 April for one week, price \u00a3346. </p> <p>\u0095 If you want to get the last bit of skiing of the season in, but your children are still small, try <strong> Zermatt</strong>, Switzerland. Its high altitude makes it one of the better bets for good snow conditions and the resort offers decent child care. Powder Byrne (020 8246 5300) doesn't come cheap, but is very flexible and doesn't fall short on service. Seven nights half-board from 7 to 15 April starts at \u00a3829 per person. Children under two can go for \u00a360; it's \u00a3280 for those under three.

The great thing is that the break falls over all those bank holidays, so you can have four days on the beach without dipping into your annual holiday entitlement. There is a drawback (of course). They are night flights, which means that you would have to arrive in the office straight from the airport on 17 April looking tanned, but knackered. </p> <p>\u0095 Greek Orthodox Easter with candlelit processions and firework displays make this a special time to visit Greece (and the celebrations are, unusually, on the same weekend as our Easter this year).

Not only is it reasonably priced, but has stunning mountain scenery. Slovenija Pursuits (0870 2200 201) has five-day breaks over Easter (on a choice of departure dates) which include a three-day trek in the Karavanke Alps, staying in mountain refuges and visiting traditional herdsmen's huts.

Despite the jetlag and long flying times, people are choosing to go on them. They are aimed at the type of people who just can't face another short break in New York - they've been so many times. San Francisco (11 hours 10 minutes flight) is now the top long-haul choice for Travelscene customers, followed by Singapore (12 hours 40 minutes) and Rio de Janeiro (13 hours 40 minutes). Four-night breaks in <strong> San Francisco </strong> start at \u00a3549 per person including three-star hotel, return flights from Heathrow, Birmingham or Manchester.

That did not happen. </p> <p>The lipstick container that struck Ashley Cole at the end might have been intended for the scorer of the goal he was celebrating, but after breaking his international duck after six years the only flak Andy Cole had to field was from his own fans. 'Great goal Andy,' an England follower shouted as the Manchester United striker boarded the team coach. Cole turned to acknowledge the compliment and into a trap. 'Pity, I could have scored that one myself - as well as half the ones you've missed.' Cole kept up a level stare. 'You should be playing then, shouldn't you,' he said, before putting himself out of earshot. </p> <p>Touche, one might have thought, although the irony probably struck Cole as he lowered himself into his seat. He is the one who is not going to be playing. The yellow card that ruled him out of the next qualifier against Greece in June is unlikely to persuade Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson to select him for the preparatory friendly against Mexico a fortnight earlier. Cole effectively misses the next two England games, and that means two chances for Robbie Fowler or Emile Heskey to make an impression. </p> <p>Eriksson, who has been assiduously expressing belief in Cole in the hope the striker would come good in front of goal to settle all the arguments, must be just as aware as Cole that the Liverpool pair will not be content to be sidelined indefinitely.

It is faintly ludicrous that in the season in which G\u00e9rard Houllier has finally succeeded in stopping Heskey taking up wide positions and encouraged him to run at central defenders, he keeps popping up on the wing for England.

'I'm not concerned that there are too many kids in the team, it's more a case of being impressed that young players are coming through and taking their chances so well,' he said. 'I thought Wes Brown and Rio Ferdinand were both great. It was a pity about the goal, but these things happen. Some of our experienced players have retired, and Martin Keown has been injured, so we had to react to that.' </p> <p>Eriksson admitted that the depth of young talent in England was one of the factors that had persuaded him to take the job. 'We now have seven points, we have won three games, and I think we were convincing in all three,' he said. 'We deserved to win them all. I know perfectly well we haven't met France away yet, but all games are difficult today and we have made a good start. The aim before I came here was to do everything to qualify for the next World Cup, but because the team is so young it is possible to look a bit further and say England could have a very good team in a few years.

While his side might not have been quite as convincing as he appears to be suggesting, at least Eriksson has been decisive and brave enough to deserve some luck. He played Seaman, stuck with Andy Cole, and did not stand on ceremony when dropping Chris Powell. He was quick to remove the ineffective Steve McManaman on Wednesday, and can be expected to be just as positive when considering his striking options for the next game. </p> <p>'The new manager is very efficient, and we needed that,' Sol Campbell said. 'He is very positive, he goes through all the aspects of the game but he doesn't waste energy. He goes over what he wants each of us to do, but he doesn't overload you with stuff. The team is responding to him, there is a nice balance now with a few young players coming through, and he's got our respect. We've played well over the two games to get six points, and we want to keep on winning.

Brazil should be safe despite their defeat by Ecuador in midweek, though at the moment the '98 losing finalists are uncomfortably close to having to rely on the play-off route. Argentina, England's nemesis in France 98 and early favourites to win in Japan and Korea, are all too clearly the real power in South America now. </p> <p>A German win in Helsinki on 2 June would leave England a clear run to second place and render September's showdown in Munich a formality.

      "bodyText": "So concerted was the racist abuse aimed at Darius Vassell and Shola Ameobi in the England under-21 game in Tirana that several previews of the full international a day later expressed fears that Andy Cole might come under similar attack. That did not happen. The lipstick container that struck Ashley Cole at the end might have been intended for the scorer of the goal he was celebrating, but after breaking his international duck after six years the only flak Andy Cole had to field was from his own fans. 'Great goal Andy,' an England follower shouted as the Manchester United striker boarded the team coach. Cole turned to acknowledge the compliment and into a trap. 'Pity, I could have scored that one myself - as well as half the ones you've missed.' Cole kept up a level stare. 'You should be playing then, shouldn't you,' he said, before putting himself out of earshot. Touche, one might have thought, although the irony probably struck Cole as he lowered himself into his seat. He is the one who is not going to be playing. The yellow card that ruled him out of the next qualifier against Greece in June is unlikely to persuade Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson to select him for the preparatory friendly against Mexico a fortnight earlier. Cole effectively misses the next two England games, and that means two chances for Robbie Fowler or Emile Heskey to make an impression. Eriksson, who has been assiduously expressing belief in Cole in the hope the striker would come good in front of goal to settle all the arguments, must be just as aware as Cole that the Liverpool pair will not be content to be sidelined indefinitely. Fowler has already been through all that with Alan Shearer, and both his club form and his sharpness in England training suggest he is presently a more reliable finisher than Cole, whose international statistics do not paint a false picture - one goal in 13 games. If Fowler and Michael Owen are deemed too instinctively predatory to form a partnership, Heskey deserves a try in his true position.

At 38 he is Spain's oldest outfield player at the top level, and although he may look podgy, slow and unwieldy, and glories in the nickname of Abuelo , or Grandad, he reads the game superbly and makes the issue of speed irrelevant. He has already been offered a contract extension. </p> <p>Donato packs one hell of a free-kick so comparisons with Ian Harte's technique will be interesting. His thunderbolts are known as 'Donatazos' by his adoring fans. And it was Donato's headed goal that broke the deadlock, settled his side and sent them on their way to their title in the final game of last season. There were those who raised eyebrows when Deportivo paid Atletico Madrid \u00a3400,000 for the old boy eight years ago and it is remarkable that he keeps up to the standard after a career spanning more than 20 years - which began with Vasco da Gama in his native Brazil. </p> <p>He's part of a Brazilian-spiced side that has Spaniards at its core after Lendoiro decided to go local and buy only Spanish players or those already settled in the league. This followed a disastrous flirtation with buying cheap foreigners - the accompanying passport scandal still haunts the club - and within a year of the new policy, the dividend came with the Liga title. </p> <p>Directing team affairs is coach Jabo Irureta, backed by Lendoiro's ability always to turn a profit on a transfer deal (notably, \u00a34 million pocketed from the sale of Sylvain Wiltord to Arsenal from a sell-on clause - he never kicked a ball for Deportivo). Between them they have created a small-town force, drawing on a population of just 240,000, with the ability to kick big-city ass in the time-honoured style of Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and, more recently, Blackburn Rovers. Provincial clubs, previously languishing, who pop up to win their national title. </p> <p>Deportivo deserve even more credit because they have done it in the ultra-modern era of huge TV deals, concentrating cash among the well-heeled elite. These days Barca and Real Madrid constantly check over their shoulders. </p> <p>Irureta, a disciplinarian, is true to his 4-2-3-1 style and requires players to fit this formation, never vice-versa. Not all approve - Eighties Liverpool star Michael Robinson's Monday night TV show in Spain recently screened footage of two Deportivo squad players ripping into their coach on the bench - but he gets results. </p> <p>Donato is flanked at centre-back by the Moroccan Nourredine Naybet, shielded by the two midfield anchors, Mauro Silva, a World Cup winner, and Bryan Robson's Brazilian pal Emerson.

But Molina is convinced his side will prevail. </p> <p>'It's the most important game in Depor's history,' he says, '_until the next round.' Emerson, who had a passing acquaintance with the Premiership, agrees. 'Depor are favourites,' he declared. 'There's no need to worry. We'll show we're better and that the league in Spain is superior.' </p> <p>Such talk will not faze Leeds - words don't impress O'Leary or his players.

Maybe he can watch us in the quarter-final on television! We don't care what people say about us. All that matters is getting a result. Deportivo are a good team.

      "body": "<p>I'm dozing when something odd brushes against my stomach. Something very odd. Maybe I'm dreaming. Suddenly, I feel a second brush, this time against my legs and I'm sure it's more of a scamper than a brush. I pa nic, jump out of bed and fling back the pink nylon sheets to reveal a 10-inch mubuya maculata , better known as a lizard to you and me. </p> <p>I shouldn't really be surprised. This is Fernando de Noronha, a group of 21 islets off the coast of north-east Brazil, with some of the strictest rules in the world to keep touris m numbers down to a bare minimum and wildlife flourishing to the full. </p> <p>There are animals everywhere. Hundreds of spinner dolphins play in the bays and stingrays greet you as you snorkel in the Atlantic. Lizards dart everywhere. Every time I feel a wriggle on my toes it's yet another mubuya maculata . At one point there are 10 in conference at my sandy feet, plus a local mouse. </p> <p>The islands are grand, green and mountainous with yellow sand fringes. Having once been volcanic they aren't the pretty, turquoise, paradise images associated with the Maldives or Bahamas, but rocky masses with attitude. </p> <p>This is a shock to me. I'm looking forward to the 16 untouched beaches. A band of male divers all with hairy wrists with watches the size of bricks and wearing matching black T-shirts are more fascinated by the underwater sea turtles, octopuses and jewfish and finding out about the 14 species of shark that inhabit the waters. </p> <p>While islands around the world are knocking up luxury resorts, this is a place where nature stays as it is. </p> <p>The guardian of these islands is Ibama, the environmental protection agency that administers Brazil's national parks. Until 1987 Brazil's armed forces had a base here. When they pulled out, discussions raged about building luxury resorts and golf courses. After a huge battle between environmentalists and the government, the eco-warriors won and Fernando was decreed a national park. </p> <p>Only 420 tourists can stay in Fernando per night (that's the size of one hotel in other parts of the world). When that number is reached, you go on a waiting list with the tour companies that go there. </p> <p>You also have to pay an eco-tax in cash in the arrivals hall (or rather shed) to get in, ranging from \u00a37 for one night to \u00a3585 for a month. You are financially encouraged not to outstay your welcome. </p> <p>I scan a big booklet of rules handed to me at the airport. They include: no swimming with dolphins; no access to beaches between 6pm and 8am, no camping, no feeding animals and the one that really catches my eye - no footwear or suntan cream on Atalaia Beach (to protect marine life). </p> <p>We jump into a beach buggy taxi which scrambles up a dusty hill, round a bend and into a clearing where most of the 420 people staying the night have gathered. Many are draped on rocks, gazing into the bay with jagged mountains behind, waiting for the big show sunset. It's only six o'clock. In minutes, people turn into silhouettes and one by one get back into their buggies (the only transport, which is limited, of course) and roar away. We are staying in Casa das Pedras, which is a stone self-catering house, up a dusty road in the most populated part of Fernando. That said, there is nothing much there other than a few small houses with decks at the front, a few rooms to rent at the back and a small hall where weekly eco-lectures are held. Back at the house the fridge is bare. The road is dark (no street lighting in paradise) and no restaurants in sight. No supermarkets either. And absolutely no humans. My husband, Markus, goes out hunting for food and a 20-minute walk later finds the only pizzeria in town. I fall asleep hungry. The windows smeared with salt water stains rattle in the wind and the bed's sponge mattress has seen better days. We wake up with the dawn. There's a small frog in the bathroom sink (this sort of thing is no longer a surprise). </p> <p>If you like your creature comforts, this is not the place for you. There's only one hotel - a corrugated iron ex-army barracks - and a bunch of basic B&amp;Bs run by locals. It's impossible to get a decent meal. Most meals consist of a few bits of locally caught fish and a pile of salad stuff from tins. </p> <p>But the payoff for keeping tourism small is pristine beaches and clear underwater diving (up to 50 metres).

      "bodyText": "I'm dozing when something odd brushes against my stomach. Something very odd. Maybe I'm dreaming. Suddenly, I feel a second brush, this time against my legs and I'm sure it's more of a scamper than a brush. I pa nic, jump out of bed and fling back the pink nylon sheets to reveal a 10-inch mubuya maculata , better known as a lizard to you and me. I shouldn't really be surprised. This is Fernando de Noronha, a group of 21 islets off the coast of north-east Brazil, with some of the strictest rules in the world to keep touris m numbers down to a bare minimum and wildlife flourishing to the full. There are animals everywhere. Hundreds of spinner dolphins play in the bays and stingrays greet you as you snorkel in the Atlantic. Lizards dart everywhere. Every time I feel a wriggle on my toes it's yet another mubuya maculata . At one point there are 10 in conference at my sandy feet, plus a local mouse. The islands are grand, green and mountainous with yellow sand fringes. Having once been volcanic they aren't the pretty, turquoise, paradise images associated with the Maldives or Bahamas, but rocky masses with attitude. This is a shock to me. I'm looking forward to the 16 untouched beaches. A band of male divers all with hairy wrists with watches the size of bricks and wearing matching black T-shirts are more fascinated by the underwater sea turtles, octopuses and jewfish and finding out about the 14 species of shark that inhabit the waters. While islands around the world are knocking up luxury resorts, this is a place where nature stays as it is. The guardian of these islands is Ibama, the environmental protection agency that administers Brazil's national parks. Until 1987 Brazil's armed forces had a base here. When they pulled out, discussions raged about building luxury resorts and golf courses. After a huge battle between environmentalists and the government, the eco-warriors won and Fernando was decreed a national park. Only 420 tourists can stay in Fernando per night (that's the size of one hotel in other parts of the world). When that number is reached, you go on a waiting list with the tour companies that go there. You also have to pay an eco-tax in cash in the arrivals hall (or rather shed) to get in, ranging from \u00a37 for one night to \u00a3585 for a month. You are financially encouraged not to outstay your welcome. I scan a big booklet of rules handed to me at the airport. They include: no swimming with dolphins; no access to beaches between 6pm and 8am, no camping, no feeding animals and the one that really catches my eye - no footwear or suntan cream on Atalaia Beach (to protect marine life). We jump into a beach buggy taxi which scrambles up a dusty hill, round a bend and into a clearing where most of the 420 people staying the night have gathered. Many are draped on rocks, gazing into the bay with jagged mountains behind, waiting for the big show sunset. It's only six o'clock. In minutes, people turn into silhouettes and one by one get back into their buggies (the only transport, which is limited, of course) and roar away. We are staying in Casa das Pedras, which is a stone self-catering house, up a dusty road in the most populated part of Fernando. That said, there is nothing much there other than a few small houses with decks at the front, a few rooms to rent at the back and a small hall where weekly eco-lectures are held. Back at the house the fridge is bare. The road is dark (no street lighting in paradise) and no restaurants in sight. No supermarkets either. And absolutely no humans. My husband, Markus, goes out hunting for food and a 20-minute walk later finds the only pizzeria in town. I fall asleep hungry. The windows smeared with salt water stains rattle in the wind and the bed's sponge mattress has seen better days. We wake up with the dawn. There's a small frog in the bathroom sink (this sort of thing is no longer a surprise). If you like your creature comforts, this is not the place for you. There's only one hotel - a corrugated iron ex-army barracks - and a bunch of basic B&amp;Bs run by locals. It's impossible to get a decent meal. Most meals consist of a few bits of locally caught fish and a pile of salad stuff from tins. But the payoff for keeping tourism small is pristine beaches and clear underwater diving (up to 50 metres). And the locals benefit directly from tourism by being the sole providers of food, beds and taxis. Just three registered companies run the diving. We go down to the island's busiest beach, Praia do Cachorro, where local kids run in the sand and jump in the waves. This is not a good place to feel thirsty - no beach huts serving cocktails here.

Davos (45/220cm) had good piste running, but lower pistes to Klosters (0/80cm) were closed. Zermatt (10/220cm) had hard runs turning slushy.

Men outnumber women by 10 to one in rural Alaska, so any snow-bound machismo followed by heroic drinking is deemed acceptable. In reality, the only thing that makes sense about the Arctic Man is where it was dreamt up: on a bar stool. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> The contest. Competitors ski down a mountain, catch a towrope on the fly and then get hauled around by a snowmobile at 80mph. 'Survivors' can win $50,000. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> Risqu\u00e9 hot-tub parties and 'high-marking' - driving a snowmobile straight up a mountain until gravity takes over. Last year, this pastime earned one unfortunate the Darwin Award: after surviving one self-inflicted avalanche, he went back for more and died in the second. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001 907 456 2626; <a href=\"http://www.alaska.net/arcticmn\">www.alaska.net/arcticmn</a> </p> <p> <strong> 2 World Cow Chip Throwing Contest</strong><br> 21 April, Beaver, Oklahoma </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> People - and flies - descend on this Panhandle town to watch cow dung flung.<br> <strong> Why: </strong> For nineteenth-century pioneers, chucking dried cow 'chips' into their wagons meant something to burn come winter. In 1970, Beaver revived this lost art. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> Some people really can shoot the shit. In 1979, Leland Searcy set the world record by slinging a chip 182ft 3in. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> Be photographed with a 10ft statue of a beaver holding a cow chip.<br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001 580 625 4726 </p> <p> <strong> 3 The World Grits Festival</strong><br> 20-22 April, St George, South Carolina </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> A three-day celebration of grits, the tasteless goop made from boiled ground corn. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> God only knows. Frankly, a mouthful of glue is more edifying than a bowl of grits. Cross the Mason-Dixon line, however, and people go mad for it. In tiny St George, locals spoon down more grits per capita than anywhere else. The town decided to cash in: now 30,000 people (15 times the town's population) show up to eat 3,000lb of grits. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> Rolling in the grits. You dive into a pool filled with cold grits, and whoever gets the most stuck to their body wins. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> A corn-shelling contest and the Miss Grits beauty parade. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001 843 563 4366 </p> <p> <strong> 4 The Summer Redneck Games</strong><br> Early July, East Dublin, Georgia </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> Bubbas, Billy-Rays and Billie-Jeans go for gold in true Southern style. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> Started as a joke to complement the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Locals hated it at first but were gradually won over by the tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Southerners as beer-swillin', hog-callin', belly-floppin' hicks. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> The beer-can torch procession. Guaranteed to put a tear in the eyes. Or is that just the smoke from the barbecue pit? <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> The mud-pit belly flop, bobbing for pig's feet, a dive into a dumpster and the armpit serenade.

Come cluck in front of 15,000 people. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> This was an arts and crafts fair, but the inaugural chicken theme stole the show. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> The Cluck-Off Championship (hear previous winners on the web). <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> The 'best chicken legs on a human' contest and the Chickendale male dancers' revue. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001 402 375 2240; <a href=\"http://www.chickenshow.com\">www.chickenshow.com</a></p> <p><strong> 6 The Great Texas Mosquito Festival</strong><br> 27-28 July, Clute, Texas </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> Up to 23,000 people celebrate tiny, whiny bloodsuckers. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> Clute has a hell of a lot of them. 'It's our only natural resource,' says the spokeswoman. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> A 25ft mosquito named Willie Man-Chew, which sports a Stetson, boots and a mighty big stinger. This is Texas, after all. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> A Ms Quito pageant and a mosquito-calling contest.

Robert Duck. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> Rent-a-duck, outhouse racing and a royal duck pageant. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001 505 546-2674; <a href=\"http://www.demingduckrace.com\">www.demingduckrace.com</a> </p> <p> <strong> 8 Sta-Bil National Lawn Mower Race Championships</strong> <br>1 September, Indianapolis, Indiana </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> Grown men (and a few women) race ride-on lawn mowers at up to 60mph. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> An April Fool's joke in 1992 has turned into a fully fledged, televised sport. The cheeky organisers are even applying to Athens for Olympics status. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> Watching the lumbering machines - with names such as Sodzilla, Turfinator and the Lawn Ranger - attempting to corner hay bales at high speeds and remain upright. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> A special push-mower race set up specially for the Brits. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 00 1 847 729-7363; <a href=\"http://www.letsmow.com\">www.letsmow.com</a></p> <p> <strong> 9 The Testicle Festival</strong> <br>13-17 September, Clinton, Montana </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> America's nuttiest event. Two tonnes of 'Rocky Mountain Oysters' (bull testicles) are sliced off, marinated in beer, battered, deep-fried and served to 15,000 visitors. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> No other festival draws such diversity, everyone from grandmothers, biker gangs, comely university co-eds and leather-faced ranch-hands. 'Cowboy caviare' must be powerful - all of the above behave badly and tend to 'get naked'. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> 'Bite the Ball', where motorcycle passengers attempt to bite a testicle dangling from a fishing pole. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> The Nut Queen pageant, Co-ed Naked Pool and Bullshit Bingo, where you bet on one of 20 squares in a corral. A calf is set loose and if it does the business on your square you win. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001 406 825 4868; <a href=\"http://www.testyfesty.com\">www.testyfesty.com</a> (warning: website, like festival, contains gratuitous nudity). </p> <p> <strong> 10 Emma Crawford Coffin Festival</strong><br>26-27 October, Manitou Springs, Colorado </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> Macabre funereal fun. <br> <strong> Why:</strong> Emma Crawford came here in the late 1800s seeking relief from tuberculosis... and died. According to her wishes, her body was buried on nearby Red Mountain. In the early 1900s, a storm washed her coffin straight down the hillside. The town decided to pay homage in the poorest possible taste. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> The Coffin Race. Teams of four pallbearers and wheeled coffins (each with a pale, costumed 'Emma' inside) assemble near the town clock then sprint down Main Street. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> Manitou Springs also hosts the messy Great Fruitcake Toss in January. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001 719 685-5089; <a href=\"http://www.manitousprings.org/events.htm\">www.manitousprings.org/events.htm</a> </p> <p> <strong> 11 The World Championship Punkin' Chunkin' Contest</strong> <br> 2-4 November, Millsboro, Delaware </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> Boffins build sophisticated devices that hurl 8lb pumpkins into the air. The only rule: no explosives. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> Started as a simple wager between farmers in 1986. The first winner managed 128ft; the current record is 4,109ft. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> Watching hundreds fly at speeds up to 400mph. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> The Heath Robinson-type ingenuity that designers bring to their demented hurling contraptions. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> 001<strong> </strong> 302 8561444; <a href=\"http://www.punkinchunkin.com\">www.punkinchunkin.com</a> </p> <p> <strong> 12 The Molasses Disaster Festival</strong><br> 15-16 December, Sucarnoochee, Mississippi </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> A Mississippi town remembers a sticky moment. <br> <strong> Why: </strong> In 1932, a distillery tank exploded at the local sugar plant, releasing two million gallons of unrefined black treacle into the streets. Over three days, the unstoppable 15ft tidal wave of molasses levelled the place. <br> <strong> Highlight: </strong> The 'Run For Your Lives' Sugar Race. A good part of the town's Main Street is fenced off with interconnecting hardboard walls, the participants line up and a 10,000-gallon cauldron of fast-running corn syrup is tipped behind them. <br> <strong> Other attractions: </strong> Molasses-swallerin' contest and the Stuck On You Strutters Ball. <br> <strong> Contact: </strong> <a href=\"http://home.swbell.net/dietricj/molasses\">http://home.swbell.net/dietricj/molasses</a></p> <p><strong>The competition</strong></p> <p>Can you spot the phoney event?

A good part of the town's Main Street is fenced off with interconnecting hardboard walls, the participants line up and a 10,000-gallon cauldron of fast-running corn syrup is tipped behind them. Other attractions: Molasses-swallerin' contest and the Stuck On You Strutters Ball. Contact: http://home.swbell.net/dietricj/molasses The competition Can you spot the phoney event? The correct answer picked out of a hat will win two return tickets in American Airlines economy class (which has increased leg room on its flights) to a US city on its network from the UK.

The manager of Mission Aviation Fellowship in Nairobi was in the midst of coping with his organisation's first crash in a decade, a forced landing in rural Tanzania that left the engine some distance from the rest of the plane and its five occupants in hospital. Just as he was trying to organise an air ambulance to take them to Europe, dealing with all the stress and red tape, a British journalist turned up looking for a free ride. </p> <p>It's a tribute to his patience - or Christian charity - that he didn't throw me out. Instead he let me accompany him to the hospital where Marit Bu Oppedal was strapped in a surgical corset, her injured face resembling a harvest moon. Yet she seemed to have experienced a kind of epiphany. 'We were flying down a valley under the cloud, and we realised we were locked in. A massive downdraught caught us, because suddenly the pilot couldn't keep the plane in the air any more. I just remember climbing out of it, drenched with blood, then villagers approaching, covering us with blankets. I remember thinking, \"yes, human nature is essentially good\". And all the time in the background, there were female voices singing a kind of lament.' </p> <p>St John ambulances arrived, and rocketed through the streets of Nairobi at 80mph, lights flashing, with Bernard racing to keep up, muttering: 'Don't they realise these people have back injuries ?' At last, the patients were transferred on to British Airways stretchers. As Bernard and I drove away, we passed a dented car and the body of a dead pedestrian. We pulled over, but others were already helping. We drove on in silence. At last Bernard said: 'I wouldn't want you to think this is an ordinary day for me. On the other hand, it's not that unusual...' </p> <p>Terlouw, 40, is a Dutchman who until three years ago was studying theology. Then he and his wife Margriet - a pastor - and their three children received a calling. Now they work with MAF, an organisation created in the late 1940s by two RAF pilots who wanted to turn their wartime skills to good use. Today, a MAF plane takes off some where in the developing world every four minutes. </p> <p>I had hoped MAF might help me fly into Sudan. Bernard was hesitant. 'You know the parable of the good Samaritan? Well, without his donkey, he couldn't have carried the injured man. MAF is a donkey; people do aid, relief and mission work all over the world, and we exist to carry them, fly them over war zones, take them into places it would need days to reach by land.' He grinned. 'Are you doing any good works, Martin?' In the end he agreed to carry me - if there was space. </p> <p>Marcos Habtetsion, an Eritrean ex-fighter pilot, has flown with MAF for 15 years. Our flight last Tuesday began with a prayer. Then we headed north to Marsabit, an oasis built on volcanic slopes in the middle of the Karoli Desert. Much of the 400-mile road to Marsabit is lawless; you either go by armed convoy - or fly in. The passengers were two officials from the UN's World Food Programme. A thunderstorm loomed, carrying before it an apron of red dust 2,000ft high. We diverted, but reached the volcanic cones of Marsabit just as the storm did. As we dropped towards the airstrip, a black cloud suddenly came over a ridge and bore down on us, engulfing the town. Marcos threw the plane into a steep bank, but the cloud swallowed us. I glimpsed rooftops close enough to touch - then grey. We were flying blind at 300ft, with peaks all around us. Happily, Marcos knows Marsabit well. We burst out of the cloud low over trees, and aimed for a rectangle of sunlit desert. I was laughing with relief as we put down on orange sand.

Even standard rooms in the Royal Palm come complete with oriental antiques, Persian carpets and walk-in wardrobes twice the size of the average British bathroom; the wine list would probably bankrupt several South American republics. Due to be unveiled later this year on its own island, the Ile des Deux Cocos, is another top-drawer retreat, Follies, where guests will be transported on old-fashioned rickshaws to suites crammed with executive toys. The personal DVDs and hand telephones can be carried to the beach. The visitors will sleep on 'sea green Irish linen'. </p> <p>The Seychelles are enjoying a more modest rise in popularity, of between 10 and 15 per cent. Dubbed 'the Garden of Eden' because of the brilliant lushness of their vegetation, teeming wildlife and bewitching charm, these have the best scenery of all the Indian Ocean islands. Adrift 1,000 miles off the African coast, there are more than 100 of them, some coral, some volcanic, all different - an island-hopper's delight. </p> <p>The snag is that they are not cheap. Where Mauritius is often quoted as a four-star island with five-star hotels, the Seychelles are described as a five-star destination with four-star accommodation - if you're lucky! Tour operators claim that underinvestment in hotels and training plus a flirtation with environmental taxes have made it difficult to justify the high prices. But there are signs of change: there are already a couple of hotel superstars - the two-year-old island-resort of Fr\u00e9gate, where only 40 guests unwind in sumptuous seclusion at nearly \u00a31,000 per night; and last year's new leisure palace, the Mauritian-owned Lemuria, on Praslin, much lauded by new British holidaymakers, though not so popular with old Praslin hands who have lost access to favourite beaches. More intimate new properties are springing up on the islands of Alphonse, Cousine and Felicit\u00e9, where Tony and Cherie Blair recently spent a quiet holiday. </p> <p>The Seychelles might well look north-east to the successful eco-tourist policies of the Maldives, whose archipelago is made up of more than 1,000 tiny islands, 100 or so of which are officially designated 'tourist islands'. Another 'new' one is opened up every year in accordance with the Islamic republic's strict development plans. Since 99.66 per cent of the country's area consists of sea, land is the most precious commodity and environmental issues are paramount. </p> <p>On a recent visit, my group was issued with eco-bags to take our rubbish home, and I witnessed the extraordinary sight of bulging garbage sacks whirling round the carousel at Gatwick airport. </p> <p>'Government strategy has kept development to a handful of islands rather than hundreds, and restricted flights so that they can keep up quality and prices,' says Biggs of Kuoni. </p> <p>A quarter of visitors are honeymooners attracted by the desert-island Robinson Crusoe image,but, let's face it, no culture whatsoever. Wannabe Crusoes have it cushy; at the five-star Kurumba, guests dine on sashimi and lobster at candlelit barbecues, while at the glamorous Four Seasons they can snack on French cheese or Chinese porridge. </p> <p>The stage is set this October for the opening of the Soneva Gili resort and spa, which is already promising that it will be the best water villa property in the world. </p> <p>The Caribbean may have been the most glamorous destination of the twentieth century, but in the new millennium, the Indian Ocean is on a roll.</p> <p><strong>Fact file </strong></p> <p><strong>Weather</strong></p> <p><strong>Mauritius:</strong> If you're heading to a resort in Mauritius (such as the Royal Palm, pictured right), there's less rain and humidity from July to September.

Another 'new' one is opened up every year in accordance with the Islamic republic's strict development plans. Since 99.66 per cent of the country's area consists of sea, land is the most precious commodity and environmental issues are paramount. On a recent visit, my group was issued with eco-bags to take our rubbish home, and I witnessed the extraordinary sight of bulging garbage sacks whirling round the carousel at Gatwick airport. 'Government strategy has kept development to a handful of islands rather than hundreds, and restricted flights so that they can keep up quality and prices,' says Biggs of Kuoni. A quarter of visitors are honeymooners attracted by the desert-island Robinson Crusoe image,but, let's face it, no culture whatsoever. Wannabe Crusoes have it cushy; at the five-star Kurumba, guests dine on sashimi and lobster at candlelit barbecues, while at the glamorous Four Seasons they can snack on French cheese or Chinese porridge. The stage is set this October for the opening of the Soneva Gili resort and spa, which is already promising that it will be the best water villa property in the world. The Caribbean may have been the most glamorous destination of the twentieth century, but in the new millennium, the Indian Ocean is on a roll. Fact file Weather Mauritius: If you're heading to a resort in Mauritius (such as the Royal Palm, pictured right), there's less rain and humidity from July to September. The worst time to go is from January to April, when there is the threat of cyclones. Seychelles: The tradewind season, from May to October, is the best time to avoid monsoons. Maldives: Peak season is the dry period, from December to April.

Croft is still behind Ashley Giles in the pecking order, though there's not much in it, and he must recognise that England are highly unlikely to play two spinners with any regularity this summer.

It's a message you might expect the normally imperturbable Ottmar Hitzfeld to hammer home to his players in advance of Bayern Munich's renewing of acquaintances with Manchester United. Revenge is one of sport's most compelling and dangerous emotions, and in a rematch with the protagonists responsible for the kind of pain sado-masochists wouldn't dream of inflicting on themselves, too much of it could have a profound effect on the Germans' performance at Old Trafford. </p> <p>But so bludgeoned were Bayern by having the European Cup snatched so unthinkably from them in the last two minutes of the 1999 Final, even Hitzfeld has succumbed to the powerful pull of retribution. As soon as the draw was made, he growled that the flame had been lit. 'My players,' he said, 'are burning for revenge.' You can bet your last mark it will be raging at the epicentre of every Bayern mind as soon as they clap eyes on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. </p> <p>This is how psyched they are: on the club's official website every story remotely connected with what they call 'the game of all games' is accompanied by an icon of Carsten Jancker's head (chosen because he is the scariest looking by far) adorned with the message 'The Revenge' spelled out in Dracula-style red letters. </p> <p>Stefan Effenberg, a man who lives as if he is constantly about to detonate, naturally has a few choice words: 'Tell them we will knock them out this time. Tell them we will concentrate for 95 minutes this time.' (Maybe someone should explain this may not be enough according to Old Trafford time.) </p> <p>Effenberg cannot forget the feeling of coming out of the doping test some two hours after the finale of finales in the Nou Camp, only to see David Beckham strolling past cradling the European Cup. 'It really hit me,' he said. 'I really felt this should have been our cup and I don't want to experience this pain ever again.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, over in Manchester, Sir Alex Ferguson could afford to be more sanguine. 'Obviously the Bayern game will evoke lots of memories for both sets of supporters, but we have moved on and progressed since that game and I'm sure Bayern are the same. They have that belief of all German teams. They have seven or eight of the players still around from the European Cup Final in Barcelona [it's actually nine: Kahn, Kuffour, Scholl, Jeremies, Fink, Effenberg, Jancker, Salihamidzic, Linke]. The usual suspects are still there. That helps us in terms of familiarity, but we know they are hard to beat and if you give them an inch, they become a hard side to break down, just as in Barcelona.' </p> <p>Ferguson went on to point out that United, themselves, have a blow to get out of their system: 'We're still grappling with the disappointment of last season's quarter-final defeat against Real Madrid. I was disappointed with our tactics in that game and that is down to me. We went for Real's throats in the game at Old Trafford when we should really have been more patient. If we had been, we'd have been all right because we hammered them. We were too gung-ho and we need to be more patient. </p> <p>'You have to move on. It could even have been good in a way because you learn from these things. Our aim on Tuesday night is to win the game without losing a goal. If we do that then we have a major chance. I would have no problem at all with a 1-0 win. That would be great for us. Playing at home first suits us because we have gone away first to places like Monaco and Real Madrid but been knocked out at our place.' Two European institutions colliding, both fuelled with so much impetus, this is one tantalising tie. Hang on to your hats. </p> <p>Usually, around this time of year, the Anyone-But-United brigade are embroiled in colourful debate about whether or not they should be supporting English football's flagbearers. This season, though, such messy moral squabbling has vanished, but because for once there is more than just United creating a stir. </p> <p>The presence of four English heavyweights in the latter stages of Europe has an impact more profound than the individual ambition brewing at Manchester, Leeds, Arsenal and Liverpool. It is, according to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, a significant moment for the English game. United apart, it has been a long, humbling journey back from the exile endured during the five-year Heysel ban. The Arsenal manager believes this journey is coming to an end. Nobody, he says, likes to play against English teams any more. 'It is a sign that English football has made a step forward. It has to be repeated again next season, but at least Manchester United won the Champions League, we were in a final - now Liverpool are in a semi-final, Leeds are in there, we are in the last eight. </p> <p>'I am surprised it took such a long time. When you are not confronted with foreign football you think you are doing all right, and then you are confronted with different football, different thinking. When you play only Premier League clubs and suddenly go into Europe you think, OK, we can play like we play against Southampton and Middlesbrough. Now the players know to be careful, it is a different game, we have to play a different way. That takes time. Since I arrived in '96, English football has changed in a huge manner. We don't realise it because we live in there on a daily basis, but it has changed for the better in every club.' </p> <p>Those changes were difficult to detect in Arsenal when they performed so dismally against Bayern in their last Champions League outing. Wenger is certain there will be no repeat performance against Valencia. 'Honestly, I still can't understand our performance in Munich. The only thing I know is that the Valencia game will be completely different and the players will show that the way they played in our last game was not good enough for Arsenal. Valencia are favourites, we play at home and we know to qualify we need to make sure we don't miss the first game.' Extra incentive comes from the fact old Arsenal heads are still smarting about the heartbreak of losing the Uefa Cup Final on penalties 21 years ago. To Valencia. </p> <p>Scores to settle all round, then.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Chairman Blair's Little Red Book</strong><br>Steve Bell and Brian Homer<br>Methuen \u00a36.99, pp192<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000520090,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>It is possible to illuminate the dark underbelly of the world in which we live in one of two ways. You could a) use the trusty weapons of searing political discourse, an encyclopedic knowledge of philosophy, a close reading of Greek tragedy and deep understanding of the battle between Keynesian economic determinism and the neo-liberalism of Milton Friedman. Or b) tell a few jokes. </p> <p>Option A involves reading lots of lengthy tomes, years of academic study and, let's face it, brains. Option B involves no more research beyond reading a very short book which actually makes you laugh out loud. The book is by Steve Bell, the Guardian cartoonist, and co-author Brian Homer. It is called Chairman Blair's Little Red Book. It's blue. It's that kind of book. </p> <p>On the back is a little explanation for those who never bothered with Option A. For younger readers (or Option B-ers, as I like to call them), the book advises: 'Chairman Mao was the communist leader in revolutionary China. His Little Red Book contained his key ideas and was used by young cadres during the Cultural Revolution. It was red and little.' </p> <p>Bell and Homer continue for older readers: 'Chairman Blair is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. His Little Red Book contains the key ideas for use in campaigning and electioneering. Fittingly, and in accordance with the New Third Way colour thinking, his Little Red Book is blue.' Which, if you didn't simply skip over the first two paragraphs of this review, you know already. </p> <p>The themes of the book are familiar - Blair the control freak, the man who uses no verbs, the Islingtonian who would prefer guacamole over mushy peas - all told as a pastiche of Mao's call to arms. The treatment is a delight, written with a wit all the better because the tone is one of complete seriousness. We have Blair on the fuel crisis ('fat blokes, we feel your pain'), a homage to Blair's humility ('it is no exaggeration to say that he towers above ordinary men but not by too much. It is a modest amount of towering'), and an explanation of Third Way Ethics ('a little bit of this, a little bit of that, not too much of the other'). </p> <p>Throughout are Bell's beautifully conceived illustrations which draw on the images well-known to any Guardian reader. We see Blair as a mad, pop-eyed figure, John Prescott as a muzzled dog, Peter Mandelson as a slippery snake. Everything is shot through with that sharp edge of rank nastiness which is Bell's forte. </p> <p>For those who find even reading 200 very small pages somewhat daunting, there is a very good piece of advice on page 8.

      "bodyText": "Chairman Blair's Little Red Book Steve Bell and Brian Homer Methuen \u00a36.99, pp192 Buy it at a discount at BOL It is possible to illuminate the dark underbelly of the world in which we live in one of two ways. You could a) use the trusty weapons of searing political discourse, an encyclopedic knowledge of philosophy, a close reading of Greek tragedy and deep understanding of the battle between Keynesian economic determinism and the neo-liberalism of Milton Friedman. Or b) tell a few jokes. Option A involves reading lots of lengthy tomes, years of academic study and, let's face it, brains. Option B involves no more research beyond reading a very short book which actually makes you laugh out loud. The book is by Steve Bell, the Guardian cartoonist, and co-author Brian Homer. It is called Chairman Blair's Little Red Book. It's blue. It's that kind of book. On the back is a little explanation for those who never bothered with Option A. For younger readers (or Option B-ers, as I like to call them), the book advises: 'Chairman Mao was the communist leader in revolutionary China. His Little Red Book contained his key ideas and was used by young cadres during the Cultural Revolution. It was red and little.' Bell and Homer continue for older readers: 'Chairman Blair is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. His Little Red Book contains the key ideas for use in campaigning and electioneering. Fittingly, and in accordance with the New Third Way colour thinking, his Little Red Book is blue.' Which, if you didn't simply skip over the first two paragraphs of this review, you know already. The themes of the book are familiar - Blair the control freak, the man who uses no verbs, the Islingtonian who would prefer guacamole over mushy peas - all told as a pastiche of Mao's call to arms. The treatment is a delight, written with a wit all the better because the tone is one of complete seriousness. We have Blair on the fuel crisis ('fat blokes, we feel your pain'), a homage to Blair's humility ('it is no exaggeration to say that he towers above ordinary men but not by too much. It is a modest amount of towering'), and an explanation of Third Way Ethics ('a little bit of this, a little bit of that, not too much of the other'). Throughout are Bell's beautifully conceived illustrations which draw on the images well-known to any Guardian reader. We see Blair as a mad, pop-eyed figure, John Prescott as a muzzled dog, Peter Mandelson as a slippery snake. Everything is shot through with that sharp edge of rank nastiness which is Bell's forte. For those who find even reading 200 very small pages somewhat daunting, there is a very good piece of advice on page 8. 'Chairman Blair's Little Red Book is a guide for new practice. You will find that this book is most effective when waved rather than read.' What a relief for all Option B-ers.

      "body": "<p>When George Bush was Governor of Texas, he called upon the big oil companies, such as Exxon-Mobil, to draw up a draft for the state's Clean Air Act. They came up with a Bill allowing them to regulate themselves. Just as Bush was signing it into law, in December 1988, the town of Odessa - a few miles from his birthplace - was engulfed by a black, toxic smoke so thick that drivers had to use their headlights during daytime. </p> <p>The President they call 'the Toxic Texan' took office on a platform pledging to turn his gubernatorial principles into national policy - to make America a 'greater Texas'. And last week Bush began his attempt to make the world environment that of a 'greater America'. He 'declared war on the environment' - in the words of Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer, both at home and on the international stage. </p> <p>Defying his European allies and many Third World countries, Bush in effect killed off the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 - by which more than 100 nations undertook to reduce emissions of 'greenhouse gases' that cause global warming - turning the US, for environmentalists, into a greedy, polluting pariah. On the domestic front, meanwhile, a series of brazen measures has provoked an outcry from even the most moderate and established of environmental groups. </p> <p>Withdrawal by the US from Kyoto tolls a death knell for the treaty, because although it accounts for only 4 per cent of the world's population, it is responsible for 25 per cent of the emissions of gases that cause the greenhouse effect. Half of America's industrial might still burns fossil fuels and belches out fumes, while Americans themselves drive heavy trucks and cars further than any other people - to the mall and across the infinite landscape - and even the average household boasts 2.8 television sets and a wealth of electrical appliances. </p> <p>The story behind the singular determination of Bush to fly in the face of world opinion, the sentiments of most Americans and even many in his own government reveals adherence to ideological rigour and a payment of debts to the business interests that helped him to the White House - above all, oil and coal. Oil runs through every sinew and vein of the Bush administration; rarely, if ever, has a Western government been so intimately entwined with a single industry. When Bush assumed office, however, oil and other energy industries were in the political cold after eight years of Bill Clinton's environmental record. Prompted by his keenly environmentalist deputy, Al Gore, Clinton had cautiously recommended ratification of Kyoto, but it was flatly rejected in the Senate. </p> <p>Clinton nevertheless put more wilderness under federal protection than any President since Franklin Roosevelt and decreed a sweeping series of anti-pollution, clean air and clean water measures, facing down formidable constituencies such as the timber industry, sugar barons, big utility and automotive lobbies - and, above all, Big Oil and King Coal. </p> <p>Determined backing for Bush was thereby assured from these quarters. According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, $10 million out of $14m in political contributions from oil and gas companies to the last election went to Republican candidates. The Bush family has roots in the oil business, and the President began his own career with a series of unsuccessful drilling ventures bailed out by bigger oil com panies. He was backed by most of the big names in oil, especially Texaco and Exxon-Mobil, in his campaigns for Governor and later President. Bush has now charged his Vice-President Dick Cheney - the pivotal power in the White House - to compile an overall energy policy document due for publication before the completion of his first 100 days in office. Cheney's connections to big oil have been close-knit and especially lucrative. </p> <p>The Pentagon chief under Bush senior, Cheney used connections forged by the Gulf war to open up valuable business for the giant Halliburton Company, of which he was made chief executive in 1995, and which does 70 per cent of its $15 billion sales to Arab governments. Bush's Commerce Secretary, Don Evans, is a long-time personal friend from the President's home town of Midland, Texas, and a man raised in oil. His father was a manager for Shell and he is chairman and chief executive of the Midland-based Tom Brown oil company which, before the Eighties crash, was worth $2bn - equivalent to the Ford Corporation. </p> <p>Among the less well known oil connections are those of America's ambassador to London, Doug Farish, who went into politics as an aide to Bush senior in 1964 and is described by former First Lady Barbara Bush as 'one of the family'. </p> <p>Despite his reclusive image as a rancher who sold horses to the Queen, Farish is a Texas oil magnate from a Texas oil family. His grandfather founded the Humble Oil and Refining Company, part of what is now Exxon, and later became president of Standard Oil. Farish's own dealings in the oil state have not only been in liquid gold but also gas exploration and mining. Bush's break with world opinion on Kyoto was debated and contested within the administration, with Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Treasury reportedly eager to leave a door open to join Britain and other nations in a commitment to reduce 'greenhouse gas' emissions. </p> <p>But even in the State Department, big oil has its man moulding policy: Middle East guru Richard Haas who, with Powell and Cheney, has an aversion to unilateral sanctions that hurt business. </p> <p>Haas hails from the Brookings think-tank, and has propelled America's preparedness to consider easing sanctions on Iraq with a document entitled 'Iraq: A Modified Approach', written by Meghan O'Sullivan, a researcher who worked under Haas at Brookings. The paper argues that embargoes are 'bad for particular businesses' - principally oil - and it emerges that much of Haas's project was funded by Conoco and Arco, with whom he has worked as a consultant. He also has a seat on the board of oil firm, Santa Fe International. With these and other connections in place, big oil was quick to move once Bush was inaugurated. The National Petrochemical Refiners Association lobbied first, for a rollback of clean-air standards for buses and big trucks decreed by Clinton. </p> <p> The association's counsel, Bob Slaughter, said he hoped 'the administration would be more interested in balancing the energy supply and environmental concerns' - and it was: Bush put a moratorium on this and all similar decrees, citing a fear of fuel price rises. Bush had promised to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide, but two weeks ago he reversed this, citing a report commissioned last year by Republican Senator David McIntosh, saying that carbon dioxide restrictions could 'boost electricity prices and hurt coal-fired utilities'. Shortly before the announcement, Washington was blitzed by the 'Coal Based Generators' group to lobby for a reversal on emissions and tax breaks for 'clean coal' utilities. </p> <p>Leading the group was Irl Engelhardt, chairman of Peabody, America's largest coal enterprise, who was also a major Republican contributor and energy adviser to the Bush-Cheney transition team. The same letter that disclosed the volte-face on carbon dioxide also announced the scrapping of new Clinton regulations reducing arsenic levels in drinking water by 80 per cent. The EPA's former administrator for water, Chuck Fox, who drafted the legislation, said: 'This action will jeopardise the health of millions of Americans.' And its backer in Congress, Henry Waxman, called the ruling 'another example of payback to industries that gave millions of dollars in campaign contributions'. </p> <p> Fear of continuing fuel price rises and shrinking supply then dictated the White House's reaction to the energy crisis in California - ironically caused, said the Democrats, by the very deregulation policies favoured by the administration on a national scale. Bush's language - and his catchphrase that 'national security depends on energy security' - turned the crisis into a national emergency which dovetailed into the arguments that tranches of federal land protected by Clinton - including the vast and virgin Arctic wilderness in Alaska - should be opened up for prospecting and drilling. </p> <p>These announcements - as well as Kyoto - have stirred even the most mainstream groups to exasperation, with the executive director of the Sierra Club - equivalent to the National Trust - predicting 'a very major fight'. Two entwined schools of thought form the core of the Bush administration: deregulation and decentralisation. The underpinning ideology is the injection of market forces into management of the public domain, and the belief that industry should police itself. Supporters of last week's decision include David Victor, fellow of science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Victor argues that Kyoto cannot work, nor can unrealistic regulations on emissions reduction. </p> <p> Instead he argues for 'economic incentives that, over time, will slow the build-up of carbon dioxide without the imposition of binding targets for a far-off future'. This ideology is embodied by John Graham, whom Bush picked last weekend to head his Office of Management and Budget - which oversees all regulatory agencies - an appointment which thrilled lobbyists. Graham, regarded as the guru of cost benefit analysis, has a history of eco-scepticism. </p> <p>Last week's decision to kill Kyoto did not enjoy full backing of the administration - some quarters of which saw it as a fait accompli from the White House and the National Security Council. Successive opinion polls show that the environment is a major issue for voters, and Bush's enemies are lining up for a PR battle. Even Republican Representative Sherwood Boehlert believes Bush is 'taking a risk' by issuing 'so many controversial decisions so early'. Mark Mellman, a Democrat pollster, said: 'Bush is creating a political disaster for himself.'</p>",

Oil runs through every sinew and vein of the Bush administration; rarely, if ever, has a Western government been so intimately entwined with a single industry. When Bush assumed office, however, oil and other energy industries were in the political cold after eight years of Bill Clinton's environmental record. Prompted by his keenly environmentalist deputy, Al Gore, Clinton had cautiously recommended ratification of Kyoto, but it was flatly rejected in the Senate. Clinton nevertheless put more wilderness under federal protection than any President since Franklin Roosevelt and decreed a sweeping series of anti-pollution, clean air and clean water measures, facing down formidable constituencies such as the timber industry, sugar barons, big utility and automotive lobbies - and, above all, Big Oil and King Coal. Determined backing for Bush was thereby assured from these quarters. According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, $10 million out of $14m in political contributions from oil and gas companies to the last election went to Republican candidates. The Bush family has roots in the oil business, and the President began his own career with a series of unsuccessful drilling ventures bailed out by bigger oil com panies. He was backed by most of the big names in oil, especially Texaco and Exxon-Mobil, in his campaigns for Governor and later President. Bush has now charged his Vice-President Dick Cheney - the pivotal power in the White House - to compile an overall energy policy document due for publication before the completion of his first 100 days in office. Cheney's connections to big oil have been close-knit and especially lucrative. The Pentagon chief under Bush senior, Cheney used connections forged by the Gulf war to open up valuable business for the giant Halliburton Company, of which he was made chief executive in 1995, and which does 70 per cent of its $15 billion sales to Arab governments. Bush's Commerce Secretary, Don Evans, is a long-time personal friend from the President's home town of Midland, Texas, and a man raised in oil. His father was a manager for Shell and he is chairman and chief executive of the Midland-based Tom Brown oil company which, before the Eighties crash, was worth $2bn - equivalent to the Ford Corporation. Among the less well known oil connections are those of America's ambassador to London, Doug Farish, who went into politics as an aide to Bush senior in 1964 and is described by former First Lady Barbara Bush as 'one of the family'. Despite his reclusive image as a rancher who sold horses to the Queen, Farish is a Texas oil magnate from a Texas oil family. His grandfather founded the Humble Oil and Refining Company, part of what is now Exxon, and later became president of Standard Oil. Farish's own dealings in the oil state have not only been in liquid gold but also gas exploration and mining. Bush's break with world opinion on Kyoto was debated and contested within the administration, with Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Treasury reportedly eager to leave a door open to join Britain and other nations in a commitment to reduce 'greenhouse gas' emissions. But even in the State Department, big oil has its man moulding policy: Middle East guru Richard Haas who, with Powell and Cheney, has an aversion to unilateral sanctions that hurt business. Haas hails from the Brookings think-tank, and has propelled America's preparedness to consider easing sanctions on Iraq with a document entitled 'Iraq: A Modified Approach', written by Meghan O'Sullivan, a researcher who worked under Haas at Brookings. The paper argues that embargoes are 'bad for particular businesses' - principally oil - and it emerges that much of Haas's project was funded by Conoco and Arco, with whom he has worked as a consultant. He also has a seat on the board of oil firm, Santa Fe International. With these and other connections in place, big oil was quick to move once Bush was inaugurated. The National Petrochemical Refiners Association lobbied first, for a rollback of clean-air standards for buses and big trucks decreed by Clinton. The association's counsel, Bob Slaughter, said he hoped 'the administration would be more interested in balancing the energy supply and environmental concerns' - and it was: Bush put a moratorium on this and all similar decrees, citing a fear of fuel price rises. Bush had promised to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide, but two weeks ago he reversed this, citing a report commissioned last year by Republican Senator David McIntosh, saying that carbon dioxide restrictions could 'boost electricity prices and hurt coal-fired utilities'. Shortly before the announcement, Washington was blitzed by the 'Coal Based Generators' group to lobby for a reversal on emissions and tax breaks for 'clean coal' utilities. Leading the group was Irl Engelhardt, chairman of Peabody, America's largest coal enterprise, who was also a major Republican contributor and energy adviser to the Bush-Cheney transition team. The same letter that disclosed the volte-face on carbon dioxide also announced the scrapping of new Clinton regulations reducing arsenic levels in drinking water by 80 per cent. The EPA's former administrator for water, Chuck Fox, who drafted the legislation, said: 'This action will jeopardise the health of millions of Americans.' And its backer in Congress, Henry Waxman, called the ruling 'another example of payback to industries that gave millions of dollars in campaign contributions'. Fear of continuing fuel price rises and shrinking supply then dictated the White House's reaction to the energy crisis in California - ironically caused, said the Democrats, by the very deregulation policies favoured by the administration on a national scale. Bush's language - and his catchphrase that 'national security depends on energy security' - turned the crisis into a national emergency which dovetailed into the arguments that tranches of federal land protected by Clinton - including the vast and virgin Arctic wilderness in Alaska - should be opened up for prospecting and drilling. These announcements - as well as Kyoto - have stirred even the most mainstream groups to exasperation, with the executive director of the Sierra Club - equivalent to the National Trust - predicting 'a very major fight'. Two entwined schools of thought form the core of the Bush administration: deregulation and decentralisation. The underpinning ideology is the injection of market forces into management of the public domain, and the belief that industry should police itself. Supporters of last week's decision include David Victor, fellow of science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Victor argues that Kyoto cannot work, nor can unrealistic regulations on emissions reduction. Instead he argues for 'economic incentives that, over time, will slow the build-up of carbon dioxide without the imposition of binding targets for a far-off future'. This ideology is embodied by John Graham, whom Bush picked last weekend to head his Office of Management and Budget - which oversees all regulatory agencies - an appointment which thrilled lobbyists. Graham, regarded as the guru of cost benefit analysis, has a history of eco-scepticism. Last week's decision to kill Kyoto did not enjoy full backing of the administration - some quarters of which saw it as a fait accompli from the White House and the National Security Council. Successive opinion polls show that the environment is a major issue for voters, and Bush's enemies are lining up for a PR battle. Even Republican Representative Sherwood Boehlert believes Bush is 'taking a risk' by issuing 'so many controversial decisions so early'. Mark Mellman, a Democrat pollster, said: 'Bush is creating a political disaster for himself.'",

As far as he was concerned, unless things improved dramatically, the General Election meticulously planned for two years by the legions of Labour apparatchiks for 3 May was off. <br></p> <p>'I think he had pretty much made up his mind then,' one of Blair's inner circle told The Observer yesterday. 'Of course there is no final decision until tomorrow, or maybe even Monday. But in his mind, I think he's known for a while. He feels he wants at least another week sorting out foot and mouth. That is all he has been concentrating on and that means he hasn't been able to focus on the politics of a campaign. At the moment he can't do both.'<br></p> <p>Blair had many helpers on his way to deciding the election date: pages and pages of focus group work from his personal pollster, Philip Gould; the latest soundings from his party, courtesy of the whips office; bulletins on the funeral pyres of cattle around the country, courtesy of Maff. And a bloke with a watch.<br></p> <p>Every day for the past three weeks one of Labour's key strategists has been scrutinising the major news bulletins on the BBC to see how much time they devote to foot and mouth. Every few days he tells Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, how it's 'playing in the media'. The news has not been good.<br></p> <p>'The imagery is all wrong,' the adviser told Campbell last week. Charred cattle, legs sticking up in different directions as the flames lick their hides. Thousands of sheep being dumped into trenches. It is leading the news, 10, 11, 12 minutes every day on every BBC news programme. 'The question is, can you call an election in such an environment?' said the adviser, one of Labour's most trusted and longest-serving experts.<br></p> <p>Campbell admitted he was now not so sure that 3 May was a viable option. Five days earlier he had told a Labour backbench MP and close colleague that the situation was 'a shambles'.<br></p> <p>One Labour official complained: 'We have lurched from one position to another - go for May, go for June. It has not been easy, but now I think it is clear what will happen.'<br></p> <p>This weekend Blair is at Chequers. After breakfast he will contact his most trusted lieutenants. Campbell will be called, and the 'press brief' put together by the Downing Street communications unit the night before will be gone through. <br></p> <p>What have the Sunday papers been saying? What is the polling evidence saying? Blair will then speak to Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff, and Gordon Brown, the Chancellor. Sally Morgan, his political secretary, and Anji Hunter, his diary secretary, will also be contacted for a final sounding. <br></p> <p>And all the time he will be inching towards the decision that first entered his mind during that brief visit to Cumbria: Delay, delay, delay. <br></p> <p>Later in the morning the Downing Street switchboard will contact Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, who will be put through to Blair's study. Brown will already have been briefed on that day's figures of foot and mouth cases by the Maff veterinary service. Blair will ask for a bullet-point summary of what is going on. Is the number of cases going up? Is the rate of increase levelling out? Has anything happened that is significant enough to change my mind? No, Prime Minister. <br></p> <p>Blair will think of the advice he has received from the 'cautious wing', as they are now known in Millbank: Gould, whose focus group work revealed negative responses from a public who think the Government should be concentrating on the countryside rather than an election; Peter Mandelson, who urged his close friend to show a 'degree of caution' over the election date and plan for a short pause; Lord Falconer, who agreed with Mandelson. <br></p> <p>Brown was always more 'go' than 'stop', but he can see that, as long as an autumn date is kept well off the agenda, there is little likelihood of either the polls or the economic figures lurching away from the Government before an election in June. <br></p> <p>Campbell started off as 'the man that wouldn't blink' - but even he realised that the election couldn't go ahead. <br></p> <p>'The major argument against delay was that tourism would be affected,' said a Downing Street source. 'But the fact is it has already been affected, to a quite ridiculous extent. The Prime Minister basically ran out of time. Another week before a decision had to be made and it would be a different picture, but we have to move on Monday.' <br></p> <p>There have been two flies in the ointment. John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, is still pressing for May but is increasingly a voice in the wilderness. As the mood music around Blair has starting sending out the message 'June', so members of the Cabinet have started falling in line. <br></p> <p>The other factor is the party, which still wants a May election. But Blair has always prided himself on being more than a party man. He did go as far as asking Ann Taylor, the chief whip, to canvass Labour MPs to get their views. The whips office said that the majority were still for May but there were significant changes. Rural MPs were showing more signs of nerves. <br></p> <p>'What people don't understand is that fighting elections is what parties are for ,' another senior Labour MP said. 'If we don't go now, what are we going to do for the next month? There's nothing in the diary.' <br></p> <p>Millbank officials were so concerned that the appeal for a delay from the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Liverpool would knock them off course, they started ringing heads of tourism authorities around the country to try and get them to speak to journalists and say that Blair should get on with the election. <br></p> <p>It was the last kick of a dying animal. Last week was the most carefully choreographed pre-election campaign week ever. The leaking of John Townend's comments on the 'Anglo-Saxon' nature of Britain being ruined by immigrants from the 'New Commonwealth' came after carefully planted stories on Conservative plans for an anti-asylum seekers party political broadcast and the defection of Ceri Evans, a key aide to William Hague, from the Tories to Labour. But Blair's mind is not for changing. <br></p> <p>'We could go for an election now, and win,' said a Downing Street source who has been close to the negotiations which have continued in Downing Street all week. 'But the image of the Prime Minister as a unifying figure would have been lost.' <br></p> <p>Last Wednesday morning in the first-floor board room at Labour's headquarters at Millbank, Blair arrived on time at 10am. The National Executive Committee, the decision-making body of the party, was about to meet, and the Prime Minister had just over an hour before he had to get back to Downing Street for yet another meeting with farming leaders. <br></p> <p>Around the table were Margaret McDonagh, the party's general secretary, Gordon Brown and Prescott. Blair started with a 10-minute preamble about the foot and mouth epidemic. Prescott spoke about the mess facing the Tube. Brown talked about the election campaign and how Labour's policies would be sold to the voters. McDonagh spoke about election planning. The 20 or so members of the committee then asked questions - about the performance of the economy, about the Underground, about attacks on the Conservatives. And each question had a rider. What, Tony, do you think about the date of the election? <br></p> <p>Blair pulled an agonised face. 'We have to be seen to be in control,' he said. 'We have to be sensitive to the problems that people are facing. We have to be on the path to eradicating it.' The message was clear. 'Tony Blair obviously had more reservations than most people in that room about the date of election,' said one of the people at the meeting. 'We all got the feeling then that he was for delay.' <br></p> <p>Millbank officials still desperately point to the factors in favour of May. When 'Mystic Greg' Cook, the Labour Party's chief pollster, made the short trip from his Millbank offices to the Commons on Wednesday night to give a crucial briefing to MPs, he was able to soothe troubled brows. The poll lead was solid at around 19 points. And when the Times poll on Thursday still showed Labour with a lead of 20 points, many in Millbank breathed a sigh of relief and thought it would be the green light for May. <br></p> <p>William Hague's diary has been cleared so that he can be back behind his desk in London early tomorrow morning, just in case an election is called. But Hague's closest advisers now don't think the election will be called this week.

The election must be in June, say York, Canterbury, Hereford and Carlisle, while Durham and Oxford plump for May. Quite why the timing is suddenly part of the ecclesiastical calendar is uncertain. Just as politicians would not presume to fix the date of the Church of England Synod meeting or the Nether Wallop parochial church-hall bring-and-buy sale, church leaders should have no leverage on when the country goes to the polls. Still, you have to admire their opportunism. </p> <p>Tony Blair had barely finished his speech to the Christian Socialist Movement, in which he advocated power and influence for faith-based groups, before the bishops, their flocks decimated by forces more pernicious than foot and mouth, invoked this proffered clout.

      "bodyText": "Like plotting Shakespearean dukes, the Anglican bishops ponder the affairs of the realm. The election must be in June, say York, Canterbury, Hereford and Carlisle, while Durham and Oxford plump for May. Quite why the timing is suddenly part of the ecclesiastical calendar is uncertain. Just as politicians would not presume to fix the date of the Church of England Synod meeting or the Nether Wallop parochial church-hall bring-and-buy sale, church leaders should have no leverage on when the country goes to the polls. Still, you have to admire their opportunism. Tony Blair had barely finished his speech to the Christian Socialist Movement, in which he advocated power and influence for faith-based groups, before the bishops, their flocks decimated by forces more pernicious than foot and mouth, invoked this proffered clout.

With rising unemployment, youths are using and dealing drugs as a way of getting by. 'Where there is no hope,' the saying goes, 'there's always dope.' </p> <p>The picture painted in Human Traffic, a bleakly comic movie about five Cardiff friends who live for their drug-fuelled weekends, isn't so far from reality. In the South Wales police area, the number of people prosecuted for trafficking in heroin has risen 63 per cent in the past year. Across the county of Rhondda Cynon Taff, at least 12 addicts overdose each week, according to the latest figures. </p> <p>In North Wales, drug sales became so blatant that last month the force launched Operation Decade, its biggest-ever crackdown, which led to 30 arrests in a few hours. In Dyfed-Powys, more dealers are arrested per 100 police officers than anywhere else in the country, while in Gwent a three-man gang will be sentenced next week for possession of a kilo of heroin - the force's largest single haul. </p> <p>Further along the coast in Llanelli, the number of heroin seizures has for the first time overtaken the number of seizures of amphetamine. While cannabis remains the most widely used drug in the area, heroin now accounts for 10 per cent of seizures. Drug- trafficking offences have shot up by 70 per cent in a year. </p> <p>With law enforcement split between four different forces, each of which uses different methods to compile statistics, accurate figures covering the whole of the country are virtually impossible to come by. </p> <p>Across Wales it is believed that drug-related deaths are occurring at an average rate of one a week. While crimes such as car theft and burglary are down across the board, they have rocketed in the areas where drug use is highest. An increasing number of addicts, some as young as 13 or 14, are selling their bodies to pay for their habits. </p> <p>For those living in smaller towns, such as Aberdare, where heroin use has traditionally been frowned on - last year a suspected dealer was firebombed out of his home on the Fernhill estate - the change has been shocking. </p> <p>One former miner who declined to be named told The Observer: 'When the mines were open, things were very different. There was full employment and everyone was pulling together as one. If one of the young lads did something - broke into a house, stole a car or gave an old lady some cheek - we'd soon find out who did it and give them hell. Now the mines are gone, the sense of community's gone. People only look out for themselves. These days if you've got a job you're virtually a celebrity.' </p> <p>This week South Wales police will release the results of new toxicology reports that are expected to link a number of recent deaths to the heroin epidemic. 'We need to gauge the size of the problem so we can tackle it most effectively,' says Detective Chief Superintendent Wynn Philips. 'We need education to reduce demand for heroin and look to the community to assist us. The drug is tolerated far more than it used to be.' </p> <p>South Wales police are also looking to alter a policy they believe could be contributing to the number of deaths. At present, many addicts are reluctant to report overdoses because they know the police will attend the scene. </p> <p>According to Roger Duncan of the Swansea Drug Project, there are a number of factors behind the sudden rise, including a crackdown on the use of amphetamine which, curiously, led many users to switch to heroin. Users of Ecstasy, which has always been disproportionately popular in Wales, are turning to heroin to help them 'come down' after a night of clubbing. </p> <p>'In the last quarter we've had 86 people coming to see us with problems linked to heroin use. A couple of years ago, that number would have been just two or three. Five years ago, heroin was almost unobtainable in Swansea.

      "body": "<p>The number of prospective first-time home-buyers is at an all-time high, despite high property prices and the threat of recession, according to one of Britain's biggest lenders. </p> <p>Miles Bingham, head of mortgage marketing at Abbey National, says the amount borrowed by first-time buyers has risen from about 20 per cent of the bank's new lending last autumn to 30 per cent now. 'First-time buyers were getting squeezed out of the market,' he says. 'But now house prices have come off the boil a bit and interest rates have come down, there is more confidence that mortgage rates will be affordable.' </p> <p>First-time buyers generally drive the property market. Without them, homeowners at the bottom of the market cannot sell up and move on to better homes. However, Bingham says first timers are now saving bigger deposits and buying better types of property: 'They're trying to miss out on the one-bedroom flats and the properties that combine kitchen and living areas. The average first-time property price is \u00a360,000, but in London and the South East this is more likely to be \u00a3125,000.' </p> <p>But even if you save up a sizeable deposit, the costs of buying your first home are likely to be high, says Johannes Kennard of Bath mortgage broker London &amp; Country. If your first home costs \u00a360,000, and you are borrowing 95 per cent, you can expect to face upfront costs of about \u00a35,000 (including the deposit). You will need to save for: </p> <p>\u0095 A minimum 5 per cent deposit; </p> <p>\u0095 Stamp duty - 1 per cent on properties worth \u00a360,001 to \u00a3250,000, 3 per cent on properties worth \u00a3250,001 to \u00a3500,000, and 4 per cent on properties over \u00a3500,001; </p> <p>\u0095 Land registry fees, ranging from \u00a340 to \u00a3800 depeding on the property. You'd pay \u00a370 for a \u00a360,000 flat; </p> <p>\u0095 Local searches - about \u00a3165; </p> <p>\u0095 Solicitors' fees of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400; </p> <p>\u0095 A survey. If you opt for the simple valuation required by your lender, this will cost about \u00a3200 on a \u00a3100,000 property. If you want information about the condition of the property, you may prefer to pay about \u00a3300 for a homebuyer's report, and if you are worried about the structure in any way, you should probably go for a building survey, costing about \u00a3600. </p> <p>You may also need to prepare for: </p> <p>\u0095 An application or administration fee on your mortgage, typically about \u00a3300; </p> <p>\u0095 Life insurance premiums. If you have dependants, you will need to buy cover to ensure the mortgage is paid off if you die. </p> <p>\u0095 Mortgage payment protection insurance. This optional insurance covers the cost of your mortgage (usually for a year) if you are unable to work through illness or redundancy, and costs about \u00a35 a month for every \u00a3100 of your monthly mortgage payment. So if you pay \u00a3500 on your mortgage, MPPI would cost you about \u00a325 a month; </p> <p>\u0095 Mortgage indemnity guarantee.

      "bodyText": "The number of prospective first-time home-buyers is at an all-time high, despite high property prices and the threat of recession, according to one of Britain's biggest lenders. Miles Bingham, head of mortgage marketing at Abbey National, says the amount borrowed by first-time buyers has risen from about 20 per cent of the bank's new lending last autumn to 30 per cent now. 'First-time buyers were getting squeezed out of the market,' he says. 'But now house prices have come off the boil a bit and interest rates have come down, there is more confidence that mortgage rates will be affordable.' First-time buyers generally drive the property market. Without them, homeowners at the bottom of the market cannot sell up and move on to better homes. However, Bingham says first timers are now saving bigger deposits and buying better types of property: 'They're trying to miss out on the one-bedroom flats and the properties that combine kitchen and living areas. The average first-time property price is \u00a360,000, but in London and the South East this is more likely to be \u00a3125,000.' But even if you save up a sizeable deposit, the costs of buying your first home are likely to be high, says Johannes Kennard of Bath mortgage broker London &amp; Country. If your first home costs \u00a360,000, and you are borrowing 95 per cent, you can expect to face upfront costs of about \u00a35,000 (including the deposit). You will need to save for: \u0095 A minimum 5 per cent deposit; \u0095 Stamp duty - 1 per cent on properties worth \u00a360,001 to \u00a3250,000, 3 per cent on properties worth \u00a3250,001 to \u00a3500,000, and 4 per cent on properties over \u00a3500,001; \u0095 Land registry fees, ranging from \u00a340 to \u00a3800 depeding on the property. You'd pay \u00a370 for a \u00a360,000 flat; \u0095 Local searches - about \u00a3165; \u0095 Solicitors' fees of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400; \u0095 A survey. If you opt for the simple valuation required by your lender, this will cost about \u00a3200 on a \u00a3100,000 property. If you want information about the condition of the property, you may prefer to pay about \u00a3300 for a homebuyer's report, and if you are worried about the structure in any way, you should probably go for a building survey, costing about \u00a3600. You may also need to prepare for: \u0095 An application or administration fee on your mortgage, typically about \u00a3300; \u0095 Life insurance premiums. If you have dependants, you will need to buy cover to ensure the mortgage is paid off if you die. \u0095 Mortgage payment protection insurance. This optional insurance covers the cost of your mortgage (usually for a year) if you are unable to work through illness or redundancy, and costs about \u00a35 a month for every \u00a3100 of your monthly mortgage payment. So if you pay \u00a3500 on your mortgage, MPPI would cost you about \u00a325 a month; \u0095 Mortgage indemnity guarantee. This is very expensive insurance that protects the lender if it is forced to repossess your home and sell it for less than the value of the mortgage. Costs vary, but typically you will pay about 8 per cent of the amount you borrow above 75 per cent of the property's value. So if you are buying a home worth \u00a3100,000, and you need to borrow \u00a395,000, you will have to pay \u00a31,600 for the MIG (8 per cent of \u00a320,000). Most lenders usually apply MIGs on mortgages where you need to borrow at least 90 per cent of the property's value, so the best way to avoid the extra cost is to save a 10 per cent deposit. Some lenders, such as Britannia and the Woolwich, offer special first-time buyers' loans that do not require MIGs. The Woolwich, for example, is offering a first-time version of its flexible Open Plan mortgage, discounted by 1.76 per cent for three years (producing a current variable interest rate of 5.74 per cent). You can borrow up to 95 per cent of your property's value without paying any MIG. The Britannia's first-timers' loan is fixed at 6.09 per cent for three years, offers a free valuation and \u00a3250 in Kingfisher vouchers that can be used at Woolworths, B&amp;Q and Comet. If money is particularly tight, look out for mortgages that include free valuations or help towards legal fees. Abbey National offers a 'Buying your first home' service, which includes help in finding a solicitor, and weekly updates on progress, budget planners, checklists and money-saving incentives such as discounts on van rental and electrical goods. Kennard recommends that you choose a fixed-rate mortgage (his recommendations can be found in the table). You may not find rates as low as those available on discounted mortgages, but he points out that neither will you face any unaffordable hikes in your mortgage payments during the period of the fix. Kennard adds: 'Make sure you avoid loans that have redemption penalties which extend beyond the end of the fixed period. That way you can remortgage to another fixed or discounted rate as soon as your first fix comes to an end.'",

      "bodyText": "They were supposed to change the male-dominated world of politics for ever, but the so-called Blair Babes have had a battle on their hands even to survive, fighting against blatant sexism - and towering male egos - to succeed. In interviews for a new report, female parliamentarians have attacked a macho culture in the Commons, accusing male colleagues of acting like 'prima donnas' and getting their 'egos massaged' by public displays of rebellion against the Government. At least two complained of sexual harassment in Westminster, such as name calling and obscene gestures, while others said they feared promoting feminist causes could damage their careers. The research conducted by politics lecturer Dr Sarah Childs concludes that, despite such obstacles, the female parliamentary intake of 1997 has quietly made a major difference to the Commons and to women voters' lives. It cites policies from crackdowns on domestic violence to better childcare and action against forced marriages as ex-amples of female MPs' success, arguing that many of their most notable successes - such as watering down the Asylum Bill - may never have been made public. But Childs, whose paper will be presented to the Political Studies Association conference in London later this month, said she emerged with sympathy for the MPs. 'I was told they would be these terrible plastic politicians, but I didn't think they were that kind of Identikit, shoulder-padded, made-over women at all,' she said. 'A lot of them were women who perhaps were first-generation higher educated, and who were passionate about things like poverty and social exclusion. 'They felt that they were set up to fail, that they were expected to come in and make massive changes overnight, which was completely unrealistic, and that that has been hung around their necks. 'They feel it was about misogyny in the press, and that they couldn't win - if you do something, you are just acting like a woman and not looking after anyone else: if you don't make a change, that's because you are pathetic.' Childs interviewed more than half of the 65 Labour women first entering Parliament in 1997, repeating most of her interviews in 2000. The strongest response came from repeated public criticism that the new women MPs were too scared to rebel against the Government in votes as men did. One said the difference with men was that 'we are not prima donnas' while a second added: 'We are committed to doing politics differently, not to trashing people, not to rubbishing people in public.' Others said the 'macho' thrill of voting against the Government might be less likely to succeed than quietly buttonholing Ministers to alter legislation.

      "body": "<p> It was a bitterly cold night as Kelly Mills and her boyfriend Ashley walked past the rundown Bestowed Estate near Nottingham. The couple moved briskly to keep warm and looked forward to getting home for a hot drink and dinner after Kelly's anti-natal appointment. </p> <p>As they passed a block of flats, they noticed a young girl slumped against a wall, holding a baby. The infant was naked apart from the adult-sized fleece she had been wrapped in. It offered little protection from the cold and biting wind. </p> <p>The couple had reached the end of the road before Mills stopped to turn around. The teenager had got up and appeared to be having trouble walking as she made her way to the railway track on the edge of the sprawling estate. </p> <p>Mills knew that something was wrong. She feared that the girl might be planning to throw the baby on the railway track. 'My instincts told me I had to do something. So we followed her. Eventually she went up an alleyway and when she thought we'd gone she turned back on to the main road. She sat on a fence and bent over to kiss the baby's head. The she looked down at a doorway and realised the lights were on, kissed the baby again and ran down the drive and put the baby on the doorstep. </p> <p>As she turned back she hesitated but then she disappeared off down the alleyway. I ran across the road to the baby and I could see there was nothing on it. I just picked him up and started crying, because he had nothing on and his cord was still attached. I banged on the door and the lady said if you hadn't knocked on the door we wouldn't have opened up until morning because we'd locked up ready to go to bed.' </p> <p>The baby was taken to City Hospital in Nottingham, where staff gave him the name Nicholas Christmas. He weighed 7lb 3oz and was said to be less than two hours old. Apart from being cold, he was in remarkably good health. </p> <p>Only at that point did Nicholas officially exist on paper. He had just joined a small but growing number of babies - known as foundlings - who are abandoned every year on the streets of England and Wales. More than 50 babies are dumped and the figure is rising. Often the only clue is a note pinned to a shawl, saying 'I'm sorry', or 'forgive me' - testament to the emotional trauma the mother must have suffered. </p> <p>Fifteen babies have already been dumped this year. An eight pound boy was recently found by a passer-by in the litter bin of Bourton Meadow Park in Buckinghamshire. The baby was named James by nurses after the man who found him - a stranger who took a shortcut through the park to get to the pub. He was barely two hours old. The mother has not been found despite public appeals. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, a baby boy was left on the doorstep of a bungalow in Sawtry, Cambridgeshire. The mother, aged 20, wrote a series of moving letters to the couple who found the child, pleading for their forgiveness. After contacting police last week, she admitted she had not come to terms with pregnancy. 'All this could have been avoided but at the time I felt desperate and confused and thought I would be in trouble,' she said. The baby is in foster care. </p> <p>Nicholas is also in the care of foster parents, who, if he is lucky, will become adoptive parents. At any time his birth mother may resurface. Until then, Detective Sergeant Ian Allsop perseveres with the task of tracing her. 'Usually, after a fortnight the mother's resistance to reclaiming the baby wanes,' he said. </p> <p>'They have reconciled themselves to the fact and come forward. If the mother has told her GP that she is pregnant she can be traced: you simply look on the records for a mother without a baby. But if the mother doesn't want to be found, you won't find her.' </p> <p>Allsop believes Nicholas's mother to be a local woman, who was probably on her way to hospital with the baby before she lost the nerve and fled. 'She was somebody confused and lost - a schoolgirl mother.' He follows up every rumour, chases every phone call. Some are from jilted boyfriends who think their old partner might have been pregnant and spurned the child. Others are hoaxers. </p> <p>There is no established procedure or national infrastruc ture for finding the mothers, so the task is left to the police. The mother has, after all, committed a crime, said Allsop. According to Home Office figures, 45 people are charged with 'abandoning a child under the age of two' every year. It is an act of desperation, but one still punishable by five years in jail, under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861. </p> <p>Allsop finds it hard to attribute blame to the mothers. 'It's a failing of society: mothers are not allowed to reject their babies' he said. 'There should be a system in place guaranteeing a degree of anonymity for women. The health of the mother is as important as the health of the baby. Some of these women could be wandering around in urgent need of medical care, the birth not complete and the placenta still partially in the womb.' </p> <p>The Foundling Group was started nine years ago by Sandra Webster who was aban doned by her mother at the age of three weeks. Now with more than 100 members, the group's role has evolved to become the only place a foundling can turn to for help in finding their birth parent. 'Many of the people who come to us have done absolutely nothing to find their parents. There's little that they can do - it's a bit hopeless. Many search newspaper archives for the story of their abandonment. Often their first picture will be in a local newspaper. Most people take for granted simple things like knowing when they were born and how much they weighed. We don't have that.' </p> <p>Webster has loving adoptive parents and now a family of her own. But traces of her uncertain past linger. 'There is so much anger and resentment,' she said. 'Everybody handles it differently. We are left without a system we can use to find our parents. We can't use the National Contact Register that helps adopted children find their real parents: we don't have prerequisite proof of our identity and relationship to the missing parent. All we want now is an amnesty under the law so that parents can come forward without fear of being charged.' </p> <p>In Webster's voice there is, however, a hint of anger at absent parents. She does not blame inadequate social services for the plight of foundlings - she says hospital staff understand the adoption process, are sympathetic and able to help. 'Some mothers say they leave their babies to give them a better life,' she continues, perplexed. 'But they haven't even thought about the effect it has upon the baby.' </p> <p>Tony May, or Victor Banks as he was originally called, maintains a romantic image of his parents. They were wartime lovers, he thinks - perhaps a young, carefree London girl and an American pilot, who had a passionate fling. On 19 December 1942, May was left near Victoria Embankment, hence his name. </p> <p>He imagines that his birth mother couldn't bear the social stigma of a child born out of wedlock. 'The fact that she put me in a public place suggests that she wanted someone to find me,' said May, now 58. But in truth, May has no idea of how he came to be left - where he was born, or who left him there. He doesn't know who found him or what time of day it was. </p> <p>'Today, people get a record of their early days,' he said. 'They get a folder - a life book - in which anything that is known about them is recorded, and their early photos are collected. But in my case I didn't even start inquiring about my birth mother until I was 50. I just wasn't interested. I never discussed it with my adoptive parents and only when they died did I begin looking. You didn't talk about that sort of thing in those days.' </p> <p>May, a successful ex-banker, believes his missing roots have left him compromised. 'I don't want to sound full of myself, but I have been lucky and done well in life, so I want to know who my parents were - if they were good at the same things as I am. I'm by nature a \"people pleaser\" - I have had a rough time and so I don't want to cause other people worry. I tend to play the game and shut up, always feeling on the outside. Anxiety has been a big part of my life.' He does not want to see anyone punished for his trauma; he simply wants to meet his mother and show her that he turned out all right in the end. The law, however, takes a different view. While the decision to prosecute a foundling's par ent must be in the 'public interest', the police cannot guarantee that a parent won't be jailed. </p> <p>It is an insurmountable dilemma: should the irresponsible act of neglecting a baby go unpunished, or should women feel able to return without reproach to their estranged baby once the trauma of an unplanned childbirth has passed? </p> <p>Allsop rejects some of the solutions that other European countries have sought. Germany has introduced 'baby banks' where mothers can anonymously leave their children. They open a metal hatch, put the baby into a cot, close the hatch and walk away. Then cameras switch on and monitor the baby until a nurse arrives. He believes such schemes fail to place enough emphasis on care for the mother. </p> <p>But, neither, some argue, does the letter of the law. Allsop said baby Nicholas's mother is unlikely to be prosecuted if she returns. 'But it is not my decision,' he added, as a note of caution. 'The door's still open for her to come back to her baby if she wants.' </p> <p><strong> The facts about foundlings </strong></p> <p> \u0095 56 babies are abandoned every year, according to Home Office figures. <br> \u0095 15 babies have been abandoned in the first three months of this year. <br> \u0095 In the nineteenth century, prior to the introduction of adoption laws, 'exposing' or abandonment of children was common. Many children perished of cold and hunger on the street. <br> \u0095 The Foundling Group is for adults over the age of 18 who have been abandoned as babies, but whose natural families did not reclaim them after their original abandonment. They therefore have no original name, no date of birth or access to any other identifying information. <br> \u0095 This group has been established under the umbrella of the National Organisation for the Counselling of Adoptees and Parents, known as Norcap.</p>",

It offered little protection from the cold and biting wind. The couple had reached the end of the road before Mills stopped to turn around. The teenager had got up and appeared to be having trouble walking as she made her way to the railway track on the edge of the sprawling estate. Mills knew that something was wrong. She feared that the girl might be planning to throw the baby on the railway track. 'My instincts told me I had to do something. So we followed her. Eventually she went up an alleyway and when she thought we'd gone she turned back on to the main road. She sat on a fence and bent over to kiss the baby's head. The she looked down at a doorway and realised the lights were on, kissed the baby again and ran down the drive and put the baby on the doorstep. As she turned back she hesitated but then she disappeared off down the alleyway. I ran across the road to the baby and I could see there was nothing on it. I just picked him up and started crying, because he had nothing on and his cord was still attached. I banged on the door and the lady said if you hadn't knocked on the door we wouldn't have opened up until morning because we'd locked up ready to go to bed.' The baby was taken to City Hospital in Nottingham, where staff gave him the name Nicholas Christmas. He weighed 7lb 3oz and was said to be less than two hours old. Apart from being cold, he was in remarkably good health. Only at that point did Nicholas officially exist on paper. He had just joined a small but growing number of babies - known as foundlings - who are abandoned every year on the streets of England and Wales. More than 50 babies are dumped and the figure is rising. Often the only clue is a note pinned to a shawl, saying 'I'm sorry', or 'forgive me' - testament to the emotional trauma the mother must have suffered. Fifteen babies have already been dumped this year. An eight pound boy was recently found by a passer-by in the litter bin of Bourton Meadow Park in Buckinghamshire. The baby was named James by nurses after the man who found him - a stranger who took a shortcut through the park to get to the pub. He was barely two hours old. The mother has not been found despite public appeals. Two weeks ago, a baby boy was left on the doorstep of a bungalow in Sawtry, Cambridgeshire. The mother, aged 20, wrote a series of moving letters to the couple who found the child, pleading for their forgiveness. After contacting police last week, she admitted she had not come to terms with pregnancy. 'All this could have been avoided but at the time I felt desperate and confused and thought I would be in trouble,' she said. The baby is in foster care. Nicholas is also in the care of foster parents, who, if he is lucky, will become adoptive parents. At any time his birth mother may resurface. Until then, Detective Sergeant Ian Allsop perseveres with the task of tracing her. 'Usually, after a fortnight the mother's resistance to reclaiming the baby wanes,' he said. 'They have reconciled themselves to the fact and come forward. If the mother has told her GP that she is pregnant she can be traced: you simply look on the records for a mother without a baby. But if the mother doesn't want to be found, you won't find her.' Allsop believes Nicholas's mother to be a local woman, who was probably on her way to hospital with the baby before she lost the nerve and fled. 'She was somebody confused and lost - a schoolgirl mother.' He follows up every rumour, chases every phone call. Some are from jilted boyfriends who think their old partner might have been pregnant and spurned the child. Others are hoaxers. There is no established procedure or national infrastruc ture for finding the mothers, so the task is left to the police. The mother has, after all, committed a crime, said Allsop. According to Home Office figures, 45 people are charged with 'abandoning a child under the age of two' every year. It is an act of desperation, but one still punishable by five years in jail, under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861. Allsop finds it hard to attribute blame to the mothers. 'It's a failing of society: mothers are not allowed to reject their babies' he said. 'There should be a system in place guaranteeing a degree of anonymity for women. The health of the mother is as important as the health of the baby. Some of these women could be wandering around in urgent need of medical care, the birth not complete and the placenta still partially in the womb.' The Foundling Group was started nine years ago by Sandra Webster who was aban doned by her mother at the age of three weeks. Now with more than 100 members, the group's role has evolved to become the only place a foundling can turn to for help in finding their birth parent. 'Many of the people who come to us have done absolutely nothing to find their parents. There's little that they can do - it's a bit hopeless. Many search newspaper archives for the story of their abandonment. Often their first picture will be in a local newspaper. Most people take for granted simple things like knowing when they were born and how much they weighed. We don't have that.' Webster has loving adoptive parents and now a family of her own. But traces of her uncertain past linger. 'There is so much anger and resentment,' she said. 'Everybody handles it differently. We are left without a system we can use to find our parents. We can't use the National Contact Register that helps adopted children find their real parents: we don't have prerequisite proof of our identity and relationship to the missing parent. All we want now is an amnesty under the law so that parents can come forward without fear of being charged.' In Webster's voice there is, however, a hint of anger at absent parents. She does not blame inadequate social services for the plight of foundlings - she says hospital staff understand the adoption process, are sympathetic and able to help. 'Some mothers say they leave their babies to give them a better life,' she continues, perplexed. 'But they haven't even thought about the effect it has upon the baby.' Tony May, or Victor Banks as he was originally called, maintains a romantic image of his parents. They were wartime lovers, he thinks - perhaps a young, carefree London girl and an American pilot, who had a passionate fling. On 19 December 1942, May was left near Victoria Embankment, hence his name. He imagines that his birth mother couldn't bear the social stigma of a child born out of wedlock. 'The fact that she put me in a public place suggests that she wanted someone to find me,' said May, now 58. But in truth, May has no idea of how he came to be left - where he was born, or who left him there. He doesn't know who found him or what time of day it was. 'Today, people get a record of their early days,' he said. 'They get a folder - a life book - in which anything that is known about them is recorded, and their early photos are collected. But in my case I didn't even start inquiring about my birth mother until I was 50. I just wasn't interested. I never discussed it with my adoptive parents and only when they died did I begin looking. You didn't talk about that sort of thing in those days.' May, a successful ex-banker, believes his missing roots have left him compromised. 'I don't want to sound full of myself, but I have been lucky and done well in life, so I want to know who my parents were - if they were good at the same things as I am. I'm by nature a \"people pleaser\" - I have had a rough time and so I don't want to cause other people worry. I tend to play the game and shut up, always feeling on the outside. Anxiety has been a big part of my life.' He does not want to see anyone punished for his trauma; he simply wants to meet his mother and show her that he turned out all right in the end. The law, however, takes a different view. While the decision to prosecute a foundling's par ent must be in the 'public interest', the police cannot guarantee that a parent won't be jailed. It is an insurmountable dilemma: should the irresponsible act of neglecting a baby go unpunished, or should women feel able to return without reproach to their estranged baby once the trauma of an unplanned childbirth has passed? Allsop rejects some of the solutions that other European countries have sought. Germany has introduced 'baby banks' where mothers can anonymously leave their children. They open a metal hatch, put the baby into a cot, close the hatch and walk away. Then cameras switch on and monitor the baby until a nurse arrives. He believes such schemes fail to place enough emphasis on care for the mother. But, neither, some argue, does the letter of the law. Allsop said baby Nicholas's mother is unlikely to be prosecuted if she returns. 'But it is not my decision,' he added, as a note of caution. 'The door's still open for her to come back to her baby if she wants.' The facts about foundlings \u0095 56 babies are abandoned every year, according to Home Office figures. \u0095 15 babies have been abandoned in the first three months of this year. \u0095 In the nineteenth century, prior to the introduction of adoption laws, 'exposing' or abandonment of children was common. Many children perished of cold and hunger on the street. \u0095 The Foundling Group is for adults over the age of 18 who have been abandoned as babies, but whose natural families did not reclaim them after their original abandonment. They therefore have no original name, no date of birth or access to any other identifying information. \u0095 This group has been established under the umbrella of the National Organisation for the Counselling of Adoptees and Parents, known as Norcap.",

      "body": "<p>It is late afternoon and I am perched on a stool at the Phat Phuk noodle bar. The appropriateness is not lost on me. I have come in search of long, slithery dough in a bowl of savoury broth. Had I been in Soho I would have eaten Japanese, but I'm not, so I plump for Thai. Who cares? It is the slurpy comfort of noodles I crave. They could just have easily have been smooth Chinese Hokkein, transparent Vietnamese beanthread or delicate Japanese somen. All I know is that the wind is icy, the rain is dripping off my nose, the handles of my shopping bag are about to break and I am so hungry I am in a state of suppressed panic. </p> <p>We are not generally good at fast food here. Sure, there was once fish and chips and there are now those revolving doner kebabs that look and taste like a table leg on a spit. But we do not have the history of drawing up a stool and tucking in for 10 minutes while the world walks past. It has nothing to do with the weather. It is more to do with being a nation brought up to believe that it is a bit common to eat in the street. </p> <p>But the noodle bar may be our salvation. You can rush in, attempt to get the cook to understand you and tuck into whatever he thought you asked for in less time than it takes to buy a BLT in Pret A Manger. Noodles are cheap, fast and as hot and spicy as you want. You can eat them gracefully or like a labrador at a water bowl. And when people ask me what is the food of the future, I have just one word. Noodles. </p> <p>I would hate the world to be turned into one big wheat field, but noodles are a cheap and ultimately comforting way to feed. They are, though, the food of the lone eater, either at home or on the sidewalk. Just as it feels right to dole out lasagne verde to a whole table, there is something appropriate about tucking into a bowl of noodles when you are alone. Like Harrison Ford in Blade Runner . There is something complete, almost territorial about a bowl of food all to yourself. Thin noodles don't work as a centre-stage dish to be doled out, earth-mother style, to an assembled crowd. </p> <p>At home I tend to cook more Japanese noodles - udon, ramen, soba and somen - than Chinese or Thai. This is partly due to the ease of the accompanying seaweed and bonito broth (the dashi) that now comes in bottles and sachets from supermarkets and can be ready in seconds. Noodles in a dashi broth spiked with dark soy, coriander, mirin, sake and ginger offer fast, fat-free gustatory satisfaction. Now there's a sentence I never thought would come from my pen. </p> <p>Noodles are as diverse as pasta. Briefly, and sticking to the most popular Japanese varieties (I am not short-changing you, this is a Japanese issue): udon are the coarse-featured peasants of the noodle world. They plump up in a bowl of boiling broth and are as warming and satiating as a baked potato. I try to eat them cold, but feel like a contestant in Endurance , being forced to eat stir-fried worms. For me they are the winter noodle, perfect to pad out a thin chicken broth. Legend has it we must slurp our udon loudly - the reason becomes apparent when the heat sustained in the fat noodles meets a chapped lip. Air drawn in as you slurp helps cool the noodles. </p> <p>Somen are slim, pale, elegant, polite. In noodle terms they are expensive. Bound in thin bundles with black ribbon, they are almost too beautiful to cook. You roll them over in your hands as if they were made of fine porcelain. If they could walk, they would have the tight shuffle of a geisha. These are the noodles I want curled up in a waxed takeaway carton, tossed with matchsticks of cucumber, dark soy and pink pickled ginger. Somen are difficult to negotiate in soup, slipping away from spoon and chopstick. </p> <p>Soba lie somewhere between the sophisticated somen and the proletariat udon. Sharp-edged, nutty soba get their cardboard hue and texture from the buckwheat added to the wheat. Traditionally served cold in a loose pile, they come with a soy and mirin dipping sauce spiked with the heat of green horseradish and the sweetness of white sugar. </p> <p>Then there are the green 'cha' noodles. I am not talking of the dark-spinach green of Italian fettucine, but a green somewhere between sage and jade; the soft matte green that comes from the green-tea powder in the dough. Few lunches are as elegant as a minimalist dish of chilled green soba with a fragile bowl of dashi dipping sauce. </p> <p>But I am happy to eat hot udon like a peasant, sitting on a stool, reading my rain-sodden paper, wolfing down my noodle fix. Japanese elegance and minimalism are fine, but not when it's past my lunchtime and my blood-sugar level is getting dangerously near the 'eat now or pass out' stage. </p> <p><strong> Mackerel with spinach and soba noodles</strong><br> </p> <p> If you are not careful, you can end up using every pot and pan in the house making noodle soup. I make the broth in the pan in which I make the teriyaki sauce and cook the spinach in the broth, thus saving two pans. You will still need a dish to marinate the mackerel, a pan to make the sauce, and another to boil the noodles. But this warming soup with its sweet savour is worth it. For 2 large bowls. </p> <p><strong> 170g dried soba </strong><br> <strong> a large handful spinach or chard leaves </strong><br> <strong> a small handful of coriander leaves </strong></p> <p>for the fish</p> <p><strong> 2 mackerel fillets (1 fish, filleted) </strong><br> <strong> 2 tbsp dark soy </strong><br> <strong> 2 tbsp sake </strong><br> <strong> 1 tbsp mirin </strong><br> <strong> 1 tsp sugar </strong></p> <p> for the broth</p> <p><strong> 5 ladlefuls of water </strong><br> <strong> 1 tsp dried dashi granules </strong><br> <strong> a fat knob of ginger (about the size of a walnut) </strong><br> <strong> 2 tbsp dark soy (I use sashimi soy) </strong><br> <strong> 1 tbsp mirin </strong></p> <p>Rinse the mackerel and lay it, skin side up, in a glass or steel dish. Mix the soy, sake, mirin and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring till the sugar has dissolved, then pour over the fish. Get the overhead grill hot, ready to cook the mackerel. </p> <p>In the same saucepan (I am only trying to save washing up here, but use a new one if you wish), pour the water and add the dashi granules, the soy and the mirin. Peel the ginger, cut it into thin slices, then shred into fine matchsticks and add to the pan. Bring to the oil, then turn down to a simmer. </p> <p>Put a large pan of water on to boil, salt it as you would for pasta, then add the noodles and boil vigorously for about 8 minutes or until the noodles are firm but tender. Try one - it is the only way to tell if they are ready. </p> <p>While the broth is simmering and the noodles cooking, transfer the mackerel on to a grill pan lined with foil and cook till sizzling and deep brown and black under an overhead grill. It should take about 6 minutes if your grill is hot enough. </p> <p>Wash the spinach, shred it with a large knife and add it to the dashi broth. It should be cooked in a couple of minutes, slightly longer for chard. </p> <p>Drain the noodles, divide them between 2 large soup bowls. Drain the spinach and place on top of the noodles. Remove the fish from the oven. Break each fillet into large chunks with a spoon and divide them between the bowls. Scatter over the coriander, then ladle the hot dashi broth over the noodles. </p> <p><strong> Terry Durack's chilled somen</strong></p> <p> It seems a new pasta book is published every week, yet the noodle is strangely ill-served in print. Terry Durack - probably the sharpest, greediest, funniest food writer alive - has devoted an entire book to the long, the thin and the slithery. Noodle (\u00a316.99, Pavilion) is his homage to the udon and the ramen, the hokkein and the shirataki. </p> <p>The recipe that follows is a breath of fresh air, cool, crisp and subtle - no big flavours here - and is probably more of a summer recipe, but I am getting tired of heavy cooking in this long, long winter. The dish only works if all the ingredients are thoroughly chilled and the watercress is spanking fresh. Wasabi, the hot Japanese horseradish can be bought ready-prepared in small tubes from Japanese food shops and major supermarkets along with the mirin, dashi and noodles. Serves 4. </p> <p><strong>200g somen </strong></p> <p><strong>6 dried shiitake mushrooms </strong></p> <p><strong>300ml dashi </strong></p> <p><strong>100ml mirin </strong></p> <p><strong>5 tbsp dark soy sauce </strong></p> <p><strong>1 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks </strong></p> <p><strong>1 handful of watercress </strong></p> <p><strong>2 spring onions, finely shredded </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp prepared wasabi </strong></p> <p>Put the noodles in a pot of boiling water. When the water returns to the boil, add cup of cold water. When it starts to boil again, add another cup of cold water. After about 2 minutes of cooking, the noodles should be ready. Rinse in plenty of cold water and drain. Refrigerate for about 2 hours. </p> <p>Soak the mushrooms in hot water for an hour, then drain and cut off the stems. To make the dipping sauce, combine the dashi, mirin, soy and mushrooms in a saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove mushrooms and cut in half. </p> <p>Strain the liquid and cool quickly by pouring it into a bowl sitting in another bowl of iced water. Refrigerate until well chilled. Divide the noodles among 4 plates or bowls and top with the cucumber, a mound of watercress, the mushrooms and a sprinkling of spring onion. Serve with individual bowls of dipping sauce and a little wasabi to individual taste. * </p> <p>\u0095 Nigel Slater's book Appetite (\u00a325, Fourth Estate) has won the Andr\u00e9 Simon Memorial Fund Award for Food Book of the Year.</p>",

This is partly due to the ease of the accompanying seaweed and bonito broth (the dashi) that now comes in bottles and sachets from supermarkets and can be ready in seconds. Noodles in a dashi broth spiked with dark soy, coriander, mirin, sake and ginger offer fast, fat-free gustatory satisfaction. Now there's a sentence I never thought would come from my pen. Noodles are as diverse as pasta. Briefly, and sticking to the most popular Japanese varieties (I am not short-changing you, this is a Japanese issue): udon are the coarse-featured peasants of the noodle world. They plump up in a bowl of boiling broth and are as warming and satiating as a baked potato. I try to eat them cold, but feel like a contestant in Endurance , being forced to eat stir-fried worms. For me they are the winter noodle, perfect to pad out a thin chicken broth. Legend has it we must slurp our udon loudly - the reason becomes apparent when the heat sustained in the fat noodles meets a chapped lip. Air drawn in as you slurp helps cool the noodles. Somen are slim, pale, elegant, polite. In noodle terms they are expensive. Bound in thin bundles with black ribbon, they are almost too beautiful to cook. You roll them over in your hands as if they were made of fine porcelain. If they could walk, they would have the tight shuffle of a geisha. These are the noodles I want curled up in a waxed takeaway carton, tossed with matchsticks of cucumber, dark soy and pink pickled ginger. Somen are difficult to negotiate in soup, slipping away from spoon and chopstick. Soba lie somewhere between the sophisticated somen and the proletariat udon. Sharp-edged, nutty soba get their cardboard hue and texture from the buckwheat added to the wheat. Traditionally served cold in a loose pile, they come with a soy and mirin dipping sauce spiked with the heat of green horseradish and the sweetness of white sugar. Then there are the green 'cha' noodles. I am not talking of the dark-spinach green of Italian fettucine, but a green somewhere between sage and jade; the soft matte green that comes from the green-tea powder in the dough. Few lunches are as elegant as a minimalist dish of chilled green soba with a fragile bowl of dashi dipping sauce. But I am happy to eat hot udon like a peasant, sitting on a stool, reading my rain-sodden paper, wolfing down my noodle fix. Japanese elegance and minimalism are fine, but not when it's past my lunchtime and my blood-sugar level is getting dangerously near the 'eat now or pass out' stage. Mackerel with spinach and soba noodles If you are not careful, you can end up using every pot and pan in the house making noodle soup. I make the broth in the pan in which I make the teriyaki sauce and cook the spinach in the broth, thus saving two pans. You will still need a dish to marinate the mackerel, a pan to make the sauce, and another to boil the noodles. But this warming soup with its sweet savour is worth it. For 2 large bowls. 170g dried soba a large handful spinach or chard leaves a small handful of coriander leaves for the fish 2 mackerel fillets (1 fish, filleted) 2 tbsp dark soy 2 tbsp sake 1 tbsp mirin 1 tsp sugar for the broth 5 ladlefuls of water 1 tsp dried dashi granules a fat knob of ginger (about the size of a walnut) 2 tbsp dark soy (I use sashimi soy) 1 tbsp mirin Rinse the mackerel and lay it, skin side up, in a glass or steel dish. Mix the soy, sake, mirin and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring till the sugar has dissolved, then pour over the fish. Get the overhead grill hot, ready to cook the mackerel. In the same saucepan (I am only trying to save washing up here, but use a new one if you wish), pour the water and add the dashi granules, the soy and the mirin. Peel the ginger, cut it into thin slices, then shred into fine matchsticks and add to the pan. Bring to the oil, then turn down to a simmer. Put a large pan of water on to boil, salt it as you would for pasta, then add the noodles and boil vigorously for about 8 minutes or until the noodles are firm but tender. Try one - it is the only way to tell if they are ready. While the broth is simmering and the noodles cooking, transfer the mackerel on to a grill pan lined with foil and cook till sizzling and deep brown and black under an overhead grill. It should take about 6 minutes if your grill is hot enough. Wash the spinach, shred it with a large knife and add it to the dashi broth. It should be cooked in a couple of minutes, slightly longer for chard. Drain the noodles, divide them between 2 large soup bowls. Drain the spinach and place on top of the noodles. Remove the fish from the oven. Break each fillet into large chunks with a spoon and divide them between the bowls. Scatter over the coriander, then ladle the hot dashi broth over the noodles. Terry Durack's chilled somen It seems a new pasta book is published every week, yet the noodle is strangely ill-served in print. Terry Durack - probably the sharpest, greediest, funniest food writer alive - has devoted an entire book to the long, the thin and the slithery. Noodle (\u00a316.99, Pavilion) is his homage to the udon and the ramen, the hokkein and the shirataki. The recipe that follows is a breath of fresh air, cool, crisp and subtle - no big flavours here - and is probably more of a summer recipe, but I am getting tired of heavy cooking in this long, long winter. The dish only works if all the ingredients are thoroughly chilled and the watercress is spanking fresh. Wasabi, the hot Japanese horseradish can be bought ready-prepared in small tubes from Japanese food shops and major supermarkets along with the mirin, dashi and noodles. Serves 4. 200g somen 6 dried shiitake mushrooms 300ml dashi 100ml mirin 5 tbsp dark soy sauce 1 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks 1 handful of watercress 2 spring onions, finely shredded 1 tsp prepared wasabi Put the noodles in a pot of boiling water. When the water returns to the boil, add cup of cold water. When it starts to boil again, add another cup of cold water. After about 2 minutes of cooking, the noodles should be ready. Rinse in plenty of cold water and drain. Refrigerate for about 2 hours. Soak the mushrooms in hot water for an hour, then drain and cut off the stems. To make the dipping sauce, combine the dashi, mirin, soy and mushrooms in a saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove mushrooms and cut in half. Strain the liquid and cool quickly by pouring it into a bowl sitting in another bowl of iced water. Refrigerate until well chilled. Divide the noodles among 4 plates or bowls and top with the cucumber, a mound of watercress, the mushrooms and a sprinkling of spring onion. Serve with individual bowls of dipping sauce and a little wasabi to individual taste. * \u0095 Nigel Slater's book Appetite (\u00a325, Fourth Estate) has won the Andr\u00e9 Simon Memorial Fund Award for Food Book of the Year.",

That its hanging gardens are a wonder to behold and its rococo architecture a delight; that it has spawned many of the nation's dreamers and provided inspiration for its artists and poets. Colindale: Edgware's Latin Quarter. There. None of that has been said before. Mind you, it's all complete cobblers, which probably explains why. There's nothing wrong with Colindale. It's just that, were you to flick through the guidebooks in search of a good day out, you would find the chapter detailing thrilling things to do in Colindale on the short side. There's the British Museum's newspaper library. It's not far from Stanmore. Er, that's it. Colindale is the suburbs in spades. It's on the edge but not at all edgy. </p> <p>Curiously, it is that very suburbanness, that utilitarian city blandness which detaches Colindale from the London of which it is a part, which makes it the perfect location for Noto Sushi. You want to eat good sushi in a place that is not noticeably British, and Colindale does the trick. It helps, of course, that this bar which serves nothing other than raw fish - no teriyaki, no tempura, no dumplings - should occupy a site in the middle of Oriental City, a large, no-frills shopping centre dedicated to the food and culture of the Far East. The place is as in-yer-face Asian as it can be and, while local office workers use its impressive food court at lunchtimes, there's no doubting that it is really designed for the expat Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Indonesian communities. The rest of us are mere interlopers, though very welcome ones. </p> <p>Noto sits off to one side of that food court, an elegant little shack with its own seats at its own marble bar beneath its own unnecessary roof of authentic Japanese ceramic tiles. Behind it is the cavernous Oriental supermarket, complete with a huge Japanese fishmonger's where you can buy the raw materials of the lunch just eaten. All the food is produced to order by Japanese chefs and is quite simply some of the best sushi I have ever eaten. For those of you who wanted to see me sentenced to eat at an Angus Steak House for the rest of my life for refusing to condemn the pricing at Ubon in my review a month or two back - my, how that made you cross - Noto also happens to be eye-poppingly good value. </p> <p>I went with my brother Adam, a regular visitor to Japan who adores the food and who comes here to get a fix of what he swears is the real thing. I have no reason to doubt him. There's a long list of various nigiri and maki sushi as well as sashimi and hand rolls, all priced at between 90p and \u00a32.80 per piece. There are also a number of set meals, and from these Adam chose the Tokujo-chirashi, at \u00a315. It was one of the two most expensive dishes on the menu. (I had the other one.) Even so, the value was immense: a large bowl filled with chirashi rice, sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and then layered with every kind of fish in the chilled counter. There was salmon and sweet prawn, surf clam and sea urchin, vinegared snapper and tiny orange fish roe. There was even some oily tuna, which sells for almost \u00a370 a kilo up at the fishmonger's. It looked beautiful and, Adam said, it tasted terrific. </p> <p>I went for the lunchtime special menu (also at \u00a315), which laid down the kind of challenge I cannot resist: you may order anything you like from an extensive list which includes almost everything, bar the oily tuna. However, you may do so for only an hour and, if there is anything left over at the end of those 60 minutes, you must pay for it at the piece meal rate (so to speak). It is, depending on your view, either an incentive to over-eat or an incentive not to over-order. It gave me the opportunity to order four pieces of one of my passions, grilled eel, tied to the rice with a ribbon of seaweed and glistening with a slick of sweet, soy-based sauce. </p> <p>What distinguishes the sushi here - the tuna and salmon, scallop and clam and snapper, all of which I tried - is not just the glorious freshness of the fish but the rice. All too often the rice in British-bought sushi, particularly the stuff found in those pre-packed supermarket containers, is in a cold, solid lump. Here it is just warm, and the grains are almost separate, yet clinging to each other as if for company. A maki roll becomes a set of distinct textures as your teeth first break through the taut membrane of the seaweed, then find the yielding rice and finally hit the soft fish at the centre. The spicy tuna rolls, the fish glazed with a light salty chilli sauce, were particularly good. </p> <p>It was almost revelatory and, as I say, heroically good value. You would find out how good if you went to Harrods, where Noto has a similar stand. There the chirashi costs a whopping \u00a339. A piece of oily tuna sushi costs \u00a33.50 instead of \u00a32, and scallops cost \u00a32.50 instead of \u00a31.40. Doubtless that is Harrods taking its cut rather than Noto inflating its prices. In my book, it simply makes Colindale far sexier a destination than Knightsbridge could ever be.</p> <p>Contact Jay Rayner on <a href=\"mailto:issuejay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">issuejay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a>.</p>",

In Japan the harbinger and star of spring is the cherry. Cherry flowers seem to work on the Japanese psyche in the same way that cow parsley or the May blossom does on the rural English. The heart leaps. The Japanese have cherry cults and will travel miles to see the blossom at its best. These economic migrants, wives of Japanese businessmen at some of the 56 Japanese factories in Wales, were quietly pining for cherry blossom and sweet spring, just as I have wept bitterly in November for May.

The tea ceremony is a form of meditation, and the view of the garden is part of that process. Just as the tea houses are carefully rustic, the garden is likely to be deliberately gentle and unimposing, expressing the same spirit as the ceremony itself. A dynamic is often created by planting or placing objects on an imaginary diagonal line, creating a pleasing visual tension. Trees and shrubs are carefully planted to create veils or layers of view, often with larger trees, stones or bushes in the foreground and smaller ones at the margins, creating the impression of infinite horizons.

After suffering a stroke, she had been rushed into the accident and emergency department where doctors stabilised her condition. At this point, she was abandoned by a system that had lost the will to care. </p> <p>After hours on a trolley in a corridor, she was eventually placed on a mixed ward where nurses had no idea that she needed a drip to help her diabetes or drops for her glaucoma. For five days, she was left without food or drink because a speech therapist was unavailable to test her swallowing reflex. </p> <p>Things were little better when she was eventually transferred to a women's geriatric ward. On one occasion, relatives found her with her head on a pillow sodden from a leaking drip and on another lying in her own faeces. Unable to speak, in her desperation, she left notes by her bed about the neglect and abuse she had endured. She wrote of how telephone calls from relatives were left unanswered as the phone was left ringing all night and how staff tried to force-feed her through the nose without her consent. </p> <p>What she didn't know was that doctors had written 'Do Not Resuscitate' on her file; if she had had another stroke or heart attack, the hospital would not have tried to save her. </p> <p>When this newspaper published details of her experiences, we thought it was an extreme case, but the response from hundreds of readers showed that her treatment was horribly and scandalously unexceptional. The 'Dignity on the Ward' campaign which followed, backed by Help the Aged, led the then Health Secretary Frank Dobson to intervene directly. He promised immediate reform of the way older people were treated. In an article in The Observer, he pledged to establish a National Service Framework for an end to ageism in hospitals. </p> <p>Last week, to the joy and genuine surprise of campaigners for older people, the framework appeared, backed by \u00a3120 million to refurbish wards for older people. Dobson's successor, Alan Milburn, has called it a 'radical blueprint' and for once those tired words appear to be borne out by the document. By the end of 2004, the NHS will undertake an additional 70,000 cataract operations, 16,000 hip and knee replacements and unclog 3,000 arteries - all on patients over 65. </p> <p>Most profoundly, the framework commits the NHS to provide care 'regardless of age and on the basis of clinical need alone'. By October, all hospitals will be expected to end rationing on the basis of age, a welcome return to the founding principles of the health service. </p> <p>But behind the scenes, the health professionals and charities which backed the Dignity on the Ward campaign are worried. Where will the extra nurses come from to care for the 88-year-olds who no longer have 'Do Not Resuscitate' written on their files? Who will pay for the doctors to carry out thousands of extra operations? </p> <p>A devastating report published on the Department of Health website last week outlined the monumental nature of the task ahead. The Standing Nursing and Midwifery Advisory Committee said that over-65s were still being denied the basic rights to privacy and independence. It also voiced 'great concern' at persistent negative attitudes to older patients, the motivation behind The Observer 's new campaign - the Elderly Abandoned. </p> <p>Alan Milburn knows that it will need far more than a lick of paint on geriatric wards to improve conditions for older patients. Last week's report made it clear that the NHS was still 'failing far too often to meet their basic needs for food, fluid, rest activity and elimination [going to the toilet]. Their psychological, mental health and rehabilitation needs are often ignored... it remains the case that staff lack the basics - clean bed linen, pillows and dressings - to allow for the humane treatment of older patients.' </p> <p>We should not belittle the genuine attempt at reform represented by the National Service Framework, but many specialists now believe ageism is so entrenched that it will take more than a blueprint, however radical, and a set of targets, however ambitious, to transform the culture of a lack of respect for the elderly. </p> <p>It is a sign of how far we have drifted from the idea of universal health care that the Secretary of State needs to make a public statement that older patients in the NHS should have equal rights. Two-thirds of those using the NHS are over the age of 65. Instructing hospitals to take their needs into account is not far removed from telling those who run Disneyland that it would be good if they catered for the needs of children.</p>",

      "byline": "Steve Barnett",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In one of those whirlwind celebrity tours that American scholars are so good at, Harvard professor Robert Putnam was doing the rounds of chat shows and conferences last week to promote his book, Bowling Alone. </p> <p>His basic thesis, that civic life in the US is falling apart, is supported by a prodigious collection of statistics demonstrating that Americans volunteer less, socialise less, eat together less and generally have less interest in community and political life than at any time in living memory. </p> <p>And why are Americans no longer leading scout troops, joining bowling leagues or inviting folks round for dinner? Because they're watching the box. With an equally impressive array of facts, figures and experimental evidence, Putnam demonstrates that TV is probably the main culprit for the collapse of American community life. </p> <p>Moreover, we are talking specifically about entertainment shows. Putnam says: 'It is precisely those Americans most marked by this dependence on televised entertainment who were most likely to have dropped out of civic and social life.' </p> <p>He names names: Miami Vice, soap operas such as Dallas - both still being rerun - and reality TV shows, such as America's Most Wanted. </p> <p>Put to one side the question of whether the figures would stack up in Britain. The basic issue of broadcasting's ability not just to inform but to stimulate involvement in civic and political life has always been one of the driving arguments for a public service framework. It is impossible to prove, of course. But what Putnam has done is to demonstrate that the opposite case - a system of completely deregulated, commercialised, entertainment-driven television contributing to political apathy - appears to hold. </p> <p>Where does that leave the Government's deregulatory White Paper on communications? Here we have a Government eager at every opportunity to emphasise good citizenship, to raise levels of participation, to make us community-minded, to get the vote out. Yet one of the primary means, apparently, for achieving just that is being progressively thrown open to the marketplace. </p> <p>It gets worse. Apart from the consequences of reducing the public service requirements on commercial television, there is another factor directly affecting TV content: who will actually own commercial TV in Britain? I raise this question because of a little-noticed recommendation in the culture select committee's report two weeks ago. It wants to abolish controls on cross-media ownership unless 'the case for such controls is overwhelming and enduring'. At the press conference to launch the report, Labour MP John Maxton said they could think of no overwhelming objections. </p> <p>What was even more astonishing was Gerald Kaufman's response when asked the inevitable 'M' question. Would he not be concerned about Rupert Murdoch - who is currently banned from owning a terrestrial TV licence because he controls more than 20 per cent of the national press - launching an immediate takeover bid for Channel 5, or even ITV? </p> <p>Kaufman was unmoved. BSkyB's share of TV viewing was declining, he said. Sky News was at least as impartial as other broadcasters. And (I wrote this bit down to be absolutely sure): 'Murdoch's proportion of newspaper circulation is not that big.' He didn't quite go so far as to say that Murdoch was really a philanthropic sweetie who is always kind to animals, but did insist that he was 'often introduced as the ogre' into such debates. </p> <p>I don't think Murdoch is an ogre, though I am intrigued that a committee with seven Labour MPs out of 11 members appears to be so unconcerned about a man who spent the best part of 18 years heaping poisonous vitriol on their party being allowed to control parts of mainstream British television. They have clearly been lulled into a false sense of security by fulsome expressions of current newspaper support for Labour. </p> <p>For the moment, I am less interested in Murdoch's politics than in his concept of what TV is about. If his Fox Network is anything to go by, it is entirely entertainment- driven. Not just entertainment, but mindless, often violent and socially pointless entertainment, which is pure escapism. </p> <p>His contempt for the notion of public service is well known, and his TV executives are under no doubt about their obligations: push out the boundaries of social acceptability, be brash, be loud, be gruesome, cause a stir, do whatever it takes to grab and hold your audience. Even in the cultural wasteland which is (with a few magnificent exceptions) American TV, Fox stands out as particularly vacuous. </p> <p>Putnam is, it is said, being courted by Downing Street. If so, I hope they are listening to his conclusions about the socially corrosive influence of American entertainment television. Perhaps then they will pay a little more attention to how we can bolster TV's role in the nation's civic life. </p> <p>A very good start would be resisting any ill-informed siren calls to let that nice, supportive Mr Murdoch have a slice of our television cake. </p> <p> Steve Barnett is Professor of Communications at the University of Westminster.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In one of those whirlwind celebrity tours that American scholars are so good at, Harvard professor Robert Putnam was doing the rounds of chat shows and conferences last week to promote his book, Bowling Alone. His basic thesis, that civic life in the US is falling apart, is supported by a prodigious collection of statistics demonstrating that Americans volunteer less, socialise less, eat together less and generally have less interest in community and political life than at any time in living memory. And why are Americans no longer leading scout troops, joining bowling leagues or inviting folks round for dinner? Because they're watching the box. With an equally impressive array of facts, figures and experimental evidence, Putnam demonstrates that TV is probably the main culprit for the collapse of American community life. Moreover, we are talking specifically about entertainment shows. Putnam says: 'It is precisely those Americans most marked by this dependence on televised entertainment who were most likely to have dropped out of civic and social life.' He names names: Miami Vice, soap operas such as Dallas - both still being rerun - and reality TV shows, such as America's Most Wanted. Put to one side the question of whether the figures would stack up in Britain. The basic issue of broadcasting's ability not just to inform but to stimulate involvement in civic and political life has always been one of the driving arguments for a public service framework. It is impossible to prove, of course. But what Putnam has done is to demonstrate that the opposite case - a system of completely deregulated, commercialised, entertainment-driven television contributing to political apathy - appears to hold. Where does that leave the Government's deregulatory White Paper on communications? Here we have a Government eager at every opportunity to emphasise good citizenship, to raise levels of participation, to make us community-minded, to get the vote out. Yet one of the primary means, apparently, for achieving just that is being progressively thrown open to the marketplace. It gets worse. Apart from the consequences of reducing the public service requirements on commercial television, there is another factor directly affecting TV content: who will actually own commercial TV in Britain? I raise this question because of a little-noticed recommendation in the culture select committee's report two weeks ago. It wants to abolish controls on cross-media ownership unless 'the case for such controls is overwhelming and enduring'. At the press conference to launch the report, Labour MP John Maxton said they could think of no overwhelming objections. What was even more astonishing was Gerald Kaufman's response when asked the inevitable 'M' question. Would he not be concerned about Rupert Murdoch - who is currently banned from owning a terrestrial TV licence because he controls more than 20 per cent of the national press - launching an immediate takeover bid for Channel 5, or even ITV? Kaufman was unmoved. BSkyB's share of TV viewing was declining, he said. Sky News was at least as impartial as other broadcasters. And (I wrote this bit down to be absolutely sure): 'Murdoch's proportion of newspaper circulation is not that big.' He didn't quite go so far as to say that Murdoch was really a philanthropic sweetie who is always kind to animals, but did insist that he was 'often introduced as the ogre' into such debates. I don't think Murdoch is an ogre, though I am intrigued that a committee with seven Labour MPs out of 11 members appears to be so unconcerned about a man who spent the best part of 18 years heaping poisonous vitriol on their party being allowed to control parts of mainstream British television. They have clearly been lulled into a false sense of security by fulsome expressions of current newspaper support for Labour. For the moment, I am less interested in Murdoch's politics than in his concept of what TV is about. If his Fox Network is anything to go by, it is entirely entertainment- driven. Not just entertainment, but mindless, often violent and socially pointless entertainment, which is pure escapism. His contempt for the notion of public service is well known, and his TV executives are under no doubt about their obligations: push out the boundaries of social acceptability, be brash, be loud, be gruesome, cause a stir, do whatever it takes to grab and hold your audience. Even in the cultural wasteland which is (with a few magnificent exceptions) American TV, Fox stands out as particularly vacuous. Putnam is, it is said, being courted by Downing Street. If so, I hope they are listening to his conclusions about the socially corrosive influence of American entertainment television. Perhaps then they will pay a little more attention to how we can bolster TV's role in the nation's civic life. A very good start would be resisting any ill-informed siren calls to let that nice, supportive Mr Murdoch have a slice of our television cake.

      "body": "<p><strong> 13 February</strong> </p> <p> I get a call from my mate Max, who got a call from our mate Trevor, who got a call from Joe who was watching Sky. I have been nominated for an Oscar. </p> <p> <strong> 15 February</strong> </p> <p> Home. The buzzer rings and I let in a Fed Ex man. He comes bow-legged up our stairs with a huge box. It is a present from Universal Studios. I am delighted. This is pay day. The film has made about $100 million worldwide and I've not seen a penny, but now the famous largesse of Hollywood studios will act as some compensation. Now they realise my worth. </p> <p>I rip open the immense box, expecting a telly, a case of wine or something comparable. I discover a water pistol, some banana-flavoured Curious George chewable 'candy' and some dominoes. I wonder if the box was meant for Jamie Bell. I quickly calculate the combined value of the gifts and realise it is a small fraction of the cost of shipping. I tip out all the polystyrene stuffing in a vain search for a book token. Nothing, except a letter telling me the person who makes the shortest acceptance speech on the night will win a telly. </p> <p> <strong> 21 February</strong> </p> <p> Every single person I have met in the last week has asked what I will be wearing. What the fuck do they think I will be wearing? I tell people I will don a miner's lamp and carry a canary. No one finds this funny. I am approached by Angela who tells me she will help fix me up with some designer togs for the main event - she got a complete wardrobe for Guy Ritchie and the blokes from Snatch so I shouldn't be a problem. She says she'll be back in touch. </p> <p>I go home and give the box of toys to the children next door. Their excited faces drop when they pull out the banana-flavoured Curious George chewable 'candy', and they disappear without a thank you. </p> <p> <strong> 17 March</strong> </p> <p> Only a week to go. I suddenly realise I still have nothing to wear. I call Angela who explains that she has called all her usual designers. After the initial excitement that they have the opportunity to dress an Oscar nominee, they suddenly find themselves short on stock when they discover I am a writer. Maybe Oswald Boateng will do something at cost. I get excited until I realise exactly what Oswald will cost. While I'd love a proper Boateng suit, I get queasy about shelling out for a dinner jacket. Anyway, I'd have to go in for a fitting which is impossible as I am in Newcastle. </p> <p> <strong> 21 March</strong> </p> <p> I leave for LA tomorrow. I still have nothing to wear. I panic and go to an ex-hire shop. For 90 quid, I get a tin flute, bow tie and cummerbund. What's more, being 100 per cent polyester, it is creaseproof and stands up on its own. The proprietor warns me against naked flames. Talk to Stephen Daldry who tells me his filming is running over and he might not make it out. He will try to get there at the last minute. </p> <p> <strong> 22 March</strong> </p> <p> We fly to LA. There is a telly you can watch when you're on the bog. I have a gander at the local news. The stand outside the Oscars has fallen down and a few of the Mexican labourers are in intensive care. </p> <p> <strong> 24 March</strong> </p> <p> We discover a stretch limo has been booked to ferry us to the Universal nominees' party at Il Ceilo's. As we are getting into the limo, I see Il Ceilo's - it is right across the street. I realise that because of the one-way system, it would take about five minutes to get there by stretch limo - and about 30 seconds to walk. We decide to walk but agree not to tell the car company so the driver can get a full night's wages. </p> <p>At the party, I find Julie Walters and Jamie Bell. While I chat with Julie, Jamie works the room. One minute he is joshing with Russell Crowe, the next Julia Roberts is stroking his cheek. I get stuck with a part-time dentist who used to rewrite scripts for Roger Corman. He tells me we should collaborate on a script about football hooliganism. I take his card and promise to email. Jamie, by this point, has been invited to a party at DreamWorks. Even though I spent all last year writing a script for Mr Spielberg, I had no idea of this party's existence. Though Jamie insists I should come anyway, I decide to have an early night. </p> <p> <strong> 25 March</strong> </p> <p> The big day. Stephen Daldry arrives on a cargo plane from Frankfurt having only finished his filming at 7pm yesterday night. I wake at 11am and stick the TV on. ABC is running a 24-hour Oscar show. Apparently, people have been queuing for 11 days to sit on the stands to watch people go in. I fish around in my haversack and retrieve my DJ. It emerges completely uncreased. </p> <p>My girlfriend Christine and I go downstairs for the limo. The driver tells us that although the Shrine Auditorium is 15 minutes away there is an expected journey time of two hours. However, there is some lukewarm champagne in an 'Oscar box' in the back. We crack it open. As we get close to the auditorium, the traffic slows to a jam. I look out of the sunroof and see rows of limos four abreast stretching into infinity. Along the route, there are lines of fans waving banners. I see groups of bearded men with posters of Jamie Bell. Then groups of fundamentalist Christians with signs saying: 'Go to the Oscars, Burn in Hell.' I wind down my window to get a better look. A man in a devil suit shouts at me to 'repent now'. We move slowly past an indigent man with no teeth bearing a sign saying: 'Out of work - will do anything. Business cards accepted.' His hopeful look sends a shiver down my spine. I wind the window up and return to the hermetic world of over-indulgence and conspicuous privilege. </p> <p>We finally arrive. Unfortunately, we've got split up from Jamie and Julie but we can hear people screaming their names. After the metal detectors and the body search, we are ushered on to the red carpet, which is a sort of corral. We shuffle off inside and the tawdry reality of the event kicks in. The airy glitz of the cakewalk gives way to the gloom of the Shrine Auditorium foyer. Then you realise that while there may be, say, 100 stars here, maybe double that if you include the character actors, there are 6,000 neckbenders all aggressively jostling for canap\u00e9s and warm wine. I try to find Stephen and Jamie but it is impossible in the crush, so we take our seats. </p> <p>I have not had time to be nervous as the surface detail of the trip has been so diverting. Now it actually hits that there is a one-in-five chance that I will have to get up in front of a billion people and say something cogent, and I have not prepared a speech. I decide to go for the free TV so to calm my nerves I repeat the mantra: 'Thanks very much. Please send me the telly.' </p> <p>The ceremony starts. The usual twaddle but I am excited that I'll get to see Randy Newman. The first half-hour is remarkably pleasant, until I realise we are only on to Best Sound Design and there are 20 more categories to go. The speeches are interminable. Most winners have thrown caution to the wind and are thanking dead relatives and defiantly shouting over the band as it sweeps in to usher them off. I can take no more. I go off for a pee. The lobby is filled with disgruntled nominees drowning their sorrows or nervously sneaking off for a pee. I hurry back to discover I've missed Randy Newman. </p> <p>Several hours pass. Bj\u00f6rk comes off stage wearing a swan costume and sits in front of me. I am now beginning to get genuinely bored. Around the hall are several TV screens and you see how much better everything looks on telly. The rather scruffy reality is somehow transformed into glitz. </p> <p>Bob Dylan is announced and I sit up hopefully. Unfortunately, he is in Sydney. Before I know it, Tom Hanks is announcing my category. A camera is stuck in my face, but before I have time to be sick, Hanks reads out the name Cameron Crowe. Relief sweeps over me, accompanied by a vague sense that I'd been conned. How could I have taken it all so seriously? I'd even prepared a speech, for god's sake. </p> <p>Then off to the Governor's Ball. After Daldry has done sufficient networking, we all head off to the Vanity Fair party. Stephen immediately passes out and Jamie and I watch the party on the television. Just a few feet away, we could see impossibly hip people having the time of their lives - Tom Hanks, Puff Daddy, you name them - but we seemed stuck in another stationary stretch of limos. The driver thought it'd only be another half-hour and he'd have us in. </p> <p>Half an hour later, we decide to wake Stephen and risk walking. We fight our way through the crowds and get to the entrance. The security team bars our way. To my delight, Harvey Weinstein joins us in the queue and is also refused entry. Luckily, Stephen's friend Lucy knows one of the doormen from a club in New York and we are then ushered through. </p> <p>We stand like someone's parents at a teenage birthday party. I'm next to a tall black man who appears to be in drag. Jamie points out that this is Whitney Houston. Puff Daddy and Snoop Doggy Dog come over and give their 'respect' to Jamie, who handles it all with great aplomb. For some reason, Zoe Ball is there and also gives her respect to Jamie, but by this time we'd had had enough. We struggle to get out through the people struggling to get in and emerge into the night. </p> <p>The men with beards are there shouting for Jamie. We decide to ignore them. One bearded man tries to make a run for it, but is wrestled to the ground by security. The limo arrives and we all collapse into the hotel, exhausted. </p> <p>I wake promptly at five in the morning. The telly's still on and there is Stephen Daldry still at the party. I look across the room and my suit is standing in the corner. I vow that if I ever get nominated again I'll be doing it in front of the telly with a take-out curry. </p> <p> Lee Hall is adapting The Good Hope for the National Theatre and writing a screenplay for Company Pictures and Tom Hanks's company Playtone.</p>",

His main reason was concern about the effect on jobs in America, which has 4 per cent of the world's population and emits a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide. In Sweden, Ministers insisted that they would push ahead with or without the US. 'The Kyoto protocol is still alive, contrary to what has been said from the other side of the Atlantic,' said Sweden's Environment Minister, Kjell Larsson. 'No individual country has the right to declare a multilateral agreement dead.' The 1997 treaty calls for countries to agree on legally binding targets for curbing heat-trapping greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels.",

But two years ago her life was devastated when her 28-year-old son, Jonathan, hanged himself in a forest near her home. Bewildered and distraught, Gloag disappeared from public life and quit the company she founded. </p> <p>Now she is going back to her roots. She is swapping her Highland estate for a hospital in one of the world's poorest countries where she will treat Aids and cancer patients. </p> <p>Ann Gloag, 58, arrived yesterday in Benin to start working for Mercy Ships, a charity that provides ship-based hospitals offering free medical and dental care to some of the world's poorest people. She decided to take the unpaid job on the 12,000-tonne SS Anastasis, moored off Cotonou, after a visit to West Africa last year. </p> <p>Friends say she wants to 'start a new chapter' after 20 gruelling years which made her Britain's second-richest woman - only the Queen is wealthier - but which have cost her her marriage and, some say, the life of her son. </p> <p>'She is still deeply traumatised by Jonathan's death, but getting back to work is her way of getting on with life,' one said. 'It is her way, perhaps, of acknowledging what has happened and of starting again and showing that some benefit can come out of it all.' </p> <p>As she prepared to treat her first patient since she quit her job as a theatre nurse in Bridge of Earn hospital, near Perth, 20 years ago, Gloag said: 'I've been very fortunate in many ways. I enjoyed my years as a nurse. I enjoyed my years in business. Maybe if I can do something for these charities for a few years, it wouldn't be a bad idea.' </p> <p>She has donated \u00a34m of her fortune to buy a new hospital ship, the African Mercy, moored at Newcastle upon Tyne. She wants to raise \u00a315m to refit and equip the ship. 'For me it's quite a big challenge to buy this ship and see the conversion through. I think I'll get a real buzz the day they launch it.' </p> <p>It is more than a quarter of a century since Gloag began her nursing career at Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Her qualifications are now out of date, so she will spend this week carrying out basic duties, such as sterilising equipment or feeding undernourished babies so they are strong enough for surgery. </p> <p>Conditions on the boat could not be more different from life in 24-bedroom Beaufort Castle, the baronial seat of the Clan Fraser, which Gloag bought 10 years ago. Temperatures can reach 35C, with near 100 per cent humidity. Food and water on board are strictly rationed. </p> <p>During the day Gloag will treat Aids and cancer victims. Chronic eye infections, cataracts and cleft lips and palates are common. The ship has four operating theatres and beds for 100 patients. At night she will sleep in a bunk in quarters that also hold 400 doctors, nurses and crew. 'I am a terrible sailor, but I should be OK while the boat is moored,' she said. </p> <p>Her return to the wards is the latest chapter in the remarkable life of a woman born in poverty in Perth. She left Perth High School with no qualifications, but enrolled as a trainee nurse and rose to become a sister. She quit her job in 1980 and used her bus driver father's \u00a325,000 redundancy money to set up Stagecoach with her brother, Brian Souter. </p> <p>They exploited Tory legislation deregulating the bus industry to undercut rivals. As Stagecoach began expanding rapidly, she let nothing stand in her way - not even her husband. Robin Gloag was on the Stagecoach board when the company was set up, but she and Souter voted him off after repeated clashes. The couple later divorced. </p> <p>Gloag's ruthlessness earned her a \u00a3200m personal fortune which she spent lavishly. She holidayed with Richard Branson on his Caribbean island and drank Bollinger with Rupert Murdoch at his Christmas parties. She bought her yellow Bentley - registration 1Ann - from the Princess Royal. </p> <p>But the good life came to a tragic end on the night of 18 September 1999 when her son left his Perthshire home, walked a few miles towards his mother's home, tied a rope to a tree and hanged himself. The suicide of a young man with a wife, three sons and the prospect of a vast inheritance all but destroyed Gloag. As she put it on the wreath of white lilies she laid at his funeral: 'From your heartbroken mum, I loved you so much. Till the day dawns and the shadows flee away.' </p> <p>Afterwards she shunned all publicity. Friends say she was haunted by the thought that she could have prevented his death. 'She knew her son believed he could not live up to her success and she knew he had been badly affected by the divorce,' one said. 'She had all that money at her disposal, and was able to help complete strangers with her charitable instincts, but not Jonathan. </p> <p>'She is a driven woman. Even when her business tactics were being criticised, she was convinced she had done no wrong. But after Jonathan's death I think she felt - for the first time - as if she might have made a terrible mistake.' </p> <p>Last year she announced that she had had enough of big business and was quitting as executive director of Stagecoach. She was seen only a few times in public before she announced last week that she was going to Africa. </p> <p>The Anastasis will remain off the coast of Benin until May. During that time doctors hope to carry out more than 1,000 operations and provide dental treatment for 3,000 people.</p>",

      "body": "<p>LIKE PLOTTING Shakespearean dukes, the Anglican bishops ponder the affairs of the realm. The election must be in June, say York, Canterbury, Hereford and Carlisle, while Durham and Oxford plump for May. Quite why the timing is suddenly part of the ecclesiastical calendar is uncertain. Just as politicians would not presume to fix the date of the Church of England Synod meeting or the Nether Wallop parochial church-hall bring-and-buy sale, church leaders should have no leverage on when the country goes to the polls. Still, you have to admire their opportunism.</p> <p>Tony Blair had barely finished his speech to the Christian Socialist Movement, in which he advocated power and influence for faith-based groups, before the bishops, their flocks decimated by forces more pernicious than foot and mouth, invoked this proffered clout. The Prime Minister might not have meant his call for government tie-ups with religious bodies to be interpreted quite so literally, but once you start rendering unto God those things that used to be Caesar's, odd mutations follow.</p> <p>The perils of mixing religion and politics are already apparent in the United States, where George W. Bush's plan to channel government aid to faith-based groups has stalled amid internecine rivalry on the religious Right and concern elsewhere about the spectre of taxpayers funding the Rev Sun Myung Moon's sexual abstinence programme in schools. Fusing private faith and public policy is rarely wise.</p> <p>William Hague's attempt to annexe the religious vote is not a worry. His unworkable plan, based on the thinking of the Bush bible-basher, Marvin Olasky, to hand over parts of the welfare state to church groups, was pure expediency. Hague is to high theology what Heddon-on-the-Wall pigswill is to River Caf\u00e9 minestrone, which makes his never-to-be-implemented brand of God-bothering wholly unthreatening. Blair's Christianity, genuine and heartfelt, is more disturbing, despite, or because of, the fact that he has no need to court the religious vote. He already has it in the bag. There was no overt zealotry in a sermon acknowledging the good work done by some faith groups and promising them a greater role in health projects and work with the young and the elderly, with offenders and ex-offenders.</p> <p>But if the language was careful, the aim was not so different from Hague's. The Conservatives' God squad would substitute for state agencies, while Labour's volunteers will be partners. Many, like MP Martin O'Neill, worry legitimately about funding being skewed towards religious groups, about possible job discrimination between believers and non-believers and about services being delivered with a side order of preaching. As for the planned proliferation of church schools, Blair should know better than most people that parents are seduced not by 'moral emphasis' but by the un-Christian wish that their kids get a better education than everyone else's.</p> <p>BLAIR'S SUBTEXT, including the implicit and erroneous notion that religion has a monopoly on altruism, is equally disturbing. As he also made clear, his religious faith is indivisible from his political judgment. Or, as he put it: 'Politics without values is sheer pragmatism .The two must go together.' Only up to a point. Religion, as David Hume argued against the consensus of eighteenth-century deists, is not rationally based but bound up in our emotional responses to life's glitches. Thus, when Euan Blair was found drunk in Leicester Square, his father reread 'The Village Church' and mused on God and how 'for thine own purpose, thou has sent/ the strife and the discouragement'.</p> <p>One imagines that, with each heaven-dispensed dose of S&amp;D, from the Hindujas to foot and mouth, the Downing Street copy of Longfellow becomes ever more thumbed. Although Blair affects to be a scholarly theologian lurching between the (perfectly compatible) natural law theories of Thomas Aquinas and the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, he appears more at home with comfort-blanket Christianity. Like other forms of private succour, such as Valium, Horlicks or a litre tub of chocolate-chip ice-cream, religion has limited use in the public domain.</p> <p>Faith, as Hume understood but Blair may not, takes off at the point where logic stops. For that reason alone, religion is the least useful spanner in the political toolbox. Piety is not, as Blair suggests, synonymous with values. In addition, for such an events-driven Prime Minister to claim that religion is a prescription against pragmatism is as specious as his suggestion that lack of faith has led to national cynicism. Voters are sceptical now not because they had too little belief in what this government might deliver but because they had too much.</p> <p>However, you do not have to be very cynical to worry about the social tinkering enshrined in Blair's paean to religion, to marriage and to community; a holy trinity that acquired a new legitimacy last week, when Robert Putnam, the latest Labour guru (and the occupant of this slot last week), arrived for breakfast at Downing Street, puffed up on the stupendous banality that attaches to being what Bryan Appleyard breathlessly calls 'the most influential academic in the world today'.</p> <p>The Putnam doctrine is a lament for the decline of faith-based and civic groups and for the demise of community. Blair is impressed. But why? We might as well bemoan the fact that we no longer aspire to be like Barney and Betty Rubble from The Flintstones. Community, like marriage, is often anachronistic and always over-romanticised. From the Mafia to the Krays, from the Ku Klux Klan to the juvenile knife gangs of Peckham, society's most destructive forces are imbued with the warm glow of community and tribalism.</p> <p>Inclusive groups are, de facto, exclusive, too, and the traditional outsiders are women, the carers and nurturers whose efforts allowed men to construct sub-communities based round the office, the pub, the Freemasons, the golf course or the 10-pin bowling club whose demise gave Putnam his Albert Camus meets David Vine book title of Bowling Alone .</p> <p>WHAT HE FAILS to see is that society is evolving away from old, faith-based communities not because of malign pressures but because people don't want to stay in Claustrophobia Mansions with the vicar and an extended family presiding over their lives. The Putnam dream has not been squandered but spurned by a generation to whom Labour's fondness for this reheated mush must seem barely comprehensible.</p> <p>Six years have passed since the first wave of communitarian waffle, peddled by Amitai Etzioni, percolated Labour thinking. Etzioni's credentials were clonishly similar to Putnam's. He, too, was a distinguished American academic, beloved of Bill Clinton, admired by Blair and, according to his publishers, an influential force in the rewriting of Clause IV.</p> <p>Whether or not that is so, it is certain that the ubiquitous mantra of 'rights and responsibilities' tracks back to Etzioni, whose contribution evoked some puzzlement from the outset. It seemed doubtful then that an anti-liberal, authoritarian movement uncluttered by worries over civil rights or individual autonomy, could ever take root in a Labour government answerable to a secular society.</p> <p>It could. A parliamentary term on, we have an Identikit guru and yesterday's gospel of faith-based communitarianism rehashed for tomorrow's election. Who can blame the bishops for calling the date when politicians are busy dressing up dodgy social engineering as eternal verity?</p>",

Tony Blair had barely finished his speech to the Christian Socialist Movement, in which he advocated power and influence for faith-based groups, before the bishops, their flocks decimated by forces more pernicious than foot and mouth, invoked this proffered clout. The Prime Minister might not have meant his call for government tie-ups with religious bodies to be interpreted quite so literally, but once you start rendering unto God those things that used to be Caesar's, odd mutations follow. The perils of mixing religion and politics are already apparent in the United States, where George W. Bush's plan to channel government aid to faith-based groups has stalled amid internecine rivalry on the religious Right and concern elsewhere about the spectre of taxpayers funding the Rev Sun Myung Moon's sexual abstinence programme in schools. Fusing private faith and public policy is rarely wise. William Hague's attempt to annexe the religious vote is not a worry. His unworkable plan, based on the thinking of the Bush bible-basher, Marvin Olasky, to hand over parts of the welfare state to church groups, was pure expediency. Hague is to high theology what Heddon-on-the-Wall pigswill is to River Caf\u00e9 minestrone, which makes his never-to-be-implemented brand of God-bothering wholly unthreatening. Blair's Christianity, genuine and heartfelt, is more disturbing, despite, or because of, the fact that he has no need to court the religious vote. He already has it in the bag. There was no overt zealotry in a sermon acknowledging the good work done by some faith groups and promising them a greater role in health projects and work with the young and the elderly, with offenders and ex-offenders. But if the language was careful, the aim was not so different from Hague's. The Conservatives' God squad would substitute for state agencies, while Labour's volunteers will be partners. Many, like MP Martin O'Neill, worry legitimately about funding being skewed towards religious groups, about possible job discrimination between believers and non-believers and about services being delivered with a side order of preaching. As for the planned proliferation of church schools, Blair should know better than most people that parents are seduced not by 'moral emphasis' but by the un-Christian wish that their kids get a better education than everyone else's. BLAIR'S SUBTEXT, including the implicit and erroneous notion that religion has a monopoly on altruism, is equally disturbing. As he also made clear, his religious faith is indivisible from his political judgment. Or, as he put it: 'Politics without values is sheer pragmatism .The two must go together.' Only up to a point. Religion, as David Hume argued against the consensus of eighteenth-century deists, is not rationally based but bound up in our emotional responses to life's glitches. Thus, when Euan Blair was found drunk in Leicester Square, his father reread 'The Village Church' and mused on God and how 'for thine own purpose, thou has sent/ the strife and the discouragement'. One imagines that, with each heaven-dispensed dose of S&amp;D, from the Hindujas to foot and mouth, the Downing Street copy of Longfellow becomes ever more thumbed. Although Blair affects to be a scholarly theologian lurching between the (perfectly compatible) natural law theories of Thomas Aquinas and the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, he appears more at home with comfort-blanket Christianity. Like other forms of private succour, such as Valium, Horlicks or a litre tub of chocolate-chip ice-cream, religion has limited use in the public domain. Faith, as Hume understood but Blair may not, takes off at the point where logic stops. For that reason alone, religion is the least useful spanner in the political toolbox. Piety is not, as Blair suggests, synonymous with values. In addition, for such an events-driven Prime Minister to claim that religion is a prescription against pragmatism is as specious as his suggestion that lack of faith has led to national cynicism. Voters are sceptical now not because they had too little belief in what this government might deliver but because they had too much. However, you do not have to be very cynical to worry about the social tinkering enshrined in Blair's paean to religion, to marriage and to community; a holy trinity that acquired a new legitimacy last week, when Robert Putnam, the latest Labour guru (and the occupant of this slot last week), arrived for breakfast at Downing Street, puffed up on the stupendous banality that attaches to being what Bryan Appleyard breathlessly calls 'the most influential academic in the world today'. The Putnam doctrine is a lament for the decline of faith-based and civic groups and for the demise of community. Blair is impressed. But why? We might as well bemoan the fact that we no longer aspire to be like Barney and Betty Rubble from The Flintstones. Community, like marriage, is often anachronistic and always over-romanticised. From the Mafia to the Krays, from the Ku Klux Klan to the juvenile knife gangs of Peckham, society's most destructive forces are imbued with the warm glow of community and tribalism. Inclusive groups are, de facto, exclusive, too, and the traditional outsiders are women, the carers and nurturers whose efforts allowed men to construct sub-communities based round the office, the pub, the Freemasons, the golf course or the 10-pin bowling club whose demise gave Putnam his Albert Camus meets David Vine book title of Bowling Alone . WHAT HE FAILS to see is that society is evolving away from old, faith-based communities not because of malign pressures but because people don't want to stay in Claustrophobia Mansions with the vicar and an extended family presiding over their lives. The Putnam dream has not been squandered but spurned by a generation to whom Labour's fondness for this reheated mush must seem barely comprehensible. Six years have passed since the first wave of communitarian waffle, peddled by Amitai Etzioni, percolated Labour thinking. Etzioni's credentials were clonishly similar to Putnam's. He, too, was a distinguished American academic, beloved of Bill Clinton, admired by Blair and, according to his publishers, an influential force in the rewriting of Clause IV. Whether or not that is so, it is certain that the ubiquitous mantra of 'rights and responsibilities' tracks back to Etzioni, whose contribution evoked some puzzlement from the outset. It seemed doubtful then that an anti-liberal, authoritarian movement uncluttered by worries over civil rights or individual autonomy, could ever take root in a Labour government answerable to a secular society. It could. A parliamentary term on, we have an Identikit guru and yesterday's gospel of faith-based communitarianism rehashed for tomorrow's election. Who can blame the bishops for calling the date when politicians are busy dressing up dodgy social engineering as eternal verity?",

At no little cost, the pugnacious publisher of the Barclay brothers' newspaper titles has installed nothing less than a duplicate of the computer system that produces Sunday Business back in Blighty. Now our Andrew doesn't even have to come into the office to meddle with the paper's production - he can do it from 800 miles away. Probably good news for all concerned. </p> <p><strong> Jay-ded memories</strong><br>Auntie Beeb must have thought she was on to a winner when it came to covering the Maxwell report. After all, Peter Jay, the Beeb's economics editor, was the fat fraudster's right-hand man before he went skinny dipping in the Atlantic. But strangely enough, Jay declined invitations to share his Cap'n Bob stories. </p> <p><strong>Price of a promise</strong><br>An ad in the FT for PricewaterhouseCoopers' Business Recovery Service team boasted: 'Our professionals have helped more companies and their financiers through this challenging process than anyone else.' The ad was below an article on the Maxwell report stating: 'Coopers &amp; Lybrand - now part of PwC - which audited Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers, is heavily criticised'. The ad urges readers: 'Whatever your ambitions, why not contact us and find out how we can help you achieve them.' Diary suggests readers ring PwC and try the following. 'I am a crooked media tycoon with a cashflow problem...' </p> <p><strong> Maff off</strong><br>It is Diary's civic duty to point out that the phone number for Maff's Northern Region press office in Cumbria - the epicentre of the foot and mouth disease - published in the Government Information Directory is wrong. And poor Dennis Butler, a Carlisle senior citizen, isn't happy. 'I've had four calls today,' Butler wails. 'It's only 9.30am. I'm a civil man, but enough is enough.' So Diary launches a Mirroresque campaign to help. The right number is 01228 640369. We thank you. </p> <p><strong> Give him a gong</strong><br>Big thanks to Diary's great friend, Sun City editor Ian 'trust my column' King. For it was Ian who found the gong awarded to Observer Sport Monthly at last month's Press Gazette awards some time after it parted company with the mag's ed, Matt Tench. With the sort of probity you would expect from a top tipster, King handed the award to the event's sponsor, Diageo, 'for safe-keeping'. The drinks giant has now made contact with Tench to reunite him with the award. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:media.diary@observer.co.uk\">media.diary@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Marje and the aliens Diary's four readers (up a soaraway 33 per cent on last month) are used to treating its stories with huge pinches of salt, and this one is no exception. Having bet the farm on developing Pearson's internet potential only to find the City has lost its thirst for dotcommery, Marje Scardino wants out, apparently. A 'top' source, ahem, says AOL/ Time Warner is keen to secure her talents. There is even wild talk of Marje helping AOL buy the FT. Next week in the bonkers story corner: Aliens found running a webzine on the moon. In a B52 bomber. Toujours in charge Avid Diary reader Andrew Neil is making improvements to his villa in the south of France. At no little cost, the pugnacious publisher of the Barclay brothers' newspaper titles has installed nothing less than a duplicate of the computer system that produces Sunday Business back in Blighty. Now our Andrew doesn't even have to come into the office to meddle with the paper's production - he can do it from 800 miles away. Probably good news for all concerned. Jay-ded memories Auntie Beeb must have thought she was on to a winner when it came to covering the Maxwell report. After all, Peter Jay, the Beeb's economics editor, was the fat fraudster's right-hand man before he went skinny dipping in the Atlantic. But strangely enough, Jay declined invitations to share his Cap'n Bob stories. Price of a promise An ad in the FT for PricewaterhouseCoopers' Business Recovery Service team boasted: 'Our professionals have helped more companies and their financiers through this challenging process than anyone else.' The ad was below an article on the Maxwell report stating: 'Coopers &amp; Lybrand - now part of PwC - which audited Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers, is heavily criticised'. The ad urges readers: 'Whatever your ambitions, why not contact us and find out how we can help you achieve them.' Diary suggests readers ring PwC and try the following. 'I am a crooked media tycoon with a cashflow problem...' Maff off It is Diary's civic duty to point out that the phone number for Maff's Northern Region press office in Cumbria - the epicentre of the foot and mouth disease - published in the Government Information Directory is wrong. And poor Dennis Butler, a Carlisle senior citizen, isn't happy. 'I've had four calls today,' Butler wails. 'It's only 9.30am. I'm a civil man, but enough is enough.' So Diary launches a Mirroresque campaign to help. The right number is 01228 640369. We thank you. Give him a gong Big thanks to Diary's great friend, Sun City editor Ian 'trust my column' King. For it was Ian who found the gong awarded to Observer Sport Monthly at last month's Press Gazette awards some time after it parted company with the mag's ed, Matt Tench. With the sort of probity you would expect from a top tipster, King handed the award to the event's sponsor, Diageo, 'for safe-keeping'. The drinks giant has now made contact with Tench to reunite him with the award. media.diary@observer.co.uk",

Now 35, and with more controversy behind him than any of his Fleet Street peers, the act is wearing thin. </p> <p>Morgan has so far survived the Slickergate shares scandal, although he awaits the verdict of the Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into allegations that he and others under his command bought shares in companies that were then ramped in the Mirror's City pages. An internal Mirror inquiry cleared Morgan of wrongdoing and his management stood resolutely behind him when the Press Complaints Commission found that he had broken both the letter and the spirit of the editors' code of conduct. </p> <p>That Morgan remains in charge is, say his supporters at the paper, testimony to his excellence as a tabloid editor and a reflection of the dearth of national newspaper experience within Trinity Mirror, the Mirror's publisher. 'When Piers is on song, he is the best editor in the country,' says one of his senior lieutenants. 'His instincts can be superb, he is popular with the staff and he has brought the Mirror back to life.' Morgan is too good to let go, whatever his flaws, they say. </p> <p>Until recently, this view that went almost unchallenged. Morgan's eclectic blend of worthy campaigns, celebrity news, occasional scoops and loyalist New Labour politics had halted the Mirror's seemingly remorseless circulation decline. </p> <p>Revitalised by the brief reign of his former mentor, Kelvin MacKenzie, as head of newspapers at the old Mirror Group, Morgan tried to steer the Mirror away from head-to-head competition with the Sun and carve out a new niche: a tabloid with heart. </p> <p>Now, however, the brief respite provided by limited circulation success has been replaced by a fresh circulation war. Morgan and his management masters are under attack from all sides, and the strains are evident. Sales in January and February have slipped year on year, and below the surface of the headline figures the picture is even more alarming. Last month, full-price sales of the Mirror were just over 1.5 million (almost exactly half the Sun's full-price sales and 600,000 behind the Daily Mail), compared with a headline figure of 2.212 million. </p> <p>The Mirror's problems are manifold. At the bottom end of its market it is threatened by the resurgence of the Star, the only Express Group title to have responded positively to Richard Desmond's ownership. At the top end it faces the relentless rise of the Daily Mail and a daily battle with the Sun. Layer on top of that the extra threat posed by a celebrity-filled Daily Express, however enfeebled, and the Mirror faces the mother of all battles. The question is whether Trinity Mirror has the stomach for the fight. </p> <p>'There is a very real and depressing possibility that the Mirror will end up like the Express - slipping away year after year because its owners lack the wherewithal or the courage to do anything other than run it for cash,' says one media analyst. 'It can, as the Express has done, survive that way for years, but it is hard to see it reversing the trend against such committed and highly professional rivals as News International and Associated Newspapers.' </p> <p>At the same time, Morgan has faced mounting criticism from his rivals for a lack of judgment and for his often craven support for the New Labour government. </p> <p>'Piers can, on occasions, get things brilliantly right. But too often, far too often, he misfires,' says one editor. </p> <p>Critics point to Morgan's 'worthy eccentricities' as proof that he is as likely to confuse as entertain his core readers. In the final week of the US election, the Mirror decided to highlight the plight of death-row Texans: an issue unlikely to shift copies off the newsstand in a market where a good celebrity splash can put on more than 50,000 sales. His closeness to Alastair Campbell has also caused irritation, both within and outside the paper. </p> <p>With an election campaign drawing closer, the Mirror's determined cheerleading becomes more strident. An interview with Keith Vaz, the highly criticised Minister for Europe, becomes a stout defence. Partisan political coverage is nothing new in British newspapers, and the derision of his peers will count for nothing: what matters to Morgan is the Mirror's circulation, and his ability to affect it positively. </p> <p>And that is where his real challenge lies. An editor, no matter how brilliant, can only be as successful as his managers allow. Trinity Mirror has a track record of excellence in regional newspapers. It is the largest newspaper publisher in the country and the second largest in Europe. But it lacks a senior manager with any experience of the national newspaper market. Morgan has nowhere, internally, to turn for advice. Strategically, Trinity Mirror must decide how much of its hard-earned profits can be invested in fighting the Mirror's corner - especially since its other two national titles, the People and the Sunday Mirror, are in steady long-term decline. </p> <p>For a public company with restless investors it is an uncomfortable choice - and not unlike that faced by Lord Stevens at the Express when he contemplated the prospect of fighting the Mail pound for pound and reader for reader.

Asylum and immigration Fear of being out-Widdecombed has seen the Government fail to explain clearly to the public the case for a principled stand on Britain's international obligations. Should do better. 'Ethical foreign policy' Robin Cook claims he never said the above words - he certainly never explained what they meant. The Kosovo war was the biggest risk taken in the first term but not regulating the arms trade left room for charges of hypocrisy. Football 'Have you noticed how we only win the World Cup under a Labour government?' said Harold Wilson. But failure in France 98 and Euro 2000 can't be covered up by a few golds in Sydney. Maybe Delivery, Delivery, Delivery The test of a second term will be whether Labour can improve schools and hospitals. For all the controversies about sticking to Tory spending plans for two years, departments have struggled to allocate cash now free. New Politics 'Are you a control freak or a pluralist?' as Paddy Ashdown asked after Blair spurned marriage in favour of casual sex. Devolution has been delivered, albeit marred by trying to hold on too strong. Only a more relaxed second term would give Labour the creativity to renew itself in office. Europe Hard decisions can't be evaded. A euro referendum would be New Labour's biggest risk but would define Blair's place in history.",

February After 16 months back in, the curse of the Dome finally catches up with Mandelson. He's out for the second time - this time for good? Blair visits US President George W Bush after bombing Baghdad. They have the same taste in toothpaste, so leadership of the free world seems safe. PM sets out second-term vision of 'a Britain which breaks down barriers to opportunity'. Yet another food crisis as foot-and-mouth disease strikes. March Hague uncovers secret Labour 'plot' to turn Britain into 'a foreign land' - 'we will give you your country back.' Brown opens - or half-opens - the war chest with a family-friendly Budget.

The Guardian Then: Key role in exposing Tory sleaze but New Labour likes to kick against its 'critical friend'. Now: Will back Labour again but would prefer a bolder second term. Key issue: Public services. The Independent Then: First electoral endorsement - broadly backing Blair, but also some LibDems and Europhile Tories. Now: Likely to be much harsher on Hague than Major, and more critical of New Labour. Expect another composite endorsement. Key issue: The case for Europe. The Independent on Sunday Then: Backed Labour with anti-Tory tactical voting. Now: May flirt with LibDems but probably not Alastair Campbell*s biggest concern. Key issue: Apathy. Financial Times Then: Backed Labour in 1997 - citing, as part of its rationale, irrational Tory Euroscepticism. Now: Labour should retain an endorsement valued more for its boost to credibility than votes. Key issue: It*s the economy, stupid. Daily Express and Daily Express Then: Both Express titles backed Major in 1997 but switched to Blair after election. Now: New owner Richard Desmond has pledged to stick to Labour but depleted political team will be competing with the celebs from OK!. Key issue: How will Posh *n* Becks vote? Tory-leaning papers Daily Mail Then: Tory to its bootstraps but anger at John Major meant a mostly Eurosceptic campaign in 1997. Now: Happier with Hague: Labour has sold out on family values and thinks Jack Straw has gone soft on crime. Key issue: Euroscepticism - and asylum soft touch. Mail on Sunday Then: Backed Major without much conviction. Now: Right-wing columnist Peter Hitchens, who argues that New Labour wants to turn Britain into a one-party state, will help to influence the editorial line. Key issue: New Labour arrogance. The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph Then: Found case for Tory fifth term 'overwhelming'. Now: Outraged by New Labour, from fox-hunting to Europe, but will keep close eye on Tory internal politics. Key issue: Euroscepticism. The Sunday Times Then: A strongly partisan campaign in 1997 endorsed the Tories 'warts and all'. Now: Unhappy with New Labour but moderate Tory editor John Witherow feels Hague is a huge letdown too. Key issue: Which is the lesser of two evils? The Times Then: Endorsed Eurosceptics including Sir James Goldsmith, Tony Benn, Diane Abbott and LibDem Nick Harvey. Now: Will combine acerbic Eurosceptic commentary with fairly straight news and keep its powder dry until the final week. A key battleground for Portillistas and Hagueites if Tories are in trouble. Key issue: Euroscepticism. Famous election ambushes Daily Mail 1924: The Zinoviev Letter As Labour's first-ever Government went to the polls, the Daily Mail produced 'evidence' that it was in league with Russian spies. A forgery - but the Tories won. Daily Mirror 1951: Whose Finger on the trigger? Churchill may have won the war, but the shock Mirror splash argued he was too much of a maverick for the nuclear age. It didn't save a tired Attlee Government - Labour won most votes, but the Tories had a majority. The Sun 1992: Nightmare on Kinnock Street Pages of anti-Welsh diatribes and dystopian fantasies intended as a history lesson for those too young to remember 1979. It was the Sun 'wot won it' they crowed. The Observer 1997: Portillo: Was it 'the Obs wot won it'? A constituency-based poll on the final Sunday showed how tactical voting could bring about Tory defeats. Labour won from third place in a number of seats.",

But the voter also needs to examine two key aspects of the result.</p> <p>First, the majority: more than 120 would be a vindication of the last four years; under 40 would be a severe jolt to the system. Second, the turnout: if one in five Labour voters doesn't bother to vote, the party could lose 60 marginal seats.</p> <p>For Hague the plus points are harder to nail down - Europe works well for some, the asylum issue for others - but he has been criticised for failing to map out a coherent Tory philosophy. He will have done well if he produces any evidence, however slim, of a fightback. If Labour's majority falls below 60, Hague is almost guaranteed another election; if it stays above 100, it's probably curtains.</p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats, Charles Kennedy will need to hold on to what he's got and try and position the party in second place in as many seats as possible for the big push in 2005. As ever it will be a messy, bloody affair, with weeks of claims and rebuttals, statistics and dirty tactics. Keep your wits about you and use our guide to unpick the political spin.</p> <p><b>The Battleground</b></p> <p><b> Labour</b></p> <p>Winning will not be enough for Tony Blair. A working majority of 30 or 40 will seem as much of a setback as the achievement of an unprecedented second Labour term. The apparent inevitability of victory may cost Labour votes and seats. New Labour was built on the belief that the secret of success was to keep expectations in check - but perhaps the party should resist the temptation to view its accidental landslide as a millstone. It provides the foundation to win big again, which may be essential to Labour's historic ambitions.</p> <p><b>Secure the Second Term</b> The Blairite mantra since 1997. Having secured the trust to govern, the promise is of a radicalism developed in office. Accounts of the Thatcher second and third terms have been much-thumbed in Downing St.</p> <p><b>Get the voters out - keep turnout above 65 per cent</b> Labour's real opposition is apathy. What seems a predictable re-election may well see turnout below 1997's 70 per cent historic low. Every percentage point below that could cost Labour 10-15 seats.</p> <p><b>Prepare to win on the euro</b> The Government's recommendation on the euro may be up to two years away, but Gordon Brown's sixth test is whether or not Labour can risk it. In this campaign, Labour will focus on people's right to vote on the euro later. But Labour will want a majority of at least 70-80 to feel confident of turning public opinion around.</p> <p><b>But ... the Labour Left would prefer a smaller majority.</b> Mark Seddon, editor of Tribune, thinks a majority of around 30 would mean a return to 'proper politics'.</p> <p><b> Conservatives</b></p> <p>Even if William Hague matches the party's record postwar swing (5.2 per cent), Labour would still expect a comfortable majority of up to 50 seats. He may always have seen the Conservative recovery as a two-term task, but will need to survive a highly personalised campaign to get another shot. What used to be Europe's most ruthless and formidable election-winning party will demand real progress.</p> <p><b>Save Hague - by cutting Labour majority to 70</b> A Labour majority of under 60 would certainly save Hague. In the danger-zone, between 60 and 100, much will depend on whether anybody wants to take the job on. Hague will certainly need to do better than Neil Kinnock did with his first shot in 1987 - a 1.7 per cent swing which failed to prevent the Tories winning another three-figure majority.</p> <p><b>Except ... for those Shadow Cabinet rivals who think they could do better.</b> <br></p> <p><b>Kill off the euro</b> A recovery in Tory fortunes would increase the chances of Labour ducking the issue. But the dream Conservative scenario is for the party to fight and win a 'Keep the Pound' campaign. <b>Except for the Tory Europhiles.</b></p> <p><b>Win the English election - a swing of 7.6 per cent</b> Having accepted devolution, Hague hopes to make constitutional mischief with a 'English votes for English laws' call. If he can take all the English seats up to Erewash in Derbyshire, he will have a majority in England. But that requires a 7.6 per cent swing from Labour and a Tory lead of 2.2 per cent.</p> <p><b>Win seats in Scotland and Wales</b> Any serious Conservative attempt to win a future election cannot just be an English strategy. Recovering all of the last 10 Scottish and six Welsh seats lost in 1997 is highly unlikely - but the Conservatives need to show they can win back 'Middle Scotland' in Eastwood, Edinburgh Pentlands and Perth, and gain a foothold in Wales, if they want to go beyond limiting the damage to challenging for power.</p> <p><b> Liberal Democrats</b></p> <p>With 'the project' of closer Labour ties stalled and no prospect of overtaking even the Tories, Charles Kennedy again faces the perennial question 'What are the LibDems for?'. The party will fight a defensive campaign to hold its south-west gains, but nationally needs a more edgy liberal and youth-focused campaign if it is to restore a sense of purpose in its ranks.</p> <p><b>Hold their 1997 gains </b> Having won 26 extra seats in 1997 without increasing their vote, the LibDems will be mostly defending ground won. The south-west is the key battleground, where they defend 14 seats, having gained six last time.</p> <p><b>Increase share of first-time and young voters </b> The LibDems held steady last time while voters under 30 switched heavily - on a 17 per cent swing - from Conservative to Labour. Student loans and liberal principles should make this fertile ground against Labour in power.</p> <p><b>Develop an urban presence </b> In their various guises, Liberal parties have always fallen back severely whenever Tory oppositions recover. Kennedy will also be looking to develop the ability to win by-elections against Labour in its urban heartlands if things turn sour for Blair.</p>",

As ever it will be a messy, bloody affair, with weeks of claims and rebuttals, statistics and dirty tactics. Keep your wits about you and use our guide to unpick the political spin. The Battleground Labour Winning will not be enough for Tony Blair. A working majority of 30 or 40 will seem as much of a setback as the achievement of an unprecedented second Labour term. The apparent inevitability of victory may cost Labour votes and seats. New Labour was built on the belief that the secret of success was to keep expectations in check - but perhaps the party should resist the temptation to view its accidental landslide as a millstone. It provides the foundation to win big again, which may be essential to Labour's historic ambitions. Secure the Second Term The Blairite mantra since 1997. Having secured the trust to govern, the promise is of a radicalism developed in office. Accounts of the Thatcher second and third terms have been much-thumbed in Downing St. Get the voters out - keep turnout above 65 per cent Labour's real opposition is apathy. What seems a predictable re-election may well see turnout below 1997's 70 per cent historic low. Every percentage point below that could cost Labour 10-15 seats. Prepare to win on the euro The Government's recommendation on the euro may be up to two years away, but Gordon Brown's sixth test is whether or not Labour can risk it. In this campaign, Labour will focus on people's right to vote on the euro later. But Labour will want a majority of at least 70-80 to feel confident of turning public opinion around. But ... the Labour Left would prefer a smaller majority. Mark Seddon, editor of Tribune, thinks a majority of around 30 would mean a return to 'proper politics'. Conservatives Even if William Hague matches the party's record postwar swing (5.2 per cent), Labour would still expect a comfortable majority of up to 50 seats. He may always have seen the Conservative recovery as a two-term task, but will need to survive a highly personalised campaign to get another shot. What used to be Europe's most ruthless and formidable election-winning party will demand real progress. Save Hague - by cutting Labour majority to 70 A Labour majority of under 60 would certainly save Hague. In the danger-zone, between 60 and 100, much will depend on whether anybody wants to take the job on. Hague will certainly need to do better than Neil Kinnock did with his first shot in 1987 - a 1.7 per cent swing which failed to prevent the Tories winning another three-figure majority. Except ... for those Shadow Cabinet rivals who think they could do better. Kill off the euro A recovery in Tory fortunes would increase the chances of Labour ducking the issue. But the dream Conservative scenario is for the party to fight and win a 'Keep the Pound' campaign. Except for the Tory Europhiles. Win the English election - a swing of 7.6 per cent Having accepted devolution, Hague hopes to make constitutional mischief with a 'English votes for English laws' call. If he can take all the English seats up to Erewash in Derbyshire, he will have a majority in England. But that requires a 7.6 per cent swing from Labour and a Tory lead of 2.2 per cent. Win seats in Scotland and Wales Any serious Conservative attempt to win a future election cannot just be an English strategy. Recovering all of the last 10 Scottish and six Welsh seats lost in 1997 is highly unlikely - but the Conservatives need to show they can win back 'Middle Scotland' in Eastwood, Edinburgh Pentlands and Perth, and gain a foothold in Wales, if they want to go beyond limiting the damage to challenging for power. Liberal Democrats With 'the project' of closer Labour ties stalled and no prospect of overtaking even the Tories, Charles Kennedy again faces the perennial question 'What are the LibDems for?'. The party will fight a defensive campaign to hold its south-west gains, but nationally needs a more edgy liberal and youth-focused campaign if it is to restore a sense of purpose in its ranks. Hold their 1997 gains Having won 26 extra seats in 1997 without increasing their vote, the LibDems will be mostly defending ground won. The south-west is the key battleground, where they defend 14 seats, having gained six last time. Increase share of first-time and young voters The LibDems held steady last time while voters under 30 switched heavily - on a 17 per cent swing - from Conservative to Labour. Student loans and liberal principles should make this fertile ground against Labour in power. Develop an urban presence In their various guises, Liberal parties have always fallen back severely whenever Tory oppositions recover. Kennedy will also be looking to develop the ability to win by-elections against Labour in its urban heartlands if things turn sour for Blair.",

Blair's claim that, in the 'knowledge economy' social justice and economic prosperity now go together, may see the Government needing to spend more to lock in economic growth: raising productivity will depend on tackling the poor quality of the country's infrastructure and improving the workforce's skills base.",

      "body": "<p>Middle England is patronised as well as pampered. Focus groupies and market researchers strain to probe and manipulate its passions. \u00c9lite politicians and pundits drop their aitches and pose as its tribunes. What's left of the Left confirms its impotence by moaning from the sidelines about a wretched political system driven by the imperative to do nothing that might upset Worcester Women and Mondeo Men as they raise 2.5 children in pebble-dashed houses.</p> <p>Middle Englanders are animated by doltish complacency and irrational fears. Gestures on asylum and crime are created to placate them. They are a greedy, rootless tribe who don't give a damn for public services and the common good. Their acquiesence can be bought with a few tax cuts and cheaper petrol. These are the last people on the planet you would expect to revolt against the Private Finance Initiative. To be honest, you wouldn't expect them to have heard of the Private Finance Initiative. Yet, marvellously, Worcestershire is defying every slander and is in open, furious rebellion. There is a fair chance that it will return one of the few independent MPs to be elected since 1945 because it can't stand what Gordon Brown has done to the NHS.</p> <p>The candidate, Richard Taylor, is the most refreshing and unlikely politician I've met. The 66-year-old retired rheumatologist holds a quaint belief in the power of democracy to challenge the status quo. New Labour MPs who triangulated with Old Tories, and Old Tories who triangulated with New Labour, lost that years ago and are greeting the prospect that he may well take the Wyre Forest seat with incomprehending panic. The game of British politics isn't meant to produce results like that. Independents are meant to be eccentrics who are lucky if they can save their deposits.</p> <p>Taylor never wanted to be an MP. He left Kidderminster Hospital after 23 years' service with the expectation that he would fill his days by indulging his passions for classic cars and ornithology. He was transformed from a retiring twitcher to avenging angel by what should have been a nugget of cheering news. In 1997 Tony Blair pledged that if he came to power he would build a new hospital in Worcester. Political junkies will remember that Worcester women were all the rage at the time. They were the English version of Bill Clinton's soccer mums; aspiring types who didn't like paying taxes but worried about the state of the schools and hospitals.</p> <p>They had plenty to worry about. For decades, pretty much everyone who needed treatment in Worcester had complained that the infirmary was split across ancient buildings on three sites. A new hospital had been promised repeatedly but never appeared. 'It's tremendously important to make sure it goes forward in the quickest and best way possible, and we will do that,' Blair told Worcester women. He took Downing Street and David Lock, one of his followers, took Wyre Forest from the Tories. Worcestershire has learned the hard way that the new era of Blairism merely heralded more of the same. Brown and the Treasury insisted that New Labour stuck with the Conservative regime's Private Finance Initiative (PFI). Instead of raising the funds for public works through taxation or government borrowing, public authorities had to allow private companies to own and manage each project and charge taxpayers for its use.</p> <p>This is a fantastically profligate waste of money which should destroy Brown's reputation as a prudent son of the manse. The Government can borrow at the lowest interest rates because it doesn't default on its debts. Private companies have to pay higher charges and make a return for their investors. Because Brown insists that every scheme should be financed privately, developers can also negotiate in the knowledge that they have the other side over a barrel. Thus the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, to quote the best example, will require the local health authority to give a consortium \u00a330 million a year at today's prices for 30 years (\u00a3900m in total). If the Government had paid for the hospital directly, the bill would have been \u00a3180m.</p> <p>The price of the new Worcester Royal Infirmary rose between 1996 and 2000 by 118 per cent - a study by Professor Allyson Pollock and her colleagues at University College, London, showed. To meet the extortionate demands, Kidderminster Hospital was reduced to a glorified GP's surgery. The accident and emergency and intensive care units were closed.

      "bodyText": "Middle England is patronised as well as pampered. Focus groupies and market researchers strain to probe and manipulate its passions. \u00c9lite politicians and pundits drop their aitches and pose as its tribunes. What's left of the Left confirms its impotence by moaning from the sidelines about a wretched political system driven by the imperative to do nothing that might upset Worcester Women and Mondeo Men as they raise 2.5 children in pebble-dashed houses. Middle Englanders are animated by doltish complacency and irrational fears. Gestures on asylum and crime are created to placate them. They are a greedy, rootless tribe who don't give a damn for public services and the common good. Their acquiesence can be bought with a few tax cuts and cheaper petrol. These are the last people on the planet you would expect to revolt against the Private Finance Initiative. To be honest, you wouldn't expect them to have heard of the Private Finance Initiative. Yet, marvellously, Worcestershire is defying every slander and is in open, furious rebellion. There is a fair chance that it will return one of the few independent MPs to be elected since 1945 because it can't stand what Gordon Brown has done to the NHS. The candidate, Richard Taylor, is the most refreshing and unlikely politician I've met. The 66-year-old retired rheumatologist holds a quaint belief in the power of democracy to challenge the status quo. New Labour MPs who triangulated with Old Tories, and Old Tories who triangulated with New Labour, lost that years ago and are greeting the prospect that he may well take the Wyre Forest seat with incomprehending panic. The game of British politics isn't meant to produce results like that. Independents are meant to be eccentrics who are lucky if they can save their deposits. Taylor never wanted to be an MP. He left Kidderminster Hospital after 23 years' service with the expectation that he would fill his days by indulging his passions for classic cars and ornithology. He was transformed from a retiring twitcher to avenging angel by what should have been a nugget of cheering news. In 1997 Tony Blair pledged that if he came to power he would build a new hospital in Worcester. Political junkies will remember that Worcester women were all the rage at the time. They were the English version of Bill Clinton's soccer mums; aspiring types who didn't like paying taxes but worried about the state of the schools and hospitals. They had plenty to worry about. For decades, pretty much everyone who needed treatment in Worcester had complained that the infirmary was split across ancient buildings on three sites. A new hospital had been promised repeatedly but never appeared. 'It's tremendously important to make sure it goes forward in the quickest and best way possible, and we will do that,' Blair told Worcester women. He took Downing Street and David Lock, one of his followers, took Wyre Forest from the Tories. Worcestershire has learned the hard way that the new era of Blairism merely heralded more of the same. Brown and the Treasury insisted that New Labour stuck with the Conservative regime's Private Finance Initiative (PFI). Instead of raising the funds for public works through taxation or government borrowing, public authorities had to allow private companies to own and manage each project and charge taxpayers for its use. This is a fantastically profligate waste of money which should destroy Brown's reputation as a prudent son of the manse. The Government can borrow at the lowest interest rates because it doesn't default on its debts. Private companies have to pay higher charges and make a return for their investors. Because Brown insists that every scheme should be financed privately, developers can also negotiate in the knowledge that they have the other side over a barrel. Thus the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, to quote the best example, will require the local health authority to give a consortium \u00a330 million a year at today's prices for 30 years (\u00a3900m in total). If the Government had paid for the hospital directly, the bill would have been \u00a3180m. The price of the new Worcester Royal Infirmary rose between 1996 and 2000 by 118 per cent - a study by Professor Allyson Pollock and her colleagues at University College, London, showed. To meet the extortionate demands, Kidderminster Hospital was reduced to a glorified GP's surgery. The accident and emergency and intensive care units were closed. A high-tech block, which cost \u00a315m, had to be mothballed and will soon be gutted. Mass demonstrations greeted the destruction of an institution whose League of Friends had collected \u00a32.5m in the 1990s from grateful patients and their families. At first, the protesters assumed the threat to the hospital was a mistake New Labour would rectify. Lock was ready to die in the last ditch with them. 'The community are not prepared to accept the Health Authority's proposals,' he cried. 'We need Kidderminster Hospital! We need a full range of services!' There was also the nice new Prime Minister.

      "body": "<p>Last weekend Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. The Free Ps' birthday bash was held in the Odyssey Arena on the banks of the River Lagan. It was an incongruous setting, with 5,000 or so faithful souls locked in the mindset of the seventeenth century inside a twenty-first-century stadium. The media, including some national newspapers, covered the event as if the Church was some kind of harmless, quaint, mildly eccentric sect like the Amish of North America.</p> <p>What was absent from the reporting was any sense of how this fundamentalist, deeply sectarian institution has had a disastrous impact on all aspects of Northern Irish life.</p> <p>Instead this bigoted sect responsible for so much reaction was treated with a folksy portrait, a religious sub-culture not exactly at one with the modern or post-modern world. It was a picture which did not correspond with the reality of Free Presbyterianism.</p> <p>First there is the theology. According to Free Presbyterians anyone who is not 'born-again' is doomed to the fires of hell. Catholics in particular, living in Free P's minds in the darkness of Popery, are all going to burn with Satan. What this twisted vision entails in practise is that any Catholic, even a young child dying of leukemia in hospital tonight, will be burned for eternity once they pass away because they have not been 'saved'. Anyone with even an ounce of humanity would find this kind of arrogant presumption nauseating and, yes, downright evil.</p> <p>If Catholics are theological untermenchen, following the Whore of Babylon in Rome to damnation, is there anything wrong with burning the followers of the Beast in this life? Why worry for instance about the Quinn children burning in their home in Ballymoney during Drumcree when in a few minutes time they were bound to burn in hell because they were not 'saved'?</p> <p>The loony extreme of loyalism may be a repellent shower of misfits but they are following a consistent path set down by Free Presbyterianism when they argue that their armed struggle is God's work.</p> <p>In political terms the Free Presbyterians are the Irish version of the Dutch Reform Church, the religious wing of the South African Apartheid regime. Free Presbyterians form the backbone of the Democratic Unionist Party, which opposes power sharing and equality with Catholics. Again there is consistency here between the theocratic and the political. If Catholics are spiritual unequals then what is the point granting them equality in the temporal world?</p> <p>Free Presbyterians are among the most vocal in opposing the Good Friday Agreement. Many church members cite the early release of terrorist prisoners as one of the main reasons why they detest the peace accord. For church members opposition to the Agreement is a moral imperative, the freeing of convicted murderers and bombers an abomination in the eyes of God.</p> <p>This air of moral superiority, however, has the whiff of hypocrisy about it. One has only to look into the history of the Free Presbyterian Church and note how many of its members were involved in loyalist terrorism.</p> <p>The earliest example of this was in 1969 when Thomas McDowell read the morning lesson at the Free Presbyterian Church in Kilkeel before setting off to Donegal where he planned to blow up a power station and black-out the Republic's western seaboard.

      "bodyText": "Last weekend Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. The Free Ps' birthday bash was held in the Odyssey Arena on the banks of the River Lagan. It was an incongruous setting, with 5,000 or so faithful souls locked in the mindset of the seventeenth century inside a twenty-first-century stadium. The media, including some national newspapers, covered the event as if the Church was some kind of harmless, quaint, mildly eccentric sect like the Amish of North America. What was absent from the reporting was any sense of how this fundamentalist, deeply sectarian institution has had a disastrous impact on all aspects of Northern Irish life. Instead this bigoted sect responsible for so much reaction was treated with a folksy portrait, a religious sub-culture not exactly at one with the modern or post-modern world. It was a picture which did not correspond with the reality of Free Presbyterianism. First there is the theology. According to Free Presbyterians anyone who is not 'born-again' is doomed to the fires of hell. Catholics in particular, living in Free P's minds in the darkness of Popery, are all going to burn with Satan. What this twisted vision entails in practise is that any Catholic, even a young child dying of leukemia in hospital tonight, will be burned for eternity once they pass away because they have not been 'saved'. Anyone with even an ounce of humanity would find this kind of arrogant presumption nauseating and, yes, downright evil. If Catholics are theological untermenchen, following the Whore of Babylon in Rome to damnation, is there anything wrong with burning the followers of the Beast in this life? Why worry for instance about the Quinn children burning in their home in Ballymoney during Drumcree when in a few minutes time they were bound to burn in hell because they were not 'saved'? The loony extreme of loyalism may be a repellent shower of misfits but they are following a consistent path set down by Free Presbyterianism when they argue that their armed struggle is God's work. In political terms the Free Presbyterians are the Irish version of the Dutch Reform Church, the religious wing of the South African Apartheid regime. Free Presbyterians form the backbone of the Democratic Unionist Party, which opposes power sharing and equality with Catholics. Again there is consistency here between the theocratic and the political. If Catholics are spiritual unequals then what is the point granting them equality in the temporal world? Free Presbyterians are among the most vocal in opposing the Good Friday Agreement. Many church members cite the early release of terrorist prisoners as one of the main reasons why they detest the peace accord. For church members opposition to the Agreement is a moral imperative, the freeing of convicted murderers and bombers an abomination in the eyes of God. This air of moral superiority, however, has the whiff of hypocrisy about it. One has only to look into the history of the Free Presbyterian Church and note how many of its members were involved in loyalist terrorism. The earliest example of this was in 1969 when Thomas McDowell read the morning lesson at the Free Presbyterian Church in Kilkeel before setting off to Donegal where he planned to blow up a power station and black-out the Republic's western seaboard. McDowell, a Free Presbyterian and member of the reconstituted Ulster Volunteer Force, died placing a series of bombs on pylons at Ballyshannon ESB station. Ironically, a Catholic priest who assumed he was a republican bomber gave McDowell, a follower of Paisley, the last rites. There have been scores like McDowell throughout the Troubles, willing to kill and maim to preserve a Protestant Ulster and who were never excommunicated from the Free Presbyterian Church. Protestant fundamentalists have always had an \u00e0 la carte attitude towards terrorism. Protestant fundamentalists are dangerous, deluded people whether they be in Northern Ireland or in the United States where many of their leaders hold influence on the Bush administration and want to blow up the world for Jesus. (By the way, would those Irish commentators such as Eoghan Harris who have been singing Bush's praises lately, in the wake of his environmentally reckless rejection of Kyoto, please wise up!) On a brighter note, it was wonderful to sit in Windsor Park eight days ago and hear Northern Ireland fans cheering rather than booing Neil Lennon. The IFA's 'Give bigotry the red card' campaign clearly had some success, the bigots appeared to have stayed away from the game. It just goes to show that when you stand up to bigotry you can score victories.",

      "body": "<p>The day a Downing Street minion asked Rory Bremner: 'How do you know Tony Blair likes to eat an apple in his office?' was the moment the impressionist knew his latest series - Bremner, Bird and Fortune - had finally scored a direct hit. <br></p> <p>His team discovered that No 10 was so disturbed by Bremner's devastating portrait of the Prime Minister's subservient relationship to his all-powerful and laconic press secretary, Alastair Campbell (played by Andrew Dunn), that it had authorised a paranoid mole-hunt. <br></p> <p>'They seriously thought,' Bremner said last week, with undisguised glee, 'that we had access to CCTV footage of Tony and Alastair.' <br></p> <p>New Labour is probably right to take Bremner seriously. It's his unplugged Sunday night TV satire that's landing significant political punches, leading to a growing sense of outrage. As John Fortune's regular character 'George Parr' put it in the opening episode: 'I'm not talking about people bribing the Government - that's corruption. I'm talking about Government bribing the people - that's democracy.'<br></p> <p>As well as persuading heavyweight journalists such as John Humphrys, Channel 4's Jon Snow and Sky's Adam Boulton to participate in cod-interviews, the show has persuaded some people it's the only serious opposition Labour has got. To Snow, the show has 'just got stronger and stronger. <br></p> <p>It's all the more potent because Rory is attacking from the radical side. He's inside the tent, but he's also urinating all over it. It's become a political show more than an entertainment show.' <br></p> <p>If, by some surreal quirk of psephology, Bremner could reach beyond his regular two million viewers on Channel 4 to a more significant portion of the electorate, Blair might even have a fight on his hands. <br></p> <p>The new lease of life experienced by Bremner and his collaborators, John Bird and John Fortune, is as much of a surprise to them as to their audience. This is, after all, the show's ninth series.<br></p> <p>When it started in 1993, Bremner was simply the most gifted impressionist in the business. In those days, he worked from scripts prepared by freelance sketch-writers. There was every reason to be leery of hard-boiled satire. Spitting Image had run out of steam and lost its way. Bremner's commission from C4 was to mix alternative comedy with variety, and, of course, to entertain. Initially, his show's only connection with the satire of the 1960s came from the presence of 'the two Johns'. <br></p> <p>Ripple-dissolve to the long, dark spring of 2001, and a farrago of innuendo and old-fashioned abuse chiefly directed at Labour humbug. What's happened, it seems, is that Bird and Fortune's influence has slowly sharpened Bremner's political appetite and tuned his comedian's antennae into decoding the confusing political static that surrounds the Government. 'I think it's fair to say,' observed Fortune carefully, 'that we have radicalised him.' <br></p> <p>Bird and Fortune have had to evolve, too, to speak to the Friends generation. Snow said: 'What's amazing is the way the two Johns have made the transition from Macmillan to Blair... What they're implicitly saying is, \"Nothing has changed. The chaps who ran Suez are the same chaps who now run Maff\".' &gt;BR&gt;</p> <p>Bremner's own anger has evolved alongside the voters' disillusion. Now he's found his subject, he is both shaping and contributing to the debate about Labour's failure to deliver on its promises and the growing perception that it has become a Conservative government in all but name. 'I mean,' said Bremner, 'Winston Churchill would be thrown out of New Labour for being too left wing.' <br></p> <p>It's taken four years. After the satirical bonanza offered by the dying days of Tory rule, the show took a while to get to grips with New Labour, and for popular disenchantment with the new Government to give Bremner an audience responsive to his own deep sense of anger at the shift 'from ideology to ruthless pragmatism'. <br></p> <p>'The key to the series now,' he said, 'is that it's engaging with what's happening.' So is he now a satirist? 'That's a label you can never give yourself. What we do is we observe.' He adds: 'The show has become like a column, or like a commonplace book, in which we respond to anything that's caught our eye.' <br></p> <p>He's been lucky with his timing: Mandelson, the Hinduja brothers, Keith Vaz, Gordon Brown's Budget ('Let's not pretend it was anything to do with economic policy') and now foot and mouth and the improbable spectacle of the Defence Minister and top military brass deployed in the killing fields of Cumbria. You couldn't make it up. 'We are simply sifting through the facts and translating it into satire. We operate in the gap between rhetoric and performance. That's where we live. I cannot believe the pomposity of New Labour.' His writing partner Geoff Atkinson says much the same. 'We have found a voice, though I can't quite put my finger on why.' <br></p> <p>Part of the explanation may lie in Bremner's own obvious delight in his material. 'It's the writing that takes precedence now,' he says. 'I spend much more time writing than I used to. I came out of light entertainment, and the show used to be a show of impressions. Now it's different and now I get real pleasure in being truthful. Bird and Fortune are writers, too. The two Johns have this fantastic eye for absurdity.' <br></p> <p>Bird's weekly improvised interview with Fortune is one of the highlights of the show, a well-researched and often blisteringly funny expos\u00e9. It's this moment in Bremner, Bird and Fortune that recalls the satire of the Sixties. <br></p> <p>It's clear that the example of 'the two Johns' has become important to Bremner. In earlier series, Bird and Fortune had a lower billing than Bremner. Now they are an integral part of the show. It's the two Johns (and the star actress Frances Barber) who write and perform the 'dinner party' sketches that have become a vital ingredient in Bremner's satirical portrait of 'the way we live now'. <br></p> <p>Nonetheless, all those who are close to the show make clear that it's Bremner who holds the ring. Will Hutton, former editor of The Observer and now chief executive of the Industrial Society, who has briefed Bremner on economic policy for years, says: 'It's Rory who calls the shots. It was Rory who first saw through New Labour. What's impressive about him is that he takes no prisoners. He's nobody's ally.' Bremner himself likes to boast that he's only said 'eight words to the Prime Minister in the past five years'. ('You are making it too easy for me.') <br></p> <p>Those, like Snow, who work opposite him, testify to the 'eerie experience' of finding the man they know morphing into 'Gordon' or 'Tony'. <br></p> <p>Combined with a natural independence, Bremner is hard-working and well-informed. 'He has a very good network,' says another insider. 'He does his homework. He cultivates politicians and civil servants. You see him on the circuit, finding things out.' <br></p> <p>Talk to Bremner for more than a few minutes and you find his outrage at the 'shamelessness' of the Government breaking through. 'Can you believe it?' he says. 'They are actually taxing more and spending less than the last Conservative Government.' <br></p> <p>Still, trying to pin down Bremner's own political allegiance is hard. Fortune, who says he cannot bring himself to vote in the next election, identifies him as a libertarian. Hutton thinks Bremner is, at heart, an old-fashioned British liberal 'who has become angered by the present Government. But like all the great comics, his work has a real humanity. It's not enough for satire simply to attack.' <br></p> <p>The show itself exemplifies this. Tune into the series and you will find the familiar range of comic impressions drawn from a close observation of contemporary politics and media - Chris Tarrant, Jeremy Paxman, Des Lynam et al. But what distinguishes Bremner's caricature of, for instance, Robin Cook, is that behind the know-all demeanour and squeaky, argumentative voice, there's a devastating portrait of the Foreign Secretary's vanity.<br></p> <p>Similarly, Bremner seems to understand Brown's broodiness, and Blair's obsessive anxiety to please. His perception of Blair's 'niceness' has what he calls the all-important 'hinterland' to his caricature - Blair is a sincere man who is also incredibly manipulative. <br></p> <p>Geoff Atkinson believes that part of the show's secret now is that 'we've narrowed it down. We've eliminated stuff that in the old days could have gone into Weekending '. The streamlined team that produces New Bremner is similarly lean.<br></p> <p>Apart from Bremner and 'the two Johns', there's Atkinson, Bremner's longtime collaborator John Langdon, a couple of researchers and 'a woman called Val who researches the archive footage'. The show is put together from week to week on the hoof. <br></p> <p>An important element is the time Fortune and Bird spend together at the beginning of the week, and the half day Fortune spends with Bremner as the recording session approaches. <br></p> <p>'I watched it last week,' said Martin O'Neill, Labour MP for Ochil and chairman of the DTI select committee. 'It's good fun and, like all satire, it makes us [the Labour Government] feel uncomfortable. He wouldn't be doing his job if he did not cause us to feel as much annoyance as he did the previous Tory administration. <br></p> <p>'In the Blair-Campbell exchanges he has got the body language of both down to a tee - you almost don't need any dialogue. It's well observed, good fun, and not really driven by any malicious intent. It does its job, and pricks all the right bubbles.' <br></p> <p>'People have got a sense of humour,' said Charlie Whelan, former adviser to Brown. 'We used to get Rory a seat in the Commons so he could watch MPs at work. Gordon Brown was quite happy about [the show]. He does have a sense of humour. One of the problems is that there haven't been any hard satire shows any more. A lot of comedians are Labour these days.' <br></p> <p>Not everyone is impressed by New Bremner. 'I'm all in favour of being able to laugh at ourselves and for satire to keep our feet on the ground,' said David Blunkett, Education Secretary. 'What I worry about is when satire masquerades as serious comment.' <br></p> <p>As for Campbell, an aide - spokesman for the spokesman - said: 'He has no comment to make on that. No comment at all.' <br></p> <p>The Daily Mail 's TV critic, Jacqui Stephens, notes that 'It's quite formulaic in the way that verything, from Big Brother down, becomes a metaphor for New Labour.' But she concedes that it's still the only satire on the scene. <br></p> <p>Bremner himself is too self-critical to be easy with the idea that it's a return to the satirical heyday of the early 1960s.<br></p> <p>'We're working in a popular medium and producing entertainment. Satire depends on a finely developed sense of irony. If we did a television version of the Modest Proposal we'd have watchdog organisations all over us. Look, I've just filmed a sketch of Des Lynam interviewing Sven G\u00f6ran Eriksson in the sauna.

At the height of apartheid, the show had a rendition of 'I've Never Met A Nice South African'. It ran from 1984 to 1992. Michael Heseltine tried to buy his puppet. Margaret Thatcher said: 'I don't ever watch that programme.'",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain's leading hospitals discriminated against children with Down's syndrome because of the belief that operating on them was not worthwhile given their condition. A damning study of the cardiac surgery department at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London says that parents with Down's children were often told that it would be better not to risk heart surgery, because the child's condition would mean it would be stressful to look after them until adulthood. The report also condemns the treatment of parents whose children died after heart surgery at the Royal Brompton Hospital and its sister hospital, Harefield, on the outskirts of west London. Parents were not 'adequately supported' by the hospitals, were denied facts about key decisions on their child's health, were badly treated when told of children's deaths, and were often left to travel home alone, despite their bereavement. Two families are now taking legal action against the Royal Brompton. Josephine Ocloo, who heads the parents' group which is involved in the inquiry, said the hospital had treated her shabbily, and that with different medical care her daughter Krista might have survived the heart defect which killed her in 1996 at the age of 17. Ocloo's case will be heard at the High Court next month. Another parent whose son died at the hospital, Debbie Hinds, is also taking action. The report - which was produced by an inquiry chaired by the former head of the National Consumer Council, Ruth Evans - attacks the Government for failing to fund proper care for families who had suffered the death of a child. It says the Department of Health did not give the hospitals the resources to deal with the problems they were facing. The report reopens the issue of the medical profession's attitude towards patients and parents of children who are suffering from life-threatening diseases. Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, has said he wants an end to the 'paternalistic attitude' in the NHS and a better relationship between doctors and the people they treat. It comes after three other damning studies of the way the medical profession operates: the Alder Hey inquiry in Liverpool, the inquiry into the Marchioness tragedy and the investigation into the controversial cardiac surgery procedures at Bristol. The inquiry into the Royal Brompton and Harefield Trust was launched in 1999 after criticisms by 49 families with children being treated for congenital heart disease - 42 at the Royal Brompton and seven at Harefield. Many of the children died during 'post-operative' care, some after having the controversial 'arterial switch' operations that led to the high death rates revealed by the Bristol heart care inquiry. The report on the Royal Brompton, which has been obtained by The Observer, says: 'We accept RBH [Royal Brompton Hospital] doctors may not have been intentionally discriminatory in the way in which treatment was offered to some [Down's] children, but that was, in our opinion, the effect of their approach. 'We conclude that some doctors at the RBH, by taking into account non-cardiac concerns and the possible future demands on the family, did not focus sufficiently on what was in the best interests of the child as the patient. 'As a result the treatment offered was construed by parents as discriminatory.' Evidence given to the inquiry team reveals that parents believed their views were ignored or dismissed by hospital consultants and that operations had been can celled after only minimal discussion with the family. The Evans inquiry is the second into the two hospitals. It was launched after parents condemned the first investigation - which had cleared the hospitals of poor treatment techniques - as a whitewash. The first report was the result of an independent examination of allegations that the Royal Brompton's death rate in operations on children with Down's syndrome was abnormally high. Headed by three leading heart specialists, the inquiry cleared the hospital and accused an unidentified whistle-blower of causing 'trouble and pain'.",

      "bodyText": "'Nothing ever changes in Northern Ireland politics'runs the conventional wisdom. The 18 Westminster seats in the province form their own contest - part religious census and part election - with rarely more than two or three results in any doubt. But the new dividing lines of the peace process, a spate of retirements and a stunning by-election result in South Antrim make 2001 the least predictable of all Ulster elections. As many as half the seats could be competitive. Ulster Unionists: Leader: David Trimble Ten seats in 1997 election, now holds nine Goal: Top the poll and defend their seats The party had some of its worst results in the 1998 Assembly and 1999 Euro elections. But the biggest shock was September's South Antrim by-election, where it lost a 16,000 majority and its second safest seat to the UUP. Seats held by deputy leader John Taylor (Strangford) and Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and Tyrone), both retiring after 18 years each, may be vulnerable too. The party has benefited from first-past-the-post, winning 10 of the 18 seats in the past three general elections, but an adverse swing could therefore prove correspondingly costly in terms of seats lost. Democratic Unionist Party : Leader: Ian Paisley Two seats in 1997, now three Goal: Hold South Antrim and make gains from UUP In South Antrim, the Rev William McCrea will be pleased to be taking on again the anti-agreement UUP candidate David Burnside, whom he beat in the by-election. And Iris Robinson, wife of deputy leader Peter Robinson, will start as favourite to gain Strangford. Ian Paisley, at the age of 74, has no plans to retire \u00ca he hopes to demonstrate that a majority of Protestant voters now opposes the agreement. SDLP : Leader: John Hume Holds three seats Goal: To maintain clear lead over Sinn Fein The party was delighted to top the poll in the 1998 Assembly elections. But the longer-term trend is a loss of votes to Sinn Fein, brought so painstakingly into the political fold by John Hume. Taking West Belfast back from Gerry Adams is unlikely, even if the party might attract tactical Protestant votes. Hume and deputy Seamus Mallon are fighting on, but the party will need a new generation of leaders for the next election. Sinn Fein : Leader: Gerry Adams Two seats Goal: Close vote gap with SDLP and gain seats Will aim to close gap on the SDLP among Catholic voters, and target one Unionist and one SDLP seat. Michelle Gildernew, aged 30, hopes to reclaim Fermanagh, which Bobby Sands won in 1981, in the most equally divided constituency in religious terms. UK Unionist Party One MP: Robert McCartney Anti-Agreement Unionist holds North Down. The party does not compete in other constituencies. \u0095 Elections are not always good news for peace in Northern Ireland. The 1974 election led to the collapse of the last power-sharing agreement.

      "bodyText": "The lowdown: Crucial naval battleground sees Conservatives fighting on two fronts. The form: The now notorious Paulsgrove estate is something of an anomaly in relatively affluent Portsmouth North, Tory-held for 18 years. Hancock's majority almost counts as a landslide in traditionally ultra-marginal Portsmouth South, which includes Southsea and Portsea Island. Local landmarks: Britain's premier naval port. Key voters: 14,000 voters in the city are employed at the naval dockyard and the same number again outside the base. Both Rapson and Hancock are strong on defence. Local issues: Tories will campaign on closure of Haslam military hospital in nearby Gosport. The verdict: LibDem Mike Hancock's community politics will make him hard to dislodge in Portsmouth South but Labour's Syd Rapson will need a high Paulsgrove turnout if he is to hang on too. The candidates Portsmouth North: Syd Rapson (Labour): Veteran Labour loyalist, aged 59. Described Paulsgrove anti-paedophile protests as 'democracy in action' while condemning violence. But then Rapson lives on the estate. Local councillor since 1971. Christopher Day (Conservative): Euro-moderate, aged 39, in risk management for American Express. Came a distant second in Stoke last time. Portsmouth South: Mike Hancock (LibDem): Should handle electoral nerves better than most, having lost this seat by 242 votes in 1992 and by 205 in 1997 after representing it for the SDP from 1984 to 1987. Philip Warr(Conservatives): Chartered surveyor and 'Keep the pound' man faces tough test on first electoral outing.

Kyoto merely pledged developed countries to restrict their industrial output. 'It was an excellent first step towards reversing climate change,' according to Southampton University's Professor Nigel Arnell. Kyoto was, in effect, a statement of intent. The industrial nations which had, after all, initiated the problem of global warming, would show their commitment by making the first crucial, self-sacrificing moves. Then the Third World could be drawn in, and the first decreases in carbon-dioxide emissions agreed over the next few years. 'Bush has now made the attainment of these next crucial steps much more difficult,' says Arnell. In fact, most experts believe he has made them impossible. If the West won't act, why should the rest of the world? If no action is taken, the consequences are likely to be calamitous. Before the industrial revolution, the atmosphere was made up of 250 parts per million of carbon dioxide. Now that figure has reached 366 and is already producing meteorological effects: a steady increase in devastating storms across Britain, rising sea levels, and dwindling glaciers and ice-caps. And that is just the start. Carbon dioxide levels will inevitably reach 450, even if governments closed every factory tomorrow. 'Plants absorb carbon dioxide and when they die they release that gas,' says Dr David Griggs of the IPCC's science working group. 'Similarly, the oceans absorb and release carbon dioxide.' These carbon dioxide stores mean that we could not stop atmospheric levels rising for future decades, no matter what we did. 'The climate is changing and will continue to change, regardless of what George Bush says,' comments Dr Mike Hulme of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change in Norwich. </p> <p>In any case, closing down factories is not on the cards. With the nation responsible for a quarter of all global carbon dioxide emissions refusing to limit its output by the merest fraction, levels will inevitably reach 550 parts per million - double their pre-industrial revolution figure - by about 2050. By then the world's temperature will have increased by 1.4 degrees Centigrade, triggering the mayhem outlined in the IPCC report. 'It is very difficult to make hard predictions,' adds Griggs. 'All we can say is that the future is going to be very uncertain, highly variable.' Britain provides an excellent example of the problem. We may swelter - or, if icy Arctic waters divert the Gulf Stream, we may shiver. Either way, the consequences will mean millions of homes will be refused insurance, native wildlife will perish and great chunks of coastline will be inundated. </p> <p>And, say meteorologists, it now looks as if there is nothing we can do about it.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Internet mogul  Cliff Stanford is taking a walk on the wild side with his new boats-to-pop stars investment vehicle. Profile by  Jamie Doward</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In a few months' time Clifford Martin Stanford will walk across an area the size of a football pitch somewhere in the middle of what was once war-torn Bosnia. </p> <p>As he negotiates what would seem to be the most mundane of feats, Stanford, the founder of Demon Internet, the internet service provider, and one of Britain's richest self-made millionaires, will be egged on by employees of Redbus, his fledgling conglomerate, which builds everything from boats to pop careers. </p> <p>If Stanford completes his stroll successfully he will breathe a huge sigh of relief: the ground over which he is to walk is currently a minefield. But not for much longer if Stanford's latest company, Redbus Landmine Disposal Systems, does its job properly. The RLD system uses two devices: Bigfoot, a machine that stomps all over a minefield, detonating hidden explosives; and 'worm', a machine to chew through the soil, ploughing it up to detect booby traps. </p> <p>Great in theory - but is Stanford just a wee bit nervous about how it will work in practice? Apparently not. </p> <p>'I'd be very happy to walk out there. We want to send a team of footballers to play on the ground we're so confident the system works,' he says, stifling one of many yawns, the result of an early-morning commute to London from his home in Brussels. </p> <p>The blueprint that led to Redbus LDS was one of 2,500 Stanford's company has received since it started life two years ago with a \u00a315m cash pile - half of what Stanford earned from selling Demon to Scottish Telecom, now called Thus, for \u00a366m. All of Stanford's businesses are branded around the Redbus name. 'We wanted a name that implied London and the UK but was pronounceable all over the world. And, as I said to somebody once, I needed a \"vehicle\" for investment.' </p> <p>The Demon sell-off turned Stanford into an overnight celebrity. The walls of his office, just off Oxford Street, are plastered with news about himself, Demon and Redbus. Missing from the gallery, however, are the salacious details of Stanford's love life plastered over the News of the World last year. Predictably, the 1,200-word account of champagne-fueled romps with two table dancers in Claridges, in his Rolls-Royce and his private jet confirmed he had the 'demon touch'. </p> <p>'Cliff doesn't have any inhibitions,' nude dancer Natalie said, breathlessly. 'Let me tell you - his bank balance isn't the only impressive thing about him. That man certainly has breathtaking assets.' </p> <p>Larry Ellison, Oracle's flamboyant MIG-flying boss, could be in danger of losing the 'most interesting internet mogul' mantle at this rate. </p> <p>Among friends and colleagues Stanford shrugs off the article: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' And if things had turned out differently, Cliff could have been a very dull boy. An accountant by training, Stanford taught himself to write computer code in his spare time. </p> <p>He struck gold when he worked out that if he built an internet service provider he could charge others for providing access to the net to subsidise his own surfing. It was the first time anyone had attempted to bring internet access to Joe Public's desktop. 'I worked out that if we got 200 users we'd break even; with 400 we'd make a small profit.' </p> <p>Nobody predicted that by 1998, when Stanford sold the business, Demon would have 250,000 subscribers. </p> <p>Stanford, small and squat, with a smoker's voice, could have retired at 46. After the Demon sale he emigrated to Belgium, where he now lives as a tax exile - when he's not at his villa in southern Spain, that is. But he says the reason he founded Redbus was to 'put something back' by investing in innovative British businesses. 'What drives me is the fun of doing things and making people rich, helping ideas turn into businesses.' </p> <p>Stanford says he wouldn't have been able to found Redbus if he hadn't left the UK to avoid capital gains tax: 'It's counter-productive. It's a bad tax. If they could stay here and keep that money, more people would do something with it back home.' </p> <p>The first venture Stanford invested in was Redbus Interhouse, which specialises in building and running internet 'hotels', the datarooms that take care of firms' online activities. The company listed on the stock market last year via a reverse takeover. 'It was voted - and I have the certificate to prove it - the best-performing share of 2000 - which, considering the downturn in the tech market, is actually pretty impressive.' </p> <p>The share price has subsequently taken a hammering.

      "bodyText": "In a few months' time Clifford Martin Stanford will walk across an area the size of a football pitch somewhere in the middle of what was once war-torn Bosnia. As he negotiates what would seem to be the most mundane of feats, Stanford, the founder of Demon Internet, the internet service provider, and one of Britain's richest self-made millionaires, will be egged on by employees of Redbus, his fledgling conglomerate, which builds everything from boats to pop careers. If Stanford completes his stroll successfully he will breathe a huge sigh of relief: the ground over which he is to walk is currently a minefield. But not for much longer if Stanford's latest company, Redbus Landmine Disposal Systems, does its job properly. The RLD system uses two devices: Bigfoot, a machine that stomps all over a minefield, detonating hidden explosives; and 'worm', a machine to chew through the soil, ploughing it up to detect booby traps. Great in theory - but is Stanford just a wee bit nervous about how it will work in practice? Apparently not. 'I'd be very happy to walk out there. We want to send a team of footballers to play on the ground we're so confident the system works,' he says, stifling one of many yawns, the result of an early-morning commute to London from his home in Brussels. The blueprint that led to Redbus LDS was one of 2,500 Stanford's company has received since it started life two years ago with a \u00a315m cash pile - half of what Stanford earned from selling Demon to Scottish Telecom, now called Thus, for \u00a366m. All of Stanford's businesses are branded around the Redbus name. 'We wanted a name that implied London and the UK but was pronounceable all over the world. And, as I said to somebody once, I needed a \"vehicle\" for investment.' The Demon sell-off turned Stanford into an overnight celebrity. The walls of his office, just off Oxford Street, are plastered with news about himself, Demon and Redbus. Missing from the gallery, however, are the salacious details of Stanford's love life plastered over the News of the World last year. Predictably, the 1,200-word account of champagne-fueled romps with two table dancers in Claridges, in his Rolls-Royce and his private jet confirmed he had the 'demon touch'. 'Cliff doesn't have any inhibitions,' nude dancer Natalie said, breathlessly. 'Let me tell you - his bank balance isn't the only impressive thing about him. That man certainly has breathtaking assets.' Larry Ellison, Oracle's flamboyant MIG-flying boss, could be in danger of losing the 'most interesting internet mogul' mantle at this rate. Among friends and colleagues Stanford shrugs off the article: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' And if things had turned out differently, Cliff could have been a very dull boy. An accountant by training, Stanford taught himself to write computer code in his spare time. He struck gold when he worked out that if he built an internet service provider he could charge others for providing access to the net to subsidise his own surfing. It was the first time anyone had attempted to bring internet access to Joe Public's desktop. 'I worked out that if we got 200 users we'd break even; with 400 we'd make a small profit.' Nobody predicted that by 1998, when Stanford sold the business, Demon would have 250,000 subscribers. Stanford, small and squat, with a smoker's voice, could have retired at 46. After the Demon sale he emigrated to Belgium, where he now lives as a tax exile - when he's not at his villa in southern Spain, that is. But he says the reason he founded Redbus was to 'put something back' by investing in innovative British businesses. 'What drives me is the fun of doing things and making people rich, helping ideas turn into businesses.' Stanford says he wouldn't have been able to found Redbus if he hadn't left the UK to avoid capital gains tax: 'It's counter-productive. It's a bad tax. If they could stay here and keep that money, more people would do something with it back home.' The first venture Stanford invested in was Redbus Interhouse, which specialises in building and running internet 'hotels', the datarooms that take care of firms' online activities. The company listed on the stock market last year via a reverse takeover. 'It was voted - and I have the certificate to prove it - the best-performing share of 2000 - which, considering the downturn in the tech market, is actually pretty impressive.' The share price has subsequently taken a hammering. Shortly after it floated in March the share hit the 300p mark. Last Thursday, however, it fell 19 per cent to 84p on the back of disappointing figures. The company lost \u00a36m last year - far greater than the \u00a34.7m its house broker had predicted. Nevertheless, Stanford says the company will turn a profit - excluding charges for interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - this year. The float raised around \u00a3100m, which will be used to turn Redbus into the European market leader for web-hosting services. But Interhouse, so far the only publicly quoted part of the Redbus empire, is one of the more prosaic members of Stanford's stable. There's Redbus Film Distribution, for example.

Then there's Redbus WorkBoats, a company that builds platformed boats for use by divers, police and photographers. Stanford admits business has been slow: 'It's a new concept and it's taking time for people to realise that. It has yet to convince the world.' He also has great hopes for Redbus Continuous Professional Training, currently in the business of helping dentists gen up on their knowledge, and Redbus Serraglaze, a firm that uses prisms to bounce light into rooms that don't see too much sun.

It was argued that as well as scaring off private investors, such a radical move would have paralysed the industry for three years while new legislation went through. </p> <p>Prescott suggested the 'public interest director' as a compromise, and is determined to force a very reluctant Railtrack, to accept it. </p> <p>No one has yet been approached to take the job, but names discussed in ministerial circles include Sir Malcolm Field, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, and Lord (Richard) Faulkner, a Labour life peer who was on the old British Rail board. </p> <p>The Government has agreed to pay some of Railtrack's state funds early on the new condition that it concentrate on fixing the network and fitting safety systems. </p> <p>The company will agree to give up its monopoly on 'enhancement' projects designed to expand the network. The second leg of the tunnel link is one of them. </p> <p>Railtrack saved the link when the consortium run ning the project - London &amp; Continental Railways (LCR), led by Bechtel - ran out of money in 1998. It agreed to buy the first phase, into Waterloo, for \u00a31.67bn from LCR on its completion in 2003. </p> <p>Railtrack was given an exclusive option to back the second phase. This should be built between this summer and late 2006, taking the line into a super-station at Kings Cross St Pancras and shaving Eurostar journey time from London to Paris and Brussels to just over two hours. </p> <p>Railtrack had refused to commit itself, partly as a bargaining chip to get more funds. Now enfeebled, it has been thrown off the project. </p> <p>Apart from Bechtel, the firms in LCR include Ove Arup, Halcrow and UBS Warburg. Most of phase two will be paid for by subsidies and Government-backed bonds.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Railtrack is to be stripped of its key role in the second stage of the Channel tunnel rail link and replaced by US construction giant Bechtel. The Government will end more than two years' uncertainty tomorrow by announcing that the whole of the \u00a35.2 billion link between Kent and London's King's Cross station will finally go ahead and be finished by 2006, minus beleaguered Railtrack. Deputy prime minister John Prescott will tell the network and signalling operator that it will receive up to \u00a31.5bn of taxpayers' money to avert a financial crisis and a slump in its credit rating. But Railtrack will have to appoint a new Government-approved director, whose prime job will be to ensure that it fulfils its public interest role. Senior Government sources told The Observer that after the Hatfield crash last October, Prescott wanted to renationalise Railtrack, but was dissuaded. It was argued that as well as scaring off private investors, such a radical move would have paralysed the industry for three years while new legislation went through. Prescott suggested the 'public interest director' as a compromise, and is determined to force a very reluctant Railtrack, to accept it. No one has yet been approached to take the job, but names discussed in ministerial circles include Sir Malcolm Field, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, and Lord (Richard) Faulkner, a Labour life peer who was on the old British Rail board. The Government has agreed to pay some of Railtrack's state funds early on the new condition that it concentrate on fixing the network and fitting safety systems. The company will agree to give up its monopoly on 'enhancement' projects designed to expand the network. The second leg of the tunnel link is one of them. Railtrack saved the link when the consortium run ning the project - London &amp; Continental Railways (LCR), led by Bechtel - ran out of money in 1998. It agreed to buy the first phase, into Waterloo, for \u00a31.67bn from LCR on its completion in 2003. Railtrack was given an exclusive option to back the second phase. This should be built between this summer and late 2006, taking the line into a super-station at Kings Cross St Pancras and shaving Eurostar journey time from London to Paris and Brussels to just over two hours. Railtrack had refused to commit itself, partly as a bargaining chip to get more funds. Now enfeebled, it has been thrown off the project. Apart from Bechtel, the firms in LCR include Ove Arup, Halcrow and UBS Warburg. Most of phase two will be paid for by subsidies and Government-backed bonds.",

      "body": "<p>A bitter little joke circulated in Belgrade after the end of Nato's war against Serbia in 1999. Slobodan Milosevic was having breakfast with his helmet-haired wife Mira in their villa-cum-bunker in the Dedinje suburb of the city when he noticed soldiers being deployed outside. 'They've come to arrest me and take me to The Hague,' Milosevic cried. His wife looked out of the window and reassured him: 'Don't worry, darling. It's only the frontier service patrolling our new borders.'</p> <p>So it has come to pass. On Friday evening armed police in balaclavas, accompanied by an ambulance, appeared at Milosevic's gate.</p> <p>By yesterday Milosevic's grand vision of a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia - for which more than a quarter of a million people died - had shrunk to the grounds of his villa; his armies to a motley handful of supporters still prepared to perish to protect him.</p> <p>In this present version of events, there is no prospect of Mira's reassurance. The police who arrived at Milosevic's door had indeed come to arrest him and take him to a specially prepared cell for questioning over 'his crimes in office' - corruption and political violence at home - although not the international community's allegations of crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Although his bodyguards drove off the initial police assault in 15 minutes of drunken firing - apparently with the tacit approval of the army chief of staff, Nebojsa Pavkovic, who commanded Milosevic's campaign in Kosovo - one thing is clear. A Rubicon has still been crossed.</p> <p>The attempt to arrest Milosevic may have been a shambles, but the fact that it happened at all has shown the determination of the new Yugoslav authorities to draw the poison of the murderous Milosevic years. He may not yet be on his way to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to face war crime charges. But suddenly it seems that, despite their insistence that they will never hand him over, Yugoslavia's new leaders have taken the first step towards it.</p> <p>Only Milosevic can now prevent the eventuality of a trial of some kind. And only then by taking the most drastic of actions. Yesterday the Yugoslav authorities revealed that Milosevic - who decried those ordering his arrest as 'Nato agents one and all' - had vowed to 'die rather than go to prison', and that he had stockpiled the weapons and explosives to back up his threat.</p> <p>Whether he means to die in battle or take his life like both his parents remains unclear.</p> <p>The chaotic scenes outside Milosevic's house are a far cry from the days when he could command the loyalty of hundreds of thousands of Serbs who would turn out to hear their leader speak after his first firebrand oration in Kosovo in 1987 as the secretary of the Serbian Communist Party, when he vowed to 'defend' Serb rights.</p> <p>The brand of nationalism he concocted was what Serbs wanted to hear - casting them as the victims who would rise to claim their national inheritance anew. Under this banner they followed him in the wars he inspired - from Slovenia to Croatia and Bosnia to Kosovo. Each ended in humiliation for the Serb cause.</p> <p>But the fiasco of the attempts to arrest Milosevic has revealed a split that remains at the heart of Yugoslavia's new 'democratic' government six months after the Balkans' most notorious dictator was pushed out of power.</p> <p>Two men encapsulate the split, and their differences produced the bungle. Vojislav Kostunica, the new Yugoslav President, is an anti-Western nationalist who sees the war crimes tribunal in The Hague as a tool of American power. Although he despises Milosevic, he has consistently said he would not deliver him to The Hague. Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian President, is a pragmatist who wants to end Serbia's decade of isolation and bring it into the European mainstream.</p> <p>Djindjic supported all Milosevic's wars but realised that the dictator would eventually have to stand trial abroad for war crimes if Serbia was ever to turn the page. His strategy was delay, insisting that Milosevic first be tried on charges of corruption and abuse of power at home. Delay has also had the advantage of giving ordinary Serbs time to get used to the idea that one day Milosevic would have to go to jail. So far Djindjic's strategy has worked. Recent polls show well over two-thirds of Serbs now think Milosevic's place should be in jail. The numbers who think that jail should be in The Hague is over 40 per cent, compared to single figures just six months ago.</p> <p>Djindjic may have persuaded a large section of the Serbian public, but he failed to get Kostunica to shift and start co-operating with The Hague. A struggle has been going on behind the scenes in the past two months. Djindjic thought he had won when he, Kostunica and key Cabinet Ministers agreed in mid-February that Serbs who were not Yugoslav citizens and had taken refuge in Serbia should be handed to The Hague. The rest would first have to stand trial at home.</p> <p>The test came 10 days ago when Milomir Stakic, the former mayor of Prijedor in Bosnia, who had been indicted for genocide, was arrested in Belgrade and sent to The Hague. Kostunica stunned his colleagues by calling it 'unacceptable'. A furious Djindjic went public to say that Kostunica was going back on what he had agreed. Stakic was not a citizen of Yugoslavia but of Bosnia. The clash over Stakic was a sign that a bigger clash over Milosevic was likely.</p> <p>If the differences between Kostunica and Djindjic were merely personal, they might be resolved gracefully. But behind them looms the role of the army, and the future of many of the top officers who carried out Milosevic's vicious orders in Kosovo. They too may be candidates for The Hague.</p> <p>Among them is General Pavkovic, Milosevic's commander in Kosovo, who was offered effective immunity if he changed sides. So he started to play on Kostunica's disagreement with Djindjic to have the arrest order thwarted. His position may be sabre-rattling, but it is causing serious anxiety in the Djindjic camp. The armed night-time clash between the special police sent in to arrest the former dictator and his body-guards was just a symbol of a bigger clash in the wings.</p> <p>That clash, should it occur, may centre around the timing of the arrest to conform to an American deadline demanding Milosevic's surrender. For while the number of Serbs happy to see Milosevic brought before local - if not international - justice has been gradually rising, there are many who are deeply unhappy that it should be orchestrated to keep America sweet. Three weeks ago that American pressure was ratcheted up again as the US told the government in Belgrade that, if it expected American aid to continue, it had to arrest and imprison Milosevic by 31 March, and at the same time should assist in transferring to The Hague at least one person to be indicted on war crimes charges. Those demands were laid out in explicit detail in a three-page document handed over by the US Ambassador to Belgrade, William D. Montgomery, to Kostunica, Djindjic and other senior Serbian officials.</p> <p>Now the world's attention is focused on what is happening inside Milosevic's house. 'If he's not drunk, he's certainly going to kill himself,' said a colonel in the Serbian army intelligence. He claims it is a thought that has been much on Milosevic's mind.</p> <p>Since October, Milosevic has not left his villa except to attend a couple of stormy party meetings which took place at the Socialist Party headquarters in Novi Belgrade. In that time little information has come out of the closed walls of the presidential villa at Uzicka 1. But what has emerged has been consistent.</p> <p>One household servant described Milosevic as 'drunk most of the time'. He added: 'He drinks lots of expensive whisky and makes long phone calls.' His wife Mira - who is in the villa with him - has been described as depressed and paranoid and to be consuming tranquillisers and sleeping pills for much of the time.</p> <p><b>The life and crimes of Milosevic </b></p> <p>In May 1999 The Hague tribunal charged Slobodan Milosevic with responsibility for killings, deportations, and violations of the laws of war in Kosovo.</p> <p><b>Genocide</b> <br> Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor in The Hague, is also believed to be close to issuing genocide charges against Milosevic in connection with the 1992-95 Bosnia war.

More than 250,000 people died in Bosnia and Kosovo.</p> <p>It came as the Serbian government announced that the former ruler, who tried to cling to power by falsifying election results, faced charges of corruption and abuse of power. He refused to accept a summons and ordered his guards to prevent his arrest by force.</p> <p>A die-hard group of flag-waving civilian supporters gathered outside the house, denouncing the government as traitors and swearing at foreign journalists.</p> <p>Last night the government announced that Milosevic was under house arrest until he agreed to appear before an investigating judge.</p> <p>'When employees of the Ministry of Interior estimate it is possible to carry out the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic, it will be done. He will either come in by himself or we will take him in, with or without force,' said Dusan Mihailovic, of the Interior Ministry.</p> <p>He added there was no current plan to send Milosevic to the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which has indicted him for atrocities committed in Kosovo in 1999.</p> <p>Mihailovic's declaration was an effort to regain dignity for the government after a clumsy effort by special armed police to break into the villa early yesterday.</p> <p>Speculation about Milosevic's imminent arrest was started by a loyalist MP from his Socialist Party last Friday afternoon. Police cars and an ambulance moved up to the villa's front entrance. Some hours later a convoy of four black Jeeps, one with tinted windows, drove to the Palace of Justice. It returned to the villa an hour later. Although radio stations reported Milosevic was in the car with tinted windows and a Deputy Prime Minister claimed the former strongman had been arrested, no one saw him get in or out of any of the vehicles.</p> <p>It seemed unlikely the government would have captured him and let him go so easily, although some Belgraders wondered if the army leadership had threatened a coup to protect him. A court official tried yesterday to deliver the summons for the former leader to appear before the investigating judge but Milosevic refused it, saying 'I do not recognise these police and these authorities. All of them are Nato servants'.</p> <p>The government then turned to force. Just before 3am reporters saw armed men get out of a white van and leap the boundary wall of the villa. Gunfire was exchanged between the raiders and men inside the house, and most of the raiders retreated. Two policemen and one civilian was injured.</p> <p>The Police Minister, Dusan Mihajlovic, said the raid was thwarted by the head of the army unit guarding the ex-President's home. Milosevic told police who went to negotiate with him that 'he will not be taken to prison alive,' Mihajlovic said.</p> <p>The government accepted the stand-off. 'If we used force, there would be victims', the Police Minister added.</p> <p>Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian Prime Minister, who has been masterminding the operations said he had intelligence reports that the villa was packed with ammunition, arms and explosives.Zoran Djindjic, the Prime Minister, later denied that Milosevic had ever been taken to the Palace of Justice.</p> <p>To deny the rumours of his arrest, Milosevic briefly appeared outside the back gate of his villa to talk to the group of about 50 loyal supporters who have kept a vigil for several days. 'We are the popular guard. What is happening here is a great tragedy. We are not war criminals. The man who resisted Nato is a hero,' an elderly man told me. He identified himself as Dragomir Majkic, deputy chairman of a Belgrade branch of the Socialist Party.</p> <p>A few from the crowd were allowed into the villa. 'At the moment I am drinking coffee with my friends and I am very well,' Milosevic told a local radio station by telephone.</p> <p>A court official tried to deliver the summons to appear before the investigating judge but Milosevic refused it, saying: 'I do not recognise these police and these authorities. All of them are Nato servants.'</p> <p>The government then turned to force. Shortly before 3am reporters saw a white van drive up from which armed men emerged. They leapt over the villa wall. Gunfire was exchanged and the invaders retreated. Two policemen and one civilian were injured.</p> <p>Mihailovic said the raid had been thwarted by the head of the army unit guarding Milosevic's villa.</p> <p>The officer, told by police to reduce the size of Milosevic's official bodyguard to just one, had given the keys to the compound to Milosevic's private guards. He said a meeting had been held, 'but the problem could not be solved because of army obstruction'.</p> <p>Milosevic had told police who went to negotiate with him that 'he will not be taken to prison alive'.</p> <p>His private bodyguards are under the command of Sinisa Vucinic, a top member of the Yugoslav Left (JUL), which was founded by Mira Markovic, Milosevic's wife. She was in the villa with him.</p> <p>But the government accepted the stand-off. 'If we used force, there would be victims,' the Police Minister said. Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian Prime Minister, said he had intelligence reports that the villa was full of ammunition, arms and explosives.</p> <p>President Vojislav Kostunica summoned an emergency meeting of top military commanders and senior politicians yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader who launched a decade of carnage in the Balkans, was holed up in his villa last night with a score of heavily armed gunmen for protection, and vowing he would 'not go to prison alive'. His threat to self-destruct or go down fighting had an eerie ring, coming from a man whose parents both committed suicide and who started - and lost - more wars than any other modern ruler. More than 250,000 people died in Bosnia and Kosovo. It came as the Serbian government announced that the former ruler, who tried to cling to power by falsifying election results, faced charges of corruption and abuse of power. He refused to accept a summons and ordered his guards to prevent his arrest by force. A die-hard group of flag-waving civilian supporters gathered outside the house, denouncing the government as traitors and swearing at foreign journalists. Last night the government announced that Milosevic was under house arrest until he agreed to appear before an investigating judge. 'When employees of the Ministry of Interior estimate it is possible to carry out the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic, it will be done. He will either come in by himself or we will take him in, with or without force,' said Dusan Mihailovic, of the Interior Ministry. He added there was no current plan to send Milosevic to the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which has indicted him for atrocities committed in Kosovo in 1999. Mihailovic's declaration was an effort to regain dignity for the government after a clumsy effort by special armed police to break into the villa early yesterday. Speculation about Milosevic's imminent arrest was started by a loyalist MP from his Socialist Party last Friday afternoon. Police cars and an ambulance moved up to the villa's front entrance. Some hours later a convoy of four black Jeeps, one with tinted windows, drove to the Palace of Justice. It returned to the villa an hour later. Although radio stations reported Milosevic was in the car with tinted windows and a Deputy Prime Minister claimed the former strongman had been arrested, no one saw him get in or out of any of the vehicles. It seemed unlikely the government would have captured him and let him go so easily, although some Belgraders wondered if the army leadership had threatened a coup to protect him. A court official tried yesterday to deliver the summons for the former leader to appear before the investigating judge but Milosevic refused it, saying 'I do not recognise these police and these authorities. All of them are Nato servants'. The government then turned to force. Just before 3am reporters saw armed men get out of a white van and leap the boundary wall of the villa. Gunfire was exchanged between the raiders and men inside the house, and most of the raiders retreated. Two policemen and one civilian was injured. The Police Minister, Dusan Mihajlovic, said the raid was thwarted by the head of the army unit guarding the ex-President's home. Milosevic told police who went to negotiate with him that 'he will not be taken to prison alive,' Mihajlovic said. The government accepted the stand-off. 'If we used force, there would be victims', the Police Minister added. Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian Prime Minister, who has been masterminding the operations said he had intelligence reports that the villa was packed with ammunition, arms and explosives.Zoran Djindjic, the Prime Minister, later denied that Milosevic had ever been taken to the Palace of Justice. To deny the rumours of his arrest, Milosevic briefly appeared outside the back gate of his villa to talk to the group of about 50 loyal supporters who have kept a vigil for several days. 'We are the popular guard. What is happening here is a great tragedy. We are not war criminals. The man who resisted Nato is a hero,' an elderly man told me. He identified himself as Dragomir Majkic, deputy chairman of a Belgrade branch of the Socialist Party. A few from the crowd were allowed into the villa. 'At the moment I am drinking coffee with my friends and I am very well,' Milosevic told a local radio station by telephone. A court official tried to deliver the summons to appear before the investigating judge but Milosevic refused it, saying: 'I do not recognise these police and these authorities. All of them are Nato servants.' The government then turned to force. Shortly before 3am reporters saw a white van drive up from which armed men emerged. They leapt over the villa wall. Gunfire was exchanged and the invaders retreated. Two policemen and one civilian were injured. Mihailovic said the raid had been thwarted by the head of the army unit guarding Milosevic's villa. The officer, told by police to reduce the size of Milosevic's official bodyguard to just one, had given the keys to the compound to Milosevic's private guards. He said a meeting had been held, 'but the problem could not be solved because of army obstruction'. Milosevic had told police who went to negotiate with him that 'he will not be taken to prison alive'. His private bodyguards are under the command of Sinisa Vucinic, a top member of the Yugoslav Left (JUL), which was founded by Mira Markovic, Milosevic's wife. She was in the villa with him. But the government accepted the stand-off. 'If we used force, there would be victims,' the Police Minister said. Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian Prime Minister, said he had intelligence reports that the villa was full of ammunition, arms and explosives. President Vojislav Kostunica summoned an emergency meeting of top military commanders and senior politicians yesterday. Afterwards, looking sombre and flanked by them all, he said they had agreed completely: 'Our purpose is to calm tensions. We want to prevent a state crisis. Whoever shoots at the police or commits crimes has to answer to the law. No one is above it, not even Slobodan Milosevic. One individual should not endanger the state and the system.' The President did not directly say Milosevic would be arrested soon, but that was the clear implication. During the day supporters were again allowed to approach the villa but their numbers had dwindled. Some Serbs were upset at the way the police bungled Milosevic's attempted detention. Others were annoyed that the government had acted on the eve of an American deadline for action.

Six Palestinians were buried after the bloodiest clashes since mid-February, as Israel begins to enact its hardline policies.</p> <p>'There had been a policy of restraint which in my view is over,' the Israeli Defence Minister, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, told Israel's Channel Two television.</p> <p>As the flag-draped coffins were borne out of the mosques by chanting crowds, popular anger was directed not only at Israel but at the US, which the Palestinians accuse of a double betrayal in a week when Yasser Arafat's residence in Gaza City was hit by Israeli missiles.</p> <p>Several key Gulf allies of the US, and lynchpins of its policy aim of forging regional stability, also accuse the administration of encouraging Israel by vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution to send an international force to protect the Palestinians, and for President Bush's blunt demand that Arafat condemn violence.</p> <p>'The blatant US bias towards Israel and its repressive practices against the Palestinian people... reveals the contempt of the United States towards Arab feelings and human rights,' wrote the al-Bayan newspaper of the United Arab Emirates yesterday. In Saudi Arabia, the al-Madina newspaper said the US veto was a blatant attempt to prevent anybody from arresting Israeli violence. 'This honest (peace) broker does not want anybody to intervene in the ring of death to ensure that the result was in favour of the stronger party,' it said.</p> <p>Many Palestinians believe that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon travelled to Washington last month with the express purpose of winning US approval for tough new methods aimed at snuffing out an uprising in which nearly 450 people have died, almost all of them Arabs.</p> <p>'Israel would not have dared to go ahead with the shellings and escalation without American approval, and without American consent on the use of its weapons, including the Apache helicopters,' said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council. 'We know they have an agreement not to surprise each other, and Israel immediately let the cat out of the bag when it said it told the Americans ahead of time.'</p> <p>In Tel Aviv, a spokesman for the US embassy denied Ashrawi's claims that Washington had approved Wednesday night's air attacks on Ramallah and Gaza City. 'I want to make clear that there is no coordination between the United States and Israel with regard to their military actions against the Palestinians,' a spokesman said.</p> <p>Among Palestinians, the American interventions last week are a bitter disappointment. They had taken hope from the new administration's public disavowal of President Clinton's micro-management of the peace process. 'On the one hand, the Americans say they do not want to intervene in the peace process. They want to leave it to both sides,' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestinian negotiator.</p> <p>'But on the other hand, they are intervening in a very biased way when it comes to condemning the Palestinians. We feel this is not a good beginning for the new American administration.'</p> <p>The latest US affront to Palestinian sensibilities arrived on Thursday, at about the same time as Arafat was touring the still smouldering site of Israel's missile attack, where four trailers in a dormitory for his Force 17 personal security guard where reduced to ruins.</p> <p>'The signal I am sending to the Palestinians is stop the violence,' Bush told a press conference in Washington. 'I can't make it any more clear, and I hope that Chairman Arafat hears it loud and clear.' Bush made a similar call to Sharon, but his balancing act failed when he issued this directive to Arafat. 'The Palestinian leader needs to speak out publicly and forcefully in a language the Palestinians can understand to condemn the violence and terror.'</p> <p>For Palestinians, the blunt language added to the snub delivered by Bush's pointed refusal to set a date for a meeting with Arafat, a huge insult for the man who was the most frequent foreign visitor to Washington during the Clinton administration.</p> <p>'This way of putting things, and trying to dictate things, is humiliating to ordinary Palestinians,' Abed Rabbo said. 'It makes it even more difficult for Mr Arafat to deal with such an idea or such a suggestion.'</p> <p>That certainly seemed so yesterday when the commander of Arafat's militias in the West Bank, Hussein Sheikh, threatened to take the uprising inside the borders of the Jewish state.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,465510,00.html\"> 30.3.2001: Arafat defies pressure to call off Palestinian uprising</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,465524,00.html\">Bomber 'driven mad' by Israelis shelling</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,464922,00.html\">29.03.2001: Israelis blast Arafat's HQ</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,465265,00.html\">29.03.2001: Comment: Talk of war</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,464913,00.html\">29.03.2001: 'I saw my friends blown apart'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,464359,00.html\">28.03.2001: Israel vows to avenge killing of baby</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,464080,00.html\">27.03.2001: Palestinian suicide bomber attacks Jerusalem</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com/\" target=\"_new\" http: www.austarab.com.au arab_league \">Member countries of the Arab League</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jordantimes.com/Mon/\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Times</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pna.net/\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",

'There had been a policy of restraint which in my view is over,' the Israeli Defence Minister, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, told Israel's Channel Two television. As the flag-draped coffins were borne out of the mosques by chanting crowds, popular anger was directed not only at Israel but at the US, which the Palestinians accuse of a double betrayal in a week when Yasser Arafat's residence in Gaza City was hit by Israeli missiles. Several key Gulf allies of the US, and lynchpins of its policy aim of forging regional stability, also accuse the administration of encouraging Israel by vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution to send an international force to protect the Palestinians, and for President Bush's blunt demand that Arafat condemn violence. 'The blatant US bias towards Israel and its repressive practices against the Palestinian people... reveals the contempt of the United States towards Arab feelings and human rights,' wrote the al-Bayan newspaper of the United Arab Emirates yesterday. In Saudi Arabia, the al-Madina newspaper said the US veto was a blatant attempt to prevent anybody from arresting Israeli violence. 'This honest (peace) broker does not want anybody to intervene in the ring of death to ensure that the result was in favour of the stronger party,' it said. Many Palestinians believe that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon travelled to Washington last month with the express purpose of winning US approval for tough new methods aimed at snuffing out an uprising in which nearly 450 people have died, almost all of them Arabs. 'Israel would not have dared to go ahead with the shellings and escalation without American approval, and without American consent on the use of its weapons, including the Apache helicopters,' said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council. 'We know they have an agreement not to surprise each other, and Israel immediately let the cat out of the bag when it said it told the Americans ahead of time.' In Tel Aviv, a spokesman for the US embassy denied Ashrawi's claims that Washington had approved Wednesday night's air attacks on Ramallah and Gaza City. 'I want to make clear that there is no coordination between the United States and Israel with regard to their military actions against the Palestinians,' a spokesman said. Among Palestinians, the American interventions last week are a bitter disappointment. They had taken hope from the new administration's public disavowal of President Clinton's micro-management of the peace process. 'On the one hand, the Americans say they do not want to intervene in the peace process. They want to leave it to both sides,' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestinian negotiator. 'But on the other hand, they are intervening in a very biased way when it comes to condemning the Palestinians. We feel this is not a good beginning for the new American administration.' The latest US affront to Palestinian sensibilities arrived on Thursday, at about the same time as Arafat was touring the still smouldering site of Israel's missile attack, where four trailers in a dormitory for his Force 17 personal security guard where reduced to ruins. 'The signal I am sending to the Palestinians is stop the violence,' Bush told a press conference in Washington. 'I can't make it any more clear, and I hope that Chairman Arafat hears it loud and clear.' Bush made a similar call to Sharon, but his balancing act failed when he issued this directive to Arafat. 'The Palestinian leader needs to speak out publicly and forcefully in a language the Palestinians can understand to condemn the violence and terror.' For Palestinians, the blunt language added to the snub delivered by Bush's pointed refusal to set a date for a meeting with Arafat, a huge insult for the man who was the most frequent foreign visitor to Washington during the Clinton administration. 'This way of putting things, and trying to dictate things, is humiliating to ordinary Palestinians,' Abed Rabbo said. 'It makes it even more difficult for Mr Arafat to deal with such an idea or such a suggestion.' That certainly seemed so yesterday when the commander of Arafat's militias in the West Bank, Hussein Sheikh, threatened to take the uprising inside the borders of the Jewish state.

No amount of waffle about tradition, ritual, art, silken kimonos, tea ceremonies, and all those other things that make ignorant, sensation-greedy Westerners go weak at the knees, has been able to disguise the ethical fungus at the heart of geisha culture. We are always hearing that these white-faced dollies are not 'strictly prostitutes' and Western tourists are happy to snap away at these willow-pattern workers in a way they never would at the women of King's Cross.

Which explains why it would be impossible to transplant the geisha on to Western society. Our prostitutes would do the sex, in a skimpy kimono if necessary (whatever!), but they'd doubtless draw the line at putting the kettle on afterwards.</p> <p>Bearing this in mind, if we are to look for geisha-parallels in Western culture, maybe we should stop gawping at the streets of King's Cross and look inside the staid homesteads of suburbia, as well as the 'self help' industry which serves them. For, it seems to me, that, unlike hookers, ordinary women of the West seem more than happy to go a bit 'geisha' if that's what it takes to rescue their sham-relationships. If you don't accept that, then just think about how often we've heard that domesticity is the new destiny, or subservience is the new pashmina? If you still don't buy it, then take a look at the latest of these tomes to be published here, The Surrendered Wife by US housewife and self-styled 'feminist and former shrew' Laura Doyle. Then find me a prostitute who would lower herself to read it.</p> <p>Self-help books have long been the amyl nitrite, the gay-disco 'poppers', of the female psyche - addictive in their own way, but decimating millions of brain cells with every sour, hectoring, ill-informed hit. Such tomes like to give the lie that male-female dynamics can be handled like Rubik's Cubes - a few clumsy twists and it's all solved - and The Surrendered Wife is no different. Having read Doyle's book, and seen her ranting on Richard and Judy, I can tell you that she dresses up 'surrendering' very prettily, but, basically, she is arguing that bovine is the new emancipated. In her view, the woman should hand over financial power to the man, obey even if she doesn't agree, and say yes to sex even if she doesn't feel like it. And if the man doesn't feel like sex? 'Put on a negligee and lay on the bed with a book,' purrs Doyle. Down boys!</p> <p>When relinquishing financial power, and kowtowing to men is suddenly promoted as the fashionable lifestyle choice, you know it's all gone horribly wrong. Moreover, at least the classic geishas got to exude mystery and history. Now we get twinsetted harridans sitting on daytime-TV sofas telling other women that the way forward is to lie around in baby doll nighties, reading improving literature.</p> <p>Indeed, what's really interesting about all this is not how successful The Surrendered Wife is (there's a sucker born every moment and we're all watching Richard and Judy), nor how little it takes to throw generations of hard-won autonomy away, but how mundane and dowdy they have made geisha-style behaviour seem. Not to mention ugly and stupid. Even the dumbest hooker on the street knows where to draw the line between sex and love, and how to build a spiritual wall between her job and her essential self. By contrast, in the case of the geishas, both of the classic Eastern and new-style Western varieties, femininity itself seems to be up for sale.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Bearing this in mind, if we are to look for geisha-parallels in Western culture, maybe we should stop gawping at the streets of King's Cross and look inside the staid homesteads of suburbia, as well as the 'self help' industry which serves them. For, it seems to me, that, unlike hookers, ordinary women of the West seem more than happy to go a bit 'geisha' if that's what it takes to rescue their sham-relationships. If you don't accept that, then just think about how often we've heard that domesticity is the new destiny, or subservience is the new pashmina? If you still don't buy it, then take a look at the latest of these tomes to be published here, The Surrendered Wife by US housewife and self-styled 'feminist and former shrew' Laura Doyle. Then find me a prostitute who would lower herself to read it. Self-help books have long been the amyl nitrite, the gay-disco 'poppers', of the female psyche - addictive in their own way, but decimating millions of brain cells with every sour, hectoring, ill-informed hit. Such tomes like to give the lie that male-female dynamics can be handled like Rubik's Cubes - a few clumsy twists and it's all solved - and The Surrendered Wife is no different. Having read Doyle's book, and seen her ranting on Richard and Judy, I can tell you that she dresses up 'surrendering' very prettily, but, basically, she is arguing that bovine is the new emancipated. In her view, the woman should hand over financial power to the man, obey even if she doesn't agree, and say yes to sex even if she doesn't feel like it. And if the man doesn't feel like sex? 'Put on a negligee and lay on the bed with a book,' purrs Doyle. Down boys! When relinquishing financial power, and kowtowing to men is suddenly promoted as the fashionable lifestyle choice, you know it's all gone horribly wrong. Moreover, at least the classic geishas got to exude mystery and history. Now we get twinsetted harridans sitting on daytime-TV sofas telling other women that the way forward is to lie around in baby doll nighties, reading improving literature. Indeed, what's really interesting about all this is not how successful The Surrendered Wife is (there's a sucker born every moment and we're all watching Richard and Judy), nor how little it takes to throw generations of hard-won autonomy away, but how mundane and dowdy they have made geisha-style behaviour seem. Not to mention ugly and stupid. Even the dumbest hooker on the street knows where to draw the line between sex and love, and how to build a spiritual wall between her job and her essential self. By contrast, in the case of the geishas, both of the classic Eastern and new-style Western varieties, femininity itself seems to be up for sale. \u0095 barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk",

The Open at Muirfield in 1972 and Jack Nicklaus, having won the USPGA the year before and that year's Masters and US Open, had the chance for the only time in his record-breaking career to hold all four Major titles at the same time. To have beaten the world's best over 288 holes of golf in four consecutive titles. To ensure the victory roster read Nicklaus, Nicklaus, Nicklaus and Nicklaus. It would be an unprecedented achievement in the modern game. </p> <p>In 1930 Bobby Jones had pulled off what way back then was described as 'the impregnable quadrilateral', but that was in the days when the Grand Slam included the US Amateur and British Amateur rather than The Masters and PGA. This is not to denigrate the achievement about which Jones wrote: 'I have been frequently confronted with the question, \"Had I started out the year 1930 with the expectations or even hope of winning four major Championships?\" I did not feel like saying that I had, because I felt reluctant to admit that I considered myself capable of such an accomplishment. Actually I did make my plans for that golfing year with precisely that end in view.' </p> <p>Then, in 1953, Ben Hogan won all six tournaments he entered and might have won the Grand Slam had it not moved on from being impregnable to logistically impossible. The final match of the PGA tournament clashed with the second day of qualifying for the Open at Carnoustie at a time when everyone had to qualify. </p> <p>So come 1972, with the '71 PGA already bagged, Nicklaus was set fair for a crack at the impossible challenge. He would write about looking forward to that year's itinerary: 'You always play your best on courses you like the most. Augusta National is Augusta National, enough said; Pebble Beach is my favourite course; Muirfield is the finest course outside the US.' When asked if it was possible to win all four, he replied 'yes' with no hesitation and complete assurance. He was happy to answer the question Bobby Jones had ducked. </p> <p>Nicklaus won the 1972 Masters by three strokes, leading for all four rounds and ending up the only player under par for the tournament. It was convincing but not overly so. Nicklaus had led by five shots at the 11th and then three- putted three of the next four greens. He said afterwards: 'Trying to play safe is the worst thing in the world. I don't think I'd have looked so bad there at the last if I'd been forced to throw the ball at the hole.' </p> <p>At Pebble Beach, Nicklaus again led from the off and was four clear going into the final nine. Again he stumbled and by the 12th Arnold Palmer had narrowed the lead to one shot. Then, at the par-three 17th, Nicklaus's one-iron hit the pin and the ball stopped five inches from the cup. Again he won by three strokes. There was only one side of the quadrilateral to go. Pat Ward-Thomas wrote in The Guardian that victory at Muirfield would be 'achievement enough to inspire wonder for generations to come'. He went on to suggest that Big Jack would be 'an even money chance' to win both the remaining Majors. Not even Tiger is that short a price. </p> <p>Nicklaus said his plan was for 'an analytical, careful, conservative game, particularly in the Major championships which, I have learnt, are far more often lost than won.' His meticulous preparation was undone by an unsuitable pillow which left him with a pain in the neck. He resolved to be more cautious and to carry his own pillow on his travels. </p> <p>Nicklaus shot a 70 in the opening round. For the first time in that year's Majors he was behind the field, the honour falling to an unknown Yorkshireman, Peter Topping. Nicklaus followed up with a 72 and a 71 to leave himself five behind Tony Jacklin and six behind Trevino, who chipped in from a bunker at 16 and chipped in again at the 18th for his fifth consecutive birdie and a score of 66. </p> <p>On Saturday morning the pain in Nicklaus's neck had eased and, reckoning that he would need no worse than a 65 to win the tournament, he told his wife over breakfast: 'I'm going to win.' He played, by his own estimation, 'a nearly flawless back nine', with birdies the 2nd and 3rd and two par fives. He then birdied 10 and 11 to move to six under and into the lead. </p> <p>'The running and roaring of the crowd became incredible,' he remembers. 'It was sending shivers down my back, there was a lump in my throat and tears on my cheeks. It fuelled my soaring confidence and I narrowly missed making my third consecutive birdie.' When he reached the 16th: 'I had a flashback to the final round in 1966 at Muirfield when I was tied for the lead and said I needed 3,4,4 to win and that is what happened.' This time he missed a six-footer to bogey the hole, failed to birdie 17th, and parred the last. He had shot a 66 . </p> <p>Back down the field, Trevino and Jacklin were a shot ahead, standing on the 17th tee. Trevino drove into a bunker and finally made it to the fringe at the back of the green in four. Jacklin was 30 yards short of the green in two. As they approached the green, Trevino said to Jacklin: 'I'm through - it's all yours.' Jacklin hit a pitch to 18ft. Trevino chipped in. Jacklin three-putted. Trevino had won by a stroke. Jacklin would never compete in a Major again. Nicklaus congratulated Trevino and then went out and played tennis. </p> <p>'The frustration and disappointment are more intense than I care to remember even now, a quarter of a century later,' he wrote. His Majors record from the start of 1971 read: second, second, fifth, first, first, first, second. Some streak. Unrepeatable, it was assumed - even Nicklaus never won back-to-back Majors again. </p> <p>Had he been slightly less conservative, he might have conquered the quadrilateral. In 1973, having criticised Nicklaus for often 'pussyfooting around with irons off the tee', The Observer's Peter Dobereiner continued: 'One day a Super-Nicklaus will come along with no such inhibitions. Just imagine a golfer hellbent on blasting the cover off the ball with his driver and who then aimed to knock the flagstick out of the cup with his approach shot and who, moreover, had the technical ability to make this policy work. Once or twice a year Nicklaus is forced to play like this and when he does golf becomes a different game. One day there will surely be a player for whom such golf is normal. Then the whole specious Nicklaus-Jones argument can start again, except that it will be whether the new hero is as good as Nicklaus.' Enter Tiger Woods. </p>",

      "byline": "Philip French",

      "body": "<p>One of the great clich\u00e9s of our time is to refer to something as 'the last taboo'. The current Private Eye comes up with 13 examples found in the Guardian alone these past three years referring to subjects as different as female masturbation and reusing graves. Jean-Pierre Sinapi's Uneasy Riders, so its publicity material proclaims, 'confronts and overturns a final taboo: the right of the disabled to sex and love'.</p> <p>Is this claim entirely true? There is, as I recall, a scene in Fanny Hill where the eponymous heroine and colleague have sex with a prodigiously endowed simpleton. More seriously, not to say solemnly, the cinema has in the past 50 years touched on the subject, if necessarily circumspectly, in such films as Fred Zinnemann's The Men and Hal Ashby's Coming Home, and there's the wonderful scene in Fellini's Amarcord where the insane uncle, on day release from an institution, climbs a tree and shouts out: 'I want a women' until he's coaxed down and taken away. </p> <p>It is the case, however, that Sinapi confronts the sexuality of the handicapped with a rare frankness and good humour that has commended itself to the public and critics alike. His movie picked up the audience prizes at San Sebastian and Berlin last year, and at the London Film Festival it won the International Critics prize and the Satyajit Ray Award. </p> <p>The film is set in a small, liberal residential hospital in Provence near a main road (the film's French title is Nationale 7) where the physically and mentally disabled mingle freely with a tolerant staff. Shot on digital video, it has the texture of a documentary and, in fact, a number of the supporting cast are disabled people, though in some cases acting as if they have different disabilities from their own. </p> <p>The institution's problem child is Ren\u00e9, a bearded malcontent in his late forties, confined to a wheelchair and raging eloquently and obscenely against the world and the hospital's staff. Not for him the bus trips to Lourdes. He'd rather stay in his room surrounded by coloured pin-ups and watching hardcore videos. Then one day, in a vulnerable moment, he confesses to Julsie (Nadia Kaci), an attractive new nurse, that he'd like to experience a prostitute before he dies. </p> <p>She broaches the matter at a staff meeting and tensions come to the fore, though only the practising Catholics are able to articulate their objections. So Julie pushes ahead and makes some discoveries, one of them being that if she arranges for a prostitute for Ren\u00e9, she could be charged with pimping, unless a doctor can be persuaded to state in writing that such services are physically and psychologically necessary. </p> <p>She visits the prostitutes plying their trade in camper-vans along Nationale 7, measuring their doors to see if they're accessible to wheelchairs. Finally, she settles on Florele (Nadine Marcovici), a strident no-nonsense whore of a sort that might once have been termed 'brazen' but would now be called 'feisty'. Florele transforms Ren\u00e9 and soon his fellow inmates are demanding similar therapy. </p> <p>There is much else going on at the home for Julie. A good-looking shrink is after her, but he's allergic to cats, so she has to get another would-be lover, the hospital's janitor, to take her cat for a month. There's also a problem with a second wheelchair-borne patient, the retarded Rabah (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui from La Haine and Hideous Kinky), a gay Arab obsessed with Johnny Halliday. The local priest and a Catholic nurse are preparing Rabah for baptism, but a complication arises when he decides that he wants as his godmother at the ceremony the whore Florele. </p> <p>The movie ends before some of the long-term problems can be confronted, and its tone is perfectly expressed in the sight of the priest and the whore jiving together at the home's New Year's Eve 2000 party, as if Christ and Mary Magdalene had taken to the dance floor. But it's a wonderfully warm, funny picture, full of generosity and goodwill, and very well acted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the great clich\u00e9s of our time is to refer to something as 'the last taboo'. The current Private Eye comes up with 13 examples found in the Guardian alone these past three years referring to subjects as different as female masturbation and reusing graves. Jean-Pierre Sinapi's Uneasy Riders, so its publicity material proclaims, 'confronts and overturns a final taboo: the right of the disabled to sex and love'. Is this claim entirely true? There is, as I recall, a scene in Fanny Hill where the eponymous heroine and colleague have sex with a prodigiously endowed simpleton. More seriously, not to say solemnly, the cinema has in the past 50 years touched on the subject, if necessarily circumspectly, in such films as Fred Zinnemann's The Men and Hal Ashby's Coming Home, and there's the wonderful scene in Fellini's Amarcord where the insane uncle, on day release from an institution, climbs a tree and shouts out: 'I want a women' until he's coaxed down and taken away. It is the case, however, that Sinapi confronts the sexuality of the handicapped with a rare frankness and good humour that has commended itself to the public and critics alike. His movie picked up the audience prizes at San Sebastian and Berlin last year, and at the London Film Festival it won the International Critics prize and the Satyajit Ray Award. The film is set in a small, liberal residential hospital in Provence near a main road (the film's French title is Nationale 7) where the physically and mentally disabled mingle freely with a tolerant staff. Shot on digital video, it has the texture of a documentary and, in fact, a number of the supporting cast are disabled people, though in some cases acting as if they have different disabilities from their own. The institution's problem child is Ren\u00e9, a bearded malcontent in his late forties, confined to a wheelchair and raging eloquently and obscenely against the world and the hospital's staff. Not for him the bus trips to Lourdes. He'd rather stay in his room surrounded by coloured pin-ups and watching hardcore videos. Then one day, in a vulnerable moment, he confesses to Julsie (Nadia Kaci), an attractive new nurse, that he'd like to experience a prostitute before he dies. She broaches the matter at a staff meeting and tensions come to the fore, though only the practising Catholics are able to articulate their objections. So Julie pushes ahead and makes some discoveries, one of them being that if she arranges for a prostitute for Ren\u00e9, she could be charged with pimping, unless a doctor can be persuaded to state in writing that such services are physically and psychologically necessary. She visits the prostitutes plying their trade in camper-vans along Nationale 7, measuring their doors to see if they're accessible to wheelchairs. Finally, she settles on Florele (Nadine Marcovici), a strident no-nonsense whore of a sort that might once have been termed 'brazen' but would now be called 'feisty'. Florele transforms Ren\u00e9 and soon his fellow inmates are demanding similar therapy. There is much else going on at the home for Julie. A good-looking shrink is after her, but he's allergic to cats, so she has to get another would-be lover, the hospital's janitor, to take her cat for a month. There's also a problem with a second wheelchair-borne patient, the retarded Rabah (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui from La Haine and Hideous Kinky), a gay Arab obsessed with Johnny Halliday. The local priest and a Catholic nurse are preparing Rabah for baptism, but a complication arises when he decides that he wants as his godmother at the ceremony the whore Florele. The movie ends before some of the long-term problems can be confronted, and its tone is perfectly expressed in the sight of the priest and the whore jiving together at the home's New Year's Eve 2000 party, as if Christ and Mary Magdalene had taken to the dance floor. But it's a wonderfully warm, funny picture, full of generosity and goodwill, and very well acted.",

      "body": "<p>'Why Japan?' I've been asked for the past 20 years or so. Meaning: why has Japan been the setting for so much of my fiction? When I started writing about Japan, I'd answer by suggesting that Japan was about to become a very central, very important place in terms of the global economy. And it did. (Or rather, it already had, but most people hadn't noticed yet.) A little later, asked the same question, I'd say that it was Japan's turn to be the centre of the world, the place to which all roads lead; Japan was where the money was and the deal was done. Today, with the glory years of the bubble long gone, I'm still asked the same question, in exactly the same quizzical tone: 'Why Japan?' </p> <p>Because Japan is the global imagination's default setting for the future. </p> <p>The Japanese seem to the rest of us to live several measurable clicks down the time line. The Japanese are the ultimate Early Adaptors, and the sort of fiction I write behoves me to pay serious heed to that. If you believe, as I do, that all cultural change is essentially technologically driven, you pay attention to the Japanese. They've been doing it for more than a century now, and they really do have a head start on the rest of us, if only in terms of what we used to call 'future shock' (but which is now simply the one constant in all our lives). </p> <p>Consider the Mobile Girl, that ubiquitous feature of contemporary Tokyo street life: a schoolgirl busily, constantly messaging on her mobile phone (which she never uses for voice communication if she can avoid it). The Mobile Girl can convert pad strokes to kanji faster than should be humanly possible, and rates her standing in her cellular community according to the amount of numbers in her phone's memory. What is it that the Mobile Girls are so busily conveying to one another? Probably not much at all: the equivalent of a schoolgirl's note, passed behind the teacher's back. Content is not the issue here, but rather the speed, the weird unconscious surety, with which the schoolgirls of Tokyo took up a secondary feature (text messaging) of a new version of the cellular telephone, and generated, almost overnight, a micro-culture. </p> <p>A little over 100 years ago, the equivalent personal, portable techno-marvel in Tokyo would have been a mechanical watch. The printmakers of the Meiji period made a very large watch the satiric symbol of the Westernised dandy, and for the Japanese, clock-time was an entirely new continuum, a new reality. </p> <p>The techno-cultural suppleness that gives us Mobile Girls today, is the result of a traumatic and ongoing temporal dislocation that began when the Japanese, emerging in the 1860s from a very long period of deep cultural isolation, sent a posse of bright young noblemen off to England. These young men returned bearing word of an alien technological culture they must have found as marvellous, as disconcerting, as we might find the products of reverse-engineered Roswell space junk. These Modern Boys, as the techno-cult they spawned came popularly to be known, somehow induced the nation of Japan to swallow whole the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. The resulting spasms were violent, painful, and probably inconceivably disorienting. The Japanese bought the entire train-set: clock-time, steam railroads, electric telegraphy, Western medical advances. Set it all up and yanked the lever to full on. Went mad. Hallucinated. Babbled wildly. Ran in circles. Were destroyed. Were reborn. </p> <p>Were reborn, in fact, as the first industrialised nation in Asia. Which got them, not too many decades later, into empire-building expansionist mode, which eventually got them two of their larger cities vaporised, blown away by an enemy wielding a technology that might as well have come from a distant galaxy. </p> <p>And then that enemy, their conquerors, the Americans, turned up in person, smilingly intent on an astonishingly ambitious programme of cultural re-engineering. The Americans, bent on restructuring the national psyche from the roots up, inadvertently plunged the Japanese several clicks further along the time line. And then left, their grand project hanging fire, and went off to fight Communism instead. </p> <p>The result of this stupendous triple-whammy (catastrophic industrialisation, the war, the American occupation) is the Japan that delights, disturbs and fascinates us today: a mirror world, an alien planet we can actually do business with, a future. </p> <p>But had this happened to any other Asian country, I doubt the result would have been the same. Japanese culture is 'coded', in some wonderfully peculiar way that finds its nearest equivalent, I think, in English culture. And that is why the Japanese are subject to various kinds of Anglophilia, and vice versa. It accounts for the totemic significance, to the Japanese, of Burberry plaid, and for the number of Paul Smith outlets in Japan, and for much else besides. Both nations display a sort of fractal coherence of sign and symbol, all the way down into the weave of history. And Tokyo is very nearly, in its own way, as 'echoic' (to borrow Peter Ackroyd's term) a city as London. </p> <p>I've always felt that London is somehow the best place from which to observe Tokyo, perhaps because the British appreciation of things Japanese is the most entertaining. There is a certain tradition of 'Orientalia', of the faux-Oriental, that has been present here for a long time, and truly, there is something in the quality of a good translation that can never be captured in the original. </p> <p>London, being London and whatever else, eminently assured of its ability to do whatever it is that London's always done, can reflect Japan, distort it, enjoy it, in ways that Vancouver, where I live, never can. In Vancouver, we cater blandly to the Japanese, both to the tour-bus people with the ever-present cameras and to a delightful but utterly silent class of Japanese slackers. These latter seem to jump ship simply to be here, and can be seen daily about the city, in ones and twos, much as, I suspect, you or I might seem to the residents of Puerto Vallarta. 'There they are again. I wonder what they might be thinking?' </p> <p>But we don't reflect them back. We don't have any equivalent of the robot sushi bar in Harvey Nichols, which is as perfectly 'Japanese' a thing as I've seen anywhere, and which probably wouldn't look nearly as cool if it had been built in Tokyo or Osaka. </p> <p>We don't have branches of Muji interspersed between our Starbucks (although I wish we did, because I'm running out of their excellent toothpaste). Muji is the perfect example of the sort of thing I'm thinking of, because it calls up a wonderful Japan that doesn't really exist. A Japan of the mind, where even toenail-clippers and plastic coat-hangers possess a Zen purity: functional, minimal, reasonably priced. I would very much like to visit the Japan that Muji evokes. I would vacation there and attain a new serenity, smooth and translucent, in perfect counterpoint to natural fabrics and unbleached cardboard.

      "bodyText": "'Why Japan?' I've been asked for the past 20 years or so. Meaning: why has Japan been the setting for so much of my fiction? When I started writing about Japan, I'd answer by suggesting that Japan was about to become a very central, very important place in terms of the global economy. And it did. (Or rather, it already had, but most people hadn't noticed yet.) A little later, asked the same question, I'd say that it was Japan's turn to be the centre of the world, the place to which all roads lead; Japan was where the money was and the deal was done. Today, with the glory years of the bubble long gone, I'm still asked the same question, in exactly the same quizzical tone: 'Why Japan?' Because Japan is the global imagination's default setting for the future. The Japanese seem to the rest of us to live several measurable clicks down the time line. The Japanese are the ultimate Early Adaptors, and the sort of fiction I write behoves me to pay serious heed to that. If you believe, as I do, that all cultural change is essentially technologically driven, you pay attention to the Japanese. They've been doing it for more than a century now, and they really do have a head start on the rest of us, if only in terms of what we used to call 'future shock' (but which is now simply the one constant in all our lives). Consider the Mobile Girl, that ubiquitous feature of contemporary Tokyo street life: a schoolgirl busily, constantly messaging on her mobile phone (which she never uses for voice communication if she can avoid it). The Mobile Girl can convert pad strokes to kanji faster than should be humanly possible, and rates her standing in her cellular community according to the amount of numbers in her phone's memory. What is it that the Mobile Girls are so busily conveying to one another? Probably not much at all: the equivalent of a schoolgirl's note, passed behind the teacher's back. Content is not the issue here, but rather the speed, the weird unconscious surety, with which the schoolgirls of Tokyo took up a secondary feature (text messaging) of a new version of the cellular telephone, and generated, almost overnight, a micro-culture. A little over 100 years ago, the equivalent personal, portable techno-marvel in Tokyo would have been a mechanical watch. The printmakers of the Meiji period made a very large watch the satiric symbol of the Westernised dandy, and for the Japanese, clock-time was an entirely new continuum, a new reality. The techno-cultural suppleness that gives us Mobile Girls today, is the result of a traumatic and ongoing temporal dislocation that began when the Japanese, emerging in the 1860s from a very long period of deep cultural isolation, sent a posse of bright young noblemen off to England. These young men returned bearing word of an alien technological culture they must have found as marvellous, as disconcerting, as we might find the products of reverse-engineered Roswell space junk. These Modern Boys, as the techno-cult they spawned came popularly to be known, somehow induced the nation of Japan to swallow whole the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. The resulting spasms were violent, painful, and probably inconceivably disorienting. The Japanese bought the entire train-set: clock-time, steam railroads, electric telegraphy, Western medical advances. Set it all up and yanked the lever to full on. Went mad. Hallucinated. Babbled wildly. Ran in circles. Were destroyed. Were reborn. Were reborn, in fact, as the first industrialised nation in Asia. Which got them, not too many decades later, into empire-building expansionist mode, which eventually got them two of their larger cities vaporised, blown away by an enemy wielding a technology that might as well have come from a distant galaxy. And then that enemy, their conquerors, the Americans, turned up in person, smilingly intent on an astonishingly ambitious programme of cultural re-engineering. The Americans, bent on restructuring the national psyche from the roots up, inadvertently plunged the Japanese several clicks further along the time line. And then left, their grand project hanging fire, and went off to fight Communism instead. The result of this stupendous triple-whammy (catastrophic industrialisation, the war, the American occupation) is the Japan that delights, disturbs and fascinates us today: a mirror world, an alien planet we can actually do business with, a future. But had this happened to any other Asian country, I doubt the result would have been the same. Japanese culture is 'coded', in some wonderfully peculiar way that finds its nearest equivalent, I think, in English culture. And that is why the Japanese are subject to various kinds of Anglophilia, and vice versa. It accounts for the totemic significance, to the Japanese, of Burberry plaid, and for the number of Paul Smith outlets in Japan, and for much else besides. Both nations display a sort of fractal coherence of sign and symbol, all the way down into the weave of history. And Tokyo is very nearly, in its own way, as 'echoic' (to borrow Peter Ackroyd's term) a city as London. I've always felt that London is somehow the best place from which to observe Tokyo, perhaps because the British appreciation of things Japanese is the most entertaining. There is a certain tradition of 'Orientalia', of the faux-Oriental, that has been present here for a long time, and truly, there is something in the quality of a good translation that can never be captured in the original. London, being London and whatever else, eminently assured of its ability to do whatever it is that London's always done, can reflect Japan, distort it, enjoy it, in ways that Vancouver, where I live, never can. In Vancouver, we cater blandly to the Japanese, both to the tour-bus people with the ever-present cameras and to a delightful but utterly silent class of Japanese slackers. These latter seem to jump ship simply to be here, and can be seen daily about the city, in ones and twos, much as, I suspect, you or I might seem to the residents of Puerto Vallarta. 'There they are again. I wonder what they might be thinking?' But we don't reflect them back. We don't have any equivalent of the robot sushi bar in Harvey Nichols, which is as perfectly 'Japanese' a thing as I've seen anywhere, and which probably wouldn't look nearly as cool if it had been built in Tokyo or Osaka. We don't have branches of Muji interspersed between our Starbucks (although I wish we did, because I'm running out of their excellent toothpaste). Muji is the perfect example of the sort of thing I'm thinking of, because it calls up a wonderful Japan that doesn't really exist. A Japan of the mind, where even toenail-clippers and plastic coat-hangers possess a Zen purity: functional, minimal, reasonably priced. I would very much like to visit the Japan that Muji evokes. I would vacation there and attain a new serenity, smooth and translucent, in perfect counterpoint to natural fabrics and unbleached cardboard. My toiletries would pretend to be nothing more than what they are, and neither would I. (If Mujiland exists anywhere, it's probably not in Japan. If anywhere, it may actually be here, in London.) Because we don't reflect them back, in Vancouver, they don't market to us in the same way they market to you. The trendy watch chains of London are the only places in the world, aside from Japan, where one can purchase the almost-very-latest Japan-only product from Casio and Seiko. Because Japanese manufacturers know that you see them, in London. They know that you get it. They know that you are a market. I like to watch the Japanese in Portobello market.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://booktalk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee80607\">Ask Pat Barker a question</a></p> <p><strong> Observer: </strong> What is Border Crossing about?</p> <p><strong> Pat Barker: </strong> The young man at the centre of it, Danny Miller, is about 23. When he was 10, he committed murder. What interests me is not so much his violence as the fact that he has this particular personality structure, where it's very difficult for him to know where he stops and other people start. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Was there a specific moment of inspiration?</p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> It must be the only novel that has ever started in a television interview. This young man said, 'I have a severe borderline personality disorder, and that is why I'm good at interviewing people.' I was fascinated.</p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> What did you mean to convey by Border Crossing?</p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> The fact of Danny's success, of a young man who is trying to cross over into territory that doesn't belong to him, to control his therapist. When he succeeds, he crosses the border. Simultaneously, the therapist, Tom, loses clinical detachment and becomes over-involved, and in the end complicit. It's the story of a good man sliding into complicity with evil. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Your work shows a great interest in psychotherapy and psychological states. Why is that? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> That balance between involvement and detachment is what novelists do. It's the ideal relationship between a novelist and a character, I think, total involvement and identity and empathy, stopping short of being autobiographical - in my case, anyway - but also quite detached. In some ways, the therapists in my novels are actually standing in for that. And the same would be true of all of the mediums of the books, of which there are an almost indecent number. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Do the mediums come from your family ? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Well, it's through all the generations. My grandmother's first husband was a spiritualist medium. What fascinates me about that is the balance between conviction and sincerity and trickery, which is also something that novelists are very familiar with. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Initially, Border Crossing seems to be built on an outrageous coincidence. Was that a technical problem? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> It is tricky, yes. You can't have a coincidence at the beginning... well, I mean, perhaps you can have a coincidence in the first chapter. You certainly can't resolve the book on a coincidence. </p> <p><strong>Obs: </strong> On page 17, you write that, 'A coincidence is the crack in human affairs that lets God or the devil in...' </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I couldn't resist the aphorism. I don't think it means a damn thing. (Laughs) </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Do you believe in God? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I sometimes behave as if I do. I would find it hard to answer a bald 'Yes'. People ask me whether I believe in evil. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> And you always seem to be drawn to rather troubled characters. </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Isn't that true of novelists in general? If you're in a restaurant and one couple in the corner are having a really blazing row and are obviously in the last few hours of the relationship, and you've got a middle-aged couple holding hands at another table, you know which one you want to be. But which are you paying attention to? </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Do you think it's a good thing for a book to be topical? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Absolutely not. It may be a good thing for a book to be contemporary. But I think it's a disaster for a novel to be topical. There's nothing deader than last year's news story. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Do you do a lot of research? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I did an enormous amount for the [Regeneration] trilogy; very little research, really, for the other books. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> This is your tenth novel. Have you ever been tempted to explore other literary forms? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Tempted, yes, but not successfully. I suppose the likeliest thing for me to do is the short story. Can't write poetry - useless at that. What I get asked to do from time to time is screenplays. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> You like dialogue?</p> <p><strong>PB: </strong> I like being able to go inside the character at any moment. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> And do you like playing God in the novel? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I don't think I do play God, because I always ask questions I don't know the answers to. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Can you recall when you knew you wanted to be a writer? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I lived in Knaresborough at the time, and there's a wishing well. You dropped a penny and you wished. When I was 11, I dropped a penny in and wished to be a novelist. And my uncle bought me a pen. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> So it wasn't a secret wish ? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Even then, it was writing fiction that I wanted to do. My grandmother very sensibly said, 'Yes, but you've got to earn a living, dear.' There was a factory at the end of the street, so my idea at 11 was, I would work in the factory to earn my living, and I would write the novels in my spare time. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> And what kind of books did you read when you were growing up, ? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I didn't belong to the sort of family where the children's classics were laid on. I went to the public library and read everything I could get my hands on. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Were there books in your home? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> There was a shelf of encyclopedias which belonged to my grandfather. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Who are the writers you admire now? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Contemporary writers, mainly poetry: Hughes, Heaney, Simon Armitage, Glyn Maxwell. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> What do you take from poetry? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Intensity of language. When I'm writing the first draft, I'm writing in a very slovenly way: anything to get the outline of the story on paper. I think it's very useful at the end of the day to remind yourself of how precisely language can be used, so that you don't slip into too lax an approach. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> There's a comic sequence set in a provincial writing school which feels as though it's written from some kind of experience. </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> Yeah, it was an experience of being a student. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Do you think you can teach writing? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> What you do with a young writer is to recognise the note in their voice when they are on song for the first time and applaud. That's what Angela Carter did for me. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> What do you think is the purpose of fiction ? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> To enable people to think clearly and feel deeply about the same subject simultaneously. I don't believe it's froth on the surface. I think we were telling each other stories in a sort of disease-ridden, half-starved condition round the camp fire two and a half million years ago. It's a fundamental part of who we are. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Are you in the middle of your writing career? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I've no idea where I am in my career. If I get totally fed up with the promotion side of it, I may be close to the end. In terms of writing, I've quite good ideas for the next two books. The ideas don't seem to stop coming. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> What are you working on now? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I don't really want to talk about it. I want to keep the steam in the kettle. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Your last book, Another World, was also haunted by the First World War, but in Border Crossing you're much more contemporary. And your picture of childhood is quite bleak.</p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> In Another World the character of Gareth is almost a Danny Miller in the making. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Does that bleakness come from your own experience, from something in your own past? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> It wasn't an untroubled childhood, and it couldn't be. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> Why? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I... I... I had no father; I didn't know who my father was. I was told he was dead. He may... he may have been dead - I don't know. He may have been killed in the war. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> One might think that was a fantastic subject. Have you ever been tempted to explore your early life ? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> I've dipped into it, in a very disguised way, in several books. Even parts of Danny Miller are... I'm drawing on parts of my own childhood. </p> <p><strong> Obs: </strong> But you've never been tempted to explore your father's history or life? </p> <p><strong> PB: </strong> It wouldn't be possible. My mother didn't know who he was - which I found out on her deathbed. It was a very strange sensation, because it felt like losing two parents. She was already unconscious, on morphine. She was obviously going to die within a matter of hours. My sister told me. I knew instantly that it was the absolute truth. </p> <p>I felt so sad that it was a truth my mother had never been able to tell me. She couldn't say, 'I haven't a clue,' because that would have seemed to her utterly disgraceful. It would not have seemed disgraceful to me, and I would not have judged her or condemned her. I would have thought, in the circumstances of wartime, she had lost a man she cared for deeply. He'd been killed, and within a matter of six weeks she went out on the town, got drunk, and then who knows? Yes, yes.

      "bodyText": "Ask Pat Barker a question Observer: What is Border Crossing about? Pat Barker: The young man at the centre of it, Danny Miller, is about 23. When he was 10, he committed murder. What interests me is not so much his violence as the fact that he has this particular personality structure, where it's very difficult for him to know where he stops and other people start. Obs: Was there a specific moment of inspiration? PB: It must be the only novel that has ever started in a television interview. This young man said, 'I have a severe borderline personality disorder, and that is why I'm good at interviewing people.' I was fascinated. Obs: What did you mean to convey by Border Crossing? PB: The fact of Danny's success, of a young man who is trying to cross over into territory that doesn't belong to him, to control his therapist. When he succeeds, he crosses the border. Simultaneously, the therapist, Tom, loses clinical detachment and becomes over-involved, and in the end complicit. It's the story of a good man sliding into complicity with evil. Obs: Your work shows a great interest in psychotherapy and psychological states. Why is that? PB: That balance between involvement and detachment is what novelists do. It's the ideal relationship between a novelist and a character, I think, total involvement and identity and empathy, stopping short of being autobiographical - in my case, anyway - but also quite detached. In some ways, the therapists in my novels are actually standing in for that. And the same would be true of all of the mediums of the books, of which there are an almost indecent number. Obs: Do the mediums come from your family ? PB: Well, it's through all the generations. My grandmother's first husband was a spiritualist medium. What fascinates me about that is the balance between conviction and sincerity and trickery, which is also something that novelists are very familiar with. Obs: Initially, Border Crossing seems to be built on an outrageous coincidence. Was that a technical problem? PB: It is tricky, yes. You can't have a coincidence at the beginning... well, I mean, perhaps you can have a coincidence in the first chapter. You certainly can't resolve the book on a coincidence. Obs: On page 17, you write that, 'A coincidence is the crack in human affairs that lets God or the devil in...' PB: I couldn't resist the aphorism. I don't think it means a damn thing. (Laughs) Obs: Do you believe in God? PB: I sometimes behave as if I do. I would find it hard to answer a bald 'Yes'. People ask me whether I believe in evil. Obs: And you always seem to be drawn to rather troubled characters. PB: Isn't that true of novelists in general? If you're in a restaurant and one couple in the corner are having a really blazing row and are obviously in the last few hours of the relationship, and you've got a middle-aged couple holding hands at another table, you know which one you want to be. But which are you paying attention to? Obs: Do you think it's a good thing for a book to be topical? PB: Absolutely not. It may be a good thing for a book to be contemporary. But I think it's a disaster for a novel to be topical. There's nothing deader than last year's news story. Obs: Do you do a lot of research? PB: I did an enormous amount for the [Regeneration] trilogy; very little research, really, for the other books. Obs: This is your tenth novel. Have you ever been tempted to explore other literary forms? PB: Tempted, yes, but not successfully. I suppose the likeliest thing for me to do is the short story. Can't write poetry - useless at that. What I get asked to do from time to time is screenplays. Obs: You like dialogue? PB: I like being able to go inside the character at any moment. Obs: And do you like playing God in the novel? PB: I don't think I do play God, because I always ask questions I don't know the answers to. Obs: Can you recall when you knew you wanted to be a writer? PB: I lived in Knaresborough at the time, and there's a wishing well. You dropped a penny and you wished. When I was 11, I dropped a penny in and wished to be a novelist. And my uncle bought me a pen. Obs: So it wasn't a secret wish ? PB: Even then, it was writing fiction that I wanted to do. My grandmother very sensibly said, 'Yes, but you've got to earn a living, dear.' There was a factory at the end of the street, so my idea at 11 was, I would work in the factory to earn my living, and I would write the novels in my spare time. Obs: And what kind of books did you read when you were growing up, ? PB: I didn't belong to the sort of family where the children's classics were laid on. I went to the public library and read everything I could get my hands on. Obs: Were there books in your home? PB: There was a shelf of encyclopedias which belonged to my grandfather. Obs: Who are the writers you admire now? PB: Contemporary writers, mainly poetry: Hughes, Heaney, Simon Armitage, Glyn Maxwell. Obs: What do you take from poetry? PB: Intensity of language. When I'm writing the first draft, I'm writing in a very slovenly way: anything to get the outline of the story on paper. I think it's very useful at the end of the day to remind yourself of how precisely language can be used, so that you don't slip into too lax an approach. Obs: There's a comic sequence set in a provincial writing school which feels as though it's written from some kind of experience. PB: Yeah, it was an experience of being a student. Obs: Do you think you can teach writing? PB: What you do with a young writer is to recognise the note in their voice when they are on song for the first time and applaud. That's what Angela Carter did for me. Obs: What do you think is the purpose of fiction ? PB: To enable people to think clearly and feel deeply about the same subject simultaneously. I don't believe it's froth on the surface. I think we were telling each other stories in a sort of disease-ridden, half-starved condition round the camp fire two and a half million years ago. It's a fundamental part of who we are. Obs: Are you in the middle of your writing career? PB: I've no idea where I am in my career. If I get totally fed up with the promotion side of it, I may be close to the end. In terms of writing, I've quite good ideas for the next two books. The ideas don't seem to stop coming. Obs: What are you working on now? PB: I don't really want to talk about it. I want to keep the steam in the kettle. Obs: Your last book, Another World, was also haunted by the First World War, but in Border Crossing you're much more contemporary. And your picture of childhood is quite bleak. PB: In Another World the character of Gareth is almost a Danny Miller in the making. Obs: Does that bleakness come from your own experience, from something in your own past? PB: It wasn't an untroubled childhood, and it couldn't be. Obs: Why? PB: I... I... I had no father; I didn't know who my father was. I was told he was dead. He may... he may have been dead - I don't know. He may have been killed in the war. Obs: One might think that was a fantastic subject. Have you ever been tempted to explore your early life ? PB: I've dipped into it, in a very disguised way, in several books. Even parts of Danny Miller are... I'm drawing on parts of my own childhood. Obs: But you've never been tempted to explore your father's history or life? PB: It wouldn't be possible. My mother didn't know who he was - which I found out on her deathbed. It was a very strange sensation, because it felt like losing two parents. She was already unconscious, on morphine. She was obviously going to die within a matter of hours. My sister told me. I knew instantly that it was the absolute truth. I felt so sad that it was a truth my mother had never been able to tell me. She couldn't say, 'I haven't a clue,' because that would have seemed to her utterly disgraceful. It would not have seemed disgraceful to me, and I would not have judged her or condemned her. I would have thought, in the circumstances of wartime, she had lost a man she cared for deeply. He'd been killed, and within a matter of six weeks she went out on the town, got drunk, and then who knows? Yes, yes. It has taken me a long time to accept that my existence might not be an unqualified disaster. \u0095 A televised version of this interview will be shown on Artsworld this afternoon at 5pm.

      "body": "<p>On his wall are several large framed maps - his 'dream world', way out beyond this west London book-lined flat. When he is stuck for words he dwells on maps and imagines the shape of the earth and loses himself for a while. On the mantelpiece is a polished horseshoe that his grandfather, a blacksmith with eight children, made many decades ago, and a gun: small and toy-like, but in the hand cold and heavy. He picks it up and with a disconcertingly theatrical flourish, crouches slightly and aims it at the window, eyes owlishly blinking. </p> <p>On his neat desk, beside the pipe that is usually stuck firmly in his mouth and the cafetiere of strong, rich coffee (brewed to the same recipe for decades), is a hard-backed ledger/desk-diary (2001) in which he writes. He opens it up and shows me page after page of neat, looped script in blue ink. </p> <p>It's a first draft, which he then types out, blackens with corrections, types out again, blackens again, and so it goes on until he no longer thinks 'trash!' when he reads it through. 'It's a washing process,' he explains; you have to get rid of the clutter, endlessly simplify, make the language 'clear, simple, good'. And with each novel he thinks: 'It's killing me. Never, ever again!' Yet he continues because he 'has to. I write in order to keep on living. Because I don't want to die; be brain-dead, emotionally dead. I write to live.' </p> <p>It's all that Alan Sillitoe has done now for 50 years, written. He grew up in Nottingham in poverty. His father was an illiterate labourer, often unemployed, often drunk and violent, and he tyrannised the household. Sillitoe left school at 14, worked in factories, became an air traffic control assistant, joined the RAF, and then - all this by the age of 20, his life too like a melodramatic kind of fiction - discovered he had TB (often a killer, then). He spent 18 months in hospital, read widely and started to learn how to write. </p> <p>From the age of 14 Sillitoe had had girlfriends. In his autobiography he describes lying with his teenage lover in front of the fire, having sex, while upstairs her mother and boyfriend were doing the same thing. He wasn't always faithful, and he seemed to move from one sexual relationship to the next with carefree swiftness. But then one day, back from hospital, he met the American poet Ruth Fainlight in a bookshop. She was already married but they 'liked each other', spent more and more time together and eventually ran off together, abandoning England (a country he says he loves but sometimes doesn't like much) and her husband. They've been together ever since, and have been married for nearly 50 years. </p> <p>Over the next 10 years - all through his peripatetic twenties, when he lived with Ruth in France and Spain and wrote under orange trees - he wrote several novels. They were emphatically rejected by dozens of publishing houses, often coming back to him with no comment from the editor. Nevertheless, he put 'writer' on his passport and didn't think of giving up, and he can't tell me what gave him the faith to keep going. 'Call it an obsession,' he says. </p> <p>In his autobiography he compares it to being underground, picking away blindly at a seam. Without writing, he says, his head would have 'burst from sheer misery'. He thinks he would have gone on producing fiction for the next decade, the one after that even, if he had not been successful. 'What else could I do?' </p> <p>But, of course, he was successful. In Majorca Robert Graves encouraged him to write about what he knew: working-class life in Nottingham. When he was 30, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning was published (after several rejections, of course). Its anarchic hero, Arthur Seaton, is a factory worker in Nottingham: rebellious, dissatisfied, contemptuous of authority. With its descriptions of adultery, violence, poverty, attempted abortion even, the novel caused a thrilled uproar. Two years later it was made into Karel Reisz's landmark film. Sillitoe became known as one of the Angry Young Men (a label he loathes and despises), a working-class writer (a label he also hates), the uneducated raw talent from up North (ditto; he hates almost every label with a passion). </p> <p>After Saturday Night and Sunday Morning came the equally successful The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner . He has written dozens of novels since but none have achieved the same cult status. Fame - which he never came to terms with anyway; it is 'somehow derogatory, not made by you but by the world, and one does not much trust the world' - ebbed. The style in which he was writing - stalwartly realistic, provincial and plain - was new for a while, but then came to seem outmoded, thrown into the shade by dazzling postmodern and multicultural voices. Sillitoe says he does not mind, though at the same time concedes that Saturday Night has dogged him as a writer - like the rock groups who are asked to play ancient hits by their audience when they want to move on. He says. listen, he's written much better books since then. 'All that was 40 years ago.' </p> <p>So why has he now, after all these years of resisting, written a sequel, Birthday, in which Arthur Seaton reappears, middle-aged, married, full of memories? He pulls deeply on his pipe; his perky, lugubrious face is wreathed in smoke. Of course, he says, he was often asked to write Monday Night and Tuesday Morning, Tuesday Night and Wednesday Morning, and 'actually I did soon start writing a novel that continued the life of Arthur Seaton, but after about 100 pages, when I saw what I had, I thought: \"I can't do this. It's the easy way out.\" I always thought I'd do it some time. I can have an idea and let it sink down into the mulch of my mind and God knows what huggermugger and argy-bargy it's up to down there, but it can reappear 10, even 25 years later. So it was that Arthur Seaton nagged away at me. \"I'm still here, you know,\" he'd go. \"Get back to work.\" </p> <p>'And then, two or three years ago, I saw a way of doing it. I wanted to write about a woman whose husband had been injured in an industrial action and she looks after him for 20 years. And I wove the story of the Seaton brothers round her. I came at it obliquely - oblique is often the best way.' </p> <p> Birthday is a triptych. It begins with the return of Arthur Seaton's brother Brian from London for a seventieth birthday party of an old flame; moves to an offstage death; ends with life continuing. It is all about revisiting memories; about ageing but not quite growing up; about the difficulty of change; about settling for what you don't really want. It's not a bitter or a pessimistic book, but it is sorrowful in a stoic and muted way (Sillitoe's daughter-in-law typed the final draft, and she wept). </p> <p>Sillitoe is a great believer in stoicism. When he talks about his own childhood he refuses any kind of self-pity. He feels sorry for the father who used to beat him because, 'poor chap', he was doing the best he could, in his way. He says he was lucky in his own life - TB made him a writer; the struggle of his early years gave him his subjects. He tried to be a good father to his two children, both grown up now. He loved them, certainly - but I'd have to ask them how he did as a father. </p> <p>He doesn't mind that people don't read him so much now - he just feels very lucky that the books gave him enough money to live on, and to still have a publisher; anyway, once he finishes a book, he lets it go. 'Vain regrets do no good,' he says briskly. He lives for the next one he is writing. He says that most of the time he simply doesn't notice getting older (he is in his seventies now), and when he does, he likes it because 'it's all experience, isn't it?; that's what you have in the end - memory, experience, imagination, skill. And at least I'm too old now to die young.' </p> <p>Anyway, 'a writer has to believe he can live forever'. He wants to be the first novelist to publish a book at 95. He talks of Verdi and Matisse and Picasso. He believes in fate. He doesn't believe in God. He isn't scared of dying: 'The lights go out and that's it.' </p> <p>Alan Sillitoe has always denied that Arthur Seaton was a version of himself, yet the two resemble each other in their ability to cut off from the past. Sillitoe's autobiography is full of unregretful partings. He learns to detach himself from his parents early on, not to love or trust them. He leaves girlfriends without a backward look. He leaves Nottingham blithely and England easily. He says that he had to become a 'different person' in order to become a writer. </p> <p>He talks of himself as two people, 'bilingual'. He has both remained close to his working-class roots (he says that he wants to give a voice to these people from Nottingham) and yet apparently at the same time severed them without much sense of pain. Sillitoe agrees to this. He nods. 'Callousness,' he says pensively. 'Yes, call me callous. You're right. Maybe it has something to do with my childhood. I had to survive. I had a sense of adventure, but that's like callousness too I think. A type of selfishness, yes.' </p> <p>He talks of a time a pure happiness, when he was a young man on a ship, very alone and looking out over the Bay of Biscay, and all he saw was emptiness rolling away over the horizon. 'Emptiness is a positive thing. You're going to have to fill it. There's adventure. I have always felt I was being driven - that's no excuse for callousness of course - and I don't fight against being driven, drawn along. It has sometimes been a slow, difficult current. But I knew if I fought it I would drown. Nobody wants to drown.' </p> <p>There is an admirable persistence of purpose in Sillitoe - a refusal to move with the tides of fashion, an insistence on his own particular brand of social realism ('good, simple English'). 'I'll not,' he says, puffing vigorously, 'write a novel with the end at the beginning and with 50 pages unpunctuated [like Ulysses ]. I tell stories. I don't care if I'm radical or old-fashioned. I'm just a novelist; that's all I've ever been. </p> <p>'Anyway, everything finds its own level in the end. And after a book is published, I just don't care any more. It can sink or swim. If it sinks, well, in a Darwinian sense then that's what it deserves. And if it swims, then it is lucky old me.' </p> <p>Sometimes young writers send him manuscripts, asking his advice, or wanting his name for a puff on the back. He reads them carefully and writes back at painstaking length. 'I say, edit it, rework it, redraft it, send it back in two years. I say: read Stendhal, Dickens, Conrad, Dostoevsky, Chekhov. People write without ever reading. They think they can sit down and write a book, just like that, and be famous. I tell them to try again. They never come back to me.' </p> <p>Hardly surprising, really. They leave him to his notebooks of neat looped script, his coffee, his gun, his horseshoe, his poet-wife, his dream-world maps, his obsessive need to be a writer still, known always for his past, peering through his pipe-smoke into the uncertain future, book by book until the lights go out.</p>",

And at least I'm too old now to die young.' Anyway, 'a writer has to believe he can live forever'. He wants to be the first novelist to publish a book at 95. He talks of Verdi and Matisse and Picasso. He believes in fate. He doesn't believe in God. He isn't scared of dying: 'The lights go out and that's it.' Alan Sillitoe has always denied that Arthur Seaton was a version of himself, yet the two resemble each other in their ability to cut off from the past. Sillitoe's autobiography is full of unregretful partings. He learns to detach himself from his parents early on, not to love or trust them. He leaves girlfriends without a backward look. He leaves Nottingham blithely and England easily. He says that he had to become a 'different person' in order to become a writer. He talks of himself as two people, 'bilingual'. He has both remained close to his working-class roots (he says that he wants to give a voice to these people from Nottingham) and yet apparently at the same time severed them without much sense of pain. Sillitoe agrees to this. He nods. 'Callousness,' he says pensively. 'Yes, call me callous. You're right. Maybe it has something to do with my childhood. I had to survive. I had a sense of adventure, but that's like callousness too I think. A type of selfishness, yes.' He talks of a time a pure happiness, when he was a young man on a ship, very alone and looking out over the Bay of Biscay, and all he saw was emptiness rolling away over the horizon. 'Emptiness is a positive thing. You're going to have to fill it. There's adventure. I have always felt I was being driven - that's no excuse for callousness of course - and I don't fight against being driven, drawn along. It has sometimes been a slow, difficult current. But I knew if I fought it I would drown. Nobody wants to drown.' There is an admirable persistence of purpose in Sillitoe - a refusal to move with the tides of fashion, an insistence on his own particular brand of social realism ('good, simple English'). 'I'll not,' he says, puffing vigorously, 'write a novel with the end at the beginning and with 50 pages unpunctuated [like Ulysses ]. I tell stories. I don't care if I'm radical or old-fashioned. I'm just a novelist; that's all I've ever been. 'Anyway, everything finds its own level in the end. And after a book is published, I just don't care any more. It can sink or swim. If it sinks, well, in a Darwinian sense then that's what it deserves. And if it swims, then it is lucky old me.' Sometimes young writers send him manuscripts, asking his advice, or wanting his name for a puff on the back. He reads them carefully and writes back at painstaking length. 'I say, edit it, rework it, redraft it, send it back in two years. I say: read Stendhal, Dickens, Conrad, Dostoevsky, Chekhov. People write without ever reading. They think they can sit down and write a book, just like that, and be famous. I tell them to try again. They never come back to me.' Hardly surprising, really. They leave him to his notebooks of neat looped script, his coffee, his gun, his horseshoe, his poet-wife, his dream-world maps, his obsessive need to be a writer still, known always for his past, peering through his pipe-smoke into the uncertain future, book by book until the lights go out.",

In the relatively short time since his Shamus Award-winning debut, A Drink Before the War, Lehane, a 35-year-old from Boston, has established himself as a major noir writer, the one Michael Connelly calls 'the heir apparent'. Like the late George V Higgins, his beat, in his five novels featuring private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, is blue-collar Boston. </p> <p>With <strong> Mystic River</strong>, his first 'stand alone' novel, he stays in the working-class neighbourhoods to tell a powerful story of childhood friendship and inexorably doomed lives. In the Seventies, three boys are playing in the street when a car draws up. Dave gets into the car, Sean and Jimmy don't. What happens to Dave in the four days he's missing changes him and the nature of their friendship irrevocably. Fast forward 25 years. Sean is a cop, Jimmy is an ex-con running a caf\u00e9 and Dave is struggling to fight his demons. Then Jimmy's daughter is savagely murdered. </p> <p>For a time, I thought I was reading George P Pelecanos, the other hip noir chronicler of blue-collar lives. The same inarticulate but deep male friendships (tough men heavily sentimental in a Bruce Springsteen-lyric kind of way), the same struggle by them to make something good out of blighted lives, and the same sense of inevitable doom. </p> <p>But not even Pelecanos has gone so far into the nitty-gritty of working-class lives to have a sequence where a character is doing the ironing and ruminating on the best kinds of iron to buy. Lehane does, but then that's of a piece with the rest of this marvellous book. He's content to go slow, even though he's writing a thriller, so that we get to know and really care about all his main characters. The result is enormously impressive: page-turning but thoughtful; moving in its sad inevitability. One of the finest novels I've read in ages. </p> <p>Pelecanos, meanwhile, has written a western. <strong> Right as Rain</strong> is set in contemporary Washington and, as with his earlier novels, is plotted around the contemporary problems of drugs and drug-related violence in downtown DC. But it's still a western, complete with a score by Ennio Morricone. </p> <p>Along with Seventies funk, Morricone and the soundtracks of other western movies is the preferred listening for Derek Strange, an ex-policeman making a quiet living as a skip-tracing private detective. When he's asked to clear up some lingering doubts about the death of an off-duty black cop at the hands of a white police officer in a street incident, he finds himself embroiled in something far more violent. </p> <p>He's the retired gunslinger required to strap his gun on for one last time. (He already carries a Bowie knife in his kit.) He teams up with Terry Quinn, the quick-on-the-trigger white cop who fired the fatal shot, to uncover the complex reality behind that street incident. Quinn, an aficionado of western fiction, is the disgraced, guilt-ridden sheriff who has lost his badge but is determined to redeem himself. </p> <p>The drug baron behind it all is called Cherokee. Also involved are a couple of country boys - father and son - who've converted their barn into a saloon with the jukebox playing country and western and a Colt pistol stashed behind the bar. That's the setting for a classic shootout involving those other western staples, the crooked sheriff and the cowardly deputy. </p> <p>Pelecanos quotes from The Wild Bunch but he's thinking Leone rather than Peckinpah here. The result is a giddy mixture of Pelecanos's righteous fury at the way drugs have ravaged the poorer sections of the city he loves, an unflinching look at racism, and a high-energy thriller. Great. </p> <p>Robert Wilson's <strong> The Company of Strangers</strong> is a big, meaty novel of love and deceit, a thriller which spans Europe from the final flickers of the Second World War to the collapse of the Berlin Wall. It's highly ambitious but Wilson, who upped the ante with his writing when he won the Gold Dagger for A Small Death in Lisbon, just about pulls it off. </p> <p>Young, na\u00efve mathematician Andrea Aspinall comes to Lisbon in 1944 to spy on a man suspected of involvement in making possible Germany's ultimate 'secret weapon'. She meets Karl Voss, military attach\u00e9 to the German Legation, and they have an urgent, clandestine love affair that overshadows the rest of Andrea's life, whether living under the brutal Portuguese fascist regime or on spying missions to East Berlin. </p> <p>There's a hint of David Hare's Plenty in Andrea's addiction to spying and, of course, in its world weariness and with one of its themes - the corruption of innocence - The Company of Strangers is redolent of John le Carr\u00e9. But Wilson's intentions are different to Hare's and le Carr\u00e9 has stamped himself so authoritatively on the spy genre the redolence is hardly surprising. </p> <p>Besides, Wilson has strengths that are entirely his own. He is brilliant at suggesting the unsaid, evoking the silent interstices between words, whether spoken by lovers or spies. Indeed, he links lovers and spies in their shared deceits and makes a connection, too, between English self-repression and efficacy at spying. He writes telling descriptions and precisely achieved set pieces - Voss's troubles with his own people and the consequent chase through the streets of Lisbon is as taut and tense a stretch of writing as you could wish for. And his sense of place is terrific. </p> <p>For me, the ending stopped the novel being great. Not that it is unbelievable, because we know that such things happen, more that it is unpersuasive. Even so, with this novel Wilson vaults to the front-rank of thriller writers. </p> <p>It grieves me to be less than effusive about Paul Eddy's debut thriller, <strong> Flint</strong>, especially since we share the same publisher, but I think the hype it has received raised expectations it couldn't hope to meet. The former editor of the Sunday Times Insight team received \u00a31.2 million in advances for Flint from American, British and continental publishers plus around half a million for the film option from Columbia Pictures. </p> <p>Some US critics have gone nuts for it, Time saying: 'Not since Modesty Blaise has spy literature seen a heroine as determined and spunky as Flint.' Its publisher, Headline, is comparing the eponymous Grace Flint to the grittier fictional characters Clarice Starling and Kay Scarpetta, whilst uber agent Ed Victor declared that she is 'the first fictional character he might want to sleep with'. Er, OK. Well, all I can say is - show me the money. </p> <p>Flint is good - and an impressive accomplishment for a first novel - but it ain't that good. Undercover cop Grace Flint has been badly damaged, emotionally and physically, in a sting operation against a big-time money-launderer that has gone horribly wrong. Plastic surgery has restored her physically but can she cope emotionally with going back undercover, especially when the operation she's involved in brings her back in conflict with the man who almost destroyed her? </p> <p>Eddy knows how to write page-turning, tense prose and whips through big setpiece scenes with gusto. Flint, although something of a composite, is an intriguing character I'd like to read more about (and presumably will). Eddy is good on detail of police and FBI procedures and tells a good story. So I recommend it, but don't expect too much. </p> <p>\u0095 Peter Guttridge's Foiled Again was published last week by Headline, \u00a317.99.</p>",

Some US critics have gone nuts for it, Time saying: 'Not since Modesty Blaise has spy literature seen a heroine as determined and spunky as Flint.' Its publisher, Headline, is comparing the eponymous Grace Flint to the grittier fictional characters Clarice Starling and Kay Scarpetta, whilst uber agent Ed Victor declared that she is 'the first fictional character he might want to sleep with'. Er, OK. Well, all I can say is - show me the money. Flint is good - and an impressive accomplishment for a first novel - but it ain't that good. Undercover cop Grace Flint has been badly damaged, emotionally and physically, in a sting operation against a big-time money-launderer that has gone horribly wrong. Plastic surgery has restored her physically but can she cope emotionally with going back undercover, especially when the operation she's involved in brings her back in conflict with the man who almost destroyed her? Eddy knows how to write page-turning, tense prose and whips through big setpiece scenes with gusto. Flint, although something of a composite, is an intriguing character I'd like to read more about (and presumably will). Eddy is good on detail of police and FBI procedures and tells a good story. So I recommend it, but don't expect too much. \u0095 Peter Guttridge's Foiled Again was published last week by Headline, \u00a317.99.",

He has looked exactly the same since 1959 - and how old was he then? Old enough to have a moustache, strong enough to fight an army of Romans, clever enough to outsmart the pirates every time. He is small, it's true, but how about Obelix? Is he an overgrown child, an idiot savant? Or is he the same age as G\u00e9rard Depardieu, who played him in the movie? Asterix and Obelix have already survived one of their creators, the writer Ren\u00e9 Goscinny, and their other 'parent', illustrator Albert Uderzo, is now 73. Yet, like Dorian Gray, they never grow old and, like Peter Pan, they never grow up. </p> <p>Goscinny died in 1977, just after completing Asterix in Belgium, a project the French might say would send anyone to his doom. Since then, Uderzo has announced on many occasions that Asterix will be no more. Behind the scenes, he has been involved in a law suit against the publishers over the rights to the backlist; he lost in 1994. And yet, every five years or so, Asterix undergoes a short-lived resurrection. <strong> Asterix and the Actress</strong>, the much-awaited new volume, is the first since 1996. The accompanying hype has been enormous: 300 million copies will be printed worldwide and all the old Asterix episodes are being reissued. </p> <p>The pleasure of seeing these characters back again is immediate, and yet there's something strangely sad about the experience. They look the same, but they're not the same. The gags are hollow, their friends' names aren't clever; none of the new characters has the charm of, say, the little boy in Asterix in Spain or the hopeless architect in Asterix and Cleopatra. In an effort to maintain continuity with the classics, two characters from old adventures are given cameos - Tremensdelirius from Asterix and Caesar's Gift and Panacea from Asterix and the Legionary. But the effect is like meeting an old friend and finding they've lost their memory. Goscinny is sorely missed. </p> <p>The story is fairly simple. It's Asterix's and Obelix's birthday - they were born on the same day an unknowable number of years ago. Their mothers come to pester them about marriage and their fathers send them presents that turn out to be the valuable belongings of a Roman consul, who needs them before he can stage his coup against Julius Caesar. The fathers never suspected the goods were stolen, but they are put in prison by the Romans, who then think of a cunning plan to get the sword and helmet back. They hire an actress, Latraviata, to pose as Panacea, a woman all the Gauls love. She plans to seduce Asterix and Obelix into returning the objects, but the real Panacea looms on the horizon and all hell breaks loose. </p> <p>The plot allows Uderzo to produce numerous sets of doubles: the two fathers are grey-haired versions of their sons and the mothers are dressed in almost identical outfits. Panacea also comes face to face with her clone. It's as if, in the absence of a wordsmith, all Uderzo can do is draw more and more of the same, filling the frames with doppelg\u00e4ngers until the pictures descend into endlessly self-reproducing chaos. There is a manic, hall-of-mirrors quality about it and if you were in the business of over-interpretation, you might say Uderzo was compensating for the loss of his own double, Goscinny. </p> <p>When Uderzo and Goscinny met in 1951, the latter had just come back from America, where he had been working with Harvey Kurtzman, who went on to found Mad comics. Goscinny's return was aptly timed. As Roger Sabin writes in <strong> Comics, Comix &amp; Graphic Novels</strong>, it had recently been decided that France needed more patriotic cartoon heroes. American comics had been syndicated in Europe in the 1930s, and the Marvel superheroes had been brought over by GIs a decade later. But in 1949 the French government passed a law effectively banning US comics in order to encourage home-grown talent. Ten years later, the world's most famous Gaul was born.</p> <p>Sabin's book is a wonderful reference work. It is full of glossy illustrations and gives a detailed account of comic art from its origins in seventeenth-century broadsheets, through the part played by 'X-rated' 'comix' in 1960s and 1970s counterculture, to its more recent renaissance in the form of graphic novels. </p> <p>Sabin is very good at bringing out the ways in which comics have reflected the idiosyncrasies of various eras. For example, the first proper comic, a nineteenth-century publication called Ally Sloper's Half-Holiday, was sold at railway stations and, with a very Victorian sense of the macabre, advertised free life insurance to anyone who died in a rail crash and was found holding a copy. The publishers claimed to have paid up three times by 1892. In 1950s America, comics were burned in the streets after a book by a psychiatrist argued they encouraged juvenile delinquency. There were hearings in the Senate and in 1955 a 'Comics Code' was passed, which specifically outlawed any 'challenges to authority'. </p> <p>Such laws are made to be broken, and perhaps the best chapter of Comics is the one that gives an account of Robert Crumb's seminal work of the 1960s. In 1968, Crumb became a hero in France, where he was thought of as an exemplary radical. He has now made Paris his permanent home. </p> <p>Asterix, of course, was never meant to cover the same ground. And, yet, he did not escape political interpretation. His creators often complained that at every election parties of both Left and Right asked if they could use Asterix as their symbol. Eventually, Goscinny and Uderzo got their own back by parodying a presidential election in Caesar's Gift. Certainly, if any party did have Asterix on its side, it would be at an enormous advantage. Asterix is arguably the most well-known comic-strip character in the world, a fact which dawned on Goscinny some years before he died. He was on holiday and some strangers passed him in the street. As they walked by, he saw them tapping their heads and saying: 'These Romans are crazy!'</p>",

Instead, it explores the equally troubled emotional battlefields of Danny Miller, who at the age of 10 was convicted of a chillingly heartless murder. Now 23, he is released from prison, though not from his sense of betrayal by child psychologist Tom Seymour, whose testimony at Danny's trial, that the boy understood the finality of death, ensured his imprisonment. </p> <p>The story plunges straight in, literally, as Tom rescues a man from the sewage-choked Tyne only to discover that, by coincidence, the suicidal man is Danny. His marriage is disintegrating due to the lack of children, and now in walks one from the past. </p> <p>Tom, who is writing a book on the moral sense of juvenile delinquents, agrees to see Danny to help them both come to terms with the past. Replacing departing wife Lauren, who recedes with the marriage to the periphery of Tom's life, the charming, manipulative Danny plays cat-and-mouse as they grapple with the legacy of his abusive childhood. The central relationship between Tom and Danny proves compelling. Increasingly aware that Danny's reappearance is no coincidence, Tom reconstructs what he can of Danny's experiences through interviews with him and his acquaintances, including Martha, the probation officer who looks after Danny and, increasingly, Tom. </p> <p>As always in Barker's novels, all time is eternally present, and the aim is - 'pace Eliot' - to glimpse the primitive terror that, in this case, connects a vulnerable child with a horrific act. The parallels with the imminent release of Jamie Bulger's killers lend the story an urgent crackle that helps transcend the thriller conventions from which it draws its form. </p> <p>Time proves unforgiving to all.

      "bodyText": "Border Crossing Pat Barker Viking \u00a316.99, pp224 Buy it at a discount at BOL Despite its suggestive title, Pat Barker's latest novel does not revisit the warscapes of her Regeneration trilogy. Instead, it explores the equally troubled emotional battlefields of Danny Miller, who at the age of 10 was convicted of a chillingly heartless murder. Now 23, he is released from prison, though not from his sense of betrayal by child psychologist Tom Seymour, whose testimony at Danny's trial, that the boy understood the finality of death, ensured his imprisonment. The story plunges straight in, literally, as Tom rescues a man from the sewage-choked Tyne only to discover that, by coincidence, the suicidal man is Danny. His marriage is disintegrating due to the lack of children, and now in walks one from the past. Tom, who is writing a book on the moral sense of juvenile delinquents, agrees to see Danny to help them both come to terms with the past. Replacing departing wife Lauren, who recedes with the marriage to the periphery of Tom's life, the charming, manipulative Danny plays cat-and-mouse as they grapple with the legacy of his abusive childhood. The central relationship between Tom and Danny proves compelling. Increasingly aware that Danny's reappearance is no coincidence, Tom reconstructs what he can of Danny's experiences through interviews with him and his acquaintances, including Martha, the probation officer who looks after Danny and, increasingly, Tom. As always in Barker's novels, all time is eternally present, and the aim is - 'pace Eliot' - to glimpse the primitive terror that, in this case, connects a vulnerable child with a horrific act. The parallels with the imminent release of Jamie Bulger's killers lend the story an urgent crackle that helps transcend the thriller conventions from which it draws its form. Time proves unforgiving to all. Lauren battles against her body clock in her desire for children, while their marriage goes as limp as Tom, faced with the battery of thermometers and calendars. Both men battle against the discovery by the media of Danny's new identity, culminating in a climax that dramatically tests the reasons for his reappearance in Tom's life, and forces the psychologist once more to determine his fate. All that leaves is for Tom's emotional life to resolve itself, though a chance meeting years later scratches the surface of memory, a palimpsest from which the elderly victim's image can never be expunged.

In recent years the biting insects that plague the Highlands in the summer months have been unsuccessfully attacked from almost every angle. Now artists are to have their own run at the problem.</p> <p>Tomorrow a \u00a350,000 grant goes to the photographer Alison Hayes to fund Midge Bait, a project which is aimed at unravelling the mysteries of Culicoides impunctatus, or the Highland midge. The hefty grant, made by The Wellcome Trust, is one of several awards to be handed out as part of Sci-art, a collaborative programme that brings scientists and artists together.</p> <p>Hayes and the film-maker David Mackenzie will be capturing the movements of the midge as it attacks for the first time and handing on the images to Dr Alison Blackwell, of the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh.</p> <p>'I have taken pictures of starlings swarming,' said Hayes, 'but my interest in midges started when I was about 14 on a family holiday in the Highlands.</p> <p>'It was a wonderfully hot day, but as dusk fell we could not go out at all because of the insects. We had the window open just a little for air and they came in.'</p> <p>Hayes and Mackenzie will be kitted out in layers of protective clothing for the project and are looking for volunteers to use as bait for the midges.</p> <p>'We are thinking of wearing breathing apparatus too, because the midges are attracted by the carbon dioxide that animals breathe out,' said Hayes.</p> <p>Initial research into the insects in the 1950s has been revived in recent years as the midges have affected tourism. Research carried out by Blackwell has revealed that 80 per cent of foreign tourists say they will not return to the area because of the bites they suffered.</p> <p>The photographs will focus on the formation of attack. 'People have spoken of funnels and tried to draw them,' said Hayes, 'but no one has got a photograph. This pattern is formed by the males at the beginning of June and then the females fly into these swarms to mate. After this we think the females fly off looking for a blood meal.'</p> <p>The project will cover scenic areas on Skye and Mull and will also examine a number of new solutions, including combinations of repellents and attractants.</p> <p>'The lifecycle can be manipulated and there are repellents, of course,' said Blackwell, 'but most of these are chemically based and are becoming less and less popular. You are never going to be able to get rid of the Highland midge, and you wouldn't want to, but we need to know if they work on their own, or whether it is a communal attack.'</p> <p>The team will also be testing an American prototype Midge Magnet, which attracts the insects with a cloud of carbon dioxide and then hoovers them up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Midges may be small, but for the tourist industry in Scotland they are potentially lethal. In recent years the biting insects that plague the Highlands in the summer months have been unsuccessfully attacked from almost every angle. Now artists are to have their own run at the problem. Tomorrow a \u00a350,000 grant goes to the photographer Alison Hayes to fund Midge Bait, a project which is aimed at unravelling the mysteries of Culicoides impunctatus, or the Highland midge. The hefty grant, made by The Wellcome Trust, is one of several awards to be handed out as part of Sci-art, a collaborative programme that brings scientists and artists together. Hayes and the film-maker David Mackenzie will be capturing the movements of the midge as it attacks for the first time and handing on the images to Dr Alison Blackwell, of the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. 'I have taken pictures of starlings swarming,' said Hayes, 'but my interest in midges started when I was about 14 on a family holiday in the Highlands. 'It was a wonderfully hot day, but as dusk fell we could not go out at all because of the insects. We had the window open just a little for air and they came in.' Hayes and Mackenzie will be kitted out in layers of protective clothing for the project and are looking for volunteers to use as bait for the midges. 'We are thinking of wearing breathing apparatus too, because the midges are attracted by the carbon dioxide that animals breathe out,' said Hayes. Initial research into the insects in the 1950s has been revived in recent years as the midges have affected tourism. Research carried out by Blackwell has revealed that 80 per cent of foreign tourists say they will not return to the area because of the bites they suffered. The photographs will focus on the formation of attack. 'People have spoken of funnels and tried to draw them,' said Hayes, 'but no one has got a photograph. This pattern is formed by the males at the beginning of June and then the females fly into these swarms to mate. After this we think the females fly off looking for a blood meal.' The project will cover scenic areas on Skye and Mull and will also examine a number of new solutions, including combinations of repellents and attractants. 'The lifecycle can be manipulated and there are repellents, of course,' said Blackwell, 'but most of these are chemically based and are becoming less and less popular. You are never going to be able to get rid of the Highland midge, and you wouldn't want to, but we need to know if they work on their own, or whether it is a communal attack.' The team will also be testing an American prototype Midge Magnet, which attracts the insects with a cloud of carbon dioxide and then hoovers them up.",

With rising unemployment, youths are using and dealing drugs as a way of getting by. 'Where there is no hope,' the saying goes, 'there's always dope.'</p> <p>The picture painted in Human Traffic, a bleakly comic movie about five Cardiff friends who live for their drug-fuelled weekends, isn't so far from reality. In the South Wales police area, the number of people prosecuted for trafficking in heroin has risen 63 per cent in the past year. Across the county of Rhondda Cynon Taff, at least 12 addicts overdose each week, according to the latest figures.</p> <p>In North Wales, drug sales became so blatant that last month the force launched Operation Decade, its biggest-ever crackdown, which led to 30 arrests in a few hours. In Dyfed-Powys, more dealers are arrested per 100 police officers than anywhere else in the country, while in Gwent a three-man gang will be sentenced next week for possession of a kilo of heroin - the force's largest single haul.</p> <p>Further along the coast in Llanelli, the number of heroin seizures has for the first time overtaken the number of seizures of amphetamine.

      "bodyText": "The picturesque hills and valleys of Wales, synonymous with male voice choirs, close-knit communities and fanatical rugby supporters, have become home to the fastest-growing drugs epidemic in the UK. The results of a new study, to be made public this week, show that Wales is caught in the grip of an unprecedented heroin epidemic, with a massive surge in the number of users, seizures and those dying from overdoses. With rising unemployment, youths are using and dealing drugs as a way of getting by. 'Where there is no hope,' the saying goes, 'there's always dope.' The picture painted in Human Traffic, a bleakly comic movie about five Cardiff friends who live for their drug-fuelled weekends, isn't so far from reality. In the South Wales police area, the number of people prosecuted for trafficking in heroin has risen 63 per cent in the past year. Across the county of Rhondda Cynon Taff, at least 12 addicts overdose each week, according to the latest figures. In North Wales, drug sales became so blatant that last month the force launched Operation Decade, its biggest-ever crackdown, which led to 30 arrests in a few hours. In Dyfed-Powys, more dealers are arrested per 100 police officers than anywhere else in the country, while in Gwent a three-man gang will be sentenced next week for possession of a kilo of heroin - the force's largest single haul. Further along the coast in Llanelli, the number of heroin seizures has for the first time overtaken the number of seizures of amphetamine. While cannabis remains the most widely used drug in the area, heroin now accounts for 10 per cent of seizures. Drug- trafficking offences have shot up by 70 per cent in a year. With law enforcement split between four different forces, each of which uses different methods to compile statistics, accurate figures covering the whole of the country are virtually impossible to come by. Across Wales it is believed that drug-related deaths are occurring at an average rate of one a week. While crimes such as car theft and burglary are down across the board, they have rocketed in the areas where drug use is highest. An increasing number of addicts, some as young as 13 or 14, are selling their bodies to pay for their habits. For those living in smaller towns, such as Aberdare, where heroin use has traditionally been frowned on - last year a suspected dealer was firebombed out of his home on the Fernhill estate - the change has been shocking. One former miner who declined to be named told The Observer: 'When the mines were open, things were very different. There was full employment and everyone was pulling together as one. If one of the young lads did something - broke into a house, stole a car or gave an old lady some cheek - we'd soon find out who did it and give them hell. Now the mines are gone, the sense of community's gone. People only look out for themselves. These days if you've got a job you're virtually a celebrity.' This week South Wales police will release the results of new toxicology reports that are expected to link a number of recent deaths to the heroin epidemic. 'We need to gauge the size of the problem so we can tackle it most effectively,' says Detective Chief Superintendent Wynn Philips. 'We need education to reduce demand for heroin and look to the community to assist us. The drug is tolerated far more than it used to be.' South Wales police are also looking to alter a policy they believe could be contributing to the number of deaths. At present, many addicts are reluctant to report overdoses because they know the police will attend the scene. According to Roger Duncan of the Swansea Drug Project, there are a number of factors behind the sudden rise, including a crackdown on the use of amphetamine which, curiously, led many users to switch to heroin. Users of Ecstasy, which has always been disproportionately popular in Wales, are turning to heroin to help them 'come down' after a night of clubbing. 'In the last quarter we've had 86 people coming to see us with problems linked to heroin use. A couple of years ago, that number would have been just two or three. Five years ago, heroin was almost unobtainable in Swansea. I believe one reason we are getting so many deaths is because there isn't a history of usage in the area. It means a lot of people are very inexperienced and unaware of the dangers of mixing heroin with Valium or alcohol.' Another factor is that dealers in Bristol and Liverpool have begun targeting Wales. Significant numbers of addicts trying to escape the drug scene have also moved to Wales, only to relapse and bring their addictions with them. Janet Joyce, 37, was typical. Originally from Manchester, she lived a drug-free life until 18 months ago when she began a relationship with a heroin addict. Within a few months, she too had become addicted and the pair moved from Manchester to North Wales to get out of the drug scene.

The food is sold - often openly - in shops and restaurants throughout Britain.</p> <p>Illegally imported meat was thought to be responsible for the outbreak of swine fever last year, and last week the Government said it was responsible for the foot and mouth outbreak which is devastating the British farming industry and costing the country billions of pounds.</p> <p>However, veterinary experts warned that the trade could cause several other serious outbreaks that not only affect farming, but could kill hundreds of people. The threats include not just food poisoning bugs such as salmonella and E.coli, but ebola and anthrax.</p> <p>Professor Hugh Pennington of Aberdeen University and a government adviser on food safety said: 'There's a risk of a major food poisoning outbreak if it's coming in uncontrolled.' Tony Little, vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, said: 'Meat from the Third World is something you have to think quite seriously about. If it's being sold in markets circumventing all regulations, that's extremely serious.'</p> <p>Seizures of illegally imported meat are running at around 200 a month, and sometimes result from tip-offs from baggage handlers who see blood dripping from suitcases. On one flight alone from Nigeria last year, 2,500kg of illegal meat was confiscated.</p> <p>The fact that meat is still coming in from countries with endemic foot and mouth disease is an embarrassment to the Government as it steps up its slaughter campaign to rid British farming of the economically disastrous virus. Our investigation has shown potentially infected meat has been smuggled into the country throughout the crisis.</p> <p>Government scientists believe the virus originated in infected imported meat from a Chinese restaurant being fed to pigs in untreated swill. But an environmental health source at Felixstowe, Britain's largest container port, revealed that last week customs stopped a consignment of illegal beef and pork from China, which had at least 20 foot and mouth outbreaks last year. It contained 100 cartons of meat mixed in with cereals, noodles and other non-meat products. The importer claimed no knowledge of the meat, which will make prosecution virtually impossible.</p> <p>Officials warn that cutbacks mean they are so short staffed they can check only a tiny proportion of imports. Customs officials are also not allowed to inspect many non-food containers or containers from other European Union countries, which could hide meat smuggled across other borders.</p> <p>'We catch a fraction of what is coming in,' said Doug Bloomfield, assistant director of environmental services at Suffolk Coastal District Council, which is responsible for Felixstowe. 'You only have to look at the foot and mouth epidemic now to see what a dangerous situation it is.'</p> <p>The meat is destined either for private family use - often by ethnic minorities keen to enjoy traditional delicacies - or the catering trade. The investigation showed that illegally imported meat was openly on sale in shops in Brixton market in London, where bush meat for sale included rat, bat and monkey. Enforcement is so weak that a shop in Old Kent Road in London had a sign out in the pavement boasting: 'We Sell Bush Meat'. Only when it was alerted to the problem on Friday did Lambeth Council inspect Brixton Market, and confiscate illegal meat. Supermarkets in London and China Town in Manchester were also openly selling illegal meat. Newport supermarket in Soho was selling illegally imported pork, undeterred by Westminster Council, while the Wing Fat supermarket in Manchester was selling dried pork and beef from China.</p> <p>The most dangerous illegal import is monkey meat, which caused an ebola scare at Heathrow airport last year. Customs sources say that 15 carcases of dead monkeys were found on 29 November hidden in a cargo of fruit and vegetables, which also contained an anteater and tortoise legs. Environmental health officers realised the monkeys could be carrying ebola, one of the deadliest and most contagious viruses known to man that kills nearly all its victims.</p> <p>The customs inspection post and any vehicle that had been near the cargo was sprayed with disinfectant. 'I had my own car sprayed and it was pretty scary. The word they kept mentioning was ebola,' said the source. The monkeys had originally come from a flight from Cameroon that touched down in Geneva and were then transferred on to a Swissair plane to London.</p> <p>Prof Pennington said it is quite possible to catch ebola from monkey meat while it is being prepared. 'Before you cook it, you cut it up and there could be an aerosol spray of the virus, or you could get the blood on you,' he said.</p> <p>Little added: 'It's the nightmare scenario if you brought ebola in from Africa.'</p> <p>Another danger from illegal meats is the Nipah virus, which affects and kills both pigs and humans, who die in agony within 48 hours. The virus killed 100 people in Malaysia last year and wiped out the pig industry before it was controlled.</p> <p>A new strain of salmonella specific to the Gambia has been found in the UK, suggesting illegal imports of meat from that country. E.coli 0157 was unknown in the UK until the mid-Eighties, and may have entered through illegal imports.</p> <p>Dozens of other diseases including anthrax, sheep pox, pseudorabies, and African horse sickness could all be imported.</p> <p>Illegal importers are making huge profits by taking advantage of weak border controls: Customs and environmental health officers have faced severe cuts since 1993 due to the single European market. In Dover, the number of health officers has fallen from seven to one in just eight years. At the airports, the picture is even more bleak. Cargo manifests often say just 'mixed goods' or 'fruit and vegetables' and there is no law making it mandatory for such consignments to be checked. Most containers go through customs electronically. It can take just a few hours for a container of dangerous meat to get on to Britain's roads.</p> <p>'Most of the containers are put on lorries and gone before we even get out of the office,' said Rose Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the Association of Port Heath Authorities. 'Airports are a great backdoor to get illegal meat into this country.'</p> <p>The worst culprits are believed to be the state airlines of Nigeria and Ghana. Last year, Customs and officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carried out raids on 14 flights from Nigeria or Ghana looking for illegal meat.</p> <p>They recovered five tons of meat products ranging from dried fish to anteaters to antelope - potentially carriers of foot and mouth.</p> <p>Clive Lawrance, head of Ciel Logistics - which oversees imports at Heathrow - organised one of the raids, including one in September on a DC-10 flight from Accra, Ghana. As the luggage was offloaded Customs and Maff officials checked it.</p> <p>A total of 56 bags contained meat weighing about 1,388 kilogrammes.</p> <p>Much of the meat was rancid and some was spilling out of the suitcases. If any viruses had been present it would have been ideal circumstances for contamination.</p> <p>Most of the tip-offs come to airport customs from baggage handlers who have spotted blood seeping out of baggage or can smell rotting meat. Despite their successes, however, the raids on planes were stopped in October. There was simply not enough staff to continue them and passengers had complained at having their luggage searched. Since then, the trade has continued. Last Monday, 12 suitcases of meat and two of live African snails were stopped on a Ghana Airways flight coming into Heathrow.</p> <p>'Up to 10 tons of meat might be coming into Heathrow every day - there is practically nothing being done to stop it,' Lawrance said.</p> <p>If a part of the airport becomes contaminated with any form of virus it could easily leap between continents in a matter of hours.</p> <p>Lawrance was so worried about the extent of the problem at Heathrow that he wrote to Agriculture Minister Nick Brown last May and warned of the risks: he specifically mentioned foot and mouth as a potential disaster. His letter was ignored.</p> <p>Port officials want greater power to check luggage, cargo and containers. They also want the use of X-ray machines to scan incoming goods.

For the past decade the United midfielder has been the acknowledged master of that department, the undisputed boss, the engine every manager would choose to power his team. Here he was usurped by Steven Gerrard, scorer of a magnificent first goal and maker of a second, who was so far ahead in the man of the match stakes he seemed to reduce everyone else on the pitch to Subbuteo size. </p> <p>Keane is normally the player head and shoulders above the rest, but running, tackling, passing and even finding time to shoot from his own half, 20-year-old Gerrard had every angle covered. If he can play this well for England, even on a part-time basis, the next few years could be bright indeed for Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. He was notionally deployed on the right, a G\u00e9rard Houllier ploy to get Danny Murphy further forward through the middle, but did more or less as he pleased - and certainly pleased his supporters.

'His game is made of power and energy, and he can now score goals with his head, from close in or from distance. He only scored two last season, but has eight already this season.

Considering the Liverpool captain had fallen over when presented with a better opportunity three minutes earlier, that Emile Heskey wasted another Gerrard invitation with a weak shot which Barthez tipped round a post, and that Gary Neville got away with a blatant handball in the area, United could not have complained had they been three or four goals down at the break. </p> <p>Presumably words were said at half-time, for United made a much better fist of the second half as Liverpool began to sit back on their lead.

      "bodyText": "This match might have meant more to Liverpool than Manchester United, as Sir Alex Ferguson rather smugly suggested, but the champions in waiting would be unwise to ignore the warnings of conceding a double to their North-West rivals for the first time since 1979. Roy Keane, in particular, caught a glimpse of the future in this comprehensive defeat. For the past decade the United midfielder has been the acknowledged master of that department, the undisputed boss, the engine every manager would choose to power his team. Here he was usurped by Steven Gerrard, scorer of a magnificent first goal and maker of a second, who was so far ahead in the man of the match stakes he seemed to reduce everyone else on the pitch to Subbuteo size. Keane is normally the player head and shoulders above the rest, but running, tackling, passing and even finding time to shoot from his own half, 20-year-old Gerrard had every angle covered. If he can play this well for England, even on a part-time basis, the next few years could be bright indeed for Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. He was notionally deployed on the right, a G\u00e9rard Houllier ploy to get Danny Murphy further forward through the middle, but did more or less as he pleased - and certainly pleased his supporters. The reception when he came off four minutes from the end was deafening. 'If Stevie has space he goes for it,' Houllier said. 'His game is made of power and energy, and he can now score goals with his head, from close in or from distance. He only scored two last season, but has eight already this season.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Sound of Music Children: After They Were Famous</strong> ITV<br><strong> Little Women: A Day in the Life of a Tweenager </strong>BBC2 <br><strong> Walk On By</strong> BBC2 </p> <p> Last week, Sir Norman Wisdom was in Albania and Lee Evans was on BBC1. After viewing the latter's desperate new sitcom, So What Now? I can't help feeling this was the wrong way around. In another intriguing juxtaposition last week, it was also revealed that the link between Rodgers and Hammerstein and Muddy Waters is not as tenuous as one might imagine. But let us start at the very beginning which is, of course, a very good place to start. An engrossing <strong>After They Were Famous</strong> rounded up the child stars of The Sound of Music and persuaded them to revisit Salzburg for the first time in 35 years, though sadly not to don dirndl and lederhosen. They turned out to be an immensely easy-going, sane and likeable bunch of forty- and fiftysomethings, still friends (indeed, seemingly closer than many siblings) and remarkably unscrewed-up by having starred in the Most Successful Movie of All Time. Though not in Austria, where it closed after three days amid cries of 'Nazis? Us? Auf Wiedersehen my arse!' </p> <p>Most of the seven grew up with an ambivalent relationship to the movie, particularly during their teens, when having 'Do-Re-Mi' on your CV must have been only slightly less cool than boasting about your six-month tour in 'Nam. Now, though, even the quiet one, Duane Chase, a geologist who played Kurt, has come to terms with the extraordinary influence the film has exerted, not only on the billion people who are alleged to have seen it (where do they get these figures?), but on those who lived it too. These days, Duane's favourite hobby is climbing. Ev'ry mountain, presumably. </p> <p>At such impressionable ages, a nine-month shoot (it took one whole month to film the 'Do-Re-Mi' scenes alone) was bound to leave it's mark. Fourteen-year-old Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich and, much later, Spiderman in a costume arguably more embarrassing than lederhosen) grew up to discover that when you belong to the world's happiest filmic family, expectations of 'a perfect wedding, a perfect relationship and a perfect family don't serve you well', though he is the only junior Von Trapp to have made a successful career in the business. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Charmian Carr (Liesl) was a fraud - the girl who sang 'I am sixteen, going on seventeen' was 21 and thus closer to Julie Andrews's age than those of her faux-siblings, but even she grew up expecting life to be a bit more Rodgers and Hammerstein than it turned out to be. Now a 56-year-old super-glamorous divorced interior decorator (she worked on Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch. No prizes for guessing his favourite movie), Charmian admits that 'there isn't that ideal family. It doesn't exist'. Aside from the birth of her daughters and her grandchild, she still counts the ovation she received from the crew after dancing through the filming of 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' with a sprained ankle as 'one of the most thrilling moments of my life'. </p> <p>The Sound of Music was the second film I ever saw (after The Jungle Book) and, for a sibling-free only child with a rich interior fantasy life, it was truly the cinematic incarnation of heaven. What was most fascinating and touching about this programme, then, was discovering that the cast had been seduced almost as much as the audience. At the end of the show, charming Nicholas said that the experience of making the documentary had forced him to 'look at my childhood from the perspective of a 50-year-old. And in a funny sort of way I feel like I'm saying goodbye to this film now'. By the time Nicholas, Charmian, Angela, Heather, Debbie, Duane and Kym sang 'So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye...' there wasn't a dry eye in my house, so perhaps we all were. </p> <p>I don't know what, if anything, little girls make of The Sound of Music these days. Probably they are too busy worshipping Kym from Hear'say to be greatly inspired by Kym Karath's Gretl. BBC2's <strong>Little Women: A Day In The Life of a Tweenager</strong> ('media-savvy pre-teens' explained the editor of Cosmo Girl) looked set to confirm one's suspicion that Britain is breeding playgrounds full of mini-Britneys - terrifyingly knowing, belly-button-baring poptots who can spot the difference between Clinique and Laboratoire Garnier, a pair of Jimmy Choos and Manolo Blahniks, and invariably favour Madonna's Music over The Sound of Music 's soppy singing nun. </p> <p>But, somewhat surprisingly, the programme revealed that underneath, say, 11-year-old Lauren's preternaturally lip-glossed veneer of sophistication ('that's the trouble with these tops, they fall down' she observed of her boob tube. Ah, but not for long, my love) she was, really, just an 11-year-old, albeit an 11-year-old whose language was 16 going on 17. Lauren even admitted that she wanted a horse - even more than she wanted a leopard-print basque, Leonardo DiCaprio and a Brit award - which was exactly what I wanted when I was 11. 'What kind of look are you going for?' asked the director, as 10-year-old Alex riffled through her smalls drawer. 'Biker babe,' Alex said without missing a beat, bless her little leathers. Meanwhile, Leigh, eight, and Georgia, seven, were in the back of a taxi with Leigh's dad. 'We're going to Harrods, shopping for clothes,' explained Leigh before immediately turning to her best friend and asking the very important consumerist question 'do you prefer big cats or little cats?' 'Kittens,' replied the winsome little poppet. Inside the store, as he flashed his plastic, Leigh's dad was asked why he spent so much on clothes for an eight-year-old who might only wear them half a dozen times. 'Because I can,' he replied with a wry smile. Roll on the recession, eh! </p> <p>Funny thing, this, but though we might not shop very much, we get far better pop music during recessions. During the last one, for example, Stock, Aitken and Waterman's 1980s' chart domination suddenly gave way to the Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays, who, in turn, begat the likes of Pulp, Blur and Oasis. Who may now be waiting in the wings ready to reach for the stars and oust Steps in the process? Which brings me neatly back to the beginning (which is a very good place to end) and the very best documentary series currently on TV, BBC2's <strong>Walk On By</strong>. </p> <p>Week three and this well-nigh definitive history of popular song has only just arrived at early Elvis, but what a blinding journey it's been so far. Littered with riveting archive footage of ancient Appalachian hillybilly banjo ensembles and honky-tonk bluesmen waking up one mornin' and findin' a hole in their bucket, relevant anecdotage is also provided by a staggering array of ageing musical legends (only Elvis was missing and he had an excuse). </p> <p>There was Loretta Lynn, Van Morrison, Ray Charles, BB King and even Keith Richards (helpfully captioned 'musician') on hand to explain how 'blues is a beautifully flexible music for such a limited form' and then demonstrate why. Here, too, was Jerry Wexler (captioned 'senior producer, Atlantic Records' which doesn't even come close to describing his place in the grand scheme of popular music) recalling the 1930s, when the description '\"Race music\" was an honourable designation', and a couple of black guys would describe a third party as 'a Race man to the bricks, a proud promulgator of negritude'. And if that isn't the most gloriously mellifluous musical sentence uttered during the whole of terrestrial TV's output last week, then I'm Muddy Waters. 'Somehow,' Wexler continued, 'down the line, \"Race\" seemed to imply separation and inferiority and so we changed it to rhythm and blues...' And when he says 'we', he means 'I'. </p> <p>From Rodgers and Hammerstein to Muddy Waters, then? Well, there's not much separating The Sound of Music 's yodelling from that of country star Jimmy Rogers, who died in 1933 and whose music was the first to be described as 'white blues' - the pioneer crossover hitmaker (and I'm afraid I just threw Muddy in there to blues the waters a bit). Walk On By is absolutely unmissable television - possibly even for Britney fans, but especially for a TV critic whose brilliant lyricist of a father has written words that have been sung by Ray Charles and Elvis and which never fail to send shivers down my spine each time I hear them. Yes, just like the Von Trapps, we Fletts are practically black - and, obviously, very, very proud.</p>",

It's a brisk, enjoyable affair on themes of tradition and family about a successful young businessman, Da Ming, returning to Beijing to visit his dying father, Liu, who runs a decaying community bathhouse in an old suburb with the help of his mentally retarded younger son, Er Ming. </p> <p>Liu's bathhouse is a place where people can relax, feel good about their bodies, chat, play mah-jong, and gamble on fights between trained crickets. Liu doesn't just massage his visitors - he keeps the peace, reconciles couples, and (through his young son) helps an aspiring opera singer to confront his stage fright. Of course the place is about to be torn down to make way for a shopping mall, and Da Ming realises the importance of his father's life and values and comes to accept responsibility for his younger brother. </p> <p>Western audiences might see in Shower a coming together of some familiar plots from European and American films. On the one hand there's the story of the self-centred businessman who finds redemption in caring for a mentally retarded brother after a father's death - the story of Rain Man and the Dogma production Mifune. On the other there's the tale of people fighting to keep open a community bath in the face of a faceless progress - the plot of both Steaming, the Nell Dunn play filmed by Joseph Losey, and the recent Italian film, Hamam - The Turkish Bath . </p> <p>The week's two American films are about very different stages of the post-war black experience. The better of the two is George Tillman Jr's earnest, plodding <strong> Men of Honour</strong>, an inspirational movie based on the career of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr), a Kentucky dirt-farmer's son, who joins the navy in the late 1940s and discovers that the only work he's given is cooking on a destroyer. A formidable swimmer, he comes to admire Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), Master Chief Navy Diver, and determines to be the first black man to get into diving school. </p> <p>At every stage he's obstructed by the virulent racism of officers, petty officers and fellow ratings, not least Sunday himself, a sadistic Southern bigot. But by sheer determination he makes it through one masochistic confrontation after another, culminating in his demand to have a damaged leg amputated so that he can get back into diving with a prosthetic leg. The painful finale resembles the end of On the Waterfront where the crippled Brando is driven on by his priest to lead the dockers back to work. </p> <p>Gooding Jr is impressive as this inner-directed character, making his way in a world where white men make the rules and arbitrarily interpret them. In contrast <strong> Save the Last Dance </strong> has a white heroine, the 17-year-old Sarah (Julia Stiles), who is brought to Chicago by her negligent father after her dedicated mother's death, and put into a school almost entirely black. Most of her fellow pupils regard her with suspicion or contempt, but one of them, an 18-year-old with a baby son, takes her under her wing, giving Sarah a crash course in African-American talk and a sartorial makeover so she can attend a hip hop club. </p> <p>Her new friend's brother (Sean Patrick Thomas), top scholar in the school and with a scholarship to Georgetown University, both teaches her the basics of hip hop and break-dancing, and encourages her to resume her dancing ambitions and to audition for Juilliard with a black-inflected contemporary dance in her repertoire. The movie is contrived and sentimental, but emotionally it goes for the same targets as Billy Elliot and in much the same way. </p> <p>The week's two films from the British Isles are both directed by Irishmen. Gerard Stembridge's <strong>About Adam</strong> is fairly entertaining. Paddy Breathnach's <strong>Blow Dry</strong> is one of those native comedies that should be buried with others of its ilk in a long, deep trench in the remote countryside, were there not more pressing calls for the space. </p> <p> About Adam is set in a cheerful, affluent, guiltless Dublin where debonair Adam (Stuart Townsend), owner of a fashionable art gallery dealing in photographs, seduces three beautiful sisters and their brother's fianc\u00e9e, and more-or-less seduces their virgin brother and spirited widowed mother. It's a little like a lite version of Pasolini's Theorem with Adam as a priapic social chameleon, and at the end doesn't amount to much. But it's nicely told by Stembridge and attractively acted. Kate Hudson, Frances O'Connor and Charlotte Bradley are gorgeous as the contrasted sisters. As a singing waitress at a trendy restaurant Hudson handles some evergreen numbers with authority. </p> <p>The author of the screenplay for Blow Dry is undisclosed but the opening credits state rather mysteriously that it's 'Based on the screenplay Never Better by Simon Beaufroy', who wrote The Full Monty. In fact it has a Full Monty and Brassed Off sort of story in which some dispirited provincial barbers decide to compete in the National British Hairdressing Championships when they're held in the town hall at Keighley in Yorkshire. </p> <p>A snarling Alan Rickman gets together with his ex-wife and co-stylist Natasha Richardson who left him for a lesbian partner (Rachel Griffiths) and now has terminal cancer. They intend to challenge an old rival, preening Bill Nighy, who's made it big in London. </p> <p>As a comedy Blow Dry is an utter failure and indeed for much of the time it goes for pathos and doesn't try to be funny. In addition to the running theme of Richardson's cancer, the film also hits us with senior citizen Rosemary Harris's blindness. At least the bad taste of the film-makers matches that of the camp creations of the hairdressers. Not since Ishtar has there been a worse film with so much talent on either side of the camera. </p> <p>From Australia comes an odd noir thriller, Samantha Lang's <strong> The Monkey's Mask</strong>, ridiculous but watchable. The formidably freckled Susie Porter plays a Sapphic private eye, hired by a well-off couple to find their daughter, a university student who wrote erotic verse and had sex with every poet in Sydney. The search, which becomes a murder investigation, takes her into Australia's bizarre literary world of posing, untalented poets, and into the bed of a bisexual professor of literature played by the voluptuous Kelly McGillis. The film's best line is delivered by McGillis: 'You're a great fuck, but you're a very ordinary detective.' We are expected to recognise this as a paraphrase of a remark Marlene Dietrich makes about Orson Welles in A Touch of Fear . </p> <p>Finally two blasts from the past. The first is Bela Tarr's monochrome <strong> Damnation</strong>, made in 1987 during the final heroic decade of serious Hungarian cinema, but never previously shown here. It's a misanthropic allegory taking place in constant rain in a decaying small town where a listless Karrer (played by Miklos Szekely, one of Hungary's most distinguished actors) has an affair with a singer at the Titanic Bar, involves her husband in some smuggling racket, and shops them to the police. The central symbol of life's absurdity is the ever-moving cable overhead constantly transporting tipping buckets of industrial waste back and forth from an electricity plant to a slag heap. The film is almost literally hypnotic - you want to leave, but you feel compelled to sit and watch. </p> <p>The other old movie is Kubrick's <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong> of 1968, back in a new print. So often do I watch it in part or whole on TV that - unlike his A Clockwork Orange - I hadn't noticed its absence from the cinema where it should be seen.</p>",

Until I tell you he's not a cartoon figure but a real live wide-eyed pre-teen, and if you lived in America your unhesitating answer would have been Malcolm in the Middle. </p> <p>Malcolm Wilkerson may bear a resemblance to Bart Simpson, but the 'live-action Simpsons' tag that critics attached to the show at the beginning of its successful first series doesn't do it justice. Malcolm in the Middle is unlike any other contemporary sitcom, and seems to have found that optimum combination of elements so wanting in recent British television comedy - perceptive casting, outstanding acting and innovative direction brought to scripts that blend verbal jousting and slapstick in much the same way as Matt Groening does with The Simpsons. </p> <p>In the States, Fox worked the inevitable comparisons to its advantage, choosing to screen the first series on Sunday nights right after The Simpsons. It attracted the biggest viewing figures for a premiere (22.4 million) since the debut of Groening's cartoon a decade ago. Last year this unusual sitcom ended up second only to ER in the crucial 18-49 ratings demographic and pocketed two Emmys from five nominations. Malcolm has joined Bart as a national anti-hero for every generation. </p> <p>But the real similarities are in the writing rather than the characters. The scripts share The Simpsons ' undercurrent of intellectual humour, while Malcolm himself is a kind of hybrid of siblings Bart and Lisa, an unusually gifted troublemaker in a bizarre family. The eldest brother, Francis, has been sent away to military school to curb his anarchic tendencies, while the three youngest are left at home with Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), a mother who wouldn't be out of place in an Almod\u00f3var film, and Hal (Bryan Cranston), the unperturbable father who sits calmly reading his paper while his family creates Armageddon around him. </p> <p>There's boy's boy Reese (Justin Berfield), 11, the unutterably cute little one, Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), six, and, of course, the reluctant genius Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) in the middle. 'Dysfunctional family sitcom' is another easy label slapped on by critics and promoters, though Jane Kaczmarek, who was nominated for the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmy, prefers the term 'eccentric'. 'This family is so highly functional,' she says. 'They eat dinner together every night. Sure, there's a sense of craziness. But there's also a sense of truth.' </p> <p>The series started life with impressive credentials - created by executive producer Linwood Boomer (Third Rock From the Sun and Red Dwarf) and directed by Todd Holland of The Larry Sanders Show, with a theme tune composed especially by They Might Be Giants - but it's the talent of the relatively unknown child actors that gives the show its hyper-energy. Muniz , 15, looks like a child but brings an aggrieved knowingness to the part with his big, expressive eyes and frequent asides to camera. </p> <p>The direction is fast and slick (over 600 edits per half hour), with jaunty camera angles and swift cuts, but the show is filmed with a single camera and without canned laughter. Much of the show's cleverness lies in the subtlety of detail - it takes a while to notice, for example, that the houses either side of the Wilkersons' on their picket-fence street both sport For Sale signs, and the dialogue never draws attention to it. </p> <p>In the first episode, the plot template is introduced. Malcolm is horrified to discover he has an IQ of 164 and is to be moved into a 'gifted class'. The source of this genius is the subject of much speculation; his mother shaves his father's back in the kitchen and answers the front door topless to his teacher ('they're just boobs, lady - you see them in the mirror every morning'), while Malcolm and Reese are content to pass their time trussing up their little brother and dodging the school bully. Malcolm confides to the camera: 'In my school, being a genius is like being radioactive', as the camera swoops up for an aerial shot of the playground revealing his classmates standing at a distance in a perfect circle. There's a touch of South Park, too, in the irreverent jokes at the expense of Stevie Kanarban, the black, wheelchair-bound fellow-genius who attempts to befriend Malcolm: 'You'll be friends with that crippled boy and like it,' Lois tells her son, though over the next few episodes Stevie turns out to be a more ingenious straight man than Milhouse, his Simpsons equivalent. </p> <p>Amid all the high-velocity antics, there are moments of poignant reflection on the assault course of family life and the way love often misguidedly shows itself as aggression, criticism or Chinese burns; the trick to surviving families is to know how to look for this between the lines. </p> <p>Fox has already commissioned a second series of 28 episodes, and the show is so popular in the US it's now being screened twice weekly with a feature film version in development.

The current Private Eye comes up with 13 examples found in the Guardian alone these past three years referring to subjects as different as female masturbation and reusing graves.

There is, as I recall, a scene in Fanny Hill where the eponymous heroine and colleague have sex with a prodigiously endowed simpleton. More seriously, not to say solemnly, the cinema has in the past 50 years touched on the subject, if necessarily circumspectly, in such films as Fred Zinnemann's The Men and Hal Ashby's Coming Home, and there's the wonderful scene in Fellini's Amarcord where the insane uncle, on day release from an institution, climbs a tree and shouts out: 'I want a women' until he's coaxed down and taken away. </p> <p>It is the case, however, that Sinapi confronts the sexuality of the handicapped with a rare frankness and good humour that has commended itself to the public and critics alike.

Shot on digital video, it has the texture of a documentary and, in fact, a number of the supporting cast are disabled people, though in some cases acting as if they have different disabilities from their own. </p> <p>The institution's problem child is Ren\u00e9, a bearded malcontent in his late forties, confined to a wheelchair and raging eloquently and obscenely against the world and the hospital's staff. Not for him the bus trips to Lourdes. He'd rather stay in his room surrounded by coloured pin-ups and watching hardcore videos. Then one day, in a vulnerable moment, he confesses to Julsie (Nadia Kaci), an attractive new nurse, that he'd like to experience a prostitute before he dies. </p> <p>She broaches the matter at a staff meeting and tensions come to the fore, though only the practising Catholics are able to articulate their objections. So Julie pushes ahead and makes some discoveries, one of them being that if she arranges for a prostitute for Ren\u00e9, she could be charged with pimping, unless a doctor can be persuaded to state in writing that such services are physically and psychologically necessary. </p> <p>She visits the prostitutes plying their trade in camper-vans along Nationale 7, measuring their doors to see if they're accessible to wheelchairs. Finally, she settles on Florele (Nadine Marcovici), a strident no-nonsense whore of a sort that might once have been termed 'brazen' but would now be called 'feisty'. Florele transforms Ren\u00e9 and soon his fellow inmates are demanding similar therapy. </p> <p>There is much else going on at the home for Julie. A good-looking shrink is after her, but he's allergic to cats, so she has to get another would-be lover, the hospital's janitor, to take her cat for a month. There's also a problem with a second wheelchair-borne patient, the retarded Rabah (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui from La Haine and Hideous Kinky), a gay Arab obsessed with Johnny Halliday. The local priest and a Catholic nurse are preparing Rabah for baptism, but a complication arises when he decides that he wants as his godmother at the ceremony the whore Florele. </p> <p>The movie ends before some of the long-term problems can be confronted, and its tone is perfectly expressed in the sight of the priest and the whore jiving together at the home's New Year's Eve 2000 party, as if Christ and Mary Magdalene had taken to the dance floor.

He's just listened to a tape of three of my favourite songs - unknown pleasures from Dwight Twilley, Kak and Cotton Mather - and now he's breaking it to me that my music taste doesn't cut it in the real world. 'It's not edgy, and it's not hip.' I've suspected this might be the case for some time now, but I always imagined that confirmation would come from an anarchic nephew. Not an advertising executive.</p> <p>Ramsey is creative director on the Levi's account at the advertising agency BBH. I'm 'pitching' songs to him as potential soundtracks for the next Levi's ad, to be shown at the end of the year. In an attempt to learn more about the clandestine world of ad soundtracks, I'm posing as an 'executive music sourcer', someone employed solely to advise ad agencies on the rate of the nation's musical pulse, and pretending that all my three tracks are by new, cutting-edge artists (they were actually recorded in 1974, 1968 and 1998). But Ramsey isn't biting. 'The songs here are too happy,' he complains. 'Our target audience prefers something darker, cooler.'</p> <p>In the eras of psychedelia and punk, the concept of manufacturers of automobiles, jeans and bathroom products acting as arbiters of musical cool would have been inconceivable. But ever since Nick Kamen flexed his buttocks to the strains of Marvin Gaye's 'I Heard It Through The Grapevine' in 1986, a seismic shift has taken place in the relationship between pop and advertising. Jingles have died out. 'The word is never even used today,' says Ramsey. In the late Eighties and early Nineties, old favourites such as Ben E King's 'Stand By Me', The Clash's 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go' and Steve Miller's 'The Joker' achieved better sales on their re-release than on their original release, all thanks to ad (over)exposure.</p> <p>Contemporary songs followed in their wake, and a high-profile ad campaign has become a near-guarantee of chart success as a study of the Guinness Book of Hit Singles will attest. America's Business Week newspaper has described advertising as 'the new top 40 radio'. In No Logo, Naomi Klein's anti-branding bestseller of last year, she points out that 'a major ad campaign for Gap or Nike penetrates more nooks and crannies of the culture than a video in heavy rotation on MTV or a cover article in Rolling Stone.'</p> <p>Ad songs traditionally have the stigma of the one-hit-wonder attached to them (Stiltskin, Babylon Zoo and Mr Oizo soundtracked Levi's ads and haven't been heard of since), but after Moby - a credible dance artist with right-on political beliefs - agreed to lease every song from his 1999 album, Play, to sell more than 600 different products, pop's view of ads has become less sceptical. Soundtracking a commercial has become not only a practical way of establishing a career but of launching one too. Aphroheads (Hula Hoops), Kinobe (Kronenbourg) and Pepe Delux\u00e9 (Levi's) are three examples of barely known groups currently using ads to kick-start a fanbase.</p> <p>Does it depress them that this is the easiest way to gain exposure? 'Not at all,' says James Spectrum from Pepe Delux\u00e9. 'Companies are starting to choose upcoming small artists for ads. Traditionally, only the major artist backed by major companies could get that much exposure.'</p> <p>'There's been better music on adverts than on Top Of The Pops for years now,' says Mark Blackburn, from Kinobe.</p> <p>For an increasing number of musicians, an ad isn't so much a 'sell out' as another platform for their own brand. 'I think every self-sufficient artist should turn their music into a brand,' says Spectrum. 'Pepe, as a group, has a strong image or brand and everything we do fits the picture.'</p> <p>Whether this is conquering the system from within or just self-deluding subservience is up for debate. There's no doubt, though, that it's a mutually convenient scenario for the advertising and music industries that, just as pop has become increasingly manufactured, commercials have become increasingly artistic in their ambitions. The current Ford Mondeo advert features a dreamy procession of brave new world imagery and Dazed and Confused styling, almost managing to make its soundtrack, 'World Looking In' by trip-hop band Morcheeba, seem unpretentious (some feat). 'From Morcheeba's point of view,' says Tracie London-Rowell, director of media licensing at Chrysalis Music, 'the Mondeo campaign is one of high creative impact using beautiful and interesting images that complement an atmospheric track to its full extent.'</p> <p>How long before music videos and adverts become one inescapable mass? 'It probably wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that 99 per cent of music video directors direct commercials as well,' says Cara Brady from EMI's video division. Vaughan Arnell, Jonathan Glazer, Dawn Shadforth, Chris Cunningham and Roman Coppola are all respected directors who divide their time between music and ads. The Fun Lovin' Criminals declined to make a video for their last single, 'Loco', preferring to star in the Miller beer ad which they soundtracked. Robbie Williams not only sold his music to ads for Pepsi, E-Plus mobile phones and Dreamcast computer games, but his image as well. All we need now is a few more of these and a text bar at the bottom of the screen with the name of the artist and track, and MTV becomes redundant.</p> <p>'Pop videos and ads are already starting to become the same thing,' says Spectrum. 'Smaller artists will soon be forced to pay the ad companies if their music is used on big name ads. Many companies have started to realise that they are giving the artists both free promotion and money, and have started paying the artists less and less.'</p> <p>Musicians seem more inclined than ever to see an ad as an art form. A source at EMI, who prefers to remain anonymous, tells me a story about Lenny Kravitz who, following the release of his album 5, found his career at an all-time low: 'The album had stiffed, and Lenny was offered a Peugeot ad for his single, 'Fly Away'. He was approached three times, and he said he didn't do ads. The ad company told him their ads were art, and showed him three examples of their previous work. Lenny called back and said he'd do it. Not long afterwards he had a number one single.' How many of the flamboyant rebel rockers from the past, who Kravitz so slavishly imitates, would want to admit that a car manufacturer rescued their career?</p> <p>Obviously, some products (cars, clothes) are cooler than others (Toilet Duck, haemorrhoid cream) for a band to get their music behind. Yet it's becoming increasingly difficult to track down a band who hasn't helped sell something somewhere along the line. Among the few are self-styled corporate anarchists Chumbawumba who 'didn't have any hesitation' turning down close on $1 million from Nike, who wanted to use their single, 'Tubthumping', for their 1998 World Cup campaign. 'It depresses us that a piece of music becomes nothing more than a piece of music to flog a lifestyle,' says their singer, Alice Nutter. 'I loved that Moby album until it became one big car advert.'</p> <p>Australia's Nick Cave also operates on a no sell-out basis.'I get letters from people telling me they've been married or buried their best friend to my songs,' he has said recently, 'and I don't want them to look at the TV and see they buried their friend to a Cornetto ad. I feel some sense of responsibility about that.'</p> <p>Where ad songs once exploited nostalgia, these days they don't even give us a chance to develop the nostalgia in the first place. Morcheeba's 'World Looking In' has only just been released as a single, yet, thanks to several months of heavy rotation, you'd be hard pushed to associate it with anything other than cars and preposterously well-dressed future families who take five showers a day. The branding of music means nothing is personal or precious any more. The musician gains sales from increased exposure. The corporation gains kudos from associating itself with something 'cool'. The consumer gains a migraine and a recurring nightmare featuring a dancing Hula Hoops packet.</p> <p>Back on the phone, Russell Ramsey is telling me why Kak's psychedelic fuzz anthem, 'Electric Sailor', is unsuitable for the cutting edge, insouciant world of advertising. 'It's too fast, not cool, and they're obviously trying too hard,' he explains. Something tells me that Kak, who recorded the song in late-Sixties San Francisco when corporations were the enemy, won't be losing too much sleep over this news.</p>",

All we need now is a few more of these and a text bar at the bottom of the screen with the name of the artist and track, and MTV becomes redundant. 'Pop videos and ads are already starting to become the same thing,' says Spectrum. 'Smaller artists will soon be forced to pay the ad companies if their music is used on big name ads. Many companies have started to realise that they are giving the artists both free promotion and money, and have started paying the artists less and less.' Musicians seem more inclined than ever to see an ad as an art form. A source at EMI, who prefers to remain anonymous, tells me a story about Lenny Kravitz who, following the release of his album 5, found his career at an all-time low: 'The album had stiffed, and Lenny was offered a Peugeot ad for his single, 'Fly Away'. He was approached three times, and he said he didn't do ads. The ad company told him their ads were art, and showed him three examples of their previous work. Lenny called back and said he'd do it. Not long afterwards he had a number one single.' How many of the flamboyant rebel rockers from the past, who Kravitz so slavishly imitates, would want to admit that a car manufacturer rescued their career? Obviously, some products (cars, clothes) are cooler than others (Toilet Duck, haemorrhoid cream) for a band to get their music behind. Yet it's becoming increasingly difficult to track down a band who hasn't helped sell something somewhere along the line. Among the few are self-styled corporate anarchists Chumbawumba who 'didn't have any hesitation' turning down close on $1 million from Nike, who wanted to use their single, 'Tubthumping', for their 1998 World Cup campaign. 'It depresses us that a piece of music becomes nothing more than a piece of music to flog a lifestyle,' says their singer, Alice Nutter. 'I loved that Moby album until it became one big car advert.' Australia's Nick Cave also operates on a no sell-out basis.'I get letters from people telling me they've been married or buried their best friend to my songs,' he has said recently, 'and I don't want them to look at the TV and see they buried their friend to a Cornetto ad. I feel some sense of responsibility about that.' Where ad songs once exploited nostalgia, these days they don't even give us a chance to develop the nostalgia in the first place. Morcheeba's 'World Looking In' has only just been released as a single, yet, thanks to several months of heavy rotation, you'd be hard pushed to associate it with anything other than cars and preposterously well-dressed future families who take five showers a day. The branding of music means nothing is personal or precious any more. The musician gains sales from increased exposure. The corporation gains kudos from associating itself with something 'cool'. The consumer gains a migraine and a recurring nightmare featuring a dancing Hula Hoops packet. Back on the phone, Russell Ramsey is telling me why Kak's psychedelic fuzz anthem, 'Electric Sailor', is unsuitable for the cutting edge, insouciant world of advertising. 'It's too fast, not cool, and they're obviously trying too hard,' he explains. Something tells me that Kak, who recorded the song in late-Sixties San Francisco when corporations were the enemy, won't be losing too much sleep over this news.",

Young British groups, following the pioneering example of the Arditti Quartet, are especially fearless in their choice of repertoire, as two concert this week demonstrated. The <b>Duke Quartet</b>, who worked with Blur on the soundtrack of the film Trainspotting (what credential could be more hip?) are regular interpreters of the music of Kevin Volans (b.1949).

(It was Stockhausen, you may recall, who was so frightened of string quartets that when eventually he came to write one he scored it for four helicopters, TV and audio relay equipment as well.) Volans now prefers to follow the less restrictive musical signposts of his native Africa rather than the grids and compass points of the European avant-garde. Neither style is evident in this new piece. The apparently static surface texture and lack of any discernible melody nevertheless suggests a non-Western mood. Not for Volans the outward journeys and safe returns of Western sonata form.

Such is the auditory effort required of the listener to notice if anything is going on through the work's 17 minutes duration. Colour takes priority over argument.

The result is a work of hypnotic simplicity. </p> <p>A lingering query was whether the musicians enjoyed playing a piece whose passion is so imperceptible and disembodied? No wonder they let rip at such a breathless pace, and with such febrile intensity in Beethoven's 'Opus 95 in F minor'. This gifted quartet may not have the most mellow of sounds (it was not easy to judge in this hall), but they were never less than ardent. </p> <p>Drama was scarcely in short supply in George Rochberg's 'String Quartet No3' (1972) played by the <b> Kreutzer Quartet</b>, another British group acclaimed for its eclectic repertoire. The lithe American octogenarian was in attendance and won warm applause for this pivotal work. Rochberg had been a dedicated serialist who came to realise he needed a more expressive mode. He began to write tunes and harmonies, to plunder the past, when to do so was to invite scorn. </p> <p>The third quartet opens abrasively, as if with a barrage of electric shocks. By the expansive slow movement, the music has become richly eloquent, drawing on Beethoven's 'Opus 132'. The Kreutzer players have an enviably warm and relaxed sound which can, if required, turn trenchant as if at the flick of a switch. They were equally dextrous in the world premiere of David Matthews's 'Aubade', a sharply focused version of his chamber orchestra piece reviewed here a fortnight ago, and in his illuminating transcription of Beethoven's 'Piano Sonata Op.101'.

The corporation is planning to move from its old home in the city's leafy West End, the Glasgow of Roy Jenkins more than Rab C. Nesbitt, to Pacific Quay, a derelict dock on the edge of Govan. It's the kind of jump that needs to be handled with care if it is not going to provoke the same outcry that exiling radio news to White City did in London. </p> <p>The most compelling image any of the competitors produced was a grainy, black-and-white photograph unearthed by the Anglo-German team, Sauerbruch Hutton. It was like a vision from a parallel universe, a Glasgow packed with ships from end to end of its river front, in which dock basins on either side of the Clyde transformed what is actually quite a narrow river into a limpid lagoon, spreading deep into the city. It might as well have been a photo of a herd of dinosaurs snacking on extinct varieties of fern. </p> <p>The ships, funnels looming over dock walls and the giant cranes that could lift railway locomotives off a quay and swing them on to the deck of a freighter, spoke of a time when Glasgow was a swaggering, mettlesome city, where fortunes were made in a hurry and spent equally hurriedly on building a great stone city. It's not just the ships that have vanished. The entire landscape is scarcely recognisable. </p> <p>The city has visibly shrivelled, reverting to scrub in places. What little new development there was in the 1970s plumbed ever bleaker depths of mediocrity. Perversely, most of the dock basins were filled in and what little water there is left is undisturbed by traffic and marked by floating debris of polystyrene chip boxes and discarded shopping trollies. </p> <p>Painfully at first, and sometimes to its own surprise, Glasgow is getting a second wind now. The glories of its Victorian centre and its culture-led regeneration strategy gave it another chance. Having successively demolished its original stone tenements and dynamited the concrete towers that replaced them, the city is rebuilding the Gorbals for a third time. It is making up its mind whether it has the boldness to give Zaha Hadid her first chance to build in Britain since the Cardiff Bay Opera House fiasco. </p> <p>Hadid has emerged as the front-runner, alongside the much more conventional practice of RMJM, in a recent competition to design an innovative housing project on Glasgow Green, the follow-up to the year of architecture in 1999. </p> <p>If Hadid is picked for the job, she will build a cluster of serpentine apartment blocks swooping out of Glasgow's East End. And on Pacific Quay, Glasgow's most ambitious Millennium Commission-funded project, the Science Centre, is about to open for business. Following in the footsteps of Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim, Building Design Partnership has designed Britain's first titanium-clad building on a dock pier, surrounded on three sides by water, next to the site that the BBC will occupy. </p> <p>Part of it houses an Imax cinema, a building type beloved of bureacratic Lottery junkies everywhere struggling to inject a little magic into their schemes for urban regeneration, but unsure as to exactly where to find it. An Imax is just perfect for this kind of thing. For architects, it lends itself to making the kind of funny shapes that they can con vince themselves are avant-garde. And for the adminstrators, there is a reliable supply of new material to project on screen to keep the punters coming back for more, without any of the bother of coming up with anything themselves. </p> <p>Glasgow's Imax is mercifully not a mirrored sphere like so many of them, from Bristol to Paris. It looks, instead, like a soft tennis ball that has been gently squeezed. It is positioned to play off the sharply sculptural form of the Science Centre's exhibition building that sits on the dock wall like an ocean liner. At the far end is a tower designed originally by Richard Horden, but completed by BDP, that offers visitors a spectacular view over the city. It is designed ingeniously to rotate slowly in the wind, shifting direction like a sail. </p> <p>These are three giant objects, not unimpressive in themselves, but landmarks rather than cityscape. They conduct a dialogue of a kind with each other and with Norman Foster's not entirely successful Bacofoil-wrapped conference centre across the river. </p> <p>It's easy to see why BDP and Foster designed their buildings in the way that they did. How else could they make a place out of this ruined waste-tip of a landscape, where the only new life in 40 years had been the building of a lumpen exhibtion hall and an enormous car-park? They were out to make commanding gestures, more like logos than architecture and, as such, they served their purpose. </p> <p>But what Glasgow needs now is fabric, rather than yet another landmark. And that is what the BBC's new building can be. It offers the prospect of bringing 24-hour-a-day life to the river. </p> <p>It's a place that will attract the public to studio performances. It's a place that will accommodate programme-makers and administrators. And, as such, it needs to do a lot of things at the same time.

Virtually everyone in the land has heard her, although most people probably don't realise it. Heard Andrew Lloyd Webber's Variations, the opening music to The South Bank Show? That's Ms Thompson's flute. Watched A Touch of Frost lately?

The first proper jazz ensemble she ever played in was the New Jazz Orchestra. I was in it too, and we sat next to one another in the saxophone section. She married the drummer, my pal Jon Hiseman.

It has been in existence ever since and many rising young musicians have passed through its ranks.

It is probably fair to say that the two most widely recognised British jazz names in these countries are Barbara Thompson and Courtney Pine.</p> <p>In a week's time her performing days will come to an end. Barbara explains how it came to this: 'I think it was about seven years ago that I first noticed something.

I just put it down to a lack of practice, but it wasn't that.</p> <p>'Other things began giving trouble and I was getting neckaches and stiffness, too. Eventually, I went to see a neurologist and he diagnosed mild Parkinson's. I did what everybody does, went and looked it up, and got the absolute horrors.

And, you know, needles and all that - goodness knows what they were really thinking. In the end it all became too much.</p> <p>'We told the band the truth then, and it gradually got around.

Last month, Northern Broadsides belted it out in Halifax. Now it's at the Swan. And in Gregory Doran's marvellous new production, it comes up shrewd and playful and pertinent. Shot through with humour and despair, this study of political shenanigans presents diplomacy (alias spin) as a series of playground games played for high stakes; it involves a trio of sorrowful women and a host of cynical men. </p> <p>From the moment that Guy Henry's febrile, flippant King John arrives late to greet the French Ambassador - the trumpets are on their second fanfare and the nobles are rolling their eyes in exasperation - it's clear that the throne is in insolent hands. He rushes in, putting on his crown as if he were pulling on a baseball cap; later, he dangles it in his hand and wags it reprovingly. </p> <p>Instability is the key to Henry's clever, comical performance, which is enhanced by his tendency to spin out the verse in long, warbling lines. He can behave like an infant having a temper tantrum: stamping his foot at the papal emissary. He can produce cadenzas of high camp: flicking his hands, puffing his cheeks, pretending to swoon as he pronounces the word 'excommunicate'. And he can slither with ease into vicious wiliness. </p> <p>Why? Because the main principle governing these characters is political expediency: 'commodity', as it's called by the only plain-speaker - Jo Stone-Fewings's strong, yeomanlike Bastard. And this is made clear - terrifically and blackly - in Doran's production, where as soon as anyone sounds lofty, someone else yawns: at one point, characters gabble their speeches over each other in their eagerness to get themselves heard. David Collings is horribly believable as the unctuous papal legate, writhing with mirth as he sets his lethal traps. </p> <p> King John can easily be staged as a dry discourse on this theme: that's not the case here. Stephen Brimson Lewis's lovely, almost bare design - a bleached wood throne set against a bare brick wall that's coloured white or striped with gold by lighting - is filled with drumming action. Battles are fought to the sound of trumpets by men brandishing flags like bayonets; there's a thrilling theatrical coup when the baby-faced Arthur swoops to his death from the upper gallery. And the three most sympathetic and eloquent characters - all women, played to the hilt - prove once more that Shakespeare was no male chauvinist. </p> <p>The RSC is on a roll. The saga they've made of the Shakespeare Histories has proved to be compulsory theatre. And now, with Peter Whelan's new play, they're supplying a pungent evocation of a more recent past. Whelan's 1996 play The Herbal Bed took off from Stratford to the West End and Broadway. <strong> A Russian in the Woods</strong> also deserves a life beyond The Other Place. </p> <p>A young national serviceman arrives in Berlin in 1950. His job is to guard a deserted army education centre, housed in a once elegant, now dilapidated villa - beautifully conjured up by Simon Higlett's design, with its clutter of army paraphernalia and its shattered, gilt-touched plaster. He has peeped at a Soviet base from the train, and is full of curiosity about the Russians (Turgenev and Chekhov are his bedtime reading). He goes for a walk in the woods, is greeted by a Soviet soldier - and fails to reply. He meets an alluring German girl - and fails to have an affair with her. He runs into a young American soldier, who's not what he seems - and fails to have a homosexual fling. Each encounter involves the possibility of betrayal, and raises questions about what makes someone into an enemy. </p> <p>You could find two apparently old-fashioned things in this: a rite-of-passage play, and an issue play. You could uncover a novel in the rapid twists of its plot and its study of military peculiarities (such as the cap badge which announces that someone works in secret intelligence). You might also detect autobiography: Whelan was himself a national serviceman in Berlin. But this is a dramatist with a sure touch: what you're aware of while watching is an atmospheric excursion, both bitter and wistful, which wears its complications and its larger resonances lightly. </p> <p>Robert Delamere, who declared himself a director to watch when he directed The Force of Change at the Royal Court last year, consolidates his growing reputation. Anthony Flanagan makes a promising stage debut as the cross and sensitive young man; Anna Madeley manoeuvres delicately between sweetness and desperation. Louis Hilyer is constantly engaging as the Flash Harry with a secret life. </p> <p>Alongside their cycle of Shakespeare's Histories, the RSC is running a series of plays by twenty-first century playwrights looking at Britain's past and present. You could make a case for A Russian in the Wood s being one of these. But it's difficult - even this RSC roll has its bumps - to make the case for <strong>Luminosity</strong>. </p> <p>The title is a hostage to fortune. You expect the play to cast light, the actors to be radiant, the design to shine. But Nick Stafford's play, directed in the Pit by Gemma Bodinetz, is so furrowed with good intentions and so clogged with over-explicitness that its plot becomes clouded, and everyone behaves rigidly: even the astute Susan Engel is barely able to glimmer. </p> <p>A young black artist looks into the history of her adoptive white liberal family. Plonk: she finds an ancestor of theirs who engaged in the slave trade. Plonk: she also finds an ancestress of mixed race. Plonk: her investigations turn up some handy metaphors - 'There is no blackness within diamonds - only colours.' Plonk: the question of the family's responsibility for its past is laboriously debated. The characters are pieces of prose that have been cut up and marched around the stage. Kandis Cook's minimal, anti-evocative design - a scoop of glittering stones scattered at the front of a bare white set - looks like something you might find in the foyer of a bank.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Beck's Futures Two</strong> ICA, London SW1 until 20 May </p> <p>Beck's Futures, the massive art prize that nobody yet loves to hate, is to be awarded on 10 April. There will be beer, speeches and sizeable cheques for each of the short-listed artists. And despite the fact that one of them likes to work with catfood and dental-floss, don't expect any tabloid outrage. There will be no spats or recriminations, no critical calumny, no fanged abuse from the art world. </p> <p>This doesn't mean that the show of short-listed art at the ICA is a miracle of incontestable talent. Nor is it because the prize, despite being the biggest in Britain, has not yet made it into our TV schedules. It's more because the event centres on private patronage and is, in its second year, still so new and unchallenged. If an art-loving brewery decides to spend its beer money on up-and-coming artists - 'Tomorrow's talent today' runs the slogan, canny in its caution - then who's going to quibble with that? </p> <p>Well, plenty of people might if the competition ran by the customary rules, according to which a small group of judges, usually gallerists and curators, offer further preferment to an equally small group of artists by ignoring all conflicts of interest. But Beck's is no closed shop. The judges, including Zadie Smith this year, and Jarvis Cocker last, don't choose from the art shows they just happen to have seen. They make their selection from a vast list of candidates supplied by nearly 200 nominators, most of them fellow artists. So two things can already be said in favour of this award - it doesn't take dictation from museums or markets and it must say something about what today's artists prize. </p> <p>To find out what they prize you need only consult the catalogue, in which artists talk about each other with absolute reverence: 'Brian Griffiths's art is evidence of a magic seldom realised beyond childhood' (he makes large and artless toys out of tissue paper, glue and cardboard). 'D.J. Simpson's works casts the readymade panel in the role of pigmented object that is desired belatedly but unsarcastically' (Simpson works with a routing plane, gouging lines out of laminated board). </p> <p>At the ICA, Simpson 0is showing a panel so big it has to be propped against the wall. The incised lines, which expose the rippled layers of wood beneath the shiny black Formica, amount to a kind of painterly abstraction by other means. The craftsmanship is superb - manoeuvring that inflexible tool through such resistant material - and the effect is both austere and seductive. But this is hardly one in the eye for Paul Klee, as claimed by his admirers in the catalogue. </p> <p>Simpson, at 34, is apparently tipped as a potential winner of the \u00a324,000 overall award. He has had solo shows in London, Amsterdam and Dusseldorf. Griffiths has quite a bit of career behind him too, his earliest endeavours long since collected by Charles Saatchi. Simon Bill up and came several years ago, although the oval paintings at the ICA are by far his best, with their deadpan humour and simple facture. In Arabeggsque, an exotic fledgling hatches out of the canvas; in Threw a Monkey in the Sea, the monkey's puzzled face appears in sea-green cameo, as if pressed up against a submarine porthole. </p> <p>But nobody, not even the most dogged footslogger of Hoxton and Shoreditch, could be familiar with all the work in this show.

      "bodyText": "Beck's Futures Two ICA, London SW1 until 20 May Beck's Futures, the massive art prize that nobody yet loves to hate, is to be awarded on 10 April. There will be beer, speeches and sizeable cheques for each of the short-listed artists. And despite the fact that one of them likes to work with catfood and dental-floss, don't expect any tabloid outrage. There will be no spats or recriminations, no critical calumny, no fanged abuse from the art world. This doesn't mean that the show of short-listed art at the ICA is a miracle of incontestable talent. Nor is it because the prize, despite being the biggest in Britain, has not yet made it into our TV schedules. It's more because the event centres on private patronage and is, in its second year, still so new and unchallenged. If an art-loving brewery decides to spend its beer money on up-and-coming artists - 'Tomorrow's talent today' runs the slogan, canny in its caution - then who's going to quibble with that? Well, plenty of people might if the competition ran by the customary rules, according to which a small group of judges, usually gallerists and curators, offer further preferment to an equally small group of artists by ignoring all conflicts of interest. But Beck's is no closed shop. The judges, including Zadie Smith this year, and Jarvis Cocker last, don't choose from the art shows they just happen to have seen. They make their selection from a vast list of candidates supplied by nearly 200 nominators, most of them fellow artists. So two things can already be said in favour of this award - it doesn't take dictation from museums or markets and it must say something about what today's artists prize. To find out what they prize you need only consult the catalogue, in which artists talk about each other with absolute reverence: 'Brian Griffiths's art is evidence of a magic seldom realised beyond childhood' (he makes large and artless toys out of tissue paper, glue and cardboard). 'D.J. Simpson's works casts the readymade panel in the role of pigmented object that is desired belatedly but unsarcastically' (Simpson works with a routing plane, gouging lines out of laminated board). At the ICA, Simpson 0is showing a panel so big it has to be propped against the wall. The incised lines, which expose the rippled layers of wood beneath the shiny black Formica, amount to a kind of painterly abstraction by other means. The craftsmanship is superb - manoeuvring that inflexible tool through such resistant material - and the effect is both austere and seductive. But this is hardly one in the eye for Paul Klee, as claimed by his admirers in the catalogue. Simpson, at 34, is apparently tipped as a potential winner of the \u00a324,000 overall award. He has had solo shows in London, Amsterdam and Dusseldorf. Griffiths has quite a bit of career behind him too, his earliest endeavours long since collected by Charles Saatchi. Simon Bill up and came several years ago, although the oval paintings at the ICA are by far his best, with their deadpan humour and simple facture. In Arabeggsque, an exotic fledgling hatches out of the canvas; in Threw a Monkey in the Sea, the monkey's puzzled face appears in sea-green cameo, as if pressed up against a submarine porthole. But nobody, not even the most dogged footslogger of Hoxton and Shoreditch, could be familiar with all the work in this show. Gemma Iles, for example, is still a student at the Royal College of Art and her photographic tableaux - mute relationships between non-committal figures - aren't quite as mysteriously unresolved as they one day might be. Clare Woods, in her twenties, has mastered the art of Gary Hume, though her subject matter is pure Blair Witch Project - deep woods in sepulchral darkness. Presumably, Hume doesn't find this homage, since he is one of this year's judges. Dan Holdsworth is still turning out melodramatic intimations of doom. His photographs of deserted hypermarkets and cliff edges by night, strategically customised with overlays of sinister red light, pile clich\u00e9 on menacing clich\u00e9. David Burrows's work acts as a kind of comic antidote, the aftermath of something that never actually happened. Burrows's works with what he calls 'plastic-foamtastic', a brightly coloured material normally used for bath toys. He uses it to create cartoon crime scenes that are later photographed - arson at a party, clothes, furniture, pizza boxes, all going up in Disneyfied flames.

The Best Newcomer Award should have gone to Sugababes, the soulful north London trio just shy of their GCSEs. When their spunky debut single 'Overload' landed in the Top 10 last autumn, the music press breathed a sigh of relief. Here, at last, was a teen sensation with panache and talent. Most importantly, they weren't recruited through the small ads by a rapacious Svengali. </p> <p>The band was born when Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan met Siobhan Docherty at a party and discovered a shared love of harmonies and soul divas. While borrowing their empowering attitude from American R&amp;B royalty such as Destiny's Child and En Vogue, there was a distinctly British feel to their impressive album One Touch, which was partly produced by former Massive Attack collaborator Cameron McVey. It was more than just the sharp two-step beats and sweet interchangeable vocals - their lyrics had attitude but were neither bombastic nor explicit. They could be dismissive, as in the sly track 'Same Old Story', but didn't try to be too streetwise. </p> <p>These girls are accessible rather than aspirational. While their American cousins are label queens, Sugababes, no doubt partly due to their age, are high street chic. That's not to say they have much in common with the cheap'n'cheerful confection that is Billie Piper. Or the Spice Girls, who failed when they tried to reinvent themselves as soul divas. The obvious comparison is with All Saints, with whom they share a record label, production team and dress sense. But the Saints were never that credible after their first album, relying instead on forests of newsprint to boost sales. </p> <p>Sugababes look more like the real thing, but tonight is only their third live appearance. Their credibility is bolstered by NME 's sponsorship of the current three-date mini-tour for invited fans only (a sign of the time, but what - you have to wonder - do the music paper's readers think of this strange relationship?) </p> <p>Predictably, the striking thing about Sugababes is their doe-eyed appearance. Of course, they're young but you don't expect them to look so fresh-faced. Even in trendy made-up and clubbing gear they wouldn't pass an ID check. </p> <p>As accomplished as they seem to be in the recording studio, they are understandably tentative performers, which makes them rather endearing. They amble onstage without fanfare, singing 'Look at Me'. This song about over-protective parents includes the line: 'I know I'm still young with no life experience/ But can't I learn from my mistakes not yours.' It seems particularly apt. While their four-piece band get happy and funky behind them, the trio look like they are concentrating too hard to really enjoy themselves. This has the effect of making them seem as cool and aloof as those backing singers in the Human League. Occasionally they flash finger signs at each other to get in position for the next stage of choreography. </p> <p>At the end of the gig Mutya has a nervous giggle with the other two that suggests she's glad it's over and there were no cock-ups. </p> <p>Of course they're not really standoffish. They invite a boy on stage halfway through the set, plonk him on a stool, and coyly slink around while he gazes up at them in adoration. Things further improve during the stylish minor key R&amp;B of 'Overload'. Sadly, that bouncy snare sound is absent but it's still a winning rendition. </p> <p>During the En Vogue flavoured 'The Real Thing', the girls, increasingly loose- limbed, start to strut. For the encore, 'Run for Cover', they strike Charlie's Angels poses and start vogueing. But that's the last song. On the evidence of tonight, Keisha is the most natural and confident performer and Siobhan is the most bashful. Of course, these are early days for the band and their assurance is certain to rise along with their record sales. Overall, this has been an efficient albeit slightly awkward performance. They're still a band to watch - but just give them a bit more time.</p>",

The anorexia debate has reared its head again, while the magazine's editor, Alison Hall, explains that her publication, which reveals slimming secrets of the stars, is encouraging exercise and 'nutritionally sound diets'. 'I think everybody wants a beautiful body,' Hall told me. 'We are reflecting public interest. We've researched it. People want the celebrities, they want the diets. We're not forcing it on the public.'</p> <p>And that is precisely what is interesting: why is there a demand for it? The magazine itself is cheap, bright and cheerful, and therefore arguably less 'damaging', in terms of portraying an unattainable look or lifestyle, than something like Vogue. On the other hand, Vogue is clearly about dreaming of glamour, whereas Celebrity Bodies claims you can have it, if only you follow the meal plans. Hall says that 25 to 35-year-old women, the target market for Celebrity Bodies, 'are on a diet probably more than any other age group. I think it's around 48 per cent'. (That is, 48 per cent of women in that age group are on a diet at any given time.) 'And then you look at the celebrity market,' Hall continues, 'and their circulation has increased by about 142 per cent in the last year.'</p> <p>There's no point in attacking Hall's new magazine as the root of something dangerous: clearly, it is a symptom rather than a cause. But what, exactly, is going on?</p> <p>Celebrities are the saints and gurus of our age. They get thinner and thinner before our eyes.

This week, OK! magazine printed a photograph of Geri coming out of a meeting of Overeaters Anonymous; Liz Hurley was recently quoted as saying that she worries about her weight; and Uma Thurman announced some weeks ago that she thought she was fat. It is often said that the famous encourage anorexia in the rest of us, but the equation works the other way, too: with the eyes of the world upon them, who wouldn't become obsessed with their looks?

But after a while, the fashion wore off, and he ends up a forgotten circus attraction. 'Perhaps it was not his fasting at all that had made him so extremely emaciated,' Kafka writes, 'perhaps what had so emaciated him was simply dissatisfaction with himself.' He starves himself until he is literally invisible, and when the circus manager wonders why an empty cage has not been put to some use, he finds the tiny hunger artist buried beneath the straw.

As a joke, to show the blatant truth of these publications' appeal, you might call it 'Celebrity Bodies'. Clearly, this game has been played in the offices of Emap Publications, and the winner has been put straight into production. Celebrity Bodies was launched last Thursday - with a cover that screams 'Geri: the TRUTH behind this body!' - and has instantly come under attack. The anorexia debate has reared its head again, while the magazine's editor, Alison Hall, explains that her publication, which reveals slimming secrets of the stars, is encouraging exercise and 'nutritionally sound diets'.

      "body": "<p>The claim of the old Panorama on the BBC - a bold claim then, rather wistful repeated now - was that television is a 'window on the world'. I would say that it is not so much a window as a mirror - the mirror - and, in some ways, the maker of our society.</p> <p>The previous form you can compare it with - apart from radio, but radio is its older sibling, its bloodline - is the novel. There, in what Henry James called that 'loose and baggy monster', was, and is, the capacity to incorporate everything. In the novel you could, and can, find the tough and the tender, the adventurous and the domestic, the intellectual and the visceral, the panoramic and the microscopic, the sexy and the chaste, war and peace. But although the novel has ambitions to let nothing escape its elastic kingdom, it is difficult to see how we can find analogies in print for Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?, or Match of the Day, or News at Ten - that ever-rolling narrative - or Cilla Black. In any competition in size, television wins.</p> <p>Is it an art? Well, artists certainly work in it: writers, directors, actors, cameramen, film and tape editors. Whether an agglomeration of artists turns a medium into an art form is a nice point. No doubt theses are on their way.</p> <p>The fact that on this one medium you can see and hear the crisis in the Middle East, the grace of a football match, the wit of a Python, the world of a Bennett, the hushed expertise of David Attenborough means it is a different order of communication, not outstripping all others - by no means - but through its unique combination of mass appeal and minority grip, able to reflect and act on society in ways never before thought possible.</p> <p>At the heart of it there is an interesting paradox. We all talk about 'television' or 'the telly' as if it were one thing. But we rarely say 'print'. We talk of 'the novel', even those who feel a little queasy that all the variety of novels can be sheltered under one umbrella, but if we were to talk of 'print', we would have to include newspapers, of course, and thousands of magazines, textbooks, poetry, history, philosophy, theology, psychology, play texts. Go into a big bookshop or newsagent: that's print.</p> <p>To say: 'I saw this terrible or marvellous thing in print the other day' or: 'I can't bear/don't watch print' would be ridiculous. Yet television is every bit as various as print - its several strata of drama, the plays of Dennis Potter, the explosions of Jimmy McGovern or Lynda La Plante, the probing of Lucy Gannon, Alan Bleasdale's volcanoes, Alan Bennett's fine brushstrokes, Alan Plater's disturbing reality, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, John Cleese, on it goes; Victoria Wood's shrewd use of comedy, the teams on the Street, EastEnders, The Bill - each with its own line, style, attack. And this is only the beginning.</p> <p>There are documentaries, often with directors of the highest order - social, political and arts documentaries fit to stand alongside the feature films or the plays of the day. There is the ingenious funfare of entertainment, threading in traditions which go back to the ancient strollers and medieval travelling players. There are horror stories - real and imagined - as grisly as any Grimm, and fairy stories imagined and real as 'Rapunzel', as strange as 'Rip Van Winkle', as boisterous as 'The Three Bears'. And sport - the display of excellence on so many fields, legends of often unimaginable achievement, coming into our houses. There is the dark side; when has prostitution and its accompanying violence ever been examined as often or watched by so many? When has the black past - Hitler, Stalin - and the bleak present - East Timor, Aids, famines - been as well reported, as relentlessly fed into minds which sometimes do not know how to, do not want to cope with it.</p> <p>Perhaps this is the reason for the paradox. We want to keep this thing tame. We need to keep it under control. So we lump it all together and call it television, the telly, hoping thereby to pretend it has so much less of the influence than it clearly has. Perhaps we fear it. And so we use the sameness of the delivery system - that tame little box - to be dismissive of it. Perhaps we are ashamed of the hold it has on us - or, if not on us, then on the nation at large. For even if we claim we do not much watch it, what is the latest conversation at the water cooler?</p> <p>It is Vanessa Feltz in Celebrity Big Brother and poor Darius, dumped from Popstars and then dumped on by the world and its mother. It is those terrible pictures of that earthquake in India, that avalanche of mud in Italy; it is the arrival of our new heroine yachtswoman or Steven Redgrave's fifth gold in five Olympics. It is the awful sight of those cattle and sheep being slung onto funeral pyres with echoes of Viking burials, medieval plagues, terrible massacre. Perhaps that secret shame breeds guilt for, after all, what are we doing but just watching, sitting and watching? It's a state of mind and body that we do not resent so much in an uncomfortable theatre, say, watching a depressingly poor play but which easily moves us to guilt if we are on the couch watching an excellently scripted edition of Morse.</p> <p>In a sense, by trivialising the medium, we can trivialise the message, and that, I believe, is what is really going on in our relationship with television. We do not want it to have the importance in our lives which, in the lives of so many - people of all classes, types, backgrounds, incomes, tastes, aspirations, ambitions - it does have. This, probably, is why self-appointed elites are so quick to downgrade and dismiss television: they do not like its power, its hold on the people, just as the high-born admirals hated Nelson's command of the ordinary seamen - 'and yet the whole Fleet loved him, damn their eyes'. Television is a force which seems to threaten their hold on the reins. Yet television does not threaten older forms. It often gives them new life.</p> <p>The history of television is very like that of other new media. Thus the novel, which began life in the fertile gutters of melodrama and sensation, was dismissed as a gross intruder into the salon of letters until great practitioners and passionate readers simply swept it into power. A parallel story describes the early cinema. What those forms have in common is that they are new, they rely mostly on the common people coming on board to get under way. And all of them have, initially most of all, a mesmerising quality.</p> <p>So the big and, to some, the frightening, the inconceivable and unacceptable message is that television is our real national theatre. It is British filmmaking sometimes at its best. It is the true UK comedy store and national stadium for sports. It is the planet at a switch and the stars in their constellations; and it takes us right back to the fire at the mouth of the cave, warming us and protecting us.</p> <p>Yet, as David Chater wrote in the Times recently: 'There is a common assumption that television rots your brain, destroys your attention span and ruins your health.' He described the concern of his friends for his mental health after hearing that he had become a television critic. The response of his friends is not uncommon, I suggest, among those whose assumption is that only they hold the keys to real cultural truth, quality and worth. As Chater pointed out: 'A great deal of television in this country is of astonishingly high calibre.'</p> <p>His list of such programmes was impressive. Any fair-minded and intelligent viewer could come up with a similar list. Why is it, then, that Chater's undoubtedly intelligent friends chose to be so ignorant, prejudiced and snobbish? Snobbish is easy - it's still the wearisome badge of authority worn by those desperate to be different without the talent to be distinctive. I even know people who announce proudly that they never watch television as if that alone is the equivalent of a first-class honours degree. Once again, I suggest, this asinine or panic-stricken reaction is, in fact, a tribute to the force of a new medium so strange and yet so ordinary that it is very difficult to grapple with.</p> <p>What in the broadest terms is the message of that medium at the moment? It is both traditional and remarkable. It is that we want to see ourselves, warts and all. In every society the elite has wanted to see itself in its culture: pharaohs begat monuments to pharaohs; Greeks begat sculpture and drama and philosophy reflecting the ideas and dilemmas and images of that most extraordinary of peoples; Elizabethans begat stories of monarchs and nobles, though the rise of the gentry showed through, as did the demands of the groundlings in the shape of the comic characters. But, largely, until quite recently, ordinary people, what used to be called working-class people, were, in our art and literature, caricatures, clowns, servants - or absent. Mostly the latter.</p> <p>On television they have, for the first time in the history of our culture, taken over the world. We see ourselves, us, the mass. We are now the cultural equation, we are centre stage. We see ourselves in EastEnders or Coronation Street ; we see ourselves in Popstars and Big Brother ; we see ourselves in The Royle Family , watching them watching; we see ourselves on Cilla and Barrymore - but it goes further. Ordinary people are now called in for what were once thought of as positions above them. For example, 'ordinary' farmers com ment on foot and mouth; 'ordinary' witnesses tell us of train crashes, earthquakes, wars. 'Ordinary' lads play football, which demonstrates the beautiful game of our time and commentators strive to be as ordinary as they can manage, to reflect the voice of the crowd.</p> <p>The airwaves seethe with phone-ins, the referendum of the ratings becomes a sometimes brutal instrument of democracy in organising the schedules; at last, those who were quite recently called 'the great unwashed' now rule the waves, and not before time. Television is the New World, the America of the arts.</p> <p>Moreover, the demand is that the people be as unmediated as possible. Of course there is art and craft in the construction of Coronation Street, EastEnders, The Bill, Big Brother, but the important issue is that it seems real. No matter that Ken Barlow has had a more varied love life than Valentino (mind you, he does live in Lancashire), he must retain ordinariness. That is the point. If the term had not been appropriated for political purposes, I would call this the 'People's Art Form'.</p> <p>There is of course at the moment - these are early days, it is a new medium - plenty to carp about. Even if there were not, we British would truffle it out. From having had the largest empire the world has ever known, which depended entirely on self-confidence, we have gone instantly to the top of the league of complainers - about ourselves. And television has joined the weather as a part of our daily moan.</p> <p>And there is cause for criticism. The medium at present has no place for the message - the life, the style, the character - of introverts, the quieter, the more thoughtful, the less drunk, the less unlicensed. These people are often those who make the world go round. Think of Darwin, of Freud, Newton, their reach through the centuries. Although television can deal brilliantly with such figures in documentary form, its current tone is anti-introvert. Loudness, gregariousness, lad- and ladettishness are imperative. You must be larky, joshy, noisy, especially if you are young. Where are the series called Men Behaving Philosophically or Women Thinking Deeply or The Examined Life, The Stiff Upper Lip? Perhaps the form itself, like much cinema and theatre, cannot finally give to that introverted part of us the same satisfactions we derive from novels and poetry and music. But I do feel it ought to try harder.</p> <p>Similarly, it is proving dif ficult for television fully to serve minorities. One problem is that minorities are so numerous and television is so expensive and, until recently, limited in its space. This is now changing radically. Look at the minority to which I have devoted my television career - the arts. The fight is on to convert the indisputable wide interest in the arts - more people went to the Tate Modern one Saturday afternoon (75,000) than saw the game at Wembley - into an integrated audience which fills a whole channel. It's out there. The conversion is the challenge, as with any new faith.</p> <p>At one stage, no one would have called the novel art, nor film, nor radio. So what of television itself? Let's go to the least likely art form, the bedrock of television, the belittlingly named soap opera. Has that saturating message from the medium a claim as art? It is, I think, fun to couple it with its polar opposite, the latest art as in artefact, sculpture, conceptual work. For instance, is Coronation Street likely to be more valued and influential in the long run than the urinal named as art by Marcel Duchamp? Because Duchamp declared a urinal to be art so it was, agreed thousands of artists following him, thousands of critics, hundreds of dealers,museums and collectors. Tracey Emin's unmade bed is in a direct line from the urinal. Duchamp's urinal is an important, even key icon of twentieth-century art.</p> <p>But might Coronation Street - whose characters would not be too struck on Duchamp's lavatory and the idea that it is worth several million pounds - also be art? Might the flag-bearer of the big message on television for the last 40 years outlive the lavatory?</p> <p>Martin Scorsese once said that if he wanted to know what late twentieth-century culture was like, he would record the whole of a few weeks on television and that would tell him. When Peter Brook, the distinguished theatre director, and his friend, the late Poet Laureate Ted Hughes, went to Africa and India to conduct their experiments in basic theatre reaching for the profound, they extolled, as so many do, the village storyteller, the man - most often a man - who told the tales which kept the community enthralled, tales very local, rich in particular reference; endless tales, tales which were deeply sown into the fabric of the lives of those they addressed.</p> <p>It sounds rather like Coronation Street, although of course it takes a gulp of faith to admit it. So: will it be the lavatory or the Street?</p> <p>It's tempting to say at last the people will decide.</p> <p>This is an edited extract of Melvyn Bragg's Edward Boyle Memorial Lecture, given at Leeds University, which can be seen tonight on Artsworld at 9pm, and again on Monday at 4pm.

Perhaps this is the reason for the paradox. We want to keep this thing tame. We need to keep it under control. So we lump it all together and call it television, the telly, hoping thereby to pretend it has so much less of the influence than it clearly has. Perhaps we fear it. And so we use the sameness of the delivery system - that tame little box - to be dismissive of it. Perhaps we are ashamed of the hold it has on us - or, if not on us, then on the nation at large. For even if we claim we do not much watch it, what is the latest conversation at the water cooler? It is Vanessa Feltz in Celebrity Big Brother and poor Darius, dumped from Popstars and then dumped on by the world and its mother. It is those terrible pictures of that earthquake in India, that avalanche of mud in Italy; it is the arrival of our new heroine yachtswoman or Steven Redgrave's fifth gold in five Olympics. It is the awful sight of those cattle and sheep being slung onto funeral pyres with echoes of Viking burials, medieval plagues, terrible massacre. Perhaps that secret shame breeds guilt for, after all, what are we doing but just watching, sitting and watching? It's a state of mind and body that we do not resent so much in an uncomfortable theatre, say, watching a depressingly poor play but which easily moves us to guilt if we are on the couch watching an excellently scripted edition of Morse. In a sense, by trivialising the medium, we can trivialise the message, and that, I believe, is what is really going on in our relationship with television. We do not want it to have the importance in our lives which, in the lives of so many - people of all classes, types, backgrounds, incomes, tastes, aspirations, ambitions - it does have. This, probably, is why self-appointed elites are so quick to downgrade and dismiss television: they do not like its power, its hold on the people, just as the high-born admirals hated Nelson's command of the ordinary seamen - 'and yet the whole Fleet loved him, damn their eyes'. Television is a force which seems to threaten their hold on the reins. Yet television does not threaten older forms. It often gives them new life. The history of television is very like that of other new media. Thus the novel, which began life in the fertile gutters of melodrama and sensation, was dismissed as a gross intruder into the salon of letters until great practitioners and passionate readers simply swept it into power. A parallel story describes the early cinema. What those forms have in common is that they are new, they rely mostly on the common people coming on board to get under way. And all of them have, initially most of all, a mesmerising quality. So the big and, to some, the frightening, the inconceivable and unacceptable message is that television is our real national theatre. It is British filmmaking sometimes at its best. It is the true UK comedy store and national stadium for sports. It is the planet at a switch and the stars in their constellations; and it takes us right back to the fire at the mouth of the cave, warming us and protecting us. Yet, as David Chater wrote in the Times recently: 'There is a common assumption that television rots your brain, destroys your attention span and ruins your health.' He described the concern of his friends for his mental health after hearing that he had become a television critic. The response of his friends is not uncommon, I suggest, among those whose assumption is that only they hold the keys to real cultural truth, quality and worth. As Chater pointed out: 'A great deal of television in this country is of astonishingly high calibre.' His list of such programmes was impressive. Any fair-minded and intelligent viewer could come up with a similar list. Why is it, then, that Chater's undoubtedly intelligent friends chose to be so ignorant, prejudiced and snobbish? Snobbish is easy - it's still the wearisome badge of authority worn by those desperate to be different without the talent to be distinctive. I even know people who announce proudly that they never watch television as if that alone is the equivalent of a first-class honours degree. Once again, I suggest, this asinine or panic-stricken reaction is, in fact, a tribute to the force of a new medium so strange and yet so ordinary that it is very difficult to grapple with. What in the broadest terms is the message of that medium at the moment? It is both traditional and remarkable. It is that we want to see ourselves, warts and all. In every society the elite has wanted to see itself in its culture: pharaohs begat monuments to pharaohs; Greeks begat sculpture and drama and philosophy reflecting the ideas and dilemmas and images of that most extraordinary of peoples; Elizabethans begat stories of monarchs and nobles, though the rise of the gentry showed through, as did the demands of the groundlings in the shape of the comic characters. But, largely, until quite recently, ordinary people, what used to be called working-class people, were, in our art and literature, caricatures, clowns, servants - or absent. Mostly the latter. On television they have, for the first time in the history of our culture, taken over the world. We see ourselves, us, the mass. We are now the cultural equation, we are centre stage. We see ourselves in EastEnders or Coronation Street ; we see ourselves in Popstars and Big Brother ; we see ourselves in The Royle Family , watching them watching; we see ourselves on Cilla and Barrymore - but it goes further. Ordinary people are now called in for what were once thought of as positions above them. For example, 'ordinary' farmers com ment on foot and mouth; 'ordinary' witnesses tell us of train crashes, earthquakes, wars. 'Ordinary' lads play football, which demonstrates the beautiful game of our time and commentators strive to be as ordinary as they can manage, to reflect the voice of the crowd. The airwaves seethe with phone-ins, the referendum of the ratings becomes a sometimes brutal instrument of democracy in organising the schedules; at last, those who were quite recently called 'the great unwashed' now rule the waves, and not before time. Television is the New World, the America of the arts. Moreover, the demand is that the people be as unmediated as possible. Of course there is art and craft in the construction of Coronation Street, EastEnders, The Bill, Big Brother, but the important issue is that it seems real. No matter that Ken Barlow has had a more varied love life than Valentino (mind you, he does live in Lancashire), he must retain ordinariness. That is the point. If the term had not been appropriated for political purposes, I would call this the 'People's Art Form'. There is of course at the moment - these are early days, it is a new medium - plenty to carp about. Even if there were not, we British would truffle it out. From having had the largest empire the world has ever known, which depended entirely on self-confidence, we have gone instantly to the top of the league of complainers - about ourselves. And television has joined the weather as a part of our daily moan. And there is cause for criticism. The medium at present has no place for the message - the life, the style, the character - of introverts, the quieter, the more thoughtful, the less drunk, the less unlicensed. These people are often those who make the world go round. Think of Darwin, of Freud, Newton, their reach through the centuries. Although television can deal brilliantly with such figures in documentary form, its current tone is anti-introvert. Loudness, gregariousness, lad- and ladettishness are imperative. You must be larky, joshy, noisy, especially if you are young. Where are the series called Men Behaving Philosophically or Women Thinking Deeply or The Examined Life, The Stiff Upper Lip? Perhaps the form itself, like much cinema and theatre, cannot finally give to that introverted part of us the same satisfactions we derive from novels and poetry and music. But I do feel it ought to try harder. Similarly, it is proving dif ficult for television fully to serve minorities. One problem is that minorities are so numerous and television is so expensive and, until recently, limited in its space. This is now changing radically. Look at the minority to which I have devoted my television career - the arts. The fight is on to convert the indisputable wide interest in the arts - more people went to the Tate Modern one Saturday afternoon (75,000) than saw the game at Wembley - into an integrated audience which fills a whole channel. It's out there. The conversion is the challenge, as with any new faith. At one stage, no one would have called the novel art, nor film, nor radio. So what of television itself? Let's go to the least likely art form, the bedrock of television, the belittlingly named soap opera. Has that saturating message from the medium a claim as art? It is, I think, fun to couple it with its polar opposite, the latest art as in artefact, sculpture, conceptual work. For instance, is Coronation Street likely to be more valued and influential in the long run than the urinal named as art by Marcel Duchamp? Because Duchamp declared a urinal to be art so it was, agreed thousands of artists following him, thousands of critics, hundreds of dealers,museums and collectors. Tracey Emin's unmade bed is in a direct line from the urinal. Duchamp's urinal is an important, even key icon of twentieth-century art. But might Coronation Street - whose characters would not be too struck on Duchamp's lavatory and the idea that it is worth several million pounds - also be art? Might the flag-bearer of the big message on television for the last 40 years outlive the lavatory? Martin Scorsese once said that if he wanted to know what late twentieth-century culture was like, he would record the whole of a few weeks on television and that would tell him. When Peter Brook, the distinguished theatre director, and his friend, the late Poet Laureate Ted Hughes, went to Africa and India to conduct their experiments in basic theatre reaching for the profound, they extolled, as so many do, the village storyteller, the man - most often a man - who told the tales which kept the community enthralled, tales very local, rich in particular reference; endless tales, tales which were deeply sown into the fabric of the lives of those they addressed. It sounds rather like Coronation Street, although of course it takes a gulp of faith to admit it. So: will it be the lavatory or the Street? It's tempting to say at last the people will decide.

      "body": "<p><strong> Sam Taylor moved with his wife, Odile, and their three children - Oscar, five, Milo, three, and Paul-Emile, 21 months - from a semi in Hertfordshire to a 'maison de matre' in rural south-west France in January. This is the second of a series of bulletins on their new life.</strong> </p> <p>Spring has sprung in southern France. It's 10 weeks since we arrived here, and in that time the trees have started budding, sun shining, birds singing and the boys and I have emerged from our cocoons. Odile has had fewer problems integrating with village life, being a) French, b) female and c) not sociopathically shy. </p> <p>Indeed, by the time of her birthday in early February, she was able to nip down to the mairie in order to post a letter and come back three hours later tipsy on the local aperitif, Floc de Gascogne, and with enough gossip to fill a newspaper. </p> <p>To begin with, most of the gossip concerned the house's previous owner, Monsieur D, whose departure was celebrated with a giant village fete. It took us a while to work out why this smoothly charming man was so disliked, but then we found the fascist newspapers in the boiler room and the FN and Le Pen stencils in the barn. Our postman, a garrulous Communist, was particularly scathing in his judgment. </p> <p>In time, we grew to loathe Monsieur D with the same intensity as our fellow villagers. Because, unfortunately, when we moved in, Monsieur D did not entirely move out. He left us vast piles of wood, barns full of rubbish, and - for three days - his poor hunting-dog locked in a cage. </p> <p>For weeks and weeks, we put on strained smiles as he drove his Jeep and trailer into our garden every morning and slowly took away his wood. Then things started turning nasty. He ran over the boys' trike and didn't apologise. He put a padlock on a barn door and refused to remove his rubbish. I got angry and yelled insults at him in French (not grammatically correct perhaps, but with enough force to make him blanch). </p> <p>One day, the boys discovered a barrel full of used engine oil which he had thoughtfully left for us in one of the barns. They got covered in the black toxic stuff and Paul-Emile narrowly avoided falling headfirst into it. We mentioned this little incident to Monsieur D and he told us to sue him if we wanted to. </p> <p>Odile then made use of her knowledge of local gossip to comment sarcastically on his private life. He had a chainsaw in his hands when she did this, but thankfully he didn't kill her, and opted instead to leave and never return. We celebrated with a bottle of Floc, relieved finally to have the whole property to ourselves, though I did regret never having used the phrase ' cochon de fasciste ' to his face. </p> <p>That, however, is the only thing that prevents me being able to declare: ' Je ne regrette rien. ' Because despite all the turbulence of these first two months, none of us ever finds ourselves pining for our old life in England. Odile misses her friends and I miss my tennis partners, but... constant rain, traffic smog, full-time work, office politics, foot and mouth? Er, non merci. I wake up every morning, open the shutters, breathe in the unpolluted air, feel the sun on my face and get a strange light feeling inside my chest as I think about the day's work, if work is the right word. </p> <p>In the first weeks, this consisted mostly of looking after the kids and buying things for the house. Rugs, furniture, plants, tools, lamps. That sort of thing. Every day the place felt more like ours, apart from the creeping shadow of Monsieur D outside. Then the temperature rose and I started using the tools: sawing wood, digging with a pickaxe, removing large rocks from the earth and hurling them on to a pile. One gloriously hot afternoon was spent shovelling cow manure into the vegetable garden; another two wrenching a tree root from the earth. </p> <p>Now, these are not the sort of activities I ever attempted at home in England, where I would break into a cold sweat at the mere sight of a hammer. But there is a kind of perverse glamour to manual labour in a warm country. You toil, you sweat, you stand back with a cold drink and survey the fruits of your labour. </p> <p>You look at the mountains and listen to the birds and feel at one with nature. And you dream of the rewards you will get in a month or two, when your beans and melons and purple sprouting broccoli shoot up from the soil. In terms of time spent and financial value gained, it is sub-minimum wage, obviously, but the satisfaction I got when I lifted up that tree root like the head of a vanquished foe... well, you can't buy that. Still, I think I may borrow a Rotovator to dig the next potager. </p> <p>Occasionally I worry about money, but no more often than I did in England, when I was earning four times more than I am now. Not having a mortgage helps; ditto a social life. And I'm writing a novel, so a period of penury prior to its success is only to be expected. Anyway, life costs less here: food and drink are much cheaper, of course, and in a month's time we will have chickens and a grapefruit bush, so at least that will be breakfast taken care of. I'm still keen on the idea of rearing a pig for meat, but Odile's convinced the children will fall in love with it and we will never be able to turn it into sausages, chops and pat\u00e9. </p> <p>One question our friends ask us is: have we changed? I don't know really. The biggest difference for me is that I have a lot more energy during the day and I feel a lot more tired by late evening. I concentrate better and feel more relaxed. I spend more time outside and I use my body more. I wear old, dirty jeans all the time instead of just most of the time. I read books instead of newspapers. And I haven't been ill since I got here (having spent half my winters in England suffering with asthma). </p> <p>The biggest difference for Odile is being able to wander round the garden in knickers and wellies without having to worry about what the neighbours will think. She loves the extra space, the slower pace of life, the absence of traffic, the warmer weather, being able to speak her native language. And the only downside is she sees a lot more of me. </p> <p>So, our lives have changed, but I don't think we have. Our children have changed enormously, though. Paul-Emile now laughs at huge angry dogs (there are parts of rural France where huge angry dogs outnumber people) but startles at the distant sound of a car engine. Oscar and Milo have grown closer to each other in the face of adversity. They still squabble over toys occasionally, but more often go on about how much they love each other. </p> <p>Oscar puts his arm round Milo's shoulders every morning when they walk into the school playground. Neither of them cries. They still want to speak English - or just run riot in the garden - when they come home, but they have overcome their xenophobia regarding French books and videos. Milo says proudly that he is 'becoming French'. </p> <p>At the moment, my French is still slightly better than theirs, but it won't be for long. Before I came here, I imagined studying for an hour a day, but in reality it's been less than an hour a week. I read Tin-Tin and Asterix and Le Petit Prince and I've listened to a CD containing reports on Chirac and the new Grand-Duc of Luxembourg. But all of this is of limited use when your primary need is to figure out the mumbled jokes of the slipper-wearing mums outside the school gates. However, I think that in the past week I may have killed two oiseaux with one pierre. In short, I have joined a tennis club and had proper conversations in French with the other players. </p> <p>Now all I need is to start playing doubles with the head of the Securit\u00e9 Sociale. At least then they might decide to give me medical cover without charging me more in payments than I'm earning. Yes, I'm afraid the notorious French red tape has wrapped itself around us and is being pulled tight. </p> <p>Honestly, you go to all the trouble of marrying a bloody Frenchwoman and what does it get you? Rien! Still, at least when the local farmers start moaning about the government, I can join in with true passion. And that, as any French person will tell you, is far more important than correct grammar.</p>",

The ethos of the school itself is entirely in keeping with our own principles and values.</p> <p>Having met some of the other parents and children though, I'm becoming increasingly uneasy that our liberal values are not widely held. I'm worried that along with the accent and vocabulary of her peers she will also pick up what appears to be a very narrow-minded, uneducated attitude. I want my daughter to be able to adapt and to fit in with her friends at school but I don't necessarily want her to model her behaviour on theirs. I want her to like them but not be like them.</p> <p>Am I worrying unnecessarily? Or am I a hypocritical snob who should abandon her flimsy principles and send her children to private school?<br>P.J. of London</p> <p>Let me dispel the notion that private schools are havens where standards are high, teachers models of rectitude and learning, children all come from liberal-minded families, and where your little ones will be protected from the sins and sordidness of the world.

      "bodyText": "I am a professional, married woman with two young children. The eldest, who is four, has just started at our local primary school. It's a school that I was keen for her to attend because it has a mix of racial and social cultures and as a white, middle-class family, I thought it important for her to go to a local school that was representative of the cultural and social mix of the society in which we live. The ethos of the school itself is entirely in keeping with our own principles and values. Having met some of the other parents and children though, I'm becoming increasingly uneasy that our liberal values are not widely held. I'm worried that along with the accent and vocabulary of her peers she will also pick up what appears to be a very narrow-minded, uneducated attitude. I want my daughter to be able to adapt and to fit in with her friends at school but I don't necessarily want her to model her behaviour on theirs. I want her to like them but not be like them. Am I worrying unnecessarily? Or am I a hypocritical snob who should abandon her flimsy principles and send her children to private school? P.J. of London Let me dispel the notion that private schools are havens where standards are high, teachers models of rectitude and learning, children all come from liberal-minded families, and where your little ones will be protected from the sins and sordidness of the world. The only difference is that the richer sectors of society who can afford school fees are in the habit of erring more expen sively and exorbitantly, and with greater facility for cover-up. At such a place, your daughter would acquire polished manners and a genteel accent, but she will rub shoulders with a much narrower class of society, with all its prejudices, than in the public sector. My medical colleagues who, almost without exception, send their children to private schools tell stories of the endemic use of drugs, the core of disrupters and troublemakers, the decline of discipline and ever younger age of rebellion. It's an excellent plan to send her to a thoroughly mixed school as long as there are enough children sufficiently near to her own section of society to whom she can immediately relate. Out of her element entirely, she is at risk of rejection, bullying and maybe long-term alienation. Monitor the state of her mind and her capacity for making friends. Be prepared to reconsider if she doesn't mix, but give her time.

      "body": "<p>The scene is one David Lynch would have envied: curvy red velvet seats swoosh around walls beneath curtains of cut-glass beads; the lighting is a dim, dark pink. Every outfit is culled, in a postmodern sort of way, from some stock American look: the women at the door are dressed the way air stewardesses were in the 60s; the men standing guard are like elegant bellboys; the hostesses are required to wear short skirts, and one of them is a perfect imitation of Audrey Hepburn; the girls who clear the tables are darting about, their long, fishnet legs topped by bunny outfits in baby-pink satin. </p> <p>Until last year, Tokyo's nightlife or sex life barely made a mark on the average Briton's brain - a geisha might have been imagined, or someone might have repeated the well-worn myth that schoolgirls sell their knickers on the street. But now it conjures up, first and unforgettably, the name of a dead girl. In the long months when Lucie Blackman was missing, attention was focused not just on her disappearance, but also on her circumstances - on the mysteries, to British minds, of the place that she had gone from. Where was the Roppongi district and what was it like? What was a bar hostess expected to do? Was she part of the Tokyo sex industry, and what, if she was, would that mean? </p> <p>I have come to try and separate the myths of sex - and sexism - in Tokyo from the facts, but the territory turns out to be hard to navigate. Every corner seems to throw up some new paradox that makes it impossible to import and impose Western views. Convenience stores sell glossy magazines that look at first glance as though they could be some version of Smash Hits. They are, in fact, full of teenage girls in swimsuits or hitched-up school uniforms. But at least one in 20 Tokyo high-school girls has been involved in prostitution: if they choose to earn money that way, can we call it exploitation? Papers advertising prostitutes are read unabashedly on the subway. And yet there are other forms of regimentation: within minutes, a visitor to the city will notice that no one crosses the street at a red light, even if the street is clear, and also that if one person does jaywalk, a huge crowd will follow blindly behind. Angela Carter, who lived in Japan for some years, once wrote that 'Few societies lay such stress on public decency and private decorum. Few offer such structured escape valves.' </p> <p>And here, next door to the seamy club where Lucie Blackman worked, is this high-class joint, the David Lynch masterpiece, which must be about as structured as escape valves get. Glove is the largest hostess bar in the whole of the Tokyo region. It employs 100 hostesses every night, and, unlike many others in Roppongi, is frequented and run mostly by Japanese people. As far as I can tell, there is only one foreign hostess, an Eastern European, and I seem to be the only woman in the club who is not working. </p> <p>'I've learnt a lot about men since I've been working here,' says Mae, one of the hostesses sent to entertain us. </p> <p>'Like what?' </p> <p>'Well, before I came here I didn't think all men were stupid. But now I know they are.' </p> <p>All of the five hostesses I speak to have a similar attitude. They are sweet, polite, and yet wonderfully cynical. There is nothing, on the face of it, to leave you saddened, and on this evidence you would hardly include the practice of hostessing under the umbrella of the sex industry at all. </p> <p>In fact, Anne Allison, author of Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club, makes an important distinction between hostesses and other nightworkers. Other outfits may be staffed by no-pan (meaning 'no panties') singers and waitresses, or girls whose job is to cover men in suds at 'soaplands', or the performers of oral sex in 'pink cabarets'. But one of the universal rules of the hostess service, no matter how classy or sad the bar, is that 'while alluding to sex, [it] cannot proceed to genital penetration or oral sex; and the service is conducted primarily at the level of conversation'. </p> <p>The heartland of the sex industry is further north, in Kabukicho, an area named after a theatre that was planned here and never built. Near a warren of alleyways famous for its tiny bars, is an endless sprawl of modern streets. Towering, tacky neon announces the delights to be found behind drab curtains in small rooms. Much of the prostitute population is made up of Thai or Filipina women - and teenagers in school uniforms, girls dressed up like office workers or women posing as other people's wives are here for the taking. </p> <p>I have heard about a relatively new kind of sex club, which simulates the environment of a subway train - taped train noises are pumped into the room and girls hold on to handles hanging from the ceiling as the punters feel them up - so men who might otherwise molest women in real life can confine it to a fantasy. We embark on a search for one of these 'Image Clubs'. We have no address, only a name and a price list, which, in our quest for directions, we show to strangers in the street. 'Shinjuku Peachy Assed Girls' School,' it reads, 'entrance \u00a51,000 [\u00a310]. Choice of room \u00a52,000. Ripping pants off a school-girl \u00a52,000. Two Polaroids \u00a52,000. Taking the pants home \u00a52,000. Our speciality is the train room - it's so realistic!' Our impromptu guides barely bat an eyelid. </p> <p>The Image Club train feature is the underground reflection of an underground phenomenon: molesters on the subways, or chikan, are incredibly common in Tokyo - a survey conducted this year found that 72 per cent of teenage girls had been groped on their way to school - and only recently have the police started to take it seriously. Now women are encouraged to report incidents to station staff, while previously, as one former Tokyo resident tells me, they were too ashamed of being harassed to draw attention to it. On the internet, girls now post advice for each other: always have a safety pin to hand in case you need to defend yourself. In December last year, one subway line experimented with a single segregated car for women at night. Plain-clothes policewomen have been hired to patrol certain lines, and posters have been put up to remind people that 'molestation is a crime'. Last year, 1,854 men were arrested for molesting women on trains. </p> <p>Samu Yamamoto, an expert in these matters, thinks it's possible that the train rooms in sex clubs have arisen in response to the crackdown on the real trains. 'The customers at Image Clubs are mainly doctors or lawyers or teachers,' he tells me, 'professionals who can't do that kind of thing on the train, so they do it where they legally can.' </p> <p>Yamamoto, now a middle-aged man, has been groping women on trains since he was 17. At the peak of his activity, he would ride around Tokyo from morning until night, and molest about 10 women a day. He is famous in Japan because he wrote a memoir about his experiences, Diary of a Chikan, in 1996. The book received so much attention that he wrote another, Peeper, the same year, and in 1998 he came up with Confessions of a Chikan. When his books were published, he became a kind of cult hero, and he now writes about the sex industry for various magazines. Even his wife, whom he claims he met by molesting her on the subway, thinks he is just a journalist. </p> <p>Yamamoto has become a kind of sexual philosopher - he has strong views about male and female sexuality, he knows about the sex industry, he is interested in the 'addiction' that made him a chikan, what makes, as he puts it, 'desire overcome reason'. But he is also an emblem of a certain contemporary situation. He became a pop cultural figure at a time when women's rights were still something of a joke and now he laments the fact that young women have become more independent, or - as he prefers to say - more selfish. Yamamoto embodies the transition, or two-way traffic, between sexual fantasy and sexist reality. For instance, he is now a director of porn videos: he films people being molested on trains. He also contributes illustrations to adult comics. His family still believes that his memoirs are a fiction. In Yamamoto's career, as in Tokyo itself, fantasy is not hidden underneath reality - the two coexist side by side. </p> <p>My attempt to get into an Image Club was doomed to failure, since they only admit Japanese men. So I ask Yamamoto if he's been to the train rooms, and what he makes of this curious parallel reality. He tells me he went to one for 'research'. 'I found it boring,' he says. 'It's different from reality, because the girls are standing in front of you, prepared to be felt up - it's their job. Whereas as a professional, I was prepared to be caught. The environment is like a stage set. I found it totally unexciting; there was no thrill.' </p> <p>If, in the sex industry, little has altered, then the speed with which changes are being made for women on other echelons is surprisingly fast. 1999 saw the passage of a Basic Law for Gender Equality, and an Equal Employment Opportunity Law. An anti-stalking law was passed last year, and this month, Japan's first law on domestic violence will be submitted. Some months ago, there was a dramatic victory for equal rights when, in the most high-profile sexual harassment, or seku-hara , case Japan has ever seen, the once- popular governor of Osaka pleaded guilty to the indecent assault of a 21-year-old member of his campaign staff. 'I did not sense the woman was annoyed,' he said in his defence, 'because she did not resist much when I slipped my hand inside her pants.' He was forced to resign and was replaced, symbolically, by a woman. </p> <p>And yet Professor Sumiko Iwao, a member of Japan's Office for Gender Equality, said recently that 'Japanese women are still not sure what feminism is'. Even the word seku-hara is an import from the West, an abbreviation of the term 'sexual harassment'. I ask Dr Dolores Martinez, who teaches anthropology at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, if she thinks feminism has reached Japan. 'Japanese feminists would say it has,' she replies. Martinez says that many of them believe too much of imported feminism is based on Western agendas, and that Japan must set its own. 'For example, the fact that menstrual leave was introduced - that women are entitled to take two days off work a month - was seen as a great victory, whereas in the West, women are unlikely to draw attention to the fact that they menstruate.' Fewer women are concerned about the sex industry than they might be in the West, Martinez explains, partly because a large percentage of those workers are not Japanese, and partly because Japanese feminists have other axes to grind. 'Their political activism is related to the protection of the environment, or improving conditions within the family home - issues that we might not necessarily call feminist.' </p> <p>There is a reason for this internal logic. Mika, a 38-year-old Japanese woman, worked as a designer in an architects' firm in Tokyo, then married a South African; they have a young child and live in London. 'Life for women in Japan is not just a question of women's rights,' she says, 'the whole culture is involved. It might look unequal to an outsider, but women have power in the home, including financial power. The woman has total power over how the money is spent, and over the children's education, for example. </p> <p>'I see old friends in Japan and they have absolute security, whereas here women are expected to be breadwinners as well. In Japan the man is the breadwinner, and women can concentrate on everything inside the home and the family. Japanese women have such a comfortable lifestyle. Japanese women live much longer than men. Actually, more pressure is on the man, that's why there is so much suicide, and so many disappearances. In society we don't have many rights, but in the family we do.' </p> <p>I ask if she thinks it matters, then, that the career situation is not equal. </p> <p>'I don't know,' Mika replies. 'What is a woman's happiness? If you have a dream to be a doctor or a lawyer, maybe Japan is not a good place, but that's changing. In my case, I am happy to be with my child.' </p> <p>As ever, the myths and superficial facts of sexism, and sex, are nowhere near the complicated truth. Though Mika is a long way from Tokyo's nightlife, her words of confidence might just as easily have been expressed by the hostesses at Glove - by Anna, for example, who told me that she feels she works too hard, but doesn't mind because she earns good money; or by Mariko, who teaches in a primary school by day and works as a hostess to make up her salary. All of these women have chosen how to live their lives. 'In some ways,' Mika says of Japanese women, 'if you see deep inside, we have freedom.'</p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Jonathan Watts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The scene is one David Lynch would have envied: curvy red velvet seats swoosh around walls beneath curtains of cut-glass beads; the lighting is a dim, dark pink. Every outfit is culled, in a postmodern sort of way, from some stock American look: the women at the door are dressed the way air stewardesses were in the 60s; the men standing guard are like elegant bellboys; the hostesses are required to wear short skirts, and one of them is a perfect imitation of Audrey Hepburn; the girls who clear the tables are darting about, their long, fishnet legs topped by bunny outfits in baby-pink satin. Until last year, Tokyo's nightlife or sex life barely made a mark on the average Briton's brain - a geisha might have been imagined, or someone might have repeated the well-worn myth that schoolgirls sell their knickers on the street. But now it conjures up, first and unforgettably, the name of a dead girl. In the long months when Lucie Blackman was missing, attention was focused not just on her disappearance, but also on her circumstances - on the mysteries, to British minds, of the place that she had gone from. Where was the Roppongi district and what was it like? What was a bar hostess expected to do? Was she part of the Tokyo sex industry, and what, if she was, would that mean? I have come to try and separate the myths of sex - and sexism - in Tokyo from the facts, but the territory turns out to be hard to navigate. Every corner seems to throw up some new paradox that makes it impossible to import and impose Western views. Convenience stores sell glossy magazines that look at first glance as though they could be some version of Smash Hits. They are, in fact, full of teenage girls in swimsuits or hitched-up school uniforms. But at least one in 20 Tokyo high-school girls has been involved in prostitution: if they choose to earn money that way, can we call it exploitation? Papers advertising prostitutes are read unabashedly on the subway. And yet there are other forms of regimentation: within minutes, a visitor to the city will notice that no one crosses the street at a red light, even if the street is clear, and also that if one person does jaywalk, a huge crowd will follow blindly behind. Angela Carter, who lived in Japan for some years, once wrote that 'Few societies lay such stress on public decency and private decorum. Few offer such structured escape valves.' And here, next door to the seamy club where Lucie Blackman worked, is this high-class joint, the David Lynch masterpiece, which must be about as structured as escape valves get. Glove is the largest hostess bar in the whole of the Tokyo region. It employs 100 hostesses every night, and, unlike many others in Roppongi, is frequented and run mostly by Japanese people. As far as I can tell, there is only one foreign hostess, an Eastern European, and I seem to be the only woman in the club who is not working. 'I've learnt a lot about men since I've been working here,' says Mae, one of the hostesses sent to entertain us. 'Like what?' 'Well, before I came here I didn't think all men were stupid. But now I know they are.' All of the five hostesses I speak to have a similar attitude. They are sweet, polite, and yet wonderfully cynical. There is nothing, on the face of it, to leave you saddened, and on this evidence you would hardly include the practice of hostessing under the umbrella of the sex industry at all. In fact, Anne Allison, author of Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club, makes an important distinction between hostesses and other nightworkers. Other outfits may be staffed by no-pan (meaning 'no panties') singers and waitresses, or girls whose job is to cover men in suds at 'soaplands', or the performers of oral sex in 'pink cabarets'. But one of the universal rules of the hostess service, no matter how classy or sad the bar, is that 'while alluding to sex, [it] cannot proceed to genital penetration or oral sex; and the service is conducted primarily at the level of conversation'. The heartland of the sex industry is further north, in Kabukicho, an area named after a theatre that was planned here and never built. Near a warren of alleyways famous for its tiny bars, is an endless sprawl of modern streets. Towering, tacky neon announces the delights to be found behind drab curtains in small rooms. Much of the prostitute population is made up of Thai or Filipina women - and teenagers in school uniforms, girls dressed up like office workers or women posing as other people's wives are here for the taking. I have heard about a relatively new kind of sex club, which simulates the environment of a subway train - taped train noises are pumped into the room and girls hold on to handles hanging from the ceiling as the punters feel them up - so men who might otherwise molest women in real life can confine it to a fantasy. We embark on a search for one of these 'Image Clubs'. We have no address, only a name and a price list, which, in our quest for directions, we show to strangers in the street. 'Shinjuku Peachy Assed Girls' School,' it reads, 'entrance \u00a51,000 [\u00a310]. Choice of room \u00a52,000. Ripping pants off a school-girl \u00a52,000. Two Polaroids \u00a52,000. Taking the pants home \u00a52,000. Our speciality is the train room - it's so realistic!' Our impromptu guides barely bat an eyelid. The Image Club train feature is the underground reflection of an underground phenomenon: molesters on the subways, or chikan, are incredibly common in Tokyo - a survey conducted this year found that 72 per cent of teenage girls had been groped on their way to school - and only recently have the police started to take it seriously. Now women are encouraged to report incidents to station staff, while previously, as one former Tokyo resident tells me, they were too ashamed of being harassed to draw attention to it. On the internet, girls now post advice for each other: always have a safety pin to hand in case you need to defend yourself. In December last year, one subway line experimented with a single segregated car for women at night. Plain-clothes policewomen have been hired to patrol certain lines, and posters have been put up to remind people that 'molestation is a crime'. Last year, 1,854 men were arrested for molesting women on trains. Samu Yamamoto, an expert in these matters, thinks it's possible that the train rooms in sex clubs have arisen in response to the crackdown on the real trains. 'The customers at Image Clubs are mainly doctors or lawyers or teachers,' he tells me, 'professionals who can't do that kind of thing on the train, so they do it where they legally can.' Yamamoto, now a middle-aged man, has been groping women on trains since he was 17. At the peak of his activity, he would ride around Tokyo from morning until night, and molest about 10 women a day. He is famous in Japan because he wrote a memoir about his experiences, Diary of a Chikan, in 1996. The book received so much attention that he wrote another, Peeper, the same year, and in 1998 he came up with Confessions of a Chikan. When his books were published, he became a kind of cult hero, and he now writes about the sex industry for various magazines. Even his wife, whom he claims he met by molesting her on the subway, thinks he is just a journalist. Yamamoto has become a kind of sexual philosopher - he has strong views about male and female sexuality, he knows about the sex industry, he is interested in the 'addiction' that made him a chikan, what makes, as he puts it, 'desire overcome reason'. But he is also an emblem of a certain contemporary situation. He became a pop cultural figure at a time when women's rights were still something of a joke and now he laments the fact that young women have become more independent, or - as he prefers to say - more selfish. Yamamoto embodies the transition, or two-way traffic, between sexual fantasy and sexist reality. For instance, he is now a director of porn videos: he films people being molested on trains. He also contributes illustrations to adult comics. His family still believes that his memoirs are a fiction. In Yamamoto's career, as in Tokyo itself, fantasy is not hidden underneath reality - the two coexist side by side. My attempt to get into an Image Club was doomed to failure, since they only admit Japanese men. So I ask Yamamoto if he's been to the train rooms, and what he makes of this curious parallel reality. He tells me he went to one for 'research'. 'I found it boring,' he says. 'It's different from reality, because the girls are standing in front of you, prepared to be felt up - it's their job.

      "body": "<p>The tall, round tower of the 109 store in the Shibuya area of Tokyo has long been a local landmark, a popular meeting place close to the vast transport hub of Shibuya station. But the crowd milling around it has changed radically in recent years. Now 109 Shibuya is the domain of teenage girls, who roam in packs around its floors of tightly packed concept boutiques, each with its own themed decor and loud, matching soundtrack. There is a bewildering choice of styles on offer: hippy chic at the Love Boat Drug Store, 'I love New York' jumpers and preppy college jackets at the Rocky American Market, and other shops selling everything from pseudo punk to 50s bubblegum, classy pastel coats and Rolex watches to turquoise fishnets and cheap pink wigs. As well as row after row of the impossibly high 12in platform boots every other customer seems to be wearing. To get a picture of the atmosphere, imagine a big, busy branch of Top Shop on a Saturday afternoon. Triple the crowds, the noise, the chaos, top it with a floor of themed caf\u00e9s so that shoppers can chill and check out each other's outfits, and you're somewhere close. </p> <p>But then add in the celebrity shop assistants. Known as 'charisma girls', these slim young women were originally intended to model the style of the boutique they worked in, to show shoppers how to put the look together. Then teen magazines began to publish their style tips and run interviews, and suddenly they were stars in their own right: some now even have fan clubs. </p> <p>When it comes to fashion, the colour and energy in Tokyo right now is extraordinary, especially after the tasteful but dull uniformity we've come to accept in our own street style. Western styles from every era are sampled and remixed with local trends to emerge as something new. The old variations on black, white and beige have given way to a riot of vivid colour: clashing patterns, Day-Glo accessories, bright combinations that shouldn't work but somehow do. There has been a boom in custom-tailoring and personalised accessories, and people no longer look solely to big-name designers for their inspiration. 'Ten years ago, people wore labels,' explains trend-spotter Yuko Suzuki, who compiles fashion reports for the Sensu agency. 'Now they are more interested in putting designer gear together with cheaper things to co-ordinate a whole look.' </p> <p>It's a boom time for hairdressers, too. Hair colour was once only for the very adventurous or for kids enjoying a year of nonconformity in Europe before settling down back home. But now hair comes with extensions (dreadlocks or natural-looking), permed into Afros, spiked, curled, braided, as well as coloured in every possible way - for men as well as women. </p> <p>As for style tribes, Tokyo's young seem to be creating and discarding them faster than we Brits can manufacture boy bands. The cute kogaru fashion themselves after a cartoon character called Sailor Girl, with ultra-short skirts and rusu-sokusu ('loose socks') drooping over clumpy shoes and clinging, as if by magic (but actually by glue) halfway between knee and ankle. The tandoori-tanned, pink-lipped, blonde-tipped Hawaiian Tropics ganguro ('dark face') look that caused such a sensation a year or so ago is pretty much over now, as is the more outrageous yamanba look named after a ghostly mountain witch and created by adding white lipstick, eye shadow and hair to a tanned face. The latest look now is one-kei ('big sisters'), girls wearing a slightly tongue-in-chic ladylike style known as new-tra ('new traditional'). </p> <p>But there are new ones all the time. In a society where conforming, being part of a group is so important, such shows of individuality have caused concern. Last year, when the novelist Hamki Murakami wrote about the 'sadness and disgust' he felt about the kind of girls who shop in 109 Shibuya, he was echoing the feelings of many older people. And in a way, they are right to be nervous. They are looking at the new Japan. </p> <p> For the old Japan, the recession seems never-ending. For a while it looked as if the economy might finally be emerging from its 10-year slump, but then in March the Nikkei stockmarket index fell to its lowest point for 15 years, and few pundits are predicting a fast recovery. This year saw yet more politicians resign after being caught with their hands in the till, and Prime Minister Mori looks set to stand down - with his job simply going to the next grey man in line. Experts seem to agree that Japan is stagnating, and big changes will be needed before its economy moves again. </p> <p>But if the country is in recession, someone seems to have forgotten to tell the shoppers in Harajuku. On the main artery, Meiji-dori, home to some of Tokyo's most expensive retail space, the young, hip department store Laforet is undergoing an expensive new refit. Now that regulations restricting the size of all outlets but the vast department stores have been relaxed, crowds flock into the big new flagship stores opened by Gap and its cheaper, more colourful Japanese counterpart Uni-qlo, while nearby, the vast new Sephora store is like a glossy three-floor shrine to expensive cosmetics. Queues form outside the Prada and Gucci stores at weekends, and the number of Louis Vuitton bags being carried by ordinary-looking office ladies is quite extraordinary. </p> <p>Mark Dytham, the Tokyo-based British architect whose company Klein-Dytham Associates is overseeing the Laforet makeover, says that life after the bubble burst hasn't all been bleak. 'The worst years were from 1992 to '94, but everyone still seemed to have a fair amount of money. All the ridiculous things stopped, like guys taking \u00a3600 taxi rides home. But there were still a lot of new cars, and everybody had full bags of shopping. I don't think they've ever had negative growth here, ever.' </p> <p>Indeed, while the economy has stagnated, individual savings have increased - by 2 per cent last year alone. With the old certainties of full employment and a job for life crumbling away, the problem isn't a shortage of cash: it's persuading people to spend it. Bargain-hunting has become fashionable after the downturn. Cheap noodle bars and \u00a5100 shops have proliferated, the discount supermarket chain Carrefour has moved successfully into Japan, and designer discount outlets are proving popular. </p> <p>But it's about quality as well as price. Vuitton bags are still popular because they are perceived as the best, the craftsmanship that goes into them making them good value. Meanwhile, the Uni-qlo chain has expanded rapidly over the past two years by selling cheap clothes which are also well designed. </p> <p>For many young Japanese, the uncertainty of the past few years has offered new freedoms. With rents for tiny urban apartments soaring to new heights, many have chosen to remain in the family home. The high disposable income they often enjoy as a result has turned them into a powerful force. </p> <p>There are other effects, too. 'As they're not necessarily going to get a job straightaway when they leave university, it's OK for the young to lounge around for a bit before they start work,' says Dytham. 'They are travelling more, they're setting up their own caf\u00e9s and shops. Even in business circles, there's a big push of independent young people doing their own thing. </p> <p>'It's a great time to be here - people are open to all sorts of things. All that old side of Japan is disappearing, except in politics, where it's still 80-year-old guys. But even there, we know a lot of younger guys in the government who are bilingual, trilingual, ready to jump in when the opportunity arises.' </p> <p> It's in the narrower streets of Harajuku behind Meiji-dori that this new Japan is most visible. This is where Tokyo's young and hip go to shop, and shops, hairdressers, caf\u00e9s, bars and new businesses have taken over not only the premises at street level but also many of the apartments above and basements below. With space at a premium, the design of these shops has to be inventive. In the tiny, narrow four-floor showcase for the thriving 20471120 label, goods are imaginatively crammed into every inch of space available. To show as much as possible in the limited window space, they have dresses gracefully rotating on an automated rail. A metal fairground-style wheel turns slowly through the ground and first floors, displaying shoes, bags and accessories. 'I want to communicate with the customers,' laughs Masahiro Nakagawa, 20471120's designer and the older of the two brothers behind the enterprise. 'I like entertainment.' </p> <p>In Harajuku, the arrival of a new type of trainer or hard-to-get item will cause queues down the street, and most of the shops are so small that shoppers are willing to wait in line for 30 minutes or more at weekends just to get in and look around. The ultra-cool A Bathing Ape store in Harajuku has a dividing rail down its narrow entrance corridor like the start of a theme park ride, allowing those leaving to get out past the queue. </p> <p>Set up in 1993 by Nigo, a former fashion stylist and drummer in the Tokyo Sex Pistols, Ape is a line of streetwear which pays homage to Nigo's favourite film, Planet of the Apes . The clothes are well designed, with lots of little details such as the 'Ape shall not kill ape' labels inside every garment, and the shops now sell other items such as camouflage tape, cushions - even dog baskets. </p> <p>But in the end, casualwear is pretty much the same everywhere: variations on a theme of T-shirts, sweatshirts, trousers and trainers. The main thing being sold here is the concept, the attitude behind it, and with this Nigo has built his brand into a big business without any help from the big traditional clothing companies. Instead, he has the Nowhere Corporation, a loose alliance of friends who started their casualwear shops at roughly the same time, each with a different concept. A Bathing Ape has its simian SF theme; Neighbourhood goes for military chic, Bounty Hunter's angle is punky anarchy, Real Mad Hectic has a New York graffiti feel, Undercover goes for revolutionary graphics and glories under the motto 'Fuck You Generation'. The labels collaborate on one-off projects, put references to each other in their window displays, have shops in the same buildings and attend each other's parties. But most importantly, they all exude a seemingly effortless cool that they somehow have managed to retain as their ranges have expanded to include homewear and children's clothing and their shops have spread across Japan. </p> <p>'They have an amazing understanding and approach to the whole supply-and-demand equation,' says Sudeep Gohil, who works for the British advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty in Japan. 'They know that kids want to buy their shirts, so they won't sell them, on purpose. If they decide for some reason that they're not going to sell shirts one week, they cover them up and won't sell them to you.' </p> <p>Which, of course, makes them all the more desirable. Both Ape and Undercover now share a flagship store near Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Issey Miyake and Yohji Yamoto's stores in the upmarket area of Aoyama, where T-shirts are displayed in clear plastic racks like artworks and Nigo's signature ape-head logo is picked out in mosaic on the floor. </p> <p>But the Nowhere shops in Harajuku are determinedly underground - literally, in some cases, as they are hidden in basements with no signs on the street to show where they are, with forbidding-looking unmarked metal doors often serving as another barrier to those not in the know. These stores are about more than buying a T-shirt: shopping in them is an experience, and customers feel part of an elite. When A Bathing Ape recently opened its first shop outside Japan, in a defiantly unfashionable part of Hong Kong, it only served to enhance the brand's mystique: apparently, the shop will only sell to customers with a Hong Kong passport. </p> <p>Revolver is the latest new label to emerge, showing similar skill in selling to a generation supposedly more immune to marketing. Taste-makers began to notice them when the hip band YKZ (Yakuza Kickz) began wearing their clothes. There were no press releases, no magazine spreads, but slowly word got around that Revolver had a shop. Not that you'd recognise it as a shop, even if you happened to walk past it. Situated in an apartment on a narrow Harajuku back alley, Revolver has no sign on its blank white door. But if you ring the bell - and they're in the mood to let you in - the door slides open and you step into a dark, enclosed lobby. When the door slides shut behind you, you may feel a moment of panic as you realise that you're completely closed in, but then a side door swishes open like an air lock and the shop is finally revealed. If you're really lucky, they may even condescend to sell you something. </p> <p>Some cool shops seem to have worked so hard on their concept, on creating gorgeous, innovative interiors, that the stock seems almost secondary. Only a few carefully chosen items are displayed: 12 trainers on a pristine wall. Astonishingly, these are the places with the biggest weekend queues of all. </p> <p> The big corporations are now starting to acknowledge that consumers born in the 60s and 70s are behaving differently. So in August 1999, a group of companies including Toyota, National Panasonic and the brewers Asahi banded together to launch a new brand, WiLL, aimed specifically at these stubbornly individualistic sons and daughters of the baby boomers. Sold under the orange WiLL logo and all advertised by the same agency, the products have little in common except that they attempt to embody a 'spirit of fun' and show 'true quality' in an effort to appeal to younger consumers. There's Toyota's compact Vi town car, a new sweet beer from Asahi, a 'Relax' range of ice cream and sweets, a funky folding bike, room deodorisers, Panasonic mini-disc players with transparent covers to allow the owner to personalise it with their own pictures and designs. </p> <p>The cute curves and pastel colours of many of the products were designed specifically with young women in mind, but the team behind the WiLL project admits it has a long way to go before they capture these elusive new markets. WiLL is failing to give consumers strong enough reasons to buy in, the big idea that will make them stand out from the rest. </p> <p>Meanwhile, shopping centres are attempting to draw in custom with a few big ideas of their own, designed to appeal to ever-narrower niche markets. After the success of teen emporiums such as 109 Shibuya and Laforet, Ikspiari - the Disney Mall next to Tokyo Disneyland - has a 'parents' alley' with adult stores, but is mainly designed with children in mind. Tonde Mun Sijan is a Korean-style mall on the third and fourth floors of Shibuya's Parco department store, where the normally reticent Japanese - who rarely return even defective goods to a shop for fear of seeming impolite - are encouraged to haggle over prices as if they were in a Korean market. Whether the goods actually work out any cheaper is, in a way, beside the point: it's a game, a fun experience, a reason to go to this particular mall rather than any other. </p> <p>Most extraordinary of all is the Venus Fort out on Tokyo Bay, a shopping mall - or rather, 'entertainment complex' - apparently designed specifically for women. The temperature is kept a little warmer than most malls and the air is gently perfumed, but it's the kitsch decor that really astonishes. We girls apparently like to shop in something resembling an Italian renaissance town, with stone porticos, cobbled streets, classical statuary and fountains, plastic plant life and staff dressed in strange knickerbockers and feathered caps. In the central 'skywalk', a realistic-looking sky gradually changes over the period of an hour from cloud-dappled blue to a glorious sunset, then after a brief period of darkness you can enjoy a glorious new dawn. </p> <p>It's 9.30am inside the vast Ginza branch of the Takashimaya department store. The elevator girls in their bright-blue uniforms are putting on their matching berets and gloves, checking their reflections and doing some last-minute cleaning and polishing in the already spotless, shiny lifts. By 9.50am, they are standing in two long, straight lines outside the elevators. They bow deeply to each other, then do a series of choreographed eye exercises before practising some of the poses and announcements they use when operating the lifts. Finally, the music for the opening ceremony strikes up. Just before 10am, two of the uniformed girls open the doors and a third one strides out to greet the assembled shoppers. Talking into a microphone, she thanks them for coming so early, announces any special events planned for the day, and tells them what type of rose - the symbol of the store - is displayed on the counter by the entrance today. Then she returns inside and, a minute later, the store doors are finally opened with a flourish. As the customers trickle in, the elevator girls and senior store staff stay by the door for a few minutes, bowing to each person walking past. </p> <p>This elaborate opening ceremony takes place every day at Takashimaya, a chain with 19 branches across Japan and a history that goes back 120 years. On the day I witnessed it - a bitterly cold morning at the end of January- the whole thing was performed for the benefit of just five customers. </p> <p>In the Japanese department store, service means everything. As the old lifts have been replaced with new, automatic ones, deputy manager Tetsuo Yamaguchi says it would have been easy to phase out the elevator girls. 'But the customers want us to retain the old-fashioned system. It helps older people feel more comfortable.' </p> <p>But despite the old-fashioned service, Tokyo's department stores are far from archaic. The Times Square branch of Takashimaya boasts an IMAX cinema, and until Sega's recent restructuring, it had a Segaworld computer-games arcade. Most big department stores have art galleries on their upper floors, with changing, museum- quality shows, and they also have craft clubs, demonstrations, and endless ingenious ways of tying visitors closer to their store. </p> <p>In November last year, Takashimaya began selling the second-generation Aibo, the first product from Sony's new entertainment robot division. A sophisticated machine that sells for \u00a31,500, it recognises 50 different voice commands, answers to the name you select for it, plays with its ball and 'learns' behaviour depending on how it is treated. The first generation was sold through the internet only, mainly to computer geeks. But Takashimaya found a surprise new audience: in a city where few apartments are big enough for a real pet, affluent older ladies found the robot a clean, trouble-free companion. The store has sold nearly 7,500 of them. </p> <p> Vittorio Radice, the energetic Italian now in charge of reinventing Selfridges, likes to travel. 'You have to see what's available, and learn,' he says. 'See if there's something out there you can use.' Last October, he went to Tokyo for the first time in four years, and was bowled over by the changes he saw. 'Somehow, recessions bring creativity, and at the moment there's creativity in everything they do in Japan. Everything is new and fresh. Artists, product designers, concept stores, books, music - it's all so much more free and less controlled than it is here. So I said, \"Why don't we bring some of this energy to London?\"' </p> <p>The result is Tokyo Life, a month-long production starting on 1 May in which Selfridges is turning Japanese. The conveyor-belt sushi chain Yo! Sushi has already opened up in the food hall, and a 24-hour Japanese-style convenience store will be built in one of the windows. There will be art installations, live webcam links with Tokyo streets, and Japanese fashion, food and gadgets. </p> <p>But for Radice, this is more than a one-off promotion. In the 90s, New York department stores such as Barney's had a big influence on British retailers. Now, he feels Tokyo is showing the way ahead. 'The Japanese are concentrating more on the concept, the environment, the message. They are far more advanced. You have to capture the imagination of the customer if you want them to consume with your brand, in your environment.' </p> <p>Instead of offering goods, he says, shops will have to offer experiences. 'These could be in the shape of a spa or a shoe shine, a travel agent or a dentist. You could have 20 hairdressers all lined up, all providing a different style. You could put 300 PlayStations out there and charge \u00a31 an hour to play them instead of selling games.' </p> <p>This, he feels, will be the future for the fusty old department store, a prime chunk of city space that now needs to be filled with interesting things to do as well as goods to buy. Shops no longer just want to sell us stuff. They want to be theme parks, leisure centres, showcases for new ideas. Will consumers buy it? In Japan, it seems they already have.</p>",

When A Bathing Ape recently opened its first shop outside Japan, in a defiantly unfashionable part of Hong Kong, it only served to enhance the brand's mystique: apparently, the shop will only sell to customers with a Hong Kong passport. Revolver is the latest new label to emerge, showing similar skill in selling to a generation supposedly more immune to marketing. Taste-makers began to notice them when the hip band YKZ (Yakuza Kickz) began wearing their clothes. There were no press releases, no magazine spreads, but slowly word got around that Revolver had a shop. Not that you'd recognise it as a shop, even if you happened to walk past it. Situated in an apartment on a narrow Harajuku back alley, Revolver has no sign on its blank white door. But if you ring the bell - and they're in the mood to let you in - the door slides open and you step into a dark, enclosed lobby. When the door slides shut behind you, you may feel a moment of panic as you realise that you're completely closed in, but then a side door swishes open like an air lock and the shop is finally revealed. If you're really lucky, they may even condescend to sell you something. Some cool shops seem to have worked so hard on their concept, on creating gorgeous, innovative interiors, that the stock seems almost secondary. Only a few carefully chosen items are displayed: 12 trainers on a pristine wall. Astonishingly, these are the places with the biggest weekend queues of all. The big corporations are now starting to acknowledge that consumers born in the 60s and 70s are behaving differently. So in August 1999, a group of companies including Toyota, National Panasonic and the brewers Asahi banded together to launch a new brand, WiLL, aimed specifically at these stubbornly individualistic sons and daughters of the baby boomers. Sold under the orange WiLL logo and all advertised by the same agency, the products have little in common except that they attempt to embody a 'spirit of fun' and show 'true quality' in an effort to appeal to younger consumers. There's Toyota's compact Vi town car, a new sweet beer from Asahi, a 'Relax' range of ice cream and sweets, a funky folding bike, room deodorisers, Panasonic mini-disc players with transparent covers to allow the owner to personalise it with their own pictures and designs. The cute curves and pastel colours of many of the products were designed specifically with young women in mind, but the team behind the WiLL project admits it has a long way to go before they capture these elusive new markets. WiLL is failing to give consumers strong enough reasons to buy in, the big idea that will make them stand out from the rest. Meanwhile, shopping centres are attempting to draw in custom with a few big ideas of their own, designed to appeal to ever-narrower niche markets. After the success of teen emporiums such as 109 Shibuya and Laforet, Ikspiari - the Disney Mall next to Tokyo Disneyland - has a 'parents' alley' with adult stores, but is mainly designed with children in mind. Tonde Mun Sijan is a Korean-style mall on the third and fourth floors of Shibuya's Parco department store, where the normally reticent Japanese - who rarely return even defective goods to a shop for fear of seeming impolite - are encouraged to haggle over prices as if they were in a Korean market. Whether the goods actually work out any cheaper is, in a way, beside the point: it's a game, a fun experience, a reason to go to this particular mall rather than any other. Most extraordinary of all is the Venus Fort out on Tokyo Bay, a shopping mall - or rather, 'entertainment complex' - apparently designed specifically for women. The temperature is kept a little warmer than most malls and the air is gently perfumed, but it's the kitsch decor that really astonishes. We girls apparently like to shop in something resembling an Italian renaissance town, with stone porticos, cobbled streets, classical statuary and fountains, plastic plant life and staff dressed in strange knickerbockers and feathered caps. In the central 'skywalk', a realistic-looking sky gradually changes over the period of an hour from cloud-dappled blue to a glorious sunset, then after a brief period of darkness you can enjoy a glorious new dawn. It's 9.30am inside the vast Ginza branch of the Takashimaya department store. The elevator girls in their bright-blue uniforms are putting on their matching berets and gloves, checking their reflections and doing some last-minute cleaning and polishing in the already spotless, shiny lifts. By 9.50am, they are standing in two long, straight lines outside the elevators. They bow deeply to each other, then do a series of choreographed eye exercises before practising some of the poses and announcements they use when operating the lifts. Finally, the music for the opening ceremony strikes up. Just before 10am, two of the uniformed girls open the doors and a third one strides out to greet the assembled shoppers. Talking into a microphone, she thanks them for coming so early, announces any special events planned for the day, and tells them what type of rose - the symbol of the store - is displayed on the counter by the entrance today. Then she returns inside and, a minute later, the store doors are finally opened with a flourish. As the customers trickle in, the elevator girls and senior store staff stay by the door for a few minutes, bowing to each person walking past. This elaborate opening ceremony takes place every day at Takashimaya, a chain with 19 branches across Japan and a history that goes back 120 years. On the day I witnessed it - a bitterly cold morning at the end of January- the whole thing was performed for the benefit of just five customers. In the Japanese department store, service means everything. As the old lifts have been replaced with new, automatic ones, deputy manager Tetsuo Yamaguchi says it would have been easy to phase out the elevator girls. 'But the customers want us to retain the old-fashioned system. It helps older people feel more comfortable.' But despite the old-fashioned service, Tokyo's department stores are far from archaic. The Times Square branch of Takashimaya boasts an IMAX cinema, and until Sega's recent restructuring, it had a Segaworld computer-games arcade. Most big department stores have art galleries on their upper floors, with changing, museum- quality shows, and they also have craft clubs, demonstrations, and endless ingenious ways of tying visitors closer to their store. In November last year, Takashimaya began selling the second-generation Aibo, the first product from Sony's new entertainment robot division. A sophisticated machine that sells for \u00a31,500, it recognises 50 different voice commands, answers to the name you select for it, plays with its ball and 'learns' behaviour depending on how it is treated. The first generation was sold through the internet only, mainly to computer geeks. But Takashimaya found a surprise new audience: in a city where few apartments are big enough for a real pet, affluent older ladies found the robot a clean, trouble-free companion. The store has sold nearly 7,500 of them. Vittorio Radice, the energetic Italian now in charge of reinventing Selfridges, likes to travel. 'You have to see what's available, and learn,' he says. 'See if there's something out there you can use.' Last October, he went to Tokyo for the first time in four years, and was bowled over by the changes he saw. 'Somehow, recessions bring creativity, and at the moment there's creativity in everything they do in Japan. Everything is new and fresh. Artists, product designers, concept stores, books, music - it's all so much more free and less controlled than it is here. So I said, \"Why don't we bring some of this energy to London?\"' The result is Tokyo Life, a month-long production starting on 1 May in which Selfridges is turning Japanese. The conveyor-belt sushi chain Yo! Sushi has already opened up in the food hall, and a 24-hour Japanese-style convenience store will be built in one of the windows. There will be art installations, live webcam links with Tokyo streets, and Japanese fashion, food and gadgets. But for Radice, this is more than a one-off promotion. In the 90s, New York department stores such as Barney's had a big influence on British retailers. Now, he feels Tokyo is showing the way ahead. 'The Japanese are concentrating more on the concept, the environment, the message. They are far more advanced. You have to capture the imagination of the customer if you want them to consume with your brand, in your environment.' Instead of offering goods, he says, shops will have to offer experiences. 'These could be in the shape of a spa or a shoe shine, a travel agent or a dentist. You could have 20 hairdressers all lined up, all providing a different style. You could put 300 PlayStations out there and charge \u00a31 an hour to play them instead of selling games.' This, he feels, will be the future for the fusty old department store, a prime chunk of city space that now needs to be filled with interesting things to do as well as goods to buy. Shops no longer just want to sell us stuff. They want to be theme parks, leisure centres, showcases for new ideas. Will consumers buy it? In Japan, it seems they already have.",

      "body": "<p>It's 3am in Tokyo and Tsujiki market, the central clearing house for most of the food consumed in this great city, is starting its working day. To an outsider, it all looks vaguely menacing. A man, clearly drunk, is screaming at some police on the street. Past the squad car in a dark, shadowy space the size of several aircraft hangars, trucks are roaring in and out and crates of fruit, vegetables and fish are being loaded on to forklifts and wooden handcarts. Further in, the lights get brighter and the stalls begin - long, dense aisles of them going back as far as the eye can see, and all selling fish. </p> <p>Established as Tokyo's central wholesale market after the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 destroyed most of the city's private food markets, this is now the biggest fish market in the world, with a mind-boggling five million pounds of seafood (worth around \u00a319m) passing through every night of the week except Sunday. After the order that characterises even Tokyo's most crowded urban spaces by day, the anarchy of this night-time world comes as something of a shock. Fork-lifts shoot up and down the wider aisles, the drivers screaming warnings to men in their way, but rarely slowing down. Huge ice-making machines rattle noisily before suddenly gushing waterfalls of cold cubes into waiting crates. The colour, the chaos and the noise are a sensory overload, but I realise something is missing. I can smell cigarette smoke, coffee, green tea and a vague whiff of the nearby ocean. What I can't smell is fish. It's a sign of the freshness and cleanliness which the market, built beside the ocean on land reclaimed from Tokyo Bay 300 years ago, is famous for. </p> <p>By 4.30am, the canned coffee stall is doing a roaring trade and the middlemen are unpacking the night's new arrivals to display on their tightly packed stalls. Giant crabs, their massive claws restrained with elastic bands, lie stupefied on beds of ice. Scallops fidget in their shells. Live fish are kept in huge glass or metal tanks. Produce comes to Tsujiki from more than 60 different countries, and here you'll find every kind of seafood you could imagine - along with several you really couldn't. There are crates of writhing eels. Bright red squid. Metal counters piled high with colourful octopuses. Indonesian prawns, Chinese swimming crabs, Scottish salmon - and repulsive cream and black slug-like creatures protruding from shells in their watery tanks that had me so aghast that nearby workers hooted with laughter. But most of all, there's the tuna. Tsujiki's daily auction sets the price and standards for tuna worldwide, and is one of Japan's greatest spectacles. </p> <p>At the very back of the market the bodies are being arranged in neat rows on wooden pallets on the floor. The tail section of each is cut off and laid alongside, exposing some flesh for the buyers to examine. In the warehouse behind them, the cheaper, frozen tuna are treated less delicately. Kept at -60 C to stop the precious oils turning rancid, they are completely solid, their sparkling white carcasses bouncing as they hit the ground and a ghostly white mist of dry ice rising from them to settle across the floor. The empty wooden crates nearby tell how far they have travelled: 'Caught by MV Amoria, Cape Town South Africa'; 'Richardo Fuentes, La Palma, Spain'; 'Tuna of the Indian Ocean 'Sri Lanka'; 'Quantas Australia air express'. </p> <p>Getting them to market in the best condition has become a science in itself. On some boats, a steel rod is passed down the spine immediately after the fish is caught to flush out the enzymes which begin the process of decay; others are experimenting with acupuncturists who can relax the fish enough to keep it alive while they head for shore. Seven wholesale companies operate from the market, all of which lay out their goods near the wooden staging where the auctions are held, marking each fish with a red number. </p> <p>Tonight, there are just over 500 fresh tuna being sold, all laid out in order of importance. The prized bluefin come first, the source of the most expensive sushi cuts: the delicate toro taken from the fattiest areas around the belly, and the very finest, fattiest otoro - which only the very rich can afford to eat. Then come the bigeye tuna and finally the cheaper yellowfin. Sizes vary depending on age. Some are the size of cows, others the size of a large cat. A mature, five-year-old bluefin can weigh in at over 1,000lb, but since these cost so much that ad-hoc consortiums often have to be formed to buy them, the wholesalers prefer tuna weighing in at 280-380lb. These younger fish are also less likely to have suffered injuries that could reduce their value. </p> <p>The bidders walk through the rows, checking the date and place where each fish was caught, then crouching with their torches to examine the flesh more carefully. It should be firm, deep red and marbled with fat. They may also touch the cut tail section and put their hands into the belly slit to feel for fat content. At exactly 5.30am, the bells ring out and the auctions begin. The buyers don hats with yellow plastic tags attached displaying their licence numbers, and those bidding for the bluefin stand up on the wooden bleachers in front of the auctioneers' crude podiums. Prices are conveyed by a series of complex finger movements, and the auctioneers' frenzied screaming is almost impossible for outsiders to understand. </p> <p>Early in January, a new record was set at Tsujiki when a 444lb bluefin sold for \u00a3120,000. At that price, it would apparently have been impossible for any restaurant to sell it for a profit: the buyer was probably willing to pay a such a premium to boast that he'd bought the first catch of the year. After bluefin are sold, the auctioneer begins to walk through the rows of bigeye and yellowfin followed by the buyers, shouting out bids in a voice so rhythmic it threatens to turn into song. Assistants write out invoices on the spot, and the wooden pallets start to empty as the tuna are heaved on to handcarts and disappear. Some go to the nearby stalls where they're carved up into to smaller pieces, the precious belly cuts displayed in glass cases to entice the sushi restaurateurs who are already arriving to buy that day's produce; others travel back across Japan, and even back to Narita to put in a few thousand more airmiles before being consumed. (The string of Nobu restaurants in Europe and the USA, for instance, buys fish here three times a week.) </p> <p>Afterwards, I make my way to the market's oldest sushi restaurant. It's just 6.15 on a bitterly cold morning, but there's a queue of people outside, stamping their feet and peering impatiently through the steamed-up glass of the tiny restaurant's sliding door. There's a young couple in club clothes who've clearly been out all night; and family bringing their two-year-old to sample the freshest fish you can eat without catching it yourself. A Tokyo-based salaryman in a suit tells me he grew up in the Aomori area, by the coastal villages where some of the most prized tuna is landed. But the fish went straight from the boats to Tsujiki, so this will be the first time he's ever sampled tuna this fresh. This restaurant, he says, is reputed to have the best sushi in Japan.

      "bodyText": "It's 3am in Tokyo and Tsujiki market, the central clearing house for most of the food consumed in this great city, is starting its working day. To an outsider, it all looks vaguely menacing. A man, clearly drunk, is screaming at some police on the street. Past the squad car in a dark, shadowy space the size of several aircraft hangars, trucks are roaring in and out and crates of fruit, vegetables and fish are being loaded on to forklifts and wooden handcarts. Further in, the lights get brighter and the stalls begin - long, dense aisles of them going back as far as the eye can see, and all selling fish. Established as Tokyo's central wholesale market after the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 destroyed most of the city's private food markets, this is now the biggest fish market in the world, with a mind-boggling five million pounds of seafood (worth around \u00a319m) passing through every night of the week except Sunday. After the order that characterises even Tokyo's most crowded urban spaces by day, the anarchy of this night-time world comes as something of a shock. Fork-lifts shoot up and down the wider aisles, the drivers screaming warnings to men in their way, but rarely slowing down. Huge ice-making machines rattle noisily before suddenly gushing waterfalls of cold cubes into waiting crates. The colour, the chaos and the noise are a sensory overload, but I realise something is missing. I can smell cigarette smoke, coffee, green tea and a vague whiff of the nearby ocean. What I can't smell is fish. It's a sign of the freshness and cleanliness which the market, built beside the ocean on land reclaimed from Tokyo Bay 300 years ago, is famous for. By 4.30am, the canned coffee stall is doing a roaring trade and the middlemen are unpacking the night's new arrivals to display on their tightly packed stalls. Giant crabs, their massive claws restrained with elastic bands, lie stupefied on beds of ice. Scallops fidget in their shells. Live fish are kept in huge glass or metal tanks. Produce comes to Tsujiki from more than 60 different countries, and here you'll find every kind of seafood you could imagine - along with several you really couldn't. There are crates of writhing eels. Bright red squid. Metal counters piled high with colourful octopuses. Indonesian prawns, Chinese swimming crabs, Scottish salmon - and repulsive cream and black slug-like creatures protruding from shells in their watery tanks that had me so aghast that nearby workers hooted with laughter. But most of all, there's the tuna. Tsujiki's daily auction sets the price and standards for tuna worldwide, and is one of Japan's greatest spectacles. At the very back of the market the bodies are being arranged in neat rows on wooden pallets on the floor. The tail section of each is cut off and laid alongside, exposing some flesh for the buyers to examine. In the warehouse behind them, the cheaper, frozen tuna are treated less delicately. Kept at -60 C to stop the precious oils turning rancid, they are completely solid, their sparkling white carcasses bouncing as they hit the ground and a ghostly white mist of dry ice rising from them to settle across the floor. The empty wooden crates nearby tell how far they have travelled: 'Caught by MV Amoria, Cape Town South Africa'; 'Richardo Fuentes, La Palma, Spain'; 'Tuna of the Indian Ocean 'Sri Lanka'; 'Quantas Australia air express'. Getting them to market in the best condition has become a science in itself. On some boats, a steel rod is passed down the spine immediately after the fish is caught to flush out the enzymes which begin the process of decay; others are experimenting with acupuncturists who can relax the fish enough to keep it alive while they head for shore. Seven wholesale companies operate from the market, all of which lay out their goods near the wooden staging where the auctions are held, marking each fish with a red number. Tonight, there are just over 500 fresh tuna being sold, all laid out in order of importance. The prized bluefin come first, the source of the most expensive sushi cuts: the delicate toro taken from the fattiest areas around the belly, and the very finest, fattiest otoro - which only the very rich can afford to eat. Then come the bigeye tuna and finally the cheaper yellowfin. Sizes vary depending on age. Some are the size of cows, others the size of a large cat. A mature, five-year-old bluefin can weigh in at over 1,000lb, but since these cost so much that ad-hoc consortiums often have to be formed to buy them, the wholesalers prefer tuna weighing in at 280-380lb. These younger fish are also less likely to have suffered injuries that could reduce their value. The bidders walk through the rows, checking the date and place where each fish was caught, then crouching with their torches to examine the flesh more carefully. It should be firm, deep red and marbled with fat. They may also touch the cut tail section and put their hands into the belly slit to feel for fat content. At exactly 5.30am, the bells ring out and the auctions begin. The buyers don hats with yellow plastic tags attached displaying their licence numbers, and those bidding for the bluefin stand up on the wooden bleachers in front of the auctioneers' crude podiums. Prices are conveyed by a series of complex finger movements, and the auctioneers' frenzied screaming is almost impossible for outsiders to understand. Early in January, a new record was set at Tsujiki when a 444lb bluefin sold for \u00a3120,000. At that price, it would apparently have been impossible for any restaurant to sell it for a profit: the buyer was probably willing to pay a such a premium to boast that he'd bought the first catch of the year. After bluefin are sold, the auctioneer begins to walk through the rows of bigeye and yellowfin followed by the buyers, shouting out bids in a voice so rhythmic it threatens to turn into song. Assistants write out invoices on the spot, and the wooden pallets start to empty as the tuna are heaved on to handcarts and disappear. Some go to the nearby stalls where they're carved up into to smaller pieces, the precious belly cuts displayed in glass cases to entice the sushi restaurateurs who are already arriving to buy that day's produce; others travel back across Japan, and even back to Narita to put in a few thousand more airmiles before being consumed. (The string of Nobu restaurants in Europe and the USA, for instance, buys fish here three times a week.) Afterwards, I make my way to the market's oldest sushi restaurant. It's just 6.15 on a bitterly cold morning, but there's a queue of people outside, stamping their feet and peering impatiently through the steamed-up glass of the tiny restaurant's sliding door. There's a young couple in club clothes who've clearly been out all night; and family bringing their two-year-old to sample the freshest fish you can eat without catching it yourself. A Tokyo-based salaryman in a suit tells me he grew up in the Aomori area, by the coastal villages where some of the most prized tuna is landed. But the fish went straight from the boats to Tsujiki, so this will be the first time he's ever sampled tuna this fresh. This restaurant, he says, is reputed to have the best sushi in Japan. 'Best in world!' adds one of the clubbers with a grin. Finally, I get to squeeze past the seven other diners in the tiny, narrow hut and take my place at the sushi bar, facing some huge, live prawns which squirm accusingly against the glass. The chef keeps up a constant banter with the customers, and there is much laughter, debate and loud appreciation of the food.

Not only do prebiotic foods travel directly to the colon without being digested by the enzymes within the digestive system, but, once there, they act as growth-enhancers for good bacteria, which in turn secrete enzymes that break down the prebiotics into bad-bacteria-inhibiting acids like butyric acid, which can both slow down the development of abnormal cells and help to kill established cancers.</p> <p>I recommend you also include plenty of prebiotic foods in your diet.

      "body": "<p>Tatsumi Orimoto is, at 55, a grand old man of Japanese contemporary art. He has made his name with a performance piece, or live sculpture, which involves wrapping several loaves of bread around his head, tightly, with twine. The configurations are not accidental: there is a large oval bloomer at the front where his face should be, and at least six baguettes jutting out at various angles from the centre. Orimoto must scarcely be able to see behind this leaven elephantiasis, and yet he wanders about the world shaking hands, boarding trains, challenging people to accept him. You might call it street theatre of the absurd. He has been to Turkey, Nepal, Germany, and, with a photographer, documented each performative moment: the time he was chased by homeless people in New York, or thrown out of a restaurant in Moscow for wasting food; the occasions when he was laughed at by students or ignored by passing tourists as he posed at the foot of Big Ben. 'Bread Man', Orimoto says now, is a project that will continue until he dies. </p> <p>This May, as part of the Tokyo Life exhibition at Selfridges, Orimoto will exhibit some of his photographs, and walk along Oxford Street as Bread Man. But for now, he is back in Kawasaki, the city outside Tokyo where he grew up. He lives with his mother in a small, traditional Japanese house. His mother has Alzheimer's, and while looking after her, he has made her the subject of his work; she is now known as Art Mama. </p> <p>When I speak to Orimoto on the phone, he says he will meet me at Kawasaki station, since the directions to his house are rather complicated. 'Will you recognise me?' he asks. I pause, trying not to laugh, and wondering if I will recognise him without the bread. I am not sure how seriously Orimoto takes himself, but as soon as we meet, all concern is dispelled. 'I'm a very funny guy,' he tells me in passing. He has a round, smiling face and flowing grey hair. He has just bought us lunch and is riding a clapped-out old bicycle. As we enter his house, he indicates one of his early works on the doorstep: it's a leafless bonsai in a plant pot, with two old Converse sneakers hanging from its branches. 'Shoe-tree,' he says. </p> <p>Orimoto's mother has just woken up from her mid-morning nap, and, as we join her on the electrically heated carpet, Orimoto gets out piles of papers and seemingly endless albums of photographs. 'This is my bible,' he says, handing me two thick yellow plastic volumes. Inside are postcards he has produced, of each of his performances - a documentary of his life as Bread Man. </p> <p>When Orimoto finished school in Kawasaki, he tried to get into art college six years in a row and failed: 'My teacher said, Tatsumi, you are already an artist, not a student.' He emigrated to America, where he met Korean-born artist Nam June Paik, often dubbed the father of video art, and fell in with the Fluxus group in New York - Paik, John Cage, Yoko Ono. Orimoto, then a painter, had never heard of performance art, and though he has fond memories of meeting Joseph Beuys, he wasn't sure he understood it. 'They did very funny things,' he tells me. 'They would say, \"Come to a party\", and I'd bring beer, and there would be a barbecue - but they weren't cooking meat. They were cooking bricks, and serving them on plates!' </p> <p>'I was looking for my style,' Orimoto says, and about 10 years ago he found it. A Christian friend told him that in the Bible 'bread means body', and that gave Orimoto an idea. If Marcel Duchamp could call a toilet a fountain, he explains, then 'bread means not food: it is sculpture'. </p> <p>Seven years ago, Orimoto's father died. His mother's role, until then, had been to look after the patriarch, and at that point she found herself at a loss. Her body packed up, she developed Alzheimer's, and her son had to come back to look after her. He couldn't travel as much, and Bread Man's happenings dwindled. Then one day Orimoto realised: 'This, my daily life, is art.' He photographed his mother wearing enormous papier-mch\u00e9 shoes ( Small Mama + Big Shoes ), or out on her daily walks around the neighbourhood. As the tag line to one of his shows has it, 'the existence of my Mama is art'. </p> <p>One piece is a picture of his mother and two of her friends sitting on a sofa at home. They are all wearing huge rubber tyres round their necks. By way of explanation, Orimoto makes a link between the junk people leave in the streets, and his mother's generation, who have been ignored by their children. There is a well-documented problem in Japan: how to care for its legions of elderly people. 'After very hard work,' Orimoto says gnomically, 'very broken body.' His brother, who lives 10 minutes away, never looks after his mother. 'The younger generation, they throw away everything.' </p> <p>I ask how much his mother knows about what he is doing. 'My mother has no education - maybe she cannot understand contemporary art,' he says, 'but she believes in me, and I believe in her.' And sometimes, the drowsy person before us proves herself to be very sharp. 'When I'm preparing photographs for an exhibition,' Orimoto goes on, 'she says, \"If somebody buys a photograph, you have to give me half the money!\"' </p> <p>Orimoto says that 'sometimes, I'm very tired from holding my bread on my head', and that he doesn't like performing Bread Man in Japan because people see him as dirty, or dangerous. In fact, he is only just beginning to be recognised in his own country, and many younger artists are hardly aware of his work. </p> <p>But this is perhaps more to do with the culture of Tokyo than with Orimoto himself. All of the artists I interviewed pointed out that contemporary art is not recognised as a discipline by the average man or woman in the street, and that it's very hard to be an artist here for that reason. Even the word they use to describe themselves is not Japanese: they all call themselves 'artists', because the Japanese word seems dated. There may be a long aesthetic tradition, but it is not experimental. A generation younger than Orimoto's has found different ways of dealing with this problem: Maywa Denki is a pair of artists who masquerade as an electronics company, slipping art to the masses in the guise of something more familiar; Masato Nakamura, the most straightforwardly 'white cube' artist of them all, constantly probes and questions Japanese identity. He is the founder and key member of an artists' collective, Command N, which will also be exhibiting at Tokyo Life. They have an office in Akihabara, the electronics district of Tokyo, and aim to make art in the context of a new technological world. They have simultaneously 'hijacked' 32 TVs in electrical shops with video works, and at Selfridges they will present a spoof real-estate project, selling virtual views of Tokyo. Each of these artists has a way of looking at their culture and their capital city in a new, refracted light. </p> <p>Masato Nakamura's work is in fact made of light. Whether it's a glowing shape in a wall, a sculpted set of barber-shop lamps or an intervention on the roof of a Tokyo taxi, all of it draws on the brightness of this 24-hour city. </p> <p>As the daylight dims, the interpreter and I meet Nakamura in Command N's office in Akihabara. The streets are crowded with multicoloured, skyscraping neon lights. Below the signs, there are warrens of electronics shops, filled like sci-fi havens with minuscule surveillance cameras and bits of circuitry and chips for unimaginable machines. In the office, some members of Command N are setting up an exhibition in a space the size of a small stairwell. Nakamura, a tall, trendy man in his late thirties, takes us in his Volvo to his home, miles away in a suburb so quiet it feels like a movie set. As we arrive, his Korean wife Shin Myeong eun - also an artist and a member of Command N - comes round the corner with their two-year-old son. We go for dinner at a restaurant nearby, and Nakamura begins to speak about his work. </p> <p>The piece that he will exhibit at Tokyo Life, in a new gallery space specially designed by architect David Adjaye, is called Minimal Selves . It is a series of nine monumental light boxes - beautiful, colourful, rectangular abstractions. Though Nakamura says he doesn't care if people in London see them as purely abstract works, what they are is the logos of the various convenience stores to be found on every street corner in Tokyo. Nakamura contacts the companies, and in most cases they put him in touch with their lighting manufacturers and supply the lights themselves. These 24-hour shops - 7-Eleven, Lawson, Family Mart, am/pm and so on - have become an undeniable feature of city life, but more than that, their effect is insidious. Unlike corner shops here, Japanese convenience stores operate on a sophist-icated computer tracking system, so they can follow trends and cater to changing tastes: they know how to make themselves indispensable. </p> <p>And yet, once Nakamura has rearranged the neon signs into art, not everyone recognises the lights and colours that have already become embedded in their subconscious. The effect, according to Nakamura's gallerist, can be strangely subliminal. Nakamura is like a postmodern, Japanese version of Dan Flavin or James Turrell. </p> <p>Nakamura compares himself to Andy Warhol, and explains that 'the difference between me and Warhol is that Warhol only made use of commercial images in the context of the art world, whereas I work within the commercial world itself'. And here we enter an area that is rather grey. Warhol's works were about consumerism, whereas Nakamura refuses to be drawn on whether he means to criticise commerce, or comment on it at all. And, moreover, he is often not free to comment, because the companies are involved in the art. The works, wonderful when seen as radical subversions, can seem disappointing when empty of political content. </p> <p>This is not true of the convenience-store works so much as of his most famous piece, a version of which he will take to the Venice Biennale this year. mm is a gigantic Stonehenge-like circle made up of McDonald's symbols in bright-yellow neon. To anyone familiar with anti-corporate thinking, this appears to be a brilliant piece of satire. But in fact McDonald's is sponsoring the exhibition. Nakamura explains when I ask about this that he had to draw up an agreement between McDonald's and himself: the company has the right of veto over who buys the work, and where it is exhibited. </p> <p>For the Biennale, Nakamura tells me, 'I am supported by McDonald's US, McDonald's Japan and McDonald's Italy. I risk being criticised for that, but I think it's OK because it's art.' Some may see this as naive, others might go so far as to call it politically irresponsible. Far from debunking global capitalism, Nakamura has made himself its slave, and mm , by extension, is not a criticism but a kind of hymn. </p> <p>After dinner, Nakamura and his wife take us to their studio space. Nakamura's light boxes are already packed up and ready to leave for London, while her paintings are leaning against the walls - she is putting the finishing touches on them in time for a show. They are all different colour combinations of the same thing: rows and rows of garish poodles, in various states of unshavenness. Shin Myeong eun explains that once, these hairstyles had a function (to help the poodles swim and make them more aerodynamic), but now they have become merely decorative. Hence her paintings, which seem to be about poodles, are really about art itself, which has lost its function and become purely decorative. Meanwhile, their toddler has found a box full of plastic poodle sculptures, mini Jeff Koons-like extensions of his mother's paintings. He starts playing with one of them, but his parents try to explain that it's art. The kid doesn't look convinced. </p> <p>Masato Nakamura makes a distinction between serious contemporary artists in Japan and those, like Maywa Denki, whom he dismisses as 'entertainers'. Dressed in light-blue uniforms, and calling themselves the 'President' and 'Vice-President' of the Maywa Denki company, Masamichi and Nobumichi Tosa make artworks and give musical performances. They have a contract with Sony Music, and are represented not by a gallery, but by the most successful agent of comedians in Japan. It's true that they are hilarious. And yet the objects they make - 'nonsense machines' built to look like parts of fish, a ventriloquist's dummy operated by a revolver, or shoes that tap-dance by remote control - are philosophical toys of which the Surrealists would have been proud. </p> <p>I catch up with them in Paris, where they are performing in the Galerie du Jour, owned by Agn\u00e8s b. She has designed the uniforms for the show, and playing to a packed house is Nobumichi Tosa, the company's vice-president. Tosa has some sort of flying machine strapped to his back, which turns out to be a set of curious castanets on metal wings. While he performs a Baron M\u00fcnchhausen version of the flamenco, his two assistants accompany him on guitar-like drum systems built in the shape of a carp. They strike increasingly complicated beats, and at one point introduce robots whose heads automatically fly off as the others cheer. Then Tosa steps into the remote tap shoes and stands stock still as the shoes, equipped with finger-like drumming attachments, work their mad magic on their own. The other performers dance around the stage mechanically. They are completely straight-faced; the audience is in stitches. </p> <p>In the neighbouring rooms, the 'nonsense machines' from the 'Naki', or fish, series are exhibited as if in a natural history museum gone strangely wrong. There is an electrical extension cable in the form of a fish skeleton, and a large birdcage with goldfish swimming at the bottom. There is a binocular device that simulates the vision of fish and carries the instruction: 'for use in fleeing from reality'. There are keyrings made in the image of the Tosa brothers and packed in plastic like ordinary toys, and there is a sketchbook contain ing 1,000 varieties of imaginary fish - airplane fish, bicycle fish, mermaid fish, elephant fish, blimp fish, fish wearing trousers. Maywa Denki aims to eventually draw 10,000 species of nonsense fish. </p> <p>After his performance, Nobumichi Tosa explains that the idea for the Naki series came to him because he had experienced a recurring nightmare ever since he was a child. 'There was chaos,' he says, 'and lots of different mutant fish were coming to get me.' If only he could make sense of it all, he thought. And so to 'sort myself out' he decided to try and see the world through the eyes of a fish. </p> <p>Tosa is a thin, sprightly man with short floppy hair and, in conversation at least, a fast-breaking smile. He is in his early thirties but looks about 18. He tells his life story with such dry wit and such a deadpan delivery of extraordinary events that I am inclined to think he is making it up. But, he assures me, all of it is true. </p> <p>The brothers' father was the original president and owner of Maywa Denki, not an artists' group then, but an actual electronics company. Nobumichi was forced to work in the factory as a child. 'I hated it,' he says. 'It was like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times . And it was illegal: child labour!' The company went bankrupt in 1979, and the family moved to Hiroshima. Nobumichi went to school and to art college, and his older brother became a salaryman, working for a car rental company. For his degree show, Tosa made a pregnant robot whose rubber stomach grew and grew until it took on the shape of the enormous contents of its womb: a car. </p> <p>'I had a very strong desire to create life itself,' Tosa explains, 'but how could I create a living being? How could I go further than the robot? I was stuck.' I ask why he decided to become an artist instead of an engineer, or a scientist, if he was interested in creating artificial life. 'Because I am more advanced,' he says at first, then laughs and goes on. By way of an artist's manifesto, he explains that those people have got it all wrong. 'Computers evolved from logic,' he says, 'but human brains are based on nonsense. Life equals nonsense. If life worked logically, all creatures would be extinct. True artificial intelligence cannot be based on logic, because that is not the way human beings think.' And so the nonsense machine, a paradox only in appearance, was born. </p> <p>He got together with his brother, who had, in the meantime, been through some prodigal adventures of his own. Masamichi Tosa had had an affair with his boss's wife and, in disgrace, disappeared for several years. He took various seedy, untraceable jobs, and re-emerged on the other side of the country just when his brother reached a crisis point in his career. The brothers realised that if they wanted to be artists they would have to find a way of reaching the public. 'Japanese people have a special weakness for uniforms,' Tosa tells me with a smile. 'They will pay attention to anyone wearing one.' The brothers decided to resurrect the defunct, labour-forcing company of their father, and Maywa Denki, whose brochure looks like any other supply catalogue but is filled with surreal curiosities, was reborn in irony. 'Entertainment' may well turn out to be the straightest road to subversion. </p> <p> Minimal Selves , the title of Masato Nakamura's new work, is intended to reflect the way in which individuals see themselves, or lose themselves, in an altered landscape of their own city. But it might just as easily apply to the work of Tatsumi Orimoto and Maywa Denki, who, by hiding behind loaves of bread or dressing up as factory workers, have minimised themselves for the sake of art. They exhibit and perform in other countries because they think it's hard to be accepted for what they are at home. And yet, through this conversion or camouflage, they have managed to create something that, in its playful, clever absurdity, feels like it could only have come from Japan.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tatsumi Orimoto is, at 55, a grand old man of Japanese contemporary art. He has made his name with a performance piece, or live sculpture, which involves wrapping several loaves of bread around his head, tightly, with twine. The configurations are not accidental: there is a large oval bloomer at the front where his face should be, and at least six baguettes jutting out at various angles from the centre. Orimoto must scarcely be able to see behind this leaven elephantiasis, and yet he wanders about the world shaking hands, boarding trains, challenging people to accept him. You might call it street theatre of the absurd. He has been to Turkey, Nepal, Germany, and, with a photographer, documented each performative moment: the time he was chased by homeless people in New York, or thrown out of a restaurant in Moscow for wasting food; the occasions when he was laughed at by students or ignored by passing tourists as he posed at the foot of Big Ben. 'Bread Man', Orimoto says now, is a project that will continue until he dies. This May, as part of the Tokyo Life exhibition at Selfridges, Orimoto will exhibit some of his photographs, and walk along Oxford Street as Bread Man. But for now, he is back in Kawasaki, the city outside Tokyo where he grew up. He lives with his mother in a small, traditional Japanese house. His mother has Alzheimer's, and while looking after her, he has made her the subject of his work; she is now known as Art Mama. When I speak to Orimoto on the phone, he says he will meet me at Kawasaki station, since the directions to his house are rather complicated. 'Will you recognise me?' he asks. I pause, trying not to laugh, and wondering if I will recognise him without the bread. I am not sure how seriously Orimoto takes himself, but as soon as we meet, all concern is dispelled. 'I'm a very funny guy,' he tells me in passing. He has a round, smiling face and flowing grey hair. He has just bought us lunch and is riding a clapped-out old bicycle. As we enter his house, he indicates one of his early works on the doorstep: it's a leafless bonsai in a plant pot, with two old Converse sneakers hanging from its branches. 'Shoe-tree,' he says. Orimoto's mother has just woken up from her mid-morning nap, and, as we join her on the electrically heated carpet, Orimoto gets out piles of papers and seemingly endless albums of photographs. 'This is my bible,' he says, handing me two thick yellow plastic volumes. Inside are postcards he has produced, of each of his performances - a documentary of his life as Bread Man. When Orimoto finished school in Kawasaki, he tried to get into art college six years in a row and failed: 'My teacher said, Tatsumi, you are already an artist, not a student.' He emigrated to America, where he met Korean-born artist Nam June Paik, often dubbed the father of video art, and fell in with the Fluxus group in New York - Paik, John Cage, Yoko Ono. Orimoto, then a painter, had never heard of performance art, and though he has fond memories of meeting Joseph Beuys, he wasn't sure he understood it. 'They did very funny things,' he tells me. 'They would say, \"Come to a party\", and I'd bring beer, and there would be a barbecue - but they weren't cooking meat. They were cooking bricks, and serving them on plates!' 'I was looking for my style,' Orimoto says, and about 10 years ago he found it. A Christian friend told him that in the Bible 'bread means body', and that gave Orimoto an idea. If Marcel Duchamp could call a toilet a fountain, he explains, then 'bread means not food: it is sculpture'. Seven years ago, Orimoto's father died. His mother's role, until then, had been to look after the patriarch, and at that point she found herself at a loss. Her body packed up, she developed Alzheimer's, and her son had to come back to look after her. He couldn't travel as much, and Bread Man's happenings dwindled. Then one day Orimoto realised: 'This, my daily life, is art.' He photographed his mother wearing enormous papier-mch\u00e9 shoes ( Small Mama + Big Shoes ), or out on her daily walks around the neighbourhood. As the tag line to one of his shows has it, 'the existence of my Mama is art'. One piece is a picture of his mother and two of her friends sitting on a sofa at home. They are all wearing huge rubber tyres round their necks. By way of explanation, Orimoto makes a link between the junk people leave in the streets, and his mother's generation, who have been ignored by their children. There is a well-documented problem in Japan: how to care for its legions of elderly people. 'After very hard work,' Orimoto says gnomically, 'very broken body.' His brother, who lives 10 minutes away, never looks after his mother. 'The younger generation, they throw away everything.' I ask how much his mother knows about what he is doing. 'My mother has no education - maybe she cannot understand contemporary art,' he says, 'but she believes in me, and I believe in her.' And sometimes, the drowsy person before us proves herself to be very sharp. 'When I'm preparing photographs for an exhibition,' Orimoto goes on, 'she says, \"If somebody buys a photograph, you have to give me half the money!\"' Orimoto says that 'sometimes, I'm very tired from holding my bread on my head', and that he doesn't like performing Bread Man in Japan because people see him as dirty, or dangerous. In fact, he is only just beginning to be recognised in his own country, and many younger artists are hardly aware of his work. But this is perhaps more to do with the culture of Tokyo than with Orimoto himself. All of the artists I interviewed pointed out that contemporary art is not recognised as a discipline by the average man or woman in the street, and that it's very hard to be an artist here for that reason. Even the word they use to describe themselves is not Japanese: they all call themselves 'artists', because the Japanese word seems dated. There may be a long aesthetic tradition, but it is not experimental. A generation younger than Orimoto's has found different ways of dealing with this problem: Maywa Denki is a pair of artists who masquerade as an electronics company, slipping art to the masses in the guise of something more familiar; Masato Nakamura, the most straightforwardly 'white cube' artist of them all, constantly probes and questions Japanese identity. He is the founder and key member of an artists' collective, Command N, which will also be exhibiting at Tokyo Life. They have an office in Akihabara, the electronics district of Tokyo, and aim to make art in the context of a new technological world. They have simultaneously 'hijacked' 32 TVs in electrical shops with video works, and at Selfridges they will present a spoof real-estate project, selling virtual views of Tokyo. Each of these artists has a way of looking at their culture and their capital city in a new, refracted light. Masato Nakamura's work is in fact made of light. Whether it's a glowing shape in a wall, a sculpted set of barber-shop lamps or an intervention on the roof of a Tokyo taxi, all of it draws on the brightness of this 24-hour city. As the daylight dims, the interpreter and I meet Nakamura in Command N's office in Akihabara. The streets are crowded with multicoloured, skyscraping neon lights. Below the signs, there are warrens of electronics shops, filled like sci-fi havens with minuscule surveillance cameras and bits of circuitry and chips for unimaginable machines. In the office, some members of Command N are setting up an exhibition in a space the size of a small stairwell. Nakamura, a tall, trendy man in his late thirties, takes us in his Volvo to his home, miles away in a suburb so quiet it feels like a movie set. As we arrive, his Korean wife Shin Myeong eun - also an artist and a member of Command N - comes round the corner with their two-year-old son. We go for dinner at a restaurant nearby, and Nakamura begins to speak about his work. The piece that he will exhibit at Tokyo Life, in a new gallery space specially designed by architect David Adjaye, is called Minimal Selves . It is a series of nine monumental light boxes - beautiful, colourful, rectangular abstractions. Though Nakamura says he doesn't care if people in London see them as purely abstract works, what they are is the logos of the various convenience stores to be found on every street corner in Tokyo. Nakamura contacts the companies, and in most cases they put him in touch with their lighting manufacturers and supply the lights themselves. These 24-hour shops - 7-Eleven, Lawson, Family Mart, am/pm and so on - have become an undeniable feature of city life, but more than that, their effect is insidious. Unlike corner shops here, Japanese convenience stores operate on a sophist-icated computer tracking system, so they can follow trends and cater to changing tastes: they know how to make themselves indispensable. And yet, once Nakamura has rearranged the neon signs into art, not everyone recognises the lights and colours that have already become embedded in their subconscious. The effect, according to Nakamura's gallerist, can be strangely subliminal. Nakamura is like a postmodern, Japanese version of Dan Flavin or James Turrell. Nakamura compares himself to Andy Warhol, and explains that 'the difference between me and Warhol is that Warhol only made use of commercial images in the context of the art world, whereas I work within the commercial world itself'. And here we enter an area that is rather grey. Warhol's works were about consumerism, whereas Nakamura refuses to be drawn on whether he means to criticise commerce, or comment on it at all. And, moreover, he is often not free to comment, because the companies are involved in the art. The works, wonderful when seen as radical subversions, can seem disappointing when empty of political content. This is not true of the convenience-store works so much as of his most famous piece, a version of which he will take to the Venice Biennale this year. mm is a gigantic Stonehenge-like circle made up of McDonald's symbols in bright-yellow neon. To anyone familiar with anti-corporate thinking, this appears to be a brilliant piece of satire. But in fact McDonald's is sponsoring the exhibition. Nakamura explains when I ask about this that he had to draw up an agreement between McDonald's and himself: the company has the right of veto over who buys the work, and where it is exhibited. For the Biennale, Nakamura tells me, 'I am supported by McDonald's US, McDonald's Japan and McDonald's Italy. I risk being criticised for that, but I think it's OK because it's art.' Some may see this as naive, others might go so far as to call it politically irresponsible. Far from debunking global capitalism, Nakamura has made himself its slave, and mm , by extension, is not a criticism but a kind of hymn. After dinner, Nakamura and his wife take us to their studio space. Nakamura's light boxes are already packed up and ready to leave for London, while her paintings are leaning against the walls - she is putting the finishing touches on them in time for a show.

      "body": "<p>Anthropologists could have a field day analysing why one man's food is another man's poison. Civet cat, for example, cooked with snake and chicken is considered a delicacy in Kuala Lumpur but not in Britain. Clearly, much depends on the social image of an ingredient. In Japan, seaweed is an essential element in cooking. It is admired for its beauty, taste, texture and nutritional value. Here, many still regard it as a food fit only for fish and nut-crunching hippies. Such Western attitudes, however, are slowly being eroded by the appearance of sushi in sandwich shops and by chefs such as Mark Edwards and Peter Gordon, who incorporate Japanese ingredients into their cooking.</p> <p>Thus, the glamour babes who hang out in Nobu can cut their pearly whites on a Mark Edwards salad of turbot sashimi, which has been marinated between slices of kombu (dried kelp). This contains a natural form of glutamic acid, which enhances the taste of other ingredients. Alternatively, they may choose to drape themselves at Providores in Marylebone, which Peter Gordon is opening this summer, and nibble a salmon roll wrapped in nori (a marine algae that is dried in sheets), dipped in a beer batter, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce.</p> <p>As Rob Shipman, sous chef at Nobu, explains: 'We experiment by applying Japanese ideas to Western recipes. We might add some kombu to an ordinary chicken stock to intensify its flavour, or leave a piece in tomato water (tomato juice drained overnight through muslin) to make a consomm\u00e9 or jelly.' It adds a deliciously deep, saline note.</p> <p>The Japanese cultivate and eat more than 20 varieties of seaweed, of which wakame, kombu and nori are the most popular. Kombu, the best - and most expensive - is speckled white with dried mineral salts. Washing will destroy these and some of its complex flavour, so wipe with a clean damp cloth instead.</p> <p>Wakame seaweed is a calcium-rich, lobe-leafed Undaria pinnatifida that belongs to the brown algae family. You often find its vibrant green leaves floating in miso soup. It is sold dried as a frond or in small pieces. If you buy a frond, soak it for 20 minutes in tepid water, then cut away its tough ribs. Its leaves taste wonderful in salads - just scald in hot water after soaking, then plunge into cold water. Otherwise, drop it into clear soups and simmer for a minute - any longer and it will turn to mush. 'It also makes an excellent sauce for noodles,' explains Peter Gordon. 'Just pur\u00e9e it and flavour to taste with sesame oil, lime juice, sesame seeds, spring onions and cashew nuts.'</p> <p>It is only a matter of time before every foodie will be garnishing their dishes with a julienne of toasted nori and flavouring their roast chicken and root vegetables \u00e0 la Peter Gordon with dried kelp. After all, you can now buy nori-wrapped sushi from your local supermarket.</p> <p>\u0095 For further information on seaweed, try Japanese Cooking: a Simple Art by Shizuo Tsuji (\u00a317, Kodansha).

      "bodyText": "Anthropologists could have a field day analysing why one man's food is another man's poison. Civet cat, for example, cooked with snake and chicken is considered a delicacy in Kuala Lumpur but not in Britain. Clearly, much depends on the social image of an ingredient. In Japan, seaweed is an essential element in cooking. It is admired for its beauty, taste, texture and nutritional value. Here, many still regard it as a food fit only for fish and nut-crunching hippies. Such Western attitudes, however, are slowly being eroded by the appearance of sushi in sandwich shops and by chefs such as Mark Edwards and Peter Gordon, who incorporate Japanese ingredients into their cooking. Thus, the glamour babes who hang out in Nobu can cut their pearly whites on a Mark Edwards salad of turbot sashimi, which has been marinated between slices of kombu (dried kelp). This contains a natural form of glutamic acid, which enhances the taste of other ingredients. Alternatively, they may choose to drape themselves at Providores in Marylebone, which Peter Gordon is opening this summer, and nibble a salmon roll wrapped in nori (a marine algae that is dried in sheets), dipped in a beer batter, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce. As Rob Shipman, sous chef at Nobu, explains: 'We experiment by applying Japanese ideas to Western recipes. We might add some kombu to an ordinary chicken stock to intensify its flavour, or leave a piece in tomato water (tomato juice drained overnight through muslin) to make a consomm\u00e9 or jelly.' It adds a deliciously deep, saline note. The Japanese cultivate and eat more than 20 varieties of seaweed, of which wakame, kombu and nori are the most popular. Kombu, the best - and most expensive - is speckled white with dried mineral salts. Washing will destroy these and some of its complex flavour, so wipe with a clean damp cloth instead. Wakame seaweed is a calcium-rich, lobe-leafed Undaria pinnatifida that belongs to the brown algae family. You often find its vibrant green leaves floating in miso soup. It is sold dried as a frond or in small pieces. If you buy a frond, soak it for 20 minutes in tepid water, then cut away its tough ribs. Its leaves taste wonderful in salads - just scald in hot water after soaking, then plunge into cold water. Otherwise, drop it into clear soups and simmer for a minute - any longer and it will turn to mush. 'It also makes an excellent sauce for noodles,' explains Peter Gordon. 'Just pur\u00e9e it and flavour to taste with sesame oil, lime juice, sesame seeds, spring onions and cashew nuts.' It is only a matter of time before every foodie will be garnishing their dishes with a julienne of toasted nori and flavouring their roast chicken and root vegetables \u00e0 la Peter Gordon with dried kelp. After all, you can now buy nori-wrapped sushi from your local supermarket. \u0095 For further information on seaweed, try Japanese Cooking: a Simple Art by Shizuo Tsuji (\u00a317, Kodansha).

      "body": "<p>I never consciously decided to try reiki, indeed I'm not sure I'd even heard of it when I first lay down next to Barbara Ann, who was to become my regular healer and eventual teacher. I had booked my appointment thinking that reiki was, in fact, shiatsu. Don't ask me how I got them mixed up.</p> <p>After a bad bout of depression in late 1998, I had been trying out different ways of living. I had discovered that the hard-work hard-play lifestyle had not made me happy. The more money I earned, the more politicking I got up to, the more sex I had, the more drugs I tried, I still felt a growing sense that my life was empty and pointless.</p> <p>During a spell in The Priory, I had tried yoga and discovered a sense of peace, especially during the more meditative breathing exercises. I'd also found a cranial osteopath who seemed able to shift the chemicals around inside my brain, quite perceptibly, improving my mood with the lightest pressure.</p> <p>Now, I wasn't relying exclusively on 'alternative' remedies. I was taking a strong antidepressant (Venlafaxine) and having regular therapy, but I felt that the other things I was trying were, literally, complementary.</p> <p>I took up aromatherapy and even bought one or two crystals. Sceptics will claim that any effect these remedies had were 'all in the mind', but that doesn't devalue them. That was where my depression was, too. Then a friend suggested shiatsu and I thought: 'Why not give it a try?' Somehow, though, I ended up picking up a leaflet for reiki - my mind had transposed the two.</p> <p>So that is how I ended up sitting cross-legged next to Barbara Ann, who began to briefly explain what reiki was. I soon realised that it wasn't the simple massage I had expected. She was talking of 'energies', 'healing' and 'the light'. She seemed to radiate pleasant feelings, and when she asked me to lie down, I thought, 'Well, I may as well give it a go.'</p> <p>She placed various crystals around, and on, my body, which lay on a soft mat on the floor, my head and knees lifted slightly by small pillows. She lit some incense and put on some dreamy music. I closed my eyes. I felt Barbara Ann kneeling behind my head. She placed her fingers on my temples. I took a deep breath. It was like someone was shining a warm light into my body, through my skull, down my neck and into my chest. I took a really deep breath, then another, and my body relaxed.</p> <p>These feelings and the ones that followed are not easy to describe. They are also not easy to explain. If someone had described them to me, I would have been sceptical. I don't expect to convince anyone of the power or efficacy of reiki by writing about it. It is something that has to be experienced. Part of its potency for me that first time was, I am sure, due to my not having any preconceptions about what was going to happen. My mind and body did not 'expect' a particular experience and so maybe they were more open than they otherwise would have been to what happened.</p> <p>Reiki is, in layman's terms, a form of spiritual healing. Like any system of healing, different practitioners explain it in diverse ways, and I am no expert, but the bare bones of the theory are this: we are beings made of energy (so far, physics would agree), and we are connected to the universal source of energy - what some would call nature, others the universe, some God. That energy flows through us, though sometimes our consciousness and bodies create blockages, and we close off to the energy. Reiki healers channel the energy - focusing it, if you like, in concentrated form - and send it into the person being healed. There it interacts with body, mind, spirit and emotions, providing holistic healing.</p> <p>Reiki is a Japanese word that is not easy to translate. The first part means spirit or soul, the second, cosmic energy (this aspect is also known as 'chi' or 'prana' in yoga). Together the word means 'God-directed lifeforce energy' (with God defined in the way relevant to you).</p> <p>It is this pure, positive energy that flows through the body during reiki healing. It's hard to imagine but incredibly easy to experience. When the energy started flowing through me, it was like being bathed in warm, soft white light. It was not a subtle feeling. As Barbara Ann moved around me, placing her hands on my chest, my abdomen, my legs, bursts of the energy would ripple luxuriously through my body. My mind went to another place, ordinary humdrum thoughts were banished, and I experienced feelings I'd never felt before: of being deeply at peace, and being connected to something vast, beyond the mere me. I ceased to be conscious of the boundary of my body. I seemed to exist beyond my skin.</p> <p>I later learnt that I had become conscious of my aura, the energy field that surrounds each of us. This, again, sounds farfetched, but remember the last time your lips were a few inches away from the lips of someone you love, about to kiss. You could feel them, just as sure as moments later when you actually touched. That is your aura.</p> <p>In the midst of the wonder of that first reiki experience, though, there was some darkness. When Barbara Ann turned her attention to my abdomen, I felt an intense sensation of pain which grew and grew - it was quite uncomfortable. It felt almost evil. Then, whoosh, it seemed to leave my body. I could hear Barbara Ann blowing it away. Then she pressed her hands on to my body and a shaft of bright golden light filled my abdomen, filling and healing where the pain had been. I had done other therapy work which had made me believe that I stored my emotional pain, as many of us do, in my stomach. It seemed that reiki had identified that pain and removed at least a part of it.</p> <p>By now I had lost track of time, as Barbara Ann moved to work on my legs. This was where the most pronounced effect occurred. As she sent the light into me, I felt my arm begin to jerk. At first I thought it was just a reaction to lying still for so long, but my breath was deepening too, in rhythm with the twitching. Eventually my arm jerked itself off the floor and was stretched fully upwards, then my other arm slowly joined it. As soon as Barbara Ann moved her hands away from my body, my arms collapsed back down to my sides.</p> <p>A few moments later, my legs lifted off the floor, stretching straight up. I think Barbara Ann's hands were on my stomach again, my arms lifted too, stretching upwards to meet my legs. Only the small of my back was on the floor. Now, I have done stretches during yoga, but nothing like this. I held it for minutes, effortlessly, then suddenly relaxed, and my limbs settled back on the floor. I felt loose, alive. I had not consciously moved a muscle, and yet I could feel my muscles buzz with energy.</p> <p>Barbara Ann moved to my feet and pressed firmly on their soles. What I can only describe as a cascade of bright, showering light filled my body, up my legs, through my chest and into my head, flowing out of the top of it. After about 30 seconds, Barbara Ann let go. The light subsided. Eventually I asked quietly, 'Wow, what was that?' She smiled and replied simply: 'Well, you did a lot of healing.' An hour and 20 minutes had passed.</p> <p>Barbara Ann did not seek to explain more. It was unnecessary anyway. Not that it's a miracle cure. Much of the effect wears off but it leaves a residue of awareness that, over time, builds up. There's a spiritual side to reiki, too. It has mantras such as 'Just for today I will feel no anger' or 'Earn your living with integrity'. Some reiki masters believe strongly in karma, even past lives. Many believe you can heal remotely, far from the person being healed. Many others swear reiki works wonders with animals.</p> <p>The point is, though, that reiki is not a belief system - it is experiential healing. You don't have to 'believe in it', or even understand it - you just have to let it do its work. And reiki can work for anyone.</p> <p>Sometimes months go by when I don't think about it, let alone make time to go to a healing session. Then one day (and it last happened a fortnight ago), I will wake up and have the unmistakable urge to receive some healing. When I get that urge I always go, and the energy is always there, waiting.</p> <p><b> The reiki stuff</b></p> <p>\u0095 Reiki healers typically charge between \u00a325 and \u00a350. Usually sessions last between an hour and an hour and a half.</p> <p>\u0095 Not all reiki healers are masters, yet they can still be very effective.</p> <p>\u0095 Many people find a healer through word of mouth and personal recommendation.</p> <p>\u0095 Some healers advertise in alternative-health magazines and on the internet (you can always ask to speak to an existing client).</p> <p>\u0095 Alternative health centres will sometimes have resident healers, or know of recommended ones.</p> <p>\u0095 Trust your own instincts about whether someone is right for you.</p> <p>\u0095 You can get a list of reiki practitioners in your area from: the Reiki Association, UK (01981 550 817; 01584 891 197; <a href=\"mailto:katejones@reikiassociation.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">katejones@reikiassociation.org.uk</a>).

Made from sugar, red beans and agar, yokan (75p per 50g stick or \u00a34.12 for a gift pack) is alleged to enhance the flavour of green tea, though Cook maintains the better-quality green teas 'are less bitter or bland' than cheaper varieties. He has just launched www.japanesetea.co.uk, selling Sencha tea direct from the plantation to Britons keen on its proven health benefits. Other reputable companies offering Japanese ingredients by mail order include Clearspring Direct (020 8746 0152). Many Chinese grocers sell some Japanese items. Arigato (50 Brewer Street, London W1; 020 7287 1722) sells dried, fresh and frozen goods as well as sushi. In Leeds, Harvey Nichols (107-111 Briggate; 0113 204 8888) boasts a big range of products, including a swish sushi set (\u00a317.95) which makes a lovely gift.",

Like coming to trainers or class A drugs in your thirties, there is a deal of baggage to be handled in making such a dramatic leap in the lifestyle stakes. So why the attraction? It is not, despite the excitement it caused when it first came out, because of the car's looks.

Like the vast majority of drivers who also happen to be non-farmers, the idea of taking your own \u00a318,000 Tonka toy across sliding mud fields or wet hillsides is not particularly attractive. Supposing it gets stuck and you have to get your trainers muddy? </p> <p>And I don't think the appeal is down to the RAV's undoubted performance qualities, even though in comparative tests with rivals the new models, like their forerunners, tend to come top or near top in most categories and best overall. </p> <p>There are yet other factors that might persuade you if you were faced with a difficult choice. Fuel economy is very good for its class, but not at the expense of performance: a top speed of 115mph puts it beyond the reach of most competitors.

The true appeal of this car lies in its king-of-the-road, high-up driving position and fortress feel. Long the preserve of the Barbour-wearing, Land Rover-driving class and its tragic imitators, the real achievement of the RAV and its ilk is to democratise the natural feeling of superiority the elevated driving position confers and make it available to the Nike-shod masses. </p> <p>This, at any rate, was the theory which four fully grown adults put to the test on a long weekend break on the Norfolk coast in the five-door GX model. </p> <p>The first thing we noticed, and continued to notice throughout the trip, was the level of comfort in both front and back seats. A 200-mile unbroken stretch of mixed A-road, motorway and urban sprawl presented no problems in terms of comfort for driver or passengers. The car proved so comfortable, in fact, that there was none of the jockeying for position for the front passenger seat to be expected on any long-distance trip, and a couple of us who are normally susceptible to car sickness even found we could read in the rear seats for lengthy periods without feeling queasy. </p> <p>The longer the weekend went on, the more we appreciated the car. Whether we had just done a long, wind-swept walk or stopped for fish and chips, we were always happy to climb in, settle into the enveloping fortress of comfort and peer down contentedly at the world speeding by. </p> <p>A few points could be made on the debit side. The most important concerns not just the RAV4 but the so-called sports utility vehicle in general. Having more or less the same wheel base as your standard small car or saloon but being that much taller, the SUV - as our manual baldly, hilariously pointed out - has a greater tendency to roll over.

In general, the build quality of the RAV4 is pretty good for its class, with a chunky, reassuring feel. But the rear door closes in very tinny fashion, introducing an unexpected off note that lingers in the memory. It sounds trivial but, when you come back from a picnic in a quiet country park and find yourself next to a Freelander or Shogun, you don't want the Wellingtons to think you're cheap when you pack away your ghetto blasters and baseball bats. Last on the debit side is the alienating name. Why 'RAV4'?

It takes a little time, a Japanese mood of ritual, to heat the ceramic flask in a pan of warm water. I like the sense of 'fixing a drink'. A hand-made drink.

The sake plays the supporting role reserved for vermouth. The actual booze is vodka. I like the sound of Nobu's summer cocktails, made with sweeter sakes, vodka and crushed strawberries. I prefer the booze to shochu, the distilled counterpart to sake.</p> <p>In Japan, a handful of restaurants are beginning to offer sakes as ap\u00e9ritif. I have been presented with the flowery Awa-Nigori ('Pale and Misty') before a meal and the peppery Chikamatsu-no (named after a classical author) as a digestif.

I side with Hyogo, because I have never been to Niigata. At the oldest of Shirayuki's five breweries, a man with a headband, looking like a samurai or at least a sushi master, shouted instructions. Four young Japanese women, dressed rather like nurses, kneeled to massage a bed of steamed rice in a cedar-lined, sauna-like room. While watching this, I thought I felt the earth move.

'The rice must be steamed to the right degree,' explains Hiroshi Matsukawa, production director of Shirayuki. 'Every grain should have a hardcrust but be soft inside. When they're being kneaded, we want the grains to be scratched to allow the koji to penetrate, but not too much. That is a matter of experience and sensitivity of judgment, so this sake will be very expensive.

'Japanese tavern' is an attempt to translate 'izakaya' - the sort of informal watering hole Iestyn Evans wanted to recreate in the principality after a decade of living in Japan. The restaurant he has created with his Japanese wife is an amalgamation of all his fondest memories, including the cheery shouts, the drama and authentic 'home cooking'. Staff wear 'hapi' jackets and scuttle back and forth with various combinations of tapas-sized dishes from a menu listing 55 items besides soups, noodles and salads. Prices are kept low; you can eat well and go home tipsy for \u00a320. <p><b> Fusion</b> 41 Byres Road, Glasgow (0141 339 3666). Glasgow's first and still funkiest sushi bar may have Albanian chefs, but locals reckon the fare is 'fantastic'. The name alludes to the availability of ramen bowls, tempura, teriyaki and the like, in addition to every type of sushi. Sushi costs from \u00a31.95 to \u00a33.75 per portion, so the bill depends on how greedy you are - but everyone from Billy Connolly to impecunious students seems to be able to afford to hang out there. </p> <p><b> Edamame </b> 15 Holywell Street, Oxford (01865 246 916). This little gem of a place seats 30 people at an absolute squeeze and is so perfectly suited to a university town full of discerning, adventurous youngsters with scant cash that it is always full to bursting. Opened by Peter and Mieko Galpin 18 months ago, Edamame only opens for lunch from Tuesday through Thursday, and dinner on Friday and Saturday - but since lunch costs around \u00a36 to \u00a37 and dinner rarely more than \u00a312, including sake or Asahi beer, some customers appear every day. Indeed, regulars' badgering for sushi became so persistent that the Galpins finally gave in a few months ago - they now offer salmon sushi only, for \u00a36. </p> <p><b> Yumi</b> 2 West Court, Edinburgh (0131 337 2173). Relocated a few years ago from a cosy basement location, Yumi incarnates a traditional Japanese restaurant within a high-ceilinged Victorian villa in the West End. Diners (surprisingly young, given the \u00a350 per head price tag on dinner) relish the chance to stay all evening in such spacious (and smoke-free) surroundings. The restaurant is named after the owner's kimono-clad wife; he is known as 'Mr Yumi'. Staff are unfailingly helpful, offering endless variations on the 10 set menus and explaining dipping and wrapping processes. There are even origami animals to take away 'for good luck'.</p>",

We met four years ago at a previous school. Keiko proofreads what I write and looks after me; she shares my work and accommodates the demands it places on me. If we go out to a restaurant, for a so-called date, and I'm deep in the dark period before a deadline, all I want to talk about is the book, because that's what I'm obsessed with. Keiko doesn't just put up with me, she encourages me, and that's the best thing. </p> <p> A more direct way that Kei helps me is simply with on-the-spot interpreting work with people I would otherwise probably not be able to communicate with, or not as well, and that can be invaluable. She has also helped me understand the Japanese culture in many ways. Keiko's patient and explains things I don't understand and she lets me practise my extraordinarily awful Japanese with her, and hopefully by doing that it will get less extraordinarily awful, and that in itself is empowerment for me. </p> <p> I think maybe I make more of an effort to eat up Japanese culture, partly out of deference to Kei, to show that I take her culture seriously and that I'm not just another pushy Westerner. </p> <p> We don't go to Tokyo, if we can help it. Hiroshima's urban enough for us, we're both country people. I love the Japanese countryside - being up in the mountains or on the islands, which are beautiful. There are still large pockets where you can kid yourself that you're in a much more civilised century than you are. </p> <p> I feel completely at home here, though I realise that in the eyes of most Japanese I'm about as Japanese as George W Bush. It's definitely my home for the time being - but when you're 32, nothing is completely permanent. </p> <p><strong> Keiko Yoshida:</strong> I got to know David because we worked in the same school in Hiroshima, though in different parts of the school. I knew him by reputation from the students and other teachers. Some English schools say, 'This is America and we don't talk in Japanese', which can make foreign English teachers seem arrogant, but David is not like that.</p> <p> He's very considerate, fair and kind, and he tries to understand people. </p> <p> We live together for half of the week, as my mum is not well, so I stay with her Monday to Friday and then stay with David for the weekend. </p> <p> He thinks I support him a lot with his work, but I don't think I'm helping him at all. I really enjoy our conversations. It's very exciting to see how he progresses with his work. I'm a really big fan of Haruki Murakami and have read everything he's published. I want to know what Haruki Murakami thinks, but it usually takes about a year before books are published once they've been written, so he's always one year ahead of me, but with David I can see every stage of his work: before he rewrites it, while he rewrites it and then after he's rewritten it - it's all very exciting. </p> <p> I know a lot about Japan, but when you live in a country you don't get all the information. David knows a lot more about the country by reading things published outside Japan, so I find out many things through his eyes. At the weekends we go to small islands on the fishermen's coast. We usually find islands by chance - in fact, lots of things happen by chance because we just go there and see what happens. </p> <p> We never argue, but we talk a lot. We have to discuss things whenever we've got any small problem because we lose a lot of the nuances in each other's language, and I don't want to miss any nuances, as much as that's possible.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is always sad to see eminent and once progressive commentators arguing for illiberal causes on the basis of evidence that they would not countenance in their own areas of competence.</p> <p>Economists Bob Rowthorn and Paul Ormerod rely largely on American findings concerning differences between married people and single, cohabiting, divorced and separated people (Comment, last week) to argue that marriage is not only good for your health, but also for your economic and emotional well-being. They go as far as to suggest it is usually better for couples to stay together for the sake of the children, even when one or both partners are unhappy.</p> <p>But these findings cannot properly be used to arrive at such conclusions. Partly, that is because marriage in the United States is not typical of marriage elsewhere in the Western world (for instance, the post-war, US divorce rate is twice as high as those of Britain and Western Europe). Partly, it is because of the high degree of self-selection inherent in the data. The adverse effects of unhappy and abusive marriages do not show up in such findings precisely because it is these kinds of marriages that are most likely to terminate in divorce and separation. <br><b> Francis Castles </b><br> Professor of Social and Public Policy <br> University of Edinburgh</p> <p>\u0095 So, 'serious violence among married couples is uncommon'. Really? Rowthorn and Ormerod must tell us why they are so sure about that, for nobody else is. Totting up the numbers in domestic violence has never been much of a priority, except to some womens' groups and a few researchers. And the figures they've come up with so far always freeze one's blood. It is a base and long-standing practice to glibly single out 'serious violence', as if all the rest, the 'less serious violence' (the kind which doesn't quite put you in casualty?) should remain decently obscured behind closed doors; just like in the safe, comfortable past. <br><b> Una Freeley </b><br> London N8</p> <p>\u0095 What Rowthorn and Ormerod fail to acknowledge is that research on cohabiting, married and lone parents does not prove that marriage is better for children. All it proves is that working-class and wageless parents are more likely to cohabit, while lone parents live on lower incomes. Consequently, if children in cohabiting or lone-parent families experience less stable and less successful lives then this is because they are poorer.</p> <p>Moreover, it is also likely that, given that the heterosexual nuclear family is socially constructed as 'normal', individuals living in other family arrangements, such as gay couples or lone parents, experience the corollary of 'abnormal', perhaps in the form of homophobic or stigmatising treatment. So it is the context in which family relationships are played out that matters, not whether parents are married. <br><b> Charlie Cooper </b><br> Faculty of Social &amp; Life Sciences <br> Lincolnshire &amp; Humberside University</p> <p>\u0095 It is sad to read my old mate Bob Rowthorn patronise me and tens of thousands of others in 'cohabiting unions'. But it's even sadder that he and Paul Ormerod have taken up the mantras of the moral Right and blame our social problems on the 'values of the 1960s generation'.</p> <p>Rowthorn wants stability in relationships, above all marriage. The old, progressive Bob would have addressed the socio-economic issues - the UK with the longest working hours in Europe; women paid on average one-fifth less than men - and called for reform: a 35-hour week, enforcement of maximum working hours and Equal Pay legislation. He would have addressed the equality issues: extend paternity leave; improve childcare; champion men doing the housework.</p> <p>Instead, he is obsessed by the superiority of marriage. He condemns cohabiting as unstable because 'the option of breaking up is consciously preserved'. But divorce law reform means this is true of marriage too. So to get his desired stability you've got to force people to stay in unsatisfactory marriages. Those who want to join born-again Bob need to understand denying divorce is the goal. <br><b> Jon Bloomfield </b><br> London EC1</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is always sad to see eminent and once progressive commentators arguing for illiberal causes on the basis of evidence that they would not countenance in their own areas of competence. Economists Bob Rowthorn and Paul Ormerod rely largely on American findings concerning differences between married people and single, cohabiting, divorced and separated people (Comment, last week) to argue that marriage is not only good for your health, but also for your economic and emotional well-being. They go as far as to suggest it is usually better for couples to stay together for the sake of the children, even when one or both partners are unhappy. But these findings cannot properly be used to arrive at such conclusions. Partly, that is because marriage in the United States is not typical of marriage elsewhere in the Western world (for instance, the post-war, US divorce rate is twice as high as those of Britain and Western Europe). Partly, it is because of the high degree of self-selection inherent in the data. The adverse effects of unhappy and abusive marriages do not show up in such findings precisely because it is these kinds of marriages that are most likely to terminate in divorce and separation. Francis Castles Professor of Social and Public Policy University of Edinburgh \u0095 So, 'serious violence among married couples is uncommon'. Really? Rowthorn and Ormerod must tell us why they are so sure about that, for nobody else is. Totting up the numbers in domestic violence has never been much of a priority, except to some womens' groups and a few researchers. And the figures they've come up with so far always freeze one's blood. It is a base and long-standing practice to glibly single out 'serious violence', as if all the rest, the 'less serious violence' (the kind which doesn't quite put you in casualty?) should remain decently obscured behind closed doors; just like in the safe, comfortable past. Una Freeley London N8 \u0095 What Rowthorn and Ormerod fail to acknowledge is that research on cohabiting, married and lone parents does not prove that marriage is better for children. All it proves is that working-class and wageless parents are more likely to cohabit, while lone parents live on lower incomes. Consequently, if children in cohabiting or lone-parent families experience less stable and less successful lives then this is because they are poorer. Moreover, it is also likely that, given that the heterosexual nuclear family is socially constructed as 'normal', individuals living in other family arrangements, such as gay couples or lone parents, experience the corollary of 'abnormal', perhaps in the form of homophobic or stigmatising treatment. So it is the context in which family relationships are played out that matters, not whether parents are married. Charlie Cooper Faculty of Social &amp; Life Sciences Lincolnshire &amp; Humberside University \u0095 It is sad to read my old mate Bob Rowthorn patronise me and tens of thousands of others in 'cohabiting unions'. But it's even sadder that he and Paul Ormerod have taken up the mantras of the moral Right and blame our social problems on the 'values of the 1960s generation'. Rowthorn wants stability in relationships, above all marriage. The old, progressive Bob would have addressed the socio-economic issues - the UK with the longest working hours in Europe; women paid on average one-fifth less than men - and called for reform: a 35-hour week, enforcement of maximum working hours and Equal Pay legislation. He would have addressed the equality issues: extend paternity leave; improve childcare; champion men doing the housework. Instead, he is obsessed by the superiority of marriage. He condemns cohabiting as unstable because 'the option of breaking up is consciously preserved'. But divorce law reform means this is true of marriage too. So to get his desired stability you've got to force people to stay in unsatisfactory marriages. Those who want to join born-again Bob need to understand denying divorce is the goal.

The UNHCR's senior emergency officer in East Timor, Bernard Kerblat, said: 'This is a decision of the UNHCR. To me it would be preferable if we could stay, but due to resource constraints 31 December is our deadline.'</p> <p>Kerblat said the camps were riddled with disease and the refugees faced daily intimidation from militia guards.</p> <p>'Certain dark forces partisan to Indonesia want to maintain the status quo of this refugee crisis as proof of their strength,' he said.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of East Timorese refugees will be left stranded across the border in squalid camps in Indonesian West Timor unless relief efforts are stepped up, writes Matthew Brace in Dili. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is winding down its operation on the island and will shut down by the end of the year. Since October 1999 almost 180,000 refugees have returned - but up to 100,000 remain, scattered in more than 220 locations. In the nine months until the December deadline only half look likely to make it home. The UNHCR's senior emergency officer in East Timor, Bernard Kerblat, said: 'This is a decision of the UNHCR. To me it would be preferable if we could stay, but due to resource constraints 31 December is our deadline.' Kerblat said the camps were riddled with disease and the refugees faced daily intimidation from militia guards. 'Certain dark forces partisan to Indonesia want to maintain the status quo of this refugee crisis as proof of their strength,' he said. 'UNHCR wants to disband these camps once and for all. We want these refugees either to be allowed to become fully fledged Indonesian citizens or to be repatriated to East Timor.' UNHCR has had no access to the camps since September last year, when three of their officials were murdered in West Timor. Increasingly, they have turned to the clandestine repatriation of refugees. A network of church workers and pro-democracy activists has been working to smuggle out those most at risk. A number of sympathetic West Timorese oustide the camps have risked their lives to help. Most refugee escapes are by land and sea. Crucial to the UNHCR operation is the Patricia Anne Hotung, a former Australian naval vessel now owned by a Chinese millionaire and donated to the relief effort, but its future role in the humanitarian effort is in doubt. There is a chance that the owner might sell it to the Chinese navy. Reports from camp staff say conditions are worsening by the day.

      "body": "<p>If you are a higher-rate taxpayer and prepared for the possibility that you could lose all of an investment, you may want to consider a venture capital trust. </p> <p>Regarded as the preserve of the very wealthy, they could appeal to people who pay tax at 40 per cent. 'We don't think they should be regarded as particularly high-risk,' says John Spiers of independent adviser Bestinvest. 'The worst have been dull investments.' </p> <p>As they launched in 1995, it is early to judge their performance. Mavis Seymour of accountant BDO Stoy Hayward says: 'I don't think they have turned out to be risky - but, of course, the story isn't over yet. Nobody has yet made a loss on VCT shares.' In one of the biggest success stories so far, a hi-tech VCT paid out a \u00a31 dividend per share - tax-free . </p> <p>You can invest up to \u00a3100,000 in VCTs each tax year. You get income tax relief at 20 per cent on your investment, there is no tax on dividends nor capital gains tax when you sell. But the investment must be held for a minimum three years to qualify for tax relief. One reason why they are so attractive to the very wealthy is that investors can postpone existing CGT liabilities by investing in a VCT within 12 months of the day they realised their gain. </p> <p>You invest in a VCT by buying ordinary shares in it. It is similar to an investment trust and must be quoted on the Stock Exchange. </p> <p>There are strict rules governing the independence of VCT directors and the experience of the fund managers. </p> <p>The VCT invests in small unquoted businesses, but it cannot put more than \u00a31m into a single company. This enforced diversification for funds larger than a few million reduces the risks. </p> <p>Funds with \u00a320m that invest in 20 businesses are typically seeing a few duds among their holdings, but these have been balanced by good performers. </p> <p>So, how much will VCTs be hit by the queasiness of stock markets? Some have specialised in hi-tech, and many general funds include some hi-tech firms. Seymour says fund managers tend to avoid start-ups, however, going instead for businesses at least three or four years old. </p> <p>She is more worried about realising value in these firms: 'A general recession may stop businesses going to the Alternative Investment Market if they don't think they'll get a good price for their company. This may slow down the realisations.' </p> <p>Most VCT managers ex-pect to invest in a business for three to five years. But Seymour says: 'Some people are saying this looks like a good investment for retirement. They usually get a dividend every year.' </p> <p>She thinks VCTs could be worthwhile investments for people who want to put in the minimum \u00a32,000 or \u00a33,000 that most VCTs allow - but only if they could live with the possibility of losing it all. </p> <p>However, Martin Churchill of Allenbridge says people should invest in VCTs only if they already have an equities portfolio of \u00a350,000. Spiers adds that a VCT investment should be less than a quarter of the overall equity investments. </p> <p>Whether smaller investors should dip their toe into this market is debatable. There is a view that smaller investors should keep out, and certainly no one is encouraging basic-rate taxpayers to take this road.

      "bodyText": "If you are a higher-rate taxpayer and prepared for the possibility that you could lose all of an investment, you may want to consider a venture capital trust. Regarded as the preserve of the very wealthy, they could appeal to people who pay tax at 40 per cent. 'We don't think they should be regarded as particularly high-risk,' says John Spiers of independent adviser Bestinvest. 'The worst have been dull investments.' As they launched in 1995, it is early to judge their performance. Mavis Seymour of accountant BDO Stoy Hayward says: 'I don't think they have turned out to be risky - but, of course, the story isn't over yet. Nobody has yet made a loss on VCT shares.' In one of the biggest success stories so far, a hi-tech VCT paid out a \u00a31 dividend per share - tax-free . You can invest up to \u00a3100,000 in VCTs each tax year. You get income tax relief at 20 per cent on your investment, there is no tax on dividends nor capital gains tax when you sell. But the investment must be held for a minimum three years to qualify for tax relief. One reason why they are so attractive to the very wealthy is that investors can postpone existing CGT liabilities by investing in a VCT within 12 months of the day they realised their gain. You invest in a VCT by buying ordinary shares in it. It is similar to an investment trust and must be quoted on the Stock Exchange. There are strict rules governing the independence of VCT directors and the experience of the fund managers. The VCT invests in small unquoted businesses, but it cannot put more than \u00a31m into a single company. This enforced diversification for funds larger than a few million reduces the risks. Funds with \u00a320m that invest in 20 businesses are typically seeing a few duds among their holdings, but these have been balanced by good performers. So, how much will VCTs be hit by the queasiness of stock markets? Some have specialised in hi-tech, and many general funds include some hi-tech firms. Seymour says fund managers tend to avoid start-ups, however, going instead for businesses at least three or four years old. She is more worried about realising value in these firms: 'A general recession may stop businesses going to the Alternative Investment Market if they don't think they'll get a good price for their company. This may slow down the realisations.' Most VCT managers ex-pect to invest in a business for three to five years. But Seymour says: 'Some people are saying this looks like a good investment for retirement. They usually get a dividend every year.' She thinks VCTs could be worthwhile investments for people who want to put in the minimum \u00a32,000 or \u00a33,000 that most VCTs allow - but only if they could live with the possibility of losing it all. However, Martin Churchill of Allenbridge says people should invest in VCTs only if they already have an equities portfolio of \u00a350,000. Spiers adds that a VCT investment should be less than a quarter of the overall equity investments. Whether smaller investors should dip their toe into this market is debatable. There is a view that smaller investors should keep out, and certainly no one is encouraging basic-rate taxpayers to take this road. But some higher-rate taxpayers with less available cash but a tolerance for risk could benefit. There are several schemes available, most of which will close by the end of the tax year. Spiers highlights 'Northern 2' and 'Leisure &amp; Media' as two that would appeal to more cautious VCT investors. Although the market will dry up after 6 April, a batch of new offerings is likely in the autumn - building up to another main season next year. Allenbridge: 020 7409 1111 Bestinvest: 0207 321 0100",

The average bill is now \u00a3901 a year for a band D home in England and \u00a3710 in Wales, says the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa). </p> <p>But there is a huge variation in what people pay in different parts of the country. The most expensive councils ask their citizens for two or three times the amount levied in other areas. Ironically, some of the wealthiest regions charge the least, while poorer areas pay far more. </p> <p>Council tax in the affluent Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, for instance, is about half the size of the Liverpool band D bill of \u00a31,171. The lowest chargers tend to be Conservative councils, and the higher ones are more likely to be Labour or Liberal Democrat held, or areas where no party has overall control. </p> <p>Surprisingly, perhaps, London boroughs are not the most expensive. None charges more than \u00a31,000 for band D - a threshold for the average semi which is broken by several councils outside the capital, including Coventry, Manchester, Salford, Bristol, Redcar, Bolsover, Burnley and Hartlepool. </p> <p>But although councils take the flak for the size of their bills, their control over its size is less than complete. About 75 per cent of local government spending comes as Treasury grants, and only the other 25 per cent is from council tax. </p> <p>Treasury cash made up a larger proportion of the total in 1993, when only 21 per cent was raised locally. </p> <p>Tony Travers, council tax expert at the London School of Economics, says: 'The Treasury - under both Conservative and Labour gov ernments - has almost cynically worked out that they can get away with an increase of about 6 per cent a year on council tax bills, even though that is way ahead of inflation. </p> <p>'The Treasury is trying to shift part of the burden off the national exchequer and on to council taxpayers. My hunch is that the Treasury thinks it can nudge the council tax element up to 30 per cent.' </p> <p>Council tax bills have been rising by about 6 per cent a year since the mid-Nineties and are likely to stay at this rate, despite the fact that inflation is about 2 per cent. It is also possible that London bills will grow faster than this over the next parliament. </p> <p>Although it is little understood by the public, there is much controversy behind the scenes about the way central funding is allocated among town halls. London is seen as having been favoured politically by Westminster, so the Government is under pressure to be more helpful to the Labour strongholds north of Watford. It is hard to see that there will be much grieving in Redcar - average bill \u00a31,081 - if the 5,000 well-off residents of the City of London have to pay more than their current \u00a3579. </p> <p>Another reason why town halls do not have complete control of the council tax bill is that they collect money for other services such as the police, fire service, parish and county councils. Only 13 per cent of a bill levied by Canterbury city council, for instance, can be spent by that council; about 80 per cent goes to the county council, and another 7 per cent to the police authority. </p> <p>Many Labour strongholds are starting to emulate the efficient running on which Conservative councils have prided themselves. Labour-run Newport in south Wales is always one of the lowest billers each year. Like many others, it is benefiting this year from devolution. When it used to get its central government money via the Welsh Office, the uses to which it could put the money were often restricted. Now that its money comes through the Welsh Assembly, it has more discretion. </p> <p>Even Liverpool, once a Labour stronghold and now the country's biggest biller at band D, is -under Liberal Democrat control - espousing privatisation and promising a better deal in future. This is the third year its levy has been frozen at \u00a31,171. </p> <p>Spokesman Matt Finnegan says: 'We've been overpeopled, with costs that were too high and with a quality of services that was too low.' </p> <p>Liverpool has laid off 1,800 of its 24,000 staff in the past year, and last month, announced an outsourcing joint venture with BT worth \u00a3500 million over the next decade to handle much of its administration, including payroll and human resources. It says this is 'a first for local government in Europe', and expects other councils to follow suit. </p> <p>But cheapness is clearly not the only issue. Many residents will be concerned at signs of services deteriorating if councils are badly run or try to cut costs too quickly.

In 1977 we suffered subsidence, and the back of the house was underpinned. I declared this on the proposal form, but Norwich Union asked for an engineer's report. </p> <p>The structural engineers we commissioned advised us to go through the motions of making a new claim, so Eagle Star would send a loss adjuster. Our engineer just inspected the property visually, but the loss adjuster dug holes and took soil samples. </p> <p>Both told us they could find no evidence of any further subsidence, but the written reports were so carefully worded, in order not to commit anyone, that Norwich Union would not accept us. We appear to be stuck with Eagle Star, which refuses to reduce the premium.<br><strong>MC, West Kirby </strong> </p> <p>You have been given appallingly bad advice by your own engineer, which has left you worse off than before. You might think that, because there was no new subsidence, you have a clean bill of health which is attractive to other, cheaper insurers. But making a false claim has done the opposite. Even though this recent claim was a dummy, it counts as a real claim on your file. Although Eagle Star did not have the expense of structural repairs, it had to pay \u00a31,000 for the loss adjuster's survey. </p> <p>Whenever you apply for building insurance in future you must now declare a second subsidence claim in 2000. There is no point explaining to a new insurer that it was only a mock claim because that makes you look dishonest. </p> <p>The second claim does not increase your Eagle Star premiums, but you'll be unlikely to get another insurer to take you on with two subsidence claims on your record. You should complain to the engineer about this bad advice and, if that gets you nowhere, contact his trade association. </p> <p><strong> Transfer value: Members only</strong></p> <p> I took out a Scottish Life endowment policy with my Halifax mortgage in 1986. In 1994, I paid off the mortgage but kept the policy going, and it was reassigned to me. </p> <p>I've been paying into the policy for 14 years and it has been in my name for the past seven, yet Scottish Life says I do not qualify as a member and will not qualify for \u00a3500 compensation if the proposed transfer to Royal London takes place.<br> <strong>MH, Birmingham </strong> </p> <p>Norwich Union, Scottish Widows, Scottish Amicable and Scottish Equitable paid benefits to mortgage endowment policyholders when they demutualised. Scottish Provident and Friends Provident will when they convert later this year. </p> <p>Yet Scottish Life policyholders lose membership when a policy is assigned to a lender and cannot be reinstated. The insurer acknowledges that its rules are unusual, saying this was deliberately done when it mutualised in 1968 to repel approaching asset strippers. </p> <p>Some Scottish Life customers benefit from the oddity: unlike other demutualisations, those with non-profit and unit-linked policies and both holders in joint-life policies are treated as members, assuming the policies have not been used as security for a mortgage. </p> <p>Scottish Life could allow policyholders to vote for a rule change but those with an assigned policy are not members, so cannot vote; the rest would be voting to dilute their own payouts. </p> <p>But it is not all bad news. Your policy will earn extra bonuses on demutualisation, worth around \u00a33,500. </p> <p><strong> Service contract: Cooking with gas</strong></p> <p> In January, I realised that I had not had my annual British Gas 3-star service check for 1999/ 2000. The documentation said it would be arranged by British Gas. I was offered a \u00a330 refund but only as a discount on next year's contract.<br><strong>PS, Banstead</strong> </p> <p>British Gas confirms that it takes responsibility for contacting customers to arrange the annual service, but admits some fall through the net. </p> <p>In compensation, the company is sending you a cheque for \u00a360, double the original offer. It will treat the service you eventually arranged in January as last year's missed visit and will give you another service next November. </p> <p><strong> Mail order: Sign of the times</strong></p> <p> I cannot get to the shops and often buy by mail. Recently Parcel Force made me sign on an electronic gadget where one can see neither one's signature nor what it relates to. </p> <p>Parcel Force will not accept a manuscript signature: if I do not sign, it returns the parcel to the sender. In all my 85-and-three-quarter years I have never signed anything without seeing what it was.<br><strong>PJ, Crediton </strong> </p> <p>Parcel Force says you ought to be able to see your signature, and the number of parcels you sign for, on the handheld computer as the text is larger than on the old printed sheets. If you have a problem seeing the writing, ask the driver to adjust the contrast on the screen. </p> <p>Before you sign, the driver swipes the barcode on the parcel on to this gadget and types in your name. Your signature matches up with that information, which the driver transmits back to the central computer. </p> <p>During transmission, the information is encrypted so your details are kept secure. No one can intercept the message or copy your signature. </p> <p><strong> Foreign banking: Can Tessa travel?</strong></p> <p> I have a Tessa with Bank of Ireland but, after reading about the difficulties of closing overseas savings accounts when someone dies, I wonder if I should move it when it matures. I do not want my family to pay charges to access my money after I die.<br><strong>AF, Motherwell </strong> </p> <p>You will not have a problem with Irish accounts.

In 1977 we suffered subsidence, and the back of the house was underpinned. I declared this on the proposal form, but Norwich Union asked for an engineer's report. The structural engineers we commissioned advised us to go through the motions of making a new claim, so Eagle Star would send a loss adjuster. Our engineer just inspected the property visually, but the loss adjuster dug holes and took soil samples. Both told us they could find no evidence of any further subsidence, but the written reports were so carefully worded, in order not to commit anyone, that Norwich Union would not accept us. We appear to be stuck with Eagle Star, which refuses to reduce the premium. MC, West Kirby You have been given appallingly bad advice by your own engineer, which has left you worse off than before. You might think that, because there was no new subsidence, you have a clean bill of health which is attractive to other, cheaper insurers. But making a false claim has done the opposite. Even though this recent claim was a dummy, it counts as a real claim on your file. Although Eagle Star did not have the expense of structural repairs, it had to pay \u00a31,000 for the loss adjuster's survey. Whenever you apply for building insurance in future you must now declare a second subsidence claim in 2000. There is no point explaining to a new insurer that it was only a mock claim because that makes you look dishonest. The second claim does not increase your Eagle Star premiums, but you'll be unlikely to get another insurer to take you on with two subsidence claims on your record. You should complain to the engineer about this bad advice and, if that gets you nowhere, contact his trade association. Transfer value: Members only I took out a Scottish Life endowment policy with my Halifax mortgage in 1986. In 1994, I paid off the mortgage but kept the policy going, and it was reassigned to me. I've been paying into the policy for 14 years and it has been in my name for the past seven, yet Scottish Life says I do not qualify as a member and will not qualify for \u00a3500 compensation if the proposed transfer to Royal London takes place. MH, Birmingham Norwich Union, Scottish Widows, Scottish Amicable and Scottish Equitable paid benefits to mortgage endowment policyholders when they demutualised. Scottish Provident and Friends Provident will when they convert later this year. Yet Scottish Life policyholders lose membership when a policy is assigned to a lender and cannot be reinstated. The insurer acknowledges that its rules are unusual, saying this was deliberately done when it mutualised in 1968 to repel approaching asset strippers. Some Scottish Life customers benefit from the oddity: unlike other demutualisations, those with non-profit and unit-linked policies and both holders in joint-life policies are treated as members, assuming the policies have not been used as security for a mortgage. Scottish Life could allow policyholders to vote for a rule change but those with an assigned policy are not members, so cannot vote; the rest would be voting to dilute their own payouts. But it is not all bad news. Your policy will earn extra bonuses on demutualisation, worth around \u00a33,500. Service contract: Cooking with gas In January, I realised that I had not had my annual British Gas 3-star service check for 1999/ 2000. The documentation said it would be arranged by British Gas. I was offered a \u00a330 refund but only as a discount on next year's contract. PS, Banstead British Gas confirms that it takes responsibility for contacting customers to arrange the annual service, but admits some fall through the net. In compensation, the company is sending you a cheque for \u00a360, double the original offer. It will treat the service you eventually arranged in January as last year's missed visit and will give you another service next November. Mail order: Sign of the times I cannot get to the shops and often buy by mail. Recently Parcel Force made me sign on an electronic gadget where one can see neither one's signature nor what it relates to. Parcel Force will not accept a manuscript signature: if I do not sign, it returns the parcel to the sender. In all my 85-and-three-quarter years I have never signed anything without seeing what it was. PJ, Crediton Parcel Force says you ought to be able to see your signature, and the number of parcels you sign for, on the handheld computer as the text is larger than on the old printed sheets. If you have a problem seeing the writing, ask the driver to adjust the contrast on the screen. Before you sign, the driver swipes the barcode on the parcel on to this gadget and types in your name. Your signature matches up with that information, which the driver transmits back to the central computer. During transmission, the information is encrypted so your details are kept secure. No one can intercept the message or copy your signature. Foreign banking: Can Tessa travel? I have a Tessa with Bank of Ireland but, after reading about the difficulties of closing overseas savings accounts when someone dies, I wonder if I should move it when it matures. I do not want my family to pay charges to access my money after I die. AF, Motherwell You will not have a problem with Irish accounts. Bank of Ireland says there are no charges for closing any of its accounts when an overseas customer dies. If your total estate is less than \u00a35,000, your executors do not need to produce letters of administration or, in England and Wales, probate. Tessas are a UK-only product (Bank of Ireland's is based here) so the issue does not even arise. \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

After the April 1991 flotation there were four board meetings before his death, during which directors allowed him to walk all over them.

Of the \u00a3250m raised by the MGN flotation, \u00a3210m went to pay off debt, \u00a318m to Maxwell, \u00a39m to advisers and just \u00a37.5m to the newspaper group. </p> <p><strong>Crimes and punishments</strong></p> <p>What happened to whom in the Maxwell saga </p> <p> <strong>Kevin and Ian Maxwell</strong><br>Acquitted unanimously of fraud in a Serious Fraud Office-led trial in 1996.

Stoney was later thrown out of the accountancy profession. </p> <p> <strong> Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte</strong><br> The Mirror Group and Maxwell's auditor - now part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers - was censured and fined \u00a31.2 million by the Accountants' Joint Disciplinary Tribunal.

He was 'motivated by the very large profits that he perceived would be made ... the resulting trading relationship was very profitable for Goldman Sachs [\u00a38m from MCC shares and \u00a315m from other trades].' Senior Goldman management must have known the tycoon was behind overseas buying by Liechtenstein trusts, but did not tell the regulators, they added. In all, Maxwell spent \u00a3344m vainly propping up MGN and MCC shares. Of the \u00a3250m raised by the MGN flotation, \u00a3210m went to pay off debt, \u00a318m to Maxwell, \u00a39m to advisers and just \u00a37.5m to the newspaper group. Crimes and punishments What happened to whom in the Maxwell saga Kevin and Ian Maxwell Acquitted unanimously of fraud in a Serious Fraud Office-led trial in 1996. A judge also ruled that a second proposed criminal trial against Kevin Maxwell would be unfair and not in the public interest. Larry Trachtenberg, Albert Fuller, Robert Bunn and Michael Stoney All four of Captain Bob's key finance men were also acquitted following the 'not guilty' verdicts in the first trial. Stoney was later thrown out of the accountancy profession. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte The Mirror Group and Maxwell's auditor - now part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers - was censured and fined \u00a31.2 million by the Accountants' Joint Disciplinary Tribunal. Even with \u00a32.1m of costs, the penalty was a fraction of the estimated \u00a321m CLD earned from Maxwell from 1988. Paid \u00a368m out-of-court to settle claims by administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC). Goldman Sachs Dealt for Maxwell in Mirror and MCC shares, and was fined \u00a3160,000 in June 1993 by the Securities and Futures Authority for breaches of regulatory rules. Again the fine represented only a fraction of its profits from Maxwell. Invesco MIM City fund manager, now part of Amvescap, found to have breached rules in share transfers from the Maxwell pension funds. Was fined \u00a3750,000 with the addition of \u00a31.6m costs. Lehman Brothers et al Nikko, Capel Cure Myers, Morgan Grenfell and NatWest Investment Management: Further City firms found guilty of breaches of the rules concerning dealings with Maxwell pension funds and subsequently fined \u00a3800,000 from 1994-96.",

      "trailText": "<p>Oliver Morgan on how union hopes for a retraining lifeline were raised, then dashed, by the steelmaker</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At about 5pm last Monday Michael Leahy, general secretary of the ISTC steel union, took a call at his Gray's Inn Road office. To his left sat a bronze bust of Nye Bevan, Welsh firebrand and hero of the 'Old' Labour left. </p> <p>On the line was Stephen Byers, Trade and Industry Secretary and member of the Blairite right. Leahy was desperate for the implausible - New Labour backing an Old Labour cause: state aid for steel jobs. Byers had good news. He would support a plan proposing subsidies for retraining 6,000 workers threatened in a restructuring package by steel giant Corus through the European Commission. </p> <p>This was a triumph. Government backing was a crucial piece in a complicated jigsaw Leahy and the ISTC high command were constructing to save jobs. </p> <p>To help gain Byers' support he had even commissioned Cherie Blair to map a legal route through the Brussels jungle and overcome DTI scepticism. 'Keeping it in the family,' he had said the week before when he handed over the legal opinion to Byers. </p> <p>With this in his back pocket, Leahy prepared for a crunch meeting the next morning with Corus's top executives, led by the phlegmatic Sir Brian Moffat. </p> <p>Byers had also placed a call to Moffat, but the reception was different. A furious Moffat called Byers' actions 'outrageous' and 'blatant electioneering'. Moffat was not about to change his view that the domestic market for carbon steel was in decline. To pretend his cutbacks were unnecessary would be a 'cruel hoax'. At 10am on Tuesday a union delegation arrived at Corus's Great Marlborough Street HQ in London's West End. Leahy was accompanied by his trusted lieutenant - pipe-smoking Irishman Eddie Lynch - and four ISTC members. Together with Bob Shannon, steel negotiator of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, and officials from the MSF, GMB and T&amp;G, Leahy plotted tactics. </p> <p>The unions' Plan A, costed at up to \u00a390 million, was to cut hours at threatened plants, with training packages when workers were off shift funded by the Government, Corus and the union. The key was to ensure that Corus rethought its plans on job and plant cuts, while waiting to see if demand rose. Plan B was a smaller \u00a311m retraining package that would have accepted massive redundancies and closures. </p> <p>At the same time Moffat and his executives - Tony Pedder, head of strip products, Alan Johnson, head of personnel, and divisional chief Chris Hollick - were deciding their line. At 11am the two sides met in the fifth-floor boardroom. </p> <p>On 1 February, the 6,000 losses had been announced peremptorily, and on 14 February Corus curtly agreed to give unions time to come up with alternatives. On 8 March the Llanwern plan was secretly discarded by managing director Nick Cragg. Similar rejections followed for other plants, all well before the 27 March deadline for discussions. </p> <p>Had the atmosphere now changed? 'Before, they were not prepared to listen, even though they said they would,' said one union man. 'This time Moffat was more engaged, asking questions. To be frank, I don't think they had anticipated Byers backing our plans.' </p> <p>There was little warmth, however, and unions knew Moffat was not a man for Damascene conversions. 'We felt we were not going to change his position through force of argument. But Moffat, though he gives little away, seemed a little less sure of his position. They were in a box, they had come under enormous political, community and media pressure... they realised they had to listen.' </p> <p>In fact Moffat probed hard. He observed the unions were proposing capacity cuts at Llanwern from 3 million tonnes to 1 million. How was he going to manage the plant, with employees who were not working because of the cut rubbing shoulders with others still working flat out. Who was to pay for it? </p> <p>At midday the meeting adjourned for an hour. When they reconvened, Corus said it still wanted wide-scale redundancies, but Leahy and Shannon said this was unacceptable. Then came what looked like a breakthrough. Corus agreed to revisit the issue, and to a tripartite working party to pilot the in-work training package through the EU with government and the unions. </p> <p>Both sides agreed to a joint statement saying that although capacity reductions were inevitable, a working party would be set up. After four hours, the meeting ended. Compared with previous discussions, this seemed like progress. The unions were jubilant, talking of a turning point. They had until mid-May to hammer out proposals. </p> <p>But the next day newspapers carried reports that Corus's position had not budged. The unions were angry, believing Corus had reneged. But, a Corus spokesman told The Observer: 'It was always going to be the case that there would be different nuances in the way the agreement was presented.' Corus says the restructuring package was not renegotiated at the meeting, and attention focused on keeping people on the Corus payroll after plant closures while retraining them. </p> <p>The all-round acceptance of capacity cuts in the statement was the wrinkle Corus needed to hold its position. The City was pleased: Corus shares rose. DTI officials were not surprised. 'We are very sceptical about what Corus will do. Perhaps they were worried about strikes (threatened by Leahy when local plans were rejected) , which led them to be positive during the talks.' </p> <p>Leahy said last Wednesday: 'This is very upsetting for us. It appears they are double-talking and briefing the financial press because they are concerned with shareholders and their bankers rather than their workers and communities. It is very different to the meeting. We would not have signed up to that joint statement if nothing had changed.' So, what happens next? For Byers the next flashpoint will fall conveniently after an election (assuming it is held on 3 May). </p> <p>As for Corus, cynics believe last Tuesday only underlines its determination to press ahead, while acknowledging it has to avoid further public relations embarrassments.

      "bodyText": "At about 5pm last Monday Michael Leahy, general secretary of the ISTC steel union, took a call at his Gray's Inn Road office. To his left sat a bronze bust of Nye Bevan, Welsh firebrand and hero of the 'Old' Labour left. On the line was Stephen Byers, Trade and Industry Secretary and member of the Blairite right. Leahy was desperate for the implausible - New Labour backing an Old Labour cause: state aid for steel jobs. Byers had good news. He would support a plan proposing subsidies for retraining 6,000 workers threatened in a restructuring package by steel giant Corus through the European Commission. This was a triumph. Government backing was a crucial piece in a complicated jigsaw Leahy and the ISTC high command were constructing to save jobs. To help gain Byers' support he had even commissioned Cherie Blair to map a legal route through the Brussels jungle and overcome DTI scepticism. 'Keeping it in the family,' he had said the week before when he handed over the legal opinion to Byers. With this in his back pocket, Leahy prepared for a crunch meeting the next morning with Corus's top executives, led by the phlegmatic Sir Brian Moffat. Byers had also placed a call to Moffat, but the reception was different. A furious Moffat called Byers' actions 'outrageous' and 'blatant electioneering'. Moffat was not about to change his view that the domestic market for carbon steel was in decline. To pretend his cutbacks were unnecessary would be a 'cruel hoax'. At 10am on Tuesday a union delegation arrived at Corus's Great Marlborough Street HQ in London's West End. Leahy was accompanied by his trusted lieutenant - pipe-smoking Irishman Eddie Lynch - and four ISTC members. Together with Bob Shannon, steel negotiator of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, and officials from the MSF, GMB and T&amp;G, Leahy plotted tactics. The unions' Plan A, costed at up to \u00a390 million, was to cut hours at threatened plants, with training packages when workers were off shift funded by the Government, Corus and the union. The key was to ensure that Corus rethought its plans on job and plant cuts, while waiting to see if demand rose. Plan B was a smaller \u00a311m retraining package that would have accepted massive redundancies and closures. At the same time Moffat and his executives - Tony Pedder, head of strip products, Alan Johnson, head of personnel, and divisional chief Chris Hollick - were deciding their line. At 11am the two sides met in the fifth-floor boardroom. On 1 February, the 6,000 losses had been announced peremptorily, and on 14 February Corus curtly agreed to give unions time to come up with alternatives. On 8 March the Llanwern plan was secretly discarded by managing director Nick Cragg. Similar rejections followed for other plants, all well before the 27 March deadline for discussions. Had the atmosphere now changed? 'Before, they were not prepared to listen, even though they said they would,' said one union man. 'This time Moffat was more engaged, asking questions. To be frank, I don't think they had anticipated Byers backing our plans.' There was little warmth, however, and unions knew Moffat was not a man for Damascene conversions. 'We felt we were not going to change his position through force of argument. But Moffat, though he gives little away, seemed a little less sure of his position. They were in a box, they had come under enormous political, community and media pressure... they realised they had to listen.' In fact Moffat probed hard. He observed the unions were proposing capacity cuts at Llanwern from 3 million tonnes to 1 million. How was he going to manage the plant, with employees who were not working because of the cut rubbing shoulders with others still working flat out. Who was to pay for it? At midday the meeting adjourned for an hour. When they reconvened, Corus said it still wanted wide-scale redundancies, but Leahy and Shannon said this was unacceptable. Then came what looked like a breakthrough. Corus agreed to revisit the issue, and to a tripartite working party to pilot the in-work training package through the EU with government and the unions. Both sides agreed to a joint statement saying that although capacity reductions were inevitable, a working party would be set up. After four hours, the meeting ended. Compared with previous discussions, this seemed like progress. The unions were jubilant, talking of a turning point. They had until mid-May to hammer out proposals. But the next day newspapers carried reports that Corus's position had not budged. The unions were angry, believing Corus had reneged. But, a Corus spokesman told The Observer: 'It was always going to be the case that there would be different nuances in the way the agreement was presented.' Corus says the restructuring package was not renegotiated at the meeting, and attention focused on keeping people on the Corus payroll after plant closures while retraining them. The all-round acceptance of capacity cuts in the statement was the wrinkle Corus needed to hold its position. The City was pleased: Corus shares rose. DTI officials were not surprised. 'We are very sceptical about what Corus will do. Perhaps they were worried about strikes (threatened by Leahy when local plans were rejected) , which led them to be positive during the talks.' Leahy said last Wednesday: 'This is very upsetting for us. It appears they are double-talking and briefing the financial press because they are concerned with shareholders and their bankers rather than their workers and communities. It is very different to the meeting. We would not have signed up to that joint statement if nothing had changed.' So, what happens next? For Byers the next flashpoint will fall conveniently after an election (assuming it is held on 3 May). As for Corus, cynics believe last Tuesday only underlines its determination to press ahead, while acknowledging it has to avoid further public relations embarrassments. But the unions must continue to hope that there will be agreement to a retraining package by both Corus and Brussels. That would give them perhaps another year to talk in the hope of salvation. Whatever happens, the meeting won't happen in Great Marlborough Street. Corus is moving out. Cost cutting, apparently. Key Dates February 1 Corus announces plant closures and 6,050 job losses.

It is clear that Sir George doesn't mix with regulars at the Pitcher &amp; Piano too much on his sojourns in the capital. </p> <p>'I would have to be working for 25 years to earn that,' said Otto Dresel, a bar manager enjoying a lager with barista Brad Callaghan. 'I'd be impressed by that,' Brad adds, before asking how much Mathewson earns in a normal year. </p> <p>The Observer consults the company's 1999 accounts, the latest year available. '\u00a3836,000,' the two are told. 'Well as he's not that short of money why doesn't he redistribute it?' Otto asks. Very boho Soho. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the bar, though, avarice has a friend. 'I'd like to meet his wife,' says Paul Barratt, a television producer. Why? 'Because she'll get all his money,' he says, sinisterly. </p> <p>The upmarket, fashionable Caf\u00e9 Boh\u00e8me is bitterly divided. John Laycock, the general manager, does a few sums and concludes: 'I'd have to do 9,600 double shifts to earn that. I reckon he's doing all right. What did he get it for?' His bank bought another bank, The Observer explains. 'Well if we went and bought Bar Soho next door I don't think there's any chance I'd get a bonus,' Laycock says ruefully. </p> <p>'It's offensive to belittle money. Even \u00a31 is a lot to someone with none,' argues Peter Bach, another TV producer. 'It seems like a great deal to me,' says Lucy Clay, who works in post production. </p> <p>'But does he get any job satisfaction?' asks Dichon LeVinse, a scriptwriter. 'People in the arts do it because they love it.' Costas Alexakis, who works for Nova Scotia bank and is from Greece, said: 'There aren't huge bonuses in Greece. You'd expect some bonuses in banking but not to this extent.' </p> <p>But the Mathewson camp is bolstered by support from James Wilkins, an e-security consultant with accountant KPMG.

When the adverts that do run include a mini talk show where the head of stockbroking firm Charles Schwab seeks to soothe jumpy investors, it's clear the problem is becoming very serious. </p> <p>The investment banks are also getting involved. In full-page ads headlined 'The storm before the calm', Merrill Lynch tells Americans that 'our research analysts expect the market to rally this spring'. If bankers and brokers are trying to reinvigorate investor confidence through applied psychology, they are not alone.

When the adverts that do run include a mini talk show where the head of stockbroking firm Charles Schwab seeks to soothe jumpy investors, it's clear the problem is becoming very serious. The investment banks are also getting involved. In full-page ads headlined 'The storm before the calm', Merrill Lynch tells Americans that 'our research analysts expect the market to rally this spring'. If bankers and brokers are trying to reinvigorate investor confidence through applied psychology, they are not alone.

      "body": "<p>Thirteen months to the day after he arrived at Baker Street, Marks &amp; Spencer chairman Luc Vandevelde has admitted what customers have known for years: the group is in desperate trouble. But will the package of measures announced last week be enough to save it? </p> <p>Everything he proposes is eminently sensible. The European stores are not just losing money, they are a positive distraction from the main issue of getting British sales moving in the right direction. Closing them is the only option. </p> <p>The US businesses may be profitable but they are some way from making a decent return on investment. The old management would doubtless have sold them already had it not been for the embarrassment of having to take a huge loss on them. </p> <p>M&amp;S is a retailer, not a property company, so it does not make sense to have billions tied up in property assets. A sale and leaseback of half of them is a good start to managing the business more efficiently. </p> <p>Likewise, the proposals for the high street business sound sensible. M&amp;S desperately needs to regain its old strength in supplying quality classics at reasonable prices, rather than high fashion. Its stores need to shed their dowdy image. </p> <p>Vandevelde - not to mention his predecessor Sir Richard Greenbury and erstwhile chief executive Peter Salsbury - have long stressed the importance of getting the clothing offer right again. But none of them has been able to do it. </p> <p>Indeed, things keep on getting worse. The 6.5 per cent fall in sales for the nine weeks to 24 March - rising to 7.7 per cent after adjustment for Mother's Day - is worse than it has been since Vandevelde took over. </p> <p>The much-vaunted store revamps have failed to impress customers and even the limited refurbishments that are now planned will cover only 120 stores by the year end. </p> <p>Roger Holmes, recruited as head of the UK retail business at the start of the year, may have been the catalyst for the change in strategy but he, too, has yet to show that he can fill the stores with decent merchandise at the right price. </p> <p>His background may be at B&amp;Q-to-Comet group Kingfisher, but he is still regarded as more of a management consultant than a retailer. </p> <p>On the positive side, however, the group has recruited Yasmin Yusuf, lauded as one of the brightest talents in British retailing, and George Davies, who founded Next and is the brains behind Asda's popular clothing ranges. </p> <p>Analysts remain sceptical about the chances of it succeeding, but investors were impressed enough to mark the shares up again, leaving them at a premium to the sector. The group now has a strategy but, to justify the premium, the strategy has to work. Wait for evidence before you buy. </p> <p><strong> Not so cheerful</strong><br> </p> <p> Stakeholder pensions will become available for the first time on Friday. Take-up is expected to be slow and most pundits predict that the Government will have to make them compulsory to have much of an impact on retirement provision. </p> <p>Even so, Deutsche Bank predicts that, by 2011, the pensions market will be worth \u00a3103 billion, up from \u00a346bn in 1999, of which 48 per cent will be stakeholders. </p> <p>Stakeholder pensions have to be simple, transparent and, above all, cheap - charges are a maximum of 1 per cent.

      "bodyText": "Thirteen months to the day after he arrived at Baker Street, Marks &amp; Spencer chairman Luc Vandevelde has admitted what customers have known for years: the group is in desperate trouble. But will the package of measures announced last week be enough to save it? Everything he proposes is eminently sensible. The European stores are not just losing money, they are a positive distraction from the main issue of getting British sales moving in the right direction. Closing them is the only option. The US businesses may be profitable but they are some way from making a decent return on investment. The old management would doubtless have sold them already had it not been for the embarrassment of having to take a huge loss on them. M&amp;S is a retailer, not a property company, so it does not make sense to have billions tied up in property assets. A sale and leaseback of half of them is a good start to managing the business more efficiently. Likewise, the proposals for the high street business sound sensible. M&amp;S desperately needs to regain its old strength in supplying quality classics at reasonable prices, rather than high fashion. Its stores need to shed their dowdy image. Vandevelde - not to mention his predecessor Sir Richard Greenbury and erstwhile chief executive Peter Salsbury - have long stressed the importance of getting the clothing offer right again. But none of them has been able to do it. Indeed, things keep on getting worse. The 6.5 per cent fall in sales for the nine weeks to 24 March - rising to 7.7 per cent after adjustment for Mother's Day - is worse than it has been since Vandevelde took over. The much-vaunted store revamps have failed to impress customers and even the limited refurbishments that are now planned will cover only 120 stores by the year end. Roger Holmes, recruited as head of the UK retail business at the start of the year, may have been the catalyst for the change in strategy but he, too, has yet to show that he can fill the stores with decent merchandise at the right price. His background may be at B&amp;Q-to-Comet group Kingfisher, but he is still regarded as more of a management consultant than a retailer. On the positive side, however, the group has recruited Yasmin Yusuf, lauded as one of the brightest talents in British retailing, and George Davies, who founded Next and is the brains behind Asda's popular clothing ranges. Analysts remain sceptical about the chances of it succeeding, but investors were impressed enough to mark the shares up again, leaving them at a premium to the sector. The group now has a strategy but, to justify the premium, the strategy has to work. Wait for evidence before you buy. Not so cheerful Stakeholder pensions will become available for the first time on Friday. Take-up is expected to be slow and most pundits predict that the Government will have to make them compulsory to have much of an impact on retirement provision. Even so, Deutsche Bank predicts that, by 2011, the pensions market will be worth \u00a3103 billion, up from \u00a346bn in 1999, of which 48 per cent will be stakeholders. Stakeholder pensions have to be simple, transparent and, above all, cheap - charges are a maximum of 1 per cent. For companies used to being featherbedded with high charges and cost loading that will come as a shock - and the effect will not be confined to stakeholder products. The arrival of cheap stakeholder pensions will put pressure on other products, which will look very expensive in comparison with cheap stakeholders. That effect is already being seen - margins at most life companies are falling. Britannic and Prudential have decided they can no longer afford their expensive door-to-door salesforces. Some - Legal &amp; General, CGNU and Prudential among them - have been working hard to position themselves for the new era. L&amp;G has linked with Alliance &amp; Leicester, Barclays and the Forum for Private Businesses; the Pru has links with unions and chambers of commerce. All are making heavy use of the internet, not just to sell the products but to help us track how much our pensions are worth, where they are invested and what would happen if we decided to retire early or increased our contributions. The hope is that these links will allow them to sell enough pensions to make them profitable, even at this cutthroat charging level. In all, 40 companies have registered an interest in selling stakeholder pensions. Even if all of them do, it is unlikely they will all be around in 10 years' time. L&amp;G predicts that, eventually, there will be only five to 10 serious players left. It intends to be one of them. Indeed, David Prosser, L&amp;G's chief executive, has staked his reputation on the promise to maintain double- digit returns to shareholders, despite falling margins on products. Insurance accounting is so opaque that it will take years before the impact on profits of the stakeholder pensions is clear. But buyers would be wise to bet on the best-prepared, such as L&amp;G , Pru and CGNU. Softly, softly Even allowing for the fact that we have a bear market, this has been a bad couple of months for software companies such as Logica and CMG. Both have seen their shares fall by around 40 per cent since February, when investors started to fret that their predictions for growth in the mobile phone industry were not quite as exciting as they seemed. The whizzy messaging and other communications services that are so key to CMG and Logica's valuations may not, therefore, be quite as exciting as the market had hoped. On the face of it, the share price collapse has left them looking reasonable value. Logica, for example, once again stands on a price-earnings ratio of around three times the market average - not bad given that analysts are forecasting earnings growth of up to 25 per cent for the next two years. The trouble is, there is a big risk that these forecasts will not be met given the speed of the slowdown in telecoms demand. If earnings growth slows, the prop for the premium valuation disappears.
