There's surely no way back to the England team now for Lewis, who got a taste of how low his stock had sunk when he was booed from the field after being run out for 0 for Leicestershire against Lancashire on Monday. The two-division County Championship, which starts today, should have been his chance to remind the selectors and the public that he is not a spent force, but in fact a better all rounder than Craig White, who has been given an England contract. I wonder about Lewis\u00d5s state of mind, especially given his short and ill-advised strike to protest his treatment by Lord MacLaurin and co. For Clairmonte Christopher Lewis, the season looks over before it's properly begun. </p> <p>Lewis has been accused time and again of not delivering the goods for England. It's a cruel irony that, as he tells it, a bent bookie asked him literally to deliver. The ECB should take a leaf out of the book of the South Africans, who acted swiftly in the case of Hansie Cronje. The three players should immediately be summoned to a hearing along with Lewis. The board should then clear up the question of whether he did make the same allegations last year. If the evidence he presents is credible, they should consider suspending the players pending a full investigation. This in turn should be part of a wider inquiry by the ICC into a) the extent to which bookies pay players for information on pitch conditions and the like, and b) the extent of real match-fixing. We know match-fixing is illegal and players who are found guilty should be banned for life. Tough, uniform new penalties should be introduced for taking payment from bookmakers. It's not criminal, but it tarnishes the sport. </p> <p>The way it looks, for the moment anyway, is that West Indies appear to be the only one of the major cricketing nations untouched by the whole affair. But it's unlikely that the bookies would have approached the likes of Cronje, Shane Warne, Mark Waugh and, apparently, several Pakistanis and not done the same to West Indies players. When I spoke with Clive Lloyd shortly after the Cronje story broke, he told me that to his knowledge none of his players was approached while he was captain or manager (a job he held until a few months ago). He was sure the players would have told him and in any case, he told me confidently, he was sure such approaches would have been dismissed out of hand. Lloyd is certain the drip-drip of allegations and revelations \"is destroying the game of cricket\", and is in favour of the ICC holding a full and wide-ranging investigation. </p> <p>How might a player get tapped? Functions such as sponsors' parties and receptions are now important off-field activities for the players, and Lloyd believes it is not that hard to get their mobile phone numbers. Journalists routinely get the their numbers that way. Unfortunately, it seems we're not the only ones who can. I'm less confident than Clive that everyone who might have approached a player would have been shooed away. Cricketers earn very little compared to other professional sportsmen. Shane Warne will take home \u00a3750,000 after his season with Hampshire, but most of that will be in sponsorship. Footballers at the low end of the pay scale in the English Premiership can earn close to half-a-million a year. A footballer who has as much stature as Warne in his game can expect to earn at least five times that. And let's not even talk about what basketball players earn in the NBA. The point is that cricketers are sensitive to issues of pay, as the Windies players showed when they almost wrecked their tour of South Africa before it started 18 months ago, with their Heathrow stand-off. When they finally did face Cronje's men, they lost the Test series 5-0 and the one-day series 6-1. Yeah, I know what you'd be thinking now: how did they win that one match when they were so mind-numbingly awful throughout the tour? I thought and still think Cronje's captaincy was a great example of ruthlessly, even chillingly, professional leadership. His opponents had even begun to inspire pity, but he never let up. As Indian investigators compile their dossier on him, Cronje can point to those matches in his defence. </p> <p><em>Orin Gordon, born and brought up in Guyana, has lived in London for five years and currently works as a broadcast journalist.

      "trailText": "<p><strong> Crucial credentials</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Crucial credentials</strong></p> <p>British Airways has found its new chief pilot in Rod Eddington. The 50 year-old Australian might be flying in from an airline few BA customers will have heard of, but he has a rock-solid reputation. </p> <p>He is intelligent - a Rhodes scholar no less - experienced in the airline world, having run Cathay Pacific and Ansett, the Australian airline, well-connected - a friend of Rupert Murdoch - and perhaps more crucially, has people-management skills - that is, he fires staff nicely. </p> <p>Unlike his predecessor Bob Ayling, who was distracted by ventures such as the Millennium Wheel, Mr Eddington is said to have a \"down-to-earth\" manner and conciliatory management skills. </p> <p>Lord Marshall, the BA chairman, made it clear that the latter were crucial credentials for Mr Ayling's replacement, partly because Mr Eddington will have to live with most of the processes put in place before his arrival on May 1. For instance, orders for smaller planes, implemented as part of the plan to cut 12% of capacity over the next three years, are almost impossible to reverse. </p> <p>The move to seek out more profitable business passengers is equally irrevocable, although Mr Eddington will try to temper perceptions that the airline wants to turn away all economy passengers as a result. Even if the plans for business passengers are fulfilled, BA's proportion of \"premium\" customers will increase from 15% to 17%, hardly any thing to get excited about. But where Mr Eddington will be able to show his worth is in repairing staff morale and the airline's reputation. </p> <p>While BA refuses to confirm the figures - he is expected to axe at least 6,500 staff, around 10% and do so without alienating people by facing staff in cabins and at check-ins. By all accounts he handled ruthless cuts at Ansett, which he turned around by talking in person to the pilots who faced the axe. </p> <p>It remains to be seen whether such a direct approach will placate British union members. But Mr Eddington will have to hope it does if he is to start winning the confidence of BA staff. If progress can be made at the most basic level, BA will be looking for positive reaction in its languishing share price. </p> <p>But cost-cutting and morale boosting is only part of the problem: generating profits is in the game, too. While Mr Eddington pushed Ansett from a loss to profit it meant revenue growth of just 6% in the turnaround period. BA investors will be looking for more rapid growth, and if he achieves it they might let him reward himself in the way other foreign chief executives expect to be compensated - with huge expatriate packages and share options schemes. </p> <p><strong> Renault refocus </strong><br> </p> <p> There should be joy at Renault headquarters today. The French automotive group has finally tied up an alliance with Volvo, even if the shape is very different from the original proposal for a full-scale marriage, long before Volvo sold its car business to Ford, which was wrecked by Swedish shareholder opposition a few years ago. </p> <p>To be fair the latest scheme does not look too bad for Volvo either, and will certainly give any lurking predators something to think about. But it is clearly a second-best option after the Swedish group's plans to merge with Scania were thwarted by the Brussels competition authorities. </p> <p>For its part, Renault gets a 15% stake in a truck business which must have a fair chance of establishing a competitive position in a fast changing industry. Most important, Renault will now be able to devote its full attention to its car business, rather than its focus being weakened by the needs of a truck business that on its own was well short of being a global player. It will need to. Renault has played what seemed a poor hand very well and now appears a much beefier player - and its financial performance has improved dramatically. </p> <p>The Nissan deal last year gave it a strong foothold in what will be a crucial market when the Japanese economy revives. Now it has the green light for buying into South Korea through Samsung Motors. The Pusan plant will give Renault a splendid manufacturing facility in a market that is expected to recover its pre-crisis capacity. Spotting opportunities is one thing, making them pay another. Renault was able to establish its Asian presence because its partners there had problems. Welding the parts into a whole will not be without difficulties, but it will be easier for Renault now it is able to refocus on cars. </p> <p><strong> Rover's lesson </strong><br> </p> <p> Politicians have fired their heavy artillery in a late attempt to save Rover but have not dented BMW's plans. They will claim to have done their best. This may reduce some of the inevitable flak when thousands lose their jobs, but it will not inspire confidence among Ford's workers at Dagenham.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Crucial credentials British Airways has found its new chief pilot in Rod Eddington. The 50 year-old Australian might be flying in from an airline few BA customers will have heard of, but he has a rock-solid reputation. He is intelligent - a Rhodes scholar no less - experienced in the airline world, having run Cathay Pacific and Ansett, the Australian airline, well-connected - a friend of Rupert Murdoch - and perhaps more crucially, has people-management skills - that is, he fires staff nicely. Unlike his predecessor Bob Ayling, who was distracted by ventures such as the Millennium Wheel, Mr Eddington is said to have a \"down-to-earth\" manner and conciliatory management skills. Lord Marshall, the BA chairman, made it clear that the latter were crucial credentials for Mr Ayling's replacement, partly because Mr Eddington will have to live with most of the processes put in place before his arrival on May 1. For instance, orders for smaller planes, implemented as part of the plan to cut 12% of capacity over the next three years, are almost impossible to reverse. The move to seek out more profitable business passengers is equally irrevocable, although Mr Eddington will try to temper perceptions that the airline wants to turn away all economy passengers as a result. Even if the plans for business passengers are fulfilled, BA's proportion of \"premium\" customers will increase from 15% to 17%, hardly any thing to get excited about. But where Mr Eddington will be able to show his worth is in repairing staff morale and the airline's reputation. While BA refuses to confirm the figures - he is expected to axe at least 6,500 staff, around 10% and do so without alienating people by facing staff in cabins and at check-ins. By all accounts he handled ruthless cuts at Ansett, which he turned around by talking in person to the pilots who faced the axe. It remains to be seen whether such a direct approach will placate British union members. But Mr Eddington will have to hope it does if he is to start winning the confidence of BA staff. If progress can be made at the most basic level, BA will be looking for positive reaction in its languishing share price. But cost-cutting and morale boosting is only part of the problem: generating profits is in the game, too. While Mr Eddington pushed Ansett from a loss to profit it meant revenue growth of just 6% in the turnaround period. BA investors will be looking for more rapid growth, and if he achieves it they might let him reward himself in the way other foreign chief executives expect to be compensated - with huge expatriate packages and share options schemes. Renault refocus There should be joy at Renault headquarters today. The French automotive group has finally tied up an alliance with Volvo, even if the shape is very different from the original proposal for a full-scale marriage, long before Volvo sold its car business to Ford, which was wrecked by Swedish shareholder opposition a few years ago. To be fair the latest scheme does not look too bad for Volvo either, and will certainly give any lurking predators something to think about. But it is clearly a second-best option after the Swedish group's plans to merge with Scania were thwarted by the Brussels competition authorities. For its part, Renault gets a 15% stake in a truck business which must have a fair chance of establishing a competitive position in a fast changing industry. Most important, Renault will now be able to devote its full attention to its car business, rather than its focus being weakened by the needs of a truck business that on its own was well short of being a global player. It will need to. Renault has played what seemed a poor hand very well and now appears a much beefier player - and its financial performance has improved dramatically. The Nissan deal last year gave it a strong foothold in what will be a crucial market when the Japanese economy revives. Now it has the green light for buying into South Korea through Samsung Motors. The Pusan plant will give Renault a splendid manufacturing facility in a market that is expected to recover its pre-crisis capacity. Spotting opportunities is one thing, making them pay another. Renault was able to establish its Asian presence because its partners there had problems. Welding the parts into a whole will not be without difficulties, but it will be easier for Renault now it is able to refocus on cars. Rover's lesson Politicians have fired their heavy artillery in a late attempt to save Rover but have not dented BMW's plans. They will claim to have done their best. This may reduce some of the inevitable flak when thousands lose their jobs, but it will not inspire confidence among Ford's workers at Dagenham.",

It also diversifies their investment portfolio and increases liquidity. </p> <p>\"The perception about Silicon Valley is that the huge equity positions held by founders in their own start-ups translate into an immediate cash position for these individuals at the initial public offering -when in fact the opposite is often true,\" said Bashir Wada, managing director of eFounders. \"Company founders can sometimes wait years to benefit from the stock they hold in their own companies; eFounders was created to provide and innovative means for founders to invest and diversify their personal equity, and seek out financial products and services that have been unavailable until now.\" </p> <p>Mr Wada's company plans to offer a range of personal finance products and services to entrepreneurs signing up to the scheme, and eFounders plans to take take 20% of profits after initial return of capital. </p> <p>Mr Wada said that an experimental fund that was set up 18 months ago, Entrepreneurs Diversification Fund 1, was so successful that it was subsequently established as a separate company. </p> <p>Analysts believe that the business model could translate to the UK and be of use to networking groups such as First Tuesday. </p> <p>Media investment specialist Durlacher is already working on plans to offer a personal finance service to entrepreneurs working in hi-tech industries who do not have the time, or often the experience, to look after their finances.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the most common complaints among internet entrepreneurs is that despite working 20-hour days and sacrificing their social lives they risk all their savings, are poorly paid and have no way of realising the value of shares that may - or may not - one day be worth a fortune. Even when their companies go public there are usually \"lock-in\" periods which prevent founders and top executives from selling their shares. But now the impoverished entrepreneurs are being offered a way of getting hold of some dot.com wealth before their own companies float on the stock market or are bought out. A San Francisco-based start-up,eFounders, has devised a scheme that allows net entrepreneurs to benefit from each other's success. It wants them to place between 5% and 10% of their personal equity in a fund along with 11 other entrepreneurs who are running companies of similar strength and valuation and chances of going public. Each time one of the partners' firms goes public, is bought or merges, everyone in the partnership benefits immediately. It also diversifies their investment portfolio and increases liquidity. \"The perception about Silicon Valley is that the huge equity positions held by founders in their own start-ups translate into an immediate cash position for these individuals at the initial public offering -when in fact the opposite is often true,\" said Bashir Wada, managing director of eFounders. \"Company founders can sometimes wait years to benefit from the stock they hold in their own companies; eFounders was created to provide and innovative means for founders to invest and diversify their personal equity, and seek out financial products and services that have been unavailable until now.\" Mr Wada's company plans to offer a range of personal finance products and services to entrepreneurs signing up to the scheme, and eFounders plans to take take 20% of profits after initial return of capital. Mr Wada said that an experimental fund that was set up 18 months ago, Entrepreneurs Diversification Fund 1, was so successful that it was subsequently established as a separate company. Analysts believe that the business model could translate to the UK and be of use to networking groups such as First Tuesday. Media investment specialist Durlacher is already working on plans to offer a personal finance service to entrepreneurs working in hi-tech industries who do not have the time, or often the experience, to look after their finances.",

He drives a BMW 740 and has just paid $4m for an acre of land in the Valley's swanky Atherton area. One female friend describes him as a \"sort of tall Al Pacino\". </p> <p>Randy is about to marry a woman he met via dating agency Kelleher &amp; Associates (slogan: \"Beautiful women want to meet Silicon Valley men\"). A \"lover of people\" who says he has been on lots of dates since arriving on the West Coast 10 years ago, Randy was nevertheless ready to pay up to $8,500 for Kelleher's services. </p> <p>\"Most people in Silicon Valley are pragmatic,\" he explains, \"and anything that saves time is good. It's all about maximising time over target. When I'm looking for a senior executive, I go to a search agency and give them my criteria. The chances of finding a long-term match are far higher with such a recruiter than if you try to do it in a scatter-gun fashion.\" </p> <p>Randy is not alone in wanting help to find a mate in Silicon Valley. The area around Palo Alto, a magnet for some of the most highly educated, highly paid people in the US, is also a mecca for matchmaking services. Ads for companies such as How About Lunch and Table For Six are constantly aired on local radio and TV networks, while other agencies leaflet entire neighbourhoods. Kelleher has almost doubled its client base in the past two years, to around 1,500. </p> <p>Last year, the American Singles dating service moved its annual convention from Anchorage to Palo Alto for the first time. The move recognised the fact that men who prospect for oil are no longer as valuable a commodity as those digging for virtual gold, but it also acknowledged the demographic and social factors that have left the most successful part of America, if not the world, one of the loneliest. </p> <p>The boom in dating services might seem odd to outsiders. Silicon Valley attracts some of the world's youngest, most dynamic people. San Francisco bars are full of twenty- and thirtysomethings at weekends, while launch parties and networking clubs such as Wildcat Wednesday attract thousands every night of the week. What's more, Silicon Valley enjoys one of the highest per capita income levels in the world, with around 64 new millionaires minted every day. </p> <p>Yet speak to these eligible men and women, and a surprising number talk of a work and wealth-obsessed culture that breeds financial and career success while keeping fun for later. Simon Levene, director of corporate development at Excite@Home, says: \"People call it the Joseph-in-Egypt phenomenon. They put up with seven years of famine and hope for seven years of plenty.\" </p> <p>There are lots of reasons for the famine in Silicon Valley, the first of which is demographic: there are simply not enough women to go round. In Palo Alto, the heart of the hi-tech machine, there are 36% more men than women - almost the reverse of figures in America as a whole, where there are 43m single women compared with 36m single men. </p> <p>Added to this statistical anomaly is the fact that the typical Valley man is not known for smoothness when it comes to the opposite sex. Think bad haircuts and an obsession with Tomb Raider. The oft-used line about dating in the Valley is that while the odds are good, the goods are odd. </p> <p>Hannah, a former comic book publisher who arrived a year ago to become a senior manager at one of the world's biggest websites, says: \"I could tell you 10 horror stories about guys I've dated here.\" The 29-year-old has been to parties where \"the geeks walk in two-by-two and sit on the floor to discuss database design\". </p> <p>American Singles fell foul of the techie nature of its target audience when it held its inaugural Valley event during Comdex, the annual convention for tech types. Hardly any men showed up to a ballroom full of women who had paid $35 a head. </p> <p>Yet demographics based on number and type go nowhere near explaining why Silicon Valley is full of singletons. Anecdotal evidence suggests nobody has any time for sex and its attendant anxieties, and Amber Kelleher confirms this. \"People fly in from all around the world. They are suddenly placed in this Valley of Competition and it's all business. Their personal lives are thrown out of the window.\" </p> <p>Kelleher &amp; Associates was founded by Amber's mother 20 years ago. Jill Kelleher is used on ads for the agency because of her resemblance to Linda Evans who played Krystle Carrington in Dynasty. The agency has witnessed several changes in that time. Until 10 years ago, new clients tended to be divorcees in their 40s and 50s; now they are more like Randy - in their early 30s and looking to settle down for the first time. \"What's happening now is that work takes precedence over relationships and people want a career before they want a family,\" Kelleher says. This Generation-X behaviour is hardly unusual, but a culture that boasts of 24/7 devotion to work intensifies the phenomenon. </p> <p> In spite of her bad experiences, Hannah fell for a \"tormented genius\" when he laughed about her company's well-publicised technical woes. She saw him \"once in a while\" for six weeks until one too many dates was cancelled because he was working all hours on a new start-up and she was too busy herself to be fitted into his schedule. \"There are so many men out here who are good on paper, who my mother would love, but when you meet someone really nice, it's impossible to find the time,\" she says. </p> <p>Randy is typical. After finishing a doctorate in electronic engineering, he worked an average of 80 hours per week for seven years. When he became CEO, he slowed down a bit to \"between 60 and 80\" hours and it was then that he realised he only ever met people to talk about work. </p> <p>\"I tend to be a pretty focused kind of person,\" he says. \"I initially focused on being successful and it was OK to date a bit. But when I felt I'd achieved my career goal, I figured I wanted somebody important to share it with.\" </p> <p>As well as the work obsession, there is a concern for wealth that rich Valley dwellers find troubling in a potential mate. Successful, available women like Hannah are in short supply. \"People talk about the gold-diggers out here,\" she says, \"but not all of them are women.\" She tells of phoning a friend of a friend to arrange a possible date. \"He asked me exactly where I worked and how long I'd been there. We carried on chatting but I could hear him clicking on his computer. A few minutes later, he told me exactly how much I must have made on my share options. We never met.\" </p> <p>An obsession with valuations can spill over into the personal sphere. Simon Levene, who is 29, says some of his peers take a very calculated approach to meeting women. \"Lots of guys want to buy their convertible Porsches before they find a girlfriend. Look, many of these men weren't necessarily successful with women at college. They weren't head of the football team. They don't mind putting that part of their lives on hold for a while in the hope that they'll do well financially and at the end of the rainbow there'll be a buxom blonde.\" </p> <p>Hannah refutes the suggestion that it is the geek factor alone that is to blame for the dearth of Valley relationships. \"Listen, I've met some of the most intelligent, interesting dudes out here. But the thing that makes them those things, the thing that makes them chase dreams in the first place, also messes them up.\" </p> <p>In this atmosphere, the apparent popularity of dating agencies does not seem so odd. Gaby Derbyshire, the English business development manager at internet company eGroups, says she laughed when she saw a dating agency leaflet land on the doormat at the home she shares with two male friends. Though they were both attractive and successful, she found it entirely believable that they may have signed up for a service. \"They are both incredibly fussy about what they want,\" she says. \"They want someone smart, not just pretty and fluffy, but they don't necessarily have the time to invest in finding someone like that.\" The leaflets turned out to be unsolicited fliers. </p> <p>In a report on the area, Business Week recently said: \"It's now 100% socially acceptable to sign up for Match.com or Matchmaker.com.\" </p> <p>Yet Randy felt the internet itself lowered the chances of meeting a partner. \"What the internet has done is disenfranchise people by increasing electronic rather than physical communication. Most people don't end up going to grocery stores any more. Silicon Valley isn't that different from the rest of the world,\" he concludes. \"People everywhere are working hard and focusing on themselves. It just gets more and more difficult to meet the right people at the same time.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Maybe it is just that early 21st century life is fuelled by caffeine, but more business meetings seem to be taking place over double tall skinny cappuccinos. In coffee shops, there are as many laptops as mugs of latte. One City firm, short on meeting rooms, is considering giving Starbucks vouchers to staff to encourage them to hold meetings off-site. Starbucks, ever alert to a new trend, have installed boardroom tables in some City outlets. On one level, this should merely serve as a warning against the Starbuckisation of society, but it also says something about the changing nature of work. </p> <p>Andrew Harrison, a partner at leading architecture firm DEGW, thinks the use of different places for meetings reflects the dispersal of the \"office\" into the city. He says firms can choose spaces that enhance their brand - trendy Soho hangouts or august art galleries - and believes the move reflects the way organisations are changing how they work. \"There are more partnerships now, the lines between companies are less clear. The great advantage of a coffee house is that it provides neutral ground and project space.\" </p> <p>The new economy - based on networks, shifting collaborations, rapid start-ups - needs new spaces and many companies and workers are finding them on their doorsteps. Just as the line between domestic and work space is being blurred, so the line between public and corporate space is harder to see. </p> <p>This trend can be seen as part of the intrusion of work into all other areas of life: the spare room, the train, now the local cafe. The idea of trying to relax with a warming cup and newspaper next to a bunch of braying executives may not appeal but on the whole, the detachment of work from the workplace is to be welcomed. For a start, any meeting is enormously improved by the addition of a decent cup of coffee and cafes avoid tiresome \"who should go to whose office\" power games. </p> <p>Most importantly, the use of non-office space for business activities can help revitalise urban areas after decades of corporate and middle-class flight. Traditionally workers trudge from car park or tube to office and back. But if they get out into their neighbourhoods, local services will reap the rewards. Cities are seizing back their mantle as centres of exchange - exchange not just of goods and services, but of ideas. Things happen in cities that can never happen in modular office blocks in suburban business parks. Meetings can happen quickly, naturally, even accidentally. </p> <p>Cafe culture tends to be associated with literary or philosophical activity, but remember that Lloyd's of London started in a coffee shop. Next time you stop for a latte and muffin, all around you, the wheels of commerce will be quietly turning. </p> <p><strong> Learning curves</strong><br> </p> <p>The story of how \"quality circles\" of workers transformed Japanese manufacturing in the 60s and 70s - and US and European firms rushed to catch up in the 80s and 90s - is standard text for management students. But the idea's genesis is less well-known. Bob Garratt, in a book with the mundane title The Learning Organisation (don't you long for a book on How To Be The Dumbest FTSE 100 Company?), describes how Prof Reg Revans pioneered \"learning circles\" among miners in the newly nationalised UK Coal Board in the late 40s. The Japanese Productivity Council, visiting in 1950, were so impressed that they took the idea home. Meanwhile we Brits promptly forgot all about it. The rest, as they say, is history. </p> <p><strong> Gone with the wind</strong><br> </p> <p>An email from Jamie Saunders includes a helpful link to a conference on Big Body Heuristics, subtitled \"Are Corporations Really Alive? Are they now our dominant species?\" One session looked unmissable, on Corporate Physiology and Metabolism. This included \"paradigms of nutrient/resource acquisition (feeding), processing (digestion) and production/disposal (secretion/excretion)\". It is a compelling vision, of big firms as living, belching organisms. But hold on. What about the place of Homo sapiens in Big Bodies? As workers, we are responsible for production, or digestion. But as consumers we are the recipients of the products - excrement or secretions. Mmmm.</p>",

Most importantly, the use of non-office space for business activities can help revitalise urban areas after decades of corporate and middle-class flight. Traditionally workers trudge from car park or tube to office and back. But if they get out into their neighbourhoods, local services will reap the rewards. Cities are seizing back their mantle as centres of exchange - exchange not just of goods and services, but of ideas. Things happen in cities that can never happen in modular office blocks in suburban business parks. Meetings can happen quickly, naturally, even accidentally. Cafe culture tends to be associated with literary or philosophical activity, but remember that Lloyd's of London started in a coffee shop. Next time you stop for a latte and muffin, all around you, the wheels of commerce will be quietly turning. Learning curves The story of how \"quality circles\" of workers transformed Japanese manufacturing in the 60s and 70s - and US and European firms rushed to catch up in the 80s and 90s - is standard text for management students. But the idea's genesis is less well-known. Bob Garratt, in a book with the mundane title The Learning Organisation (don't you long for a book on How To Be The Dumbest FTSE 100 Company?), describes how Prof Reg Revans pioneered \"learning circles\" among miners in the newly nationalised UK Coal Board in the late 40s. The Japanese Productivity Council, visiting in 1950, were so impressed that they took the idea home. Meanwhile we Brits promptly forgot all about it. The rest, as they say, is history. Gone with the wind An email from Jamie Saunders includes a helpful link to a conference on Big Body Heuristics, subtitled \"Are Corporations Really Alive? Are they now our dominant species?\" One session looked unmissable, on Corporate Physiology and Metabolism. This included \"paradigms of nutrient/resource acquisition (feeding), processing (digestion) and production/disposal (secretion/excretion)\". It is a compelling vision, of big firms as living, belching organisms. But hold on. What about the place of Homo sapiens in Big Bodies? As workers, we are responsible for production, or digestion. But as consumers we are the recipients of the products - excrement or secretions. Mmmm.",

      "body": "<p>Written in 1700, William Congreve's Restoration play was so poorly received that he gave up writing soon after. It has since become an acknowledged example of a grandiloquent, lightly moralising comedy of manners which is good for a chuckle and sure to draw an audience. Now the Royal Exchange has turned to its harmless frippery, perhaps to steady the schedule after a couple of programming controversies. </p> <p>Mirabell and Millamant are lovers whose independent spirits are getting in the way of their marriage; to compound matters, they are also thwarted by intrigues. The undaunted Mirabell is the moralising voice of the play, yet Lloyd Owen's spiritless delivery often suggests a lawyer's summing-up. Though this is appropriate later, his intonation should have been livelier from the outset. </p> <p>Emily Morgan's Millamant, however, exhibits the right blend of spite, self-knowledge and vanity. With equal measures of wit and derision for those who visit, she languishes on the chaise longue in her rose-satin gown like a genteel coquette. </p> <p>Involving as much double-dealing as the game of cards in the first scene, the sub-plots mask and then expose the lusts and infidelities of the other characters. The scheming Fainall, played with versatility by Paul Higgins, is in love with Caroline Langrishe's equally assured Mrs Marwood, while Catherine Russell's nicely uptight Mrs Fainall has yet to overcome her desire for Mirabell. </p> <p>Congreve, though, did not sufficiently develop the sub-plots, and their apparent complexity renders them almost impossible to follow.

      "bodyText": "Written in 1700, William Congreve's Restoration play was so poorly received that he gave up writing soon after. It has since become an acknowledged example of a grandiloquent, lightly moralising comedy of manners which is good for a chuckle and sure to draw an audience. Now the Royal Exchange has turned to its harmless frippery, perhaps to steady the schedule after a couple of programming controversies. Mirabell and Millamant are lovers whose independent spirits are getting in the way of their marriage; to compound matters, they are also thwarted by intrigues. The undaunted Mirabell is the moralising voice of the play, yet Lloyd Owen's spiritless delivery often suggests a lawyer's summing-up. Though this is appropriate later, his intonation should have been livelier from the outset. Emily Morgan's Millamant, however, exhibits the right blend of spite, self-knowledge and vanity. With equal measures of wit and derision for those who visit, she languishes on the chaise longue in her rose-satin gown like a genteel coquette. Involving as much double-dealing as the game of cards in the first scene, the sub-plots mask and then expose the lusts and infidelities of the other characters. The scheming Fainall, played with versatility by Paul Higgins, is in love with Caroline Langrishe's equally assured Mrs Marwood, while Catherine Russell's nicely uptight Mrs Fainall has yet to overcome her desire for Mirabell. Congreve, though, did not sufficiently develop the sub-plots, and their apparent complexity renders them almost impossible to follow. Instead, it is the fops, Witwoud (Tobias Menzies) and Petulant (Christopher Colquhoun), who provide the most enjoyable diversions. Powdered and befrocked, and with pink bows on his high-heel shoes, Witwoud delights with his elaborate language and well-timed gestures. Petulant, meanwhile, is the dandy with the northern accent whose extravagant dress also disguises his dubious morals. By contrast, James Saxon's boisterous Sir Wilfull Witwoud sullies the airs of courtly pretension with his forthright rustic ways, while Auriol Smith gives a fine, shivering performance as Lady Wishfort in her white-faced state of \"dyingness\". Although some of the monologues were trimmed, at two-and-a-half hours the play is still too long, and many of the updated puns failed to find their laughs. In the end, there is enough tomfoolery to sustain the spirit of mischief, but only just. \u0095 Until May 27. Box office: 0161-833 9833.",

      "body": "<p>There were more long faces in the Kent dressing room than you could find on Easter Island after yesterday's resounding 77-run victory over Middlesex left them tantalisingly short of a place in the B&amp;H Cup quarter-finals. </p> <p>They finished behind the group winners Sussex, whose 62-run victory over Essex at Chelmsford was spearheaded by a stunning 271-run stand between Michael Bevan and Chris Adams, and runners-up Hampshire, who had an exciting two-run win over Surrey at the Oval in a match reduced to 10 overs per side. </p> <p>Two wickets apiece to Hampshire's new boy Shane Warne, who took the gold award, and their in-form old boy Peter Hartley ensured Surrey fell two runs short after they had appeared to be coasting to victory. </p> <p>Kent did not even make third place in the southern group, Surrey finishing level with them on points but, along with the northern side Durham, edging into the quarter-finals through the back door. </p> <p>Middlesex's batting yesterday was awful, but at least they could blame a lack of match practice.

      "bodyText": "There were more long faces in the Kent dressing room than you could find on Easter Island after yesterday's resounding 77-run victory over Middlesex left them tantalisingly short of a place in the B&amp;H Cup quarter-finals. They finished behind the group winners Sussex, whose 62-run victory over Essex at Chelmsford was spearheaded by a stunning 271-run stand between Michael Bevan and Chris Adams, and runners-up Hampshire, who had an exciting two-run win over Surrey at the Oval in a match reduced to 10 overs per side. Two wickets apiece to Hampshire's new boy Shane Warne, who took the gold award, and their in-form old boy Peter Hartley ensured Surrey fell two runs short after they had appeared to be coasting to victory. Kent did not even make third place in the southern group, Surrey finishing level with them on points but, along with the northern side Durham, edging into the quarter-finals through the back door. Middlesex's batting yesterday was awful, but at least they could blame a lack of match practice. Their past four matches had been washed out without a ball bowled, and even their pre-season trip to South Africa was hit by rain. Requiring a modest four runs an over, the captain Justin Langer - who looked in commanding form with an unbeaten 66 from 85 balls - merely needed someone to stay with him. But only Robin Weston reached double figures. Langer usually plays well against Kent. Last April he hit them for an unbeaten 241 in the championship, and his success has much to do with the fact that some years ago he played for Dover in the Kent League. Despite scoring heavily, his attempt to get a trial with the county was rejected. Yesterday it was his colleagues who played like club cricketers. They were eight for three inside four overs after Mark Ealham had Owais Shah lbw and Mark Ramprakash caught behind, before Ben Phillips bowled David Nash. After that, Weston put on 57 with his captain before he was caught in the slips. From there, it was a succession.

He was apt to turn up, cheerful as a terrier, anywhere at any time where the going was hardest and most urgent. He was one of the most remarkable coordinators, enthusers and inspirers the British armed forces have produced since the second world war.</p> <p>He came to the Falklands with an outstanding record of being in the thick of things. In Northern Ireland in 1979, he was the first officer to brief Mrs Thatcher, as the new prime minister, among the debris of the Warrenpoint bombing, which killed 18 soldiers.</p> <p>As the army's youngest major-general, he was appointed vice-quartermaster general to the south Atlantic task force, another densely detailed job. When he left the islands, full of golden opinions from contemporaries, he was knighted.</p> <p>His chief of defence staff, field marshal Lord Bramall, wrote to him, \"I would say, with a bit of luck - which we all need - the sky could be the limit.\"</p> <p>Luck, however, did not quite work out in that way. Thorne went on to head the 1st armoured division of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), the prime job for his rank. But he never became chief of general staff, or of defence staff. Five years later, he retired from the army, sidelined, as he saw it, by his temperamental distaste for joining coteries on the way to the top.</p> <p>But he also made his own luck. When he finished his final posting, as the army's director of infantry, he had - against heavy odds - won an unpublicised, but convulsive, internal battle to save the infantry's precious regimental and battalion roots.</p> <p>On his retirement, presenting a silver salver from all infantry regiments, the ex-Rhine army general Sir Jeremy Reilly said, \"I would rate General David as being the outstanding director of infantry since the war, without question, and probably of all time.\"</p> <p>It was a gesture of rare affection. As a civilian, Thorne went on to head the Royal Commonwealth Society, raise \u00a310m and save it from bankruptcy, a longer struggle with fewer big guns at his disposal than in any military posting; but, after nine dogged years, it was done.</p> <p>At home in Suffolk, in a memoir about his working life, Thorne wrote, \"I have seen enough of leaders under pressure and in crisis to know that many - even with fine reputations - bend with the wind. One always has to guard against giving away any of one's integrity for short term ease or advantage.\"</p> <p>Born in Hertfordshire, David Thorne was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, and at Sandhurst, from which he was commissioned into the Royal Norfolk (later Royal Anglian) Regiment. He spent his early career on the defence intelligence staff and as an RAF staff college instructor.</p> <p>In 1972, when he was 38, he rose to command the Royal Anglian regiment and, five years later, the 3rd infantry brigade in Northern Ireland. James Callaghan's government then believed IRA support was waning and was keen to hand control of troublespots - including south Armagh - to the Royal Ulster Constabulary and South Armagh defence regiment.</p> <p>The new brigadier's \"not too fashionable\" early assessment of IRA trends was less rosy. It led him to argue against the handover, for improved intelligence and for better army/RUC coordination. Shootings and bombings did escalate. After three Grenadier guardsmen were shot dead in December 1978, he managed to get a joint operations room set up.</p> <p>Nine months later, came the assassination of Lord Mountbatten and - the same day - the two Warrenpoint explosions. Thorne landed by helicopter in the carnage. A young paratroop commander, restraining tears, told him: \"You should have this\", handing him an epaulette. It was all that remained of David Blair, commanding officer of 1st battalion the Queen's Own Highlanders.</p> <p>Briefing Mrs Thatcher 36 hours later, he \"laid David Blair's cloth epaulette gently on the table beside her\". At the end of his briefing, which stressed intelligence and coordination, he said, \"I would now like briefly to come back to the human factor. David Blair has a son [then aged eight]. I have a son...\"</p> <p>He was unable to finish the sentence but thought she had understood, his memoir says. His Ulster commander called the briefing \"a highly personal tour de force\". Five weeks later, the Cabinet decided to appoint a coordinator of army/RUC operations. But, Thorne wrote in a cautionary memo to himself, \"God preserve us from officers who claim, after two years, to have cracked the problem.\"</p> <p>In 1981, in the first of the army's new fast-stream promotions, he was made three-star general. That led to the Falklands, where his achievement was to get long-term defences up and the garrison under shelter, before winter arrived. He also saw off, by argument, an MoD cost-cutting proposal to halve garrison numbers.</p> <p>In his last weeks on the island, he led the topping-out of Mount Kent radar station, one of three built despite 100mph winds and almost intolerable logistics. The plaque he unveiled read: \"Zeus - a routine project for 34 field squadron.\"</p> <p>In a speech which epitomised his qualities of rapport as a soldier, he said, \"You know, and I know, that it was not a routine task. It was a unique task. We are a particular brotherhood and you have scored yet again.\"</p> <p>Back in England, in his prime, his bright prospects suddenly unravelled. On his first day with BAOR, his commander General Sir Nigel Bagnall, soon to be chief of general staff, told Thorne he had not wanted him as a subordinate. Thorne had fallen foul of career rivalries between the UK-based army, which was his own background, and the Rhine army. The latter - with Bagnall in the ascendant - controlled promotions at the very top.</p> <p>That set a frustrating pattern till he retired. But he got stuck into tightening aspects of BAOR and, in his last role as director of infantry, found decisive influence. He was up against a plan, spearheaded by Bagnall, to \"trickle-post\" individual officers and soldiers between battalions on UK and overseas assignments, rather than transfer them as complete battalion units.</p> <p>This, though arguably more efficient, was seen by Thorne and many others as undermining a regimental system which was at the core of the army's cohesiveness and mutual loyalties on active service. At first, in 1986, he felt virtually isolated on the general staff. \"No senior officers came to my aid,\" his memoir says. \"Most were in their tents, polishing their helmets - and looking in the mirror.\"</p> <p>He argued his case, partly through two daring unsigned articles in the British Army Review, winning service-wide backing. In early 1988, the reorganisation was dropped. He was deluged with letters of gratitude. The victory was decisive: the issue has not subsequently been re-opened.</p> <p>As director general of the Royal Commonwealth Society until 1997, he wove another of his \"particular brotherhoods\", which stretched from Prince Charles to the commonwealth secretary general Chief Anyaoku to the chairman of BAT industries Sir Patrick Sheehy, and gradually won the day. Working with, and promoting the cause of, young people of many races brought him some of the deepest satisfaction of his working life.</p> <p>At home in Framlingham, Suffolk, finally though all too briefly, with his wife Anne and her variable second family of cats, dogs, sheep, Shetland ponies and muscovy ducks which had gone with them on most of their postings, he reflected, \"The lesson I have re-learned is that the best and happiest moments in life come when one is under pressure in a good cause - with just sufficient people to give at least an outside chance of success.\"</p> <p>He achieved one last target, through willpower and the care of his family: to live until Easter Sunday morning, the date fixed for a get-together of friends at his home to raise funds for Macmillan cancer nurses and Framlingham church.</p> <p>He leaves Anne, their daughters Georgina and Laura, and their son Edward.</p> <p>\u0095 Major-General Sir David Calthrop Thorne, soldier and administrator: born December 13 1933; died April 23 2000</p>",

Five years later, he retired from the army, sidelined, as he saw it, by his temperamental distaste for joining coteries on the way to the top. But he also made his own luck. When he finished his final posting, as the army's director of infantry, he had - against heavy odds - won an unpublicised, but convulsive, internal battle to save the infantry's precious regimental and battalion roots. On his retirement, presenting a silver salver from all infantry regiments, the ex-Rhine army general Sir Jeremy Reilly said, \"I would rate General David as being the outstanding director of infantry since the war, without question, and probably of all time.\" It was a gesture of rare affection. As a civilian, Thorne went on to head the Royal Commonwealth Society, raise \u00a310m and save it from bankruptcy, a longer struggle with fewer big guns at his disposal than in any military posting; but, after nine dogged years, it was done. At home in Suffolk, in a memoir about his working life, Thorne wrote, \"I have seen enough of leaders under pressure and in crisis to know that many - even with fine reputations - bend with the wind. One always has to guard against giving away any of one's integrity for short term ease or advantage.\" Born in Hertfordshire, David Thorne was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, and at Sandhurst, from which he was commissioned into the Royal Norfolk (later Royal Anglian) Regiment. He spent his early career on the defence intelligence staff and as an RAF staff college instructor. In 1972, when he was 38, he rose to command the Royal Anglian regiment and, five years later, the 3rd infantry brigade in Northern Ireland. James Callaghan's government then believed IRA support was waning and was keen to hand control of troublespots - including south Armagh - to the Royal Ulster Constabulary and South Armagh defence regiment. The new brigadier's \"not too fashionable\" early assessment of IRA trends was less rosy. It led him to argue against the handover, for improved intelligence and for better army/RUC coordination. Shootings and bombings did escalate. After three Grenadier guardsmen were shot dead in December 1978, he managed to get a joint operations room set up. Nine months later, came the assassination of Lord Mountbatten and - the same day - the two Warrenpoint explosions. Thorne landed by helicopter in the carnage. A young paratroop commander, restraining tears, told him: \"You should have this\", handing him an epaulette. It was all that remained of David Blair, commanding officer of 1st battalion the Queen's Own Highlanders. Briefing Mrs Thatcher 36 hours later, he \"laid David Blair's cloth epaulette gently on the table beside her\". At the end of his briefing, which stressed intelligence and coordination, he said, \"I would now like briefly to come back to the human factor. David Blair has a son [then aged eight]. I have a son...\" He was unable to finish the sentence but thought she had understood, his memoir says. His Ulster commander called the briefing \"a highly personal tour de force\". Five weeks later, the Cabinet decided to appoint a coordinator of army/RUC operations. But, Thorne wrote in a cautionary memo to himself, \"God preserve us from officers who claim, after two years, to have cracked the problem.\" In 1981, in the first of the army's new fast-stream promotions, he was made three-star general. That led to the Falklands, where his achievement was to get long-term defences up and the garrison under shelter, before winter arrived. He also saw off, by argument, an MoD cost-cutting proposal to halve garrison numbers. In his last weeks on the island, he led the topping-out of Mount Kent radar station, one of three built despite 100mph winds and almost intolerable logistics. The plaque he unveiled read: \"Zeus - a routine project for 34 field squadron.\" In a speech which epitomised his qualities of rapport as a soldier, he said, \"You know, and I know, that it was not a routine task. It was a unique task. We are a particular brotherhood and you have scored yet again.\" Back in England, in his prime, his bright prospects suddenly unravelled. On his first day with BAOR, his commander General Sir Nigel Bagnall, soon to be chief of general staff, told Thorne he had not wanted him as a subordinate. Thorne had fallen foul of career rivalries between the UK-based army, which was his own background, and the Rhine army. The latter - with Bagnall in the ascendant - controlled promotions at the very top. That set a frustrating pattern till he retired. But he got stuck into tightening aspects of BAOR and, in his last role as director of infantry, found decisive influence. He was up against a plan, spearheaded by Bagnall, to \"trickle-post\" individual officers and soldiers between battalions on UK and overseas assignments, rather than transfer them as complete battalion units. This, though arguably more efficient, was seen by Thorne and many others as undermining a regimental system which was at the core of the army's cohesiveness and mutual loyalties on active service. At first, in 1986, he felt virtually isolated on the general staff. \"No senior officers came to my aid,\" his memoir says. \"Most were in their tents, polishing their helmets - and looking in the mirror.\" He argued his case, partly through two daring unsigned articles in the British Army Review, winning service-wide backing. In early 1988, the reorganisation was dropped. He was deluged with letters of gratitude. The victory was decisive: the issue has not subsequently been re-opened. As director general of the Royal Commonwealth Society until 1997, he wove another of his \"particular brotherhoods\", which stretched from Prince Charles to the commonwealth secretary general Chief Anyaoku to the chairman of BAT industries Sir Patrick Sheehy, and gradually won the day. Working with, and promoting the cause of, young people of many races brought him some of the deepest satisfaction of his working life. At home in Framlingham, Suffolk, finally though all too briefly, with his wife Anne and her variable second family of cats, dogs, sheep, Shetland ponies and muscovy ducks which had gone with them on most of their postings, he reflected, \"The lesson I have re-learned is that the best and happiest moments in life come when one is under pressure in a good cause - with just sufficient people to give at least an outside chance of success.\" He achieved one last target, through willpower and the care of his family: to live until Easter Sunday morning, the date fixed for a get-together of friends at his home to raise funds for Macmillan cancer nurses and Framlingham church. He leaves Anne, their daughters Georgina and Laura, and their son Edward. \u0095 Major-General Sir David Calthrop Thorne, soldier and administrator: born December 13 1933; died April 23 2000",

Yesterday they found it. </p> <p>While fortunate to travel to Wearside on a day when Sunderland - with little left to play for, having not applied for the InterToto Cup - were in wretched form, Bradford deserved to edge this untidy affair. Their victory, coming after a run of one point from their previous 12 away games, sets everything up nicely because they now stand two points behind fourth-bottom Wimbledon, whom they face on Sunday at Valley Parade. </p> <p>Bradford's manager Paul Jewell said: \"This is a great boost in our fight for survival. We simply have to win a game - any game. Our meeting with Wimbledon is now a massive fixture.

      "bodyText": "Bradford City have known for some time that, if salvation was to be achieved, they would have to find another victory away from West Yorkshire. Yesterday they found it. While fortunate to travel to Wearside on a day when Sunderland - with little left to play for, having not applied for the InterToto Cup - were in wretched form, Bradford deserved to edge this untidy affair. Their victory, coming after a run of one point from their previous 12 away games, sets everything up nicely because they now stand two points behind fourth-bottom Wimbledon, whom they face on Sunday at Valley Parade. Bradford's manager Paul Jewell said: \"This is a great boost in our fight for survival. We simply have to win a game - any game. Our meeting with Wimbledon is now a massive fixture. By winning here today, when nobody fancied us, we have given ourselves a real chance, a realistic chance, of staying in the Premiership.\" From a managerial perspective the only problem with leading an unfashionable club to unlikely success is that it does precious little for long-term job prospects. Jewell is a classic case in point. A more amiable and dedicated man one will not find and yet what was always going to be a difficult season in the Premiership has led some to demand his removal. Presumably humble pie was being served in many Bradford households last night. Jewell's ploy of shoehorning into his side as many experienced, long-in-the-tooth players as he could lay his hands on may well have been a gamble worth taking. Bradford were never fluent yesterday but they offered stubborn resistance. In a first half which never threatened to raise itself above the ordinary Sunderland were uncommonly lazy, going through the motions rather than up the through the gears. It did not occur to them that by reducing the tempo - at times to a standstill - they were playing directly into enemy hands. It was dismal fare, though, and the interval was reached without the game yielding a single good chance for either side. The Bradford defender David Wetherall went closest to lifting the afternoon out of the gutter but his firm early header from a Peter Beagrie corner was comfortably smothered by the Sunderland goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen. The game had lurched, almost without incident, to its 57th minute before the tedium was genuinely threatened. Surprisingly, the first sweeping move was thrown together by Bradford, Dean Saunders sprinting clear before laying the ball into the path of Robbie Blake who hit the face of the crossbar with a vicious shot. Then, astonishingly, on the hour there was a goal. Beagrie's first cross from the left was headed back to him but his second, to the far post, landed directly in front of John Dreyer who claimed his first goal in three seasons with the cleanest of headers. Thereafter Sunderland rallied but Bradford defended magnificently. The battle was won but even now the war wages on. \u0095Watford's relegation from the Premiership was confirmed yesterday with Bradford's win, sending Graham Taylor's side back to the First Division after one season.",

      "bodyText": "The Lockerbie trial could be postponed for several weeks if an application by Scotland's senior law officer for a delay is successful, it emerged tonight. Lord advocate Colin Boyd will make the application to the high court after notice from the defence last week that there will be 119 defence witnesses, the crown office said. The trial of the two Libyans accused of causing the PanAm jet disaster, Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, was due to start at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands on May 3. The plane exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988 killing 270 people, including 11 on the ground. Mr Boyd will make his application for a postponement at a hearing before Lord Sutherland at Camp Zeist on Thursday. The application is being made on the grounds that the prosecution has not been provided with any advance notice of any defence witnesses despite repeated requests and has not yet seen any defence documents. It will be argued that given the number of witnesses and the fact that many live abroad, the prosecution team does not consider that the case can go to trial next week. The defence witnesses are based in a number of countries including Malta, Sweden, Germany and the United States, but the largest number are from Libya. Mr Boyd is likely to ask for a postponement of several weeks. The trial, scheduled to last for a year, will be conducted under Scottish law. The suspects were extradited only after Britain, the US and Libya agreed to hold the trial in a neutral country. Jim Swire, spokesman for relatives of the British victims of the disaster, said he planned to be present at Camp Zeist for Thursday's hearing. \"I understand the reason is the crown have only recently received a full list of defence witnesses, and they feel they need time,\" he said. \"Any further postponement would be unwelcome, but we are after truth and justice. If a postponement would improve the quality of the defence or prosecution, we would go along with the decision of the judges if they feel it's important for the fairness and objectivity of the trial.\" The trial has already been postponed once - it had been due to start in February, but late last year was put back at the request of the defence.",

They were the pressure to expand higher education rapidly to meet the needs of the knowledge economy, the fact that the money available for this was limited, and the public demand that standards should be seen to be maintained. </p> <p>Throughout the world, higher education is in transition from elite systems to mass participation. One consequence is the development of a more formal approach to quality assurance. In the past decade, quality assurance agencies have been established in some 50 countries. </p> <p>There are two reasons for this. The first is obvious. The amounts governments spend on higher education are significant. Multi-million pound sums, sufficient to fund several ministerial pet projects, are but the small change of the multi-billion pound UK higher education budget. Little wonder there is public and political concern that value for money should be demonstrated. </p> <p>The second reason is less obvious, but of equal importance. As the student population has become larger, has grown to include more mature students and has become more representative of society at large, the relationship between students and their teachers has altered. </p> <p>With all other professionals, university teachers are learning that deference to title or position has been replaced with respect for ability and quality of service. Most people make the choice of a degree course only once, and a mistake may be both difficult and expensive to put right. Many potential students, especially mature ones, may not be as mobile as the young school leaver. Such people need reliable information about what may be the only university to which they can apply. </p> <p>Academic standards are not a private matter. Explaining what they mean, and confirming that they are achieved, does no more than meet modern democracies' proper expectations of transparency and accountability in those who provide professional services. The public assurance of quality allows students and employers to make informed choices between institutions, and enables academics to earn the respect on which professional standing now rests. </p> <p>It would be naive to expect that external scrutiny of academic activities would be welcomed universally by those subject to it. But there is general acceptance of the principle of scrutiny as a means of providing accountability, generating public information and disseminating good practice. </p> <p>Yet when it comes to the reality of conducting a scrutiny there are complaints, sometimes well-founded, of intrusiveness and bureaucracy. The cartoons that adorn my office wall relate to the perception of quality assurance as a bureaucratic nightmare, and show harassed dons buried beneath mountains of paper. </p> <p>This week the Quality Assurance Agency will launch a new approach to the scrutiny of academic affairs. No longer will it be possible for vice-chancellors to pose for photographs in a room full of box files containing the evidence needed to demonstrate the quality of their teaching. </p> <p>The old approach involves a snapshot of activity from a short visit. Information had to be assembled artificially and for no other purpose, and kept at hand in case it was required. Much of it was not needed, giving rise to complaints of wasted effort. In future, we will work with the grain of academic activity. The time of reviewers will not be compressed into one visit but will be spread, to enable them to deal with naturally arising rather than artificially assembled evidence. </p> <p>Visits will coincide with internal events for which the institution has had to assemble evidence for its own purposes - such as the periodic reapproval of a course.

Instead, if provision is failing we will say so. If there are exemplary features we will single them out. At the heart of the new approach is a concern with standards which was identified in the Dearing report.

      "body": "<p>Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, yesterday attacked the largest teaching union for using children \"as pawns in a game\" to fight the government's plans for performance-related pay.</p> <p>As delegates at the National Union of Teachers' annual conference in Harrogate warned of stress on pupils caused by pressure on staff to improve test scores, Mr Woodhead said the argument amounted to a breach of professionalism.</p> <p>\"A seven-year-old who feels any pressure when they are doing the test, only feels that pressure if the teacher communicates it,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>\"Their pay doesn't depend exclusively on results. Part of it does and part of it should because the teacher's job in a primary school is to ensure that children learn to read and write and master rules of basic numbers. I don't think teachers are so unprofessional that they are going to communicate unacceptable levels of stress on their children. They are using children as pawns in a game, the game being that the union is opposed to performance-related pay, just as it is opposed to inspection,\" the Ofsted chief said.</p> <p>Doug McAvoy, the union's general secretary, said teachers being measured by results were bound to suffer anxiety and pass it on to children.</p> <p>There was also a danger that staff would concentrate their efforts on particular children whose results would affect delivery of performance targets, at the expense of others in the class. \"I can't imagine that is what parents want, but that is a consequence of performance-related pay,\" he said. The union's campaign against the government's pay scheme got strong support from Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman.</p> <p>In an address to the conference he appeared to congratulate delegates who heckled Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, on Saturday. \"It's about time teachers displayed their anger at the way they are being treated,\" he said.</p> <p>The government should stop telling teachers how to teach and abandon \"the bureaucratic farce called performance-related promotion\".</p> <p>It was being introduced absurdly quickly, with inadequate training of headteachers and external assessors who would decide which teachers deserved a \u00a32,000 performance bonus. It was not possible to identify which teacher made the difference to a pupil's performance, he said.</p> <p>The conference edged nearer a programme of industrial action against performance pay, but it was still unclear last night whether the union would be able to agree a clear policy before it closed today.</p> <p>Ron Haycock, a teacher from Waltham Forest, east London, said: \"Ministers want good performance. Teachers have been performing miracles for years. So pay all of us.\"</p> <p>The union should resist the government's scheme with a one-day strike. \"We owe it to every child we teach to go on national strike,\" he said.</p> <p>But Jerry Glazier, for the union's executive, said that a one-day strike would split the union and hand a propaganda weapon for the government to turn on teachers.</p> <p>The conference agreed a campaign against privatisation of state education, including local strike action when teachers' jobs were threatened by contracting out to private firms.</p> <p>The conference also approved resolutions to cut class sizes and protect teachers from undue stress.</p> <p>Delegates reported surveys showing that a quarter of teachers suffered from \"workplace bullying\" by over-zealous superiors and 56% suffered from stress serious enough to require medical attention.</p>",

As delegates at the National Union of Teachers' annual conference in Harrogate warned of stress on pupils caused by pressure on staff to improve test scores, Mr Woodhead said the argument amounted to a breach of professionalism. \"A seven-year-old who feels any pressure when they are doing the test, only feels that pressure if the teacher communicates it,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"Their pay doesn't depend exclusively on results. Part of it does and part of it should because the teacher's job in a primary school is to ensure that children learn to read and write and master rules of basic numbers. I don't think teachers are so unprofessional that they are going to communicate unacceptable levels of stress on their children. They are using children as pawns in a game, the game being that the union is opposed to performance-related pay, just as it is opposed to inspection,\" the Ofsted chief said. Doug McAvoy, the union's general secretary, said teachers being measured by results were bound to suffer anxiety and pass it on to children. There was also a danger that staff would concentrate their efforts on particular children whose results would affect delivery of performance targets, at the expense of others in the class. \"I can't imagine that is what parents want, but that is a consequence of performance-related pay,\" he said. The union's campaign against the government's pay scheme got strong support from Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman. In an address to the conference he appeared to congratulate delegates who heckled Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, on Saturday. \"It's about time teachers displayed their anger at the way they are being treated,\" he said. The government should stop telling teachers how to teach and abandon \"the bureaucratic farce called performance-related promotion\". It was being introduced absurdly quickly, with inadequate training of headteachers and external assessors who would decide which teachers deserved a \u00a32,000 performance bonus. It was not possible to identify which teacher made the difference to a pupil's performance, he said. The conference edged nearer a programme of industrial action against performance pay, but it was still unclear last night whether the union would be able to agree a clear policy before it closed today. Ron Haycock, a teacher from Waltham Forest, east London, said: \"Ministers want good performance. Teachers have been performing miracles for years. So pay all of us.\" The union should resist the government's scheme with a one-day strike. \"We owe it to every child we teach to go on national strike,\" he said. But Jerry Glazier, for the union's executive, said that a one-day strike would split the union and hand a propaganda weapon for the government to turn on teachers. The conference agreed a campaign against privatisation of state education, including local strike action when teachers' jobs were threatened by contracting out to private firms. The conference also approved resolutions to cut class sizes and protect teachers from undue stress. Delegates reported surveys showing that a quarter of teachers suffered from \"workplace bullying\" by over-zealous superiors and 56% suffered from stress serious enough to require medical attention.",

      "bodyText": "Adoption agencies today welcomed new legal proposals to make adoption easier and were \"hopeful\" of extra cash for post-adoptive support, following a summit on the issue at Downing Street. Experts say that around 5,000 children suitable for adoption are currently trapped in the care system because they cannot be matched with couples who want to adopt them, while hundreds of hopeful parents find themselves frustrated by the complex adoption procedures. Health minister John Hutton, who chaired the meeting of social services professionals, adoption agencies and children's charities, said that the key issues identified were the need for national standards on adoption and clarity on what was required of prospective parents. Mr Hutton estimates that up to 1,000 extra adoptions could happen each year as a result of the reform of the system planned by the government. It is hoped that creating national standards will sweep away the situation where different councils apply different criteria when deciding who may adopt - some of them rejecting parents because of their age, because they have a different racial background to the child or even because they smoke or are overweight. No details of what criteria adoptive parents will be required to meet in future have yet been finalised, but Mr Hutton hinted that it was likely that restrictions on older couples adopting would be relaxed. One proposal which seems certain to become policy is the creation of a new national register of children seeking adoption and hopeful couples, to end the situation where couples approved for adoption are forced to apply to many different local authorities. Today's meeting was part of a review of the adoption system which will result in a report to the prime minister next month.",

      "body": "<p>The long search for justice by the families of the victims of the 1988 Lockerbie disaster is approaching a crucial point with the opening next week in the Netherlands of the trial of two Libyan suspects accused of sabotaging Pan Am flight 103. The plane crashed near the Scottish town of Lockerbie after exploding in mid-air, killing 270 people.</p> <p>But the trial of Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah may raise more questions than it answers. The two men, alleged to be agents of Libyan intelligence, are expected to deny all the charges levelled against them. And terrorism experts say it is almost inconceivable that, even if they were involved, they could have acted alone or without the knowledge of the government of Colonel Muammar Gadafy.</p> <p>As a condition for finally handing over the two suspects, after a protracted legal wrangle, Libya stipulated that the special court to be convened in Zeist would not seek to put the Libyan state on trial but concentrate solely on the case against the two men.</p> <p>Libya's longstanding involvement in international terrorism will, however, provide the context for the trial. The US state department lists Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism and has maintained bilateral sanctions against the country. Its status as one of a group of so-called \"rogue states\" is used by the US, for example, to justify its need for a new \"Star Wars\" defensive missile shield.</p> <p>Col Gadafy is a long-standing bogyman of the west. The US air attacks on Tripoli in 1986, ordered by President Ronald Reagan, followed a Libyan-inspired attack on a Berlin discotheque used by American servicemen. At various times, Col Gadafy has expressed support for groups engaged in armed struggles, from Lebanon to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Libyan \"diplomats\" were responsible for the murder in London of WPC Yvonne Fletcher. Last May, a shipment of Scud missile parts bound for Libya were discovered at Gatwick airport - a breach of the international arms embargo against Libya. And earlier this year, it was alleged that the British intelligence service, MI6, had at one time plotted to assassinate Col Gadafy.</p> <p>Despite Libya's bloody track record, the Lockerbie attack was widely reported at the time to have been commissioned and paid for by Iran, which was said to be determined to avenge the earlier, accidental shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane over the Gulf by the American navy ship, the USS Vincennes. The Iranians allegedly employed a Syrian-based terrorist group as middlemen. Under this theory, the Libyans were merely the \"bag men\" and the two suspects are fall-guys for a much wider plot.</p> <p>Col Gadafy has been trying to clean up his image recently. His agreement to pay compensation for the death of WPC Fletcher, and his handing over of the Lockerbie suspects last April, brought a resumption of diplomatic ties with Britain, which has now sent an ambassador back to Tripoli. This week, Sir John Kerr, the top Foreign Office civil servant, will pursue this improvement in relations with a personal visit to Libya.

      "bodyText": "The long search for justice by the families of the victims of the 1988 Lockerbie disaster is approaching a crucial point with the opening next week in the Netherlands of the trial of two Libyan suspects accused of sabotaging Pan Am flight 103. The plane crashed near the Scottish town of Lockerbie after exploding in mid-air, killing 270 people. But the trial of Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah may raise more questions than it answers. The two men, alleged to be agents of Libyan intelligence, are expected to deny all the charges levelled against them. And terrorism experts say it is almost inconceivable that, even if they were involved, they could have acted alone or without the knowledge of the government of Colonel Muammar Gadafy. As a condition for finally handing over the two suspects, after a protracted legal wrangle, Libya stipulated that the special court to be convened in Zeist would not seek to put the Libyan state on trial but concentrate solely on the case against the two men. Libya's longstanding involvement in international terrorism will, however, provide the context for the trial. The US state department lists Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism and has maintained bilateral sanctions against the country. Its status as one of a group of so-called \"rogue states\" is used by the US, for example, to justify its need for a new \"Star Wars\" defensive missile shield. Col Gadafy is a long-standing bogyman of the west. The US air attacks on Tripoli in 1986, ordered by President Ronald Reagan, followed a Libyan-inspired attack on a Berlin discotheque used by American servicemen. At various times, Col Gadafy has expressed support for groups engaged in armed struggles, from Lebanon to Northern Ireland. Libyan \"diplomats\" were responsible for the murder in London of WPC Yvonne Fletcher. Last May, a shipment of Scud missile parts bound for Libya were discovered at Gatwick airport - a breach of the international arms embargo against Libya. And earlier this year, it was alleged that the British intelligence service, MI6, had at one time plotted to assassinate Col Gadafy. Despite Libya's bloody track record, the Lockerbie attack was widely reported at the time to have been commissioned and paid for by Iran, which was said to be determined to avenge the earlier, accidental shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane over the Gulf by the American navy ship, the USS Vincennes. The Iranians allegedly employed a Syrian-based terrorist group as middlemen. Under this theory, the Libyans were merely the \"bag men\" and the two suspects are fall-guys for a much wider plot. Col Gadafy has been trying to clean up his image recently. His agreement to pay compensation for the death of WPC Fletcher, and his handing over of the Lockerbie suspects last April, brought a resumption of diplomatic ties with Britain, which has now sent an ambassador back to Tripoli. This week, Sir John Kerr, the top Foreign Office civil servant, will pursue this improvement in relations with a personal visit to Libya. Even the US has reopened informal diplomatic contacts. Col Gadafy has also returned to the Organisation of African Unity fold, after many years of self-imposed isolation. And he attended the recent EU-Africa summit meeting in Cairo. Although on his best behaviour, he could not resist a characteristic tirade against the former colonial powers' African legacy. The EU has lifted most remaining sanctions on Libya, although a proposal by Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, to invite Col Gadafy to Brussels was withdrawn recently amid much embarrassment. Behind this thaw lies economic self-interest - Libya has important oil reserves and untapped commercial potential - and a desire to encourage Col Gadafy to adopt less threatening policies; put simply, to bring Libya in from the cold. Thus while the Zeist trial may finally help bring the long-suffering families of the Lockerbie victims some sense of vindication, it may be unable to uncover the whole story of what really happened to flight 103. And suspicions will persist that governments as far apart as Tehran and Washington share a common interest in bringing the affair to a conclusion, however unsatisfactory - and in drawing a veil over the many murky and bloody episodes which comprised the West's undeclared 20-year war with Col Gadafy.",

A recent survey by the British Dental Association shows that a serious lack of orthodontists means patients in some parts of the country must wait up to four years for treatment. </p> <p>While orthodontists say 60% of children in this country would benefit from corrective treatment, they are only able to treat about 25%. Warren Jones, vice-chairman of the BDA's central committee for hospital dental services, says: \"The problem is extremely serious.

This may mean an additional 18 months of merciless teasing over having goofy teeth, when with treatment they could blossom into self-confident young adults.

The reason is not clear, although some theories suggest that increasingly refined diets or decaying milk teeth interfere with healthy spacing. What is certain, however, is that orthodontic treatment is already much harder to come by in Britain than in the US and most other European countries. </p> <p>Sandler says: \"Some parents are already sending their children to private specialists, but it's something few can afford, so if nothing is done to rectify our current problems, there will soon be a critical lack of trained specialists within the NHS.\" </p> <p>Catherine Woodman, 14, from Brentwood in Essex, was put on a waiting list for assessment a year ago, and has now been told she could wait two years for surgery to clear an impacted eye tooth in the roof of her mouth. Then she may have to wear a brace for two years. Her mother, Jane, says: \"It's just shocking. She could be nearly 19 by the time it's all over. She's got GCSEs coming up, and does not need this added upset. I've investigated getting it done privately, but it would cost \u00a32,800.\" </p> <p>The BDA says the shortage stems from orthodontists' training being extended 15 years ago from one to three years - on top of an initial five-year degree in dental surgery and two to three more in general practice. </p> <p>Jones says: \"The average treatment lasts two years, so it was felt the training should be extended.\" However, there hasn't been enough funding to increase the number of training places in proportion. This means many orthodontists are now reaching retirement age, and hanging up their pliers faster than they can be replaced. One in 20 hospital consultants' posts are not filled. </p> <p>There is also a north-south divide in training places, with around 50% of all new orthodontists (23 out of 50 each year) being trained in the south-east. Nearly all end up working within a 30-mile radius of where they were trained. </p> <p>This has created an acute shortage of practice specialists, needed to leave hospital orthodontists free to concentrate on severe, surgical cases. Such specialists are usually better paid than hospital orthodontists, and this, too, means that more of them tend to congregate in London and the south-east. </p> <p>Therefore, while London has one specialist for every 1,308 12-year-olds, there is just one per 4,692 in the West Midlands, for example. In some areas, such as Barnsley, where children are waiting four years for assessment and treatment, there is not one. </p> <p> Delays are not the only problem. Once patients are assessed, confusion reigns over which conditions should be treated within the NHS. These range from the purely cosmetic, such as squint teeth, to cleft palates, or congenital problems where teeth have not developed and implants are needed. However, with no clear guidelines, some health authorities will treat some conditions but not others. </p> <p>So what is the solution? The BDA is calling for urgent meetings with government experts. Jones says: \"We understand there isn't unlimited money in the health service. But this government was voted in on a platform of equality of access to care and as far as orthodontic treatment is concerned, it's a postcode lottery.\" </p> <p>He hopes some of the money allocated to the NHS in the budget will be used to set up additional training places. \"Once we know what we're going to treat, we can get a better idea about how many extra specialists we need, and decide how to get them to the places where they're most needed; for example, by providing loans or grants to help them set up in poorly covered areas.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's over. My three months is up. I'm on my own. You will first want the facts. I've lost a stone; my body fat is down from 32% to 25%; my resting heart rate is down from 86 to 68 beats per minute; my blood pressure is the same - high, but not worryingly so. That is good progress, but by no means the end of the story. Ideally, I ought to lose another 7-9kg (15-20lb), reduce my body fat to around 20%, and get my resting heart rate down to the low 60s. </p> <p>Sam, my personal trainer, has kindly sent me on my way with an action plan. This will mean working out twice at weekends, combining half an hour of cardiovascular training with half an hour of weights; once in the week, with 25 minutes of cardiovascular and 20 minutes of upper-body work; and running twice a week for 30-40 minutes each time. </p> <p>He emphasises that what counts is the intensity at which you train. You have to push yourself; get your heart rate up to, in my case, 150-165 beats per minute (this figure will vary according to age); introduce \"speedplay\" into the running, injecting short bursts to raise the heart rate. Rest assured that I will do it all - scout's honour. </p> <p>So, some conclusions. It has certainly been worthwhile and I've gone sufficiently far down the road to want to carry on with the journey. I've really enjoyed locating, if not quite uncovering, my stomach muscles. I realise now that booze is, mentally and physically, very bad news: I'm down from 20-plus units a week at the start to maybe five a week now. Drink should be an occasional pleasure, not a daily standby. It's a treat, not part of the routine for getting through the day. </p> <p>I haven't quite worked out diet yet. I have muesli for breakfast, eat much more fruit, spread little or no butter on toast, and eat smaller, more sensible meals through the day, but I still find it difficult to kick biscuits, sugar, muffins and, worst of all, cheese. (Although, if cheese is so bad for you, why do you never see fat mice?) The real problem is that I don't have the imagination to plan a diet, and so end up eating endless tubs of tuna pasta, which isn't even that healthy. </p> <p>What I don't do any more is have any really large meals: I now never feel bloated after eating. One course rather than three; water rather than wine; say no to rolls; avoid desserts. It isn't puritanism, it's pragmatism - your body quickly gets used to the new regime, and sitting down to a three-course meal with half a bottle of wine would now be anathema. </p> <p>I still don't drink enough water. A litre and a half a day really is a lot; you spend your whole day wondering where the next bottle of Evian is going to come from, which drives you crazy after a while. (Consumer note: the small bottles are wildly overpriced, so get organised and buy a supply of large bottles from a supermarket. [Hypocrisy note: I never do this, but it doesn't stop me passing on the advice.]) </p> <p>Motive: I've tried to convince myself that my urge to train, to get thinner and fitter, hasn't been driven by narcissism. No doubt that plays a part, but I don't think narcissism would be enough to keep you going. The real pay-off is control, physical and mental. We eat and drink too much, get fat and unfit, out of boredom, laziness, indiscipline and perhaps a sense of failure. Reversing the process is all about empowerment. </p> <p>We complicate life to a ridiculous degree; the gym is a place where all the frustrations are stripped away and life is reduced to something simple and linear. Exercise is about your psyche rather than your body, so perhaps it is a form of spiritual narcissism. (Note to publishers: I am very happy to flesh this out in a short, money-spinning self-help book called something like Reclaiming the Self.) </p> <p>Sam's point was always \"How do you feel?\" not \"How do you look?\" Lose weight at your own speed; don't be a slave to the scales; don't diet just for the sake of it. Your well-being and performance in training are the best guides to how things are going. I don't feel I've got much stronger over the three months - my left side is still much weaker than my right, for example. What has improved considerably, thanks to all the cardiovascular work and my more efficient heart, is my running: I now feel in control when I run, and that's when it becomes fun. </p> <p>Now I must leave Sam: my friend, guide and taskmaster for the past three months. A colleague suggested that I write a follow-up series called \"Piling it all back on\" - a fortnightly exploration of decadence that he thinks would be far more popular than my advocacy of the ascetic. But that would be an insult to Sam. He says that if I fall by the wayside now, he will have failed. As we said at the beginning, this change is for life. </p> <p>The intention henceforth is to eat well, drink plenty of water, drink less tea (and coffee only occasionally), eat lots of fruit (five portions a day, remember), drink alcohol for occasional pleasure and not as a regular pick-me-up, go to the gym three times a week, run at least twice a week, keep up the boxercise (but avoid fights), and use the new-found fitness to be more mentally focused (physical health ought to have a spiritual purpose). I'll stay in touch with Sam, too. Next season he is playing for a football club close to where I live and is going to come for the occasional (light) pre-match lunch. So, you see, it's a happy ending. Or do I mean beginning? </p> <p>\u0095 Stephen Moss would like to thank all the staff at Matt Roberts at One, 1 Aldwych, London WC2 (tel: 020-7300 0600), where he worked out for three months.</p>",

What has improved considerably, thanks to all the cardiovascular work and my more efficient heart, is my running: I now feel in control when I run, and that's when it becomes fun. Now I must leave Sam: my friend, guide and taskmaster for the past three months. A colleague suggested that I write a follow-up series called \"Piling it all back on\" - a fortnightly exploration of decadence that he thinks would be far more popular than my advocacy of the ascetic. But that would be an insult to Sam. He says that if I fall by the wayside now, he will have failed. As we said at the beginning, this change is for life. The intention henceforth is to eat well, drink plenty of water, drink less tea (and coffee only occasionally), eat lots of fruit (five portions a day, remember), drink alcohol for occasional pleasure and not as a regular pick-me-up, go to the gym three times a week, run at least twice a week, keep up the boxercise (but avoid fights), and use the new-found fitness to be more mentally focused (physical health ought to have a spiritual purpose). I'll stay in touch with Sam, too. Next season he is playing for a football club close to where I live and is going to come for the occasional (light) pre-match lunch. So, you see, it's a happy ending. Or do I mean beginning? \u0095 Stephen Moss would like to thank all the staff at Matt Roberts at One, 1 Aldwych, London WC2 (tel: 020-7300 0600), where he worked out for three months.",

      "body": "<p><strong> How can I treat hives? </strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I have had hot and itchy inflamed skin on my arms for about six months. The doctor has diagnosed urticaria. I have tried conventional treatments and eliminating possible triggers, but the inflammation always returns. The waiting time for a dermatologist is at least six months. Would it be worth paying to go privately? </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> Urticaria - or hives - is where itchy, red weals flare up on the skin, as though you've been stung by nettles. About a quarter of sufferers get hives in response to physical factors such as pressure from tight clothes, extremes of heat, sunshine or contact with water. The remaining 75% may never identify a trigger, which is very frustrating. </p> <p>Numerous triggers, ranging from eggs, food additives, house dust mite and pesticides, have been suggested - you need to work out what's likely in your case. All you can do is eliminate potential triggers, take an antihistamine when your urticaria flares up and carry an adrenaline injection if you get breathing problems associated with the condition. </p> <p><strong> What causes these cuts?</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> For the past 18 months I have suffered periodically from cuts around my mouth, which are painful and split when I speak or eat. My doctor has not been able to diagnose the cause and, after prescribing steroid creams that aggravated the problem, now puts it down to \"stress\". Moisturisers give limited relief, and vitamin B complex tablets (as recommended by my pharmacist) helped at first, but are no longer effective. Sometimes the cuts disappear of their own accord. Can you advise me? </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> This condition is known as angular stomatitis. It can be a sign of iron deficiency anaemia so it's worth checking that your GP has done a blood test. The test will also indicate whether you're deficient in B vitamins or folic acid. </p> <p>The cuts can be associated with Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation throughout the gut from mouth to anus, though this would produce other symptoms, such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. A food allergy would be more likely to make your lips tingle and swell than produce small cuts. </p> <p>Try using Vaseline liberally on the lips and round the mouth, and a sunblocking lip salve in the sun. </p> <p><strong> I yawn all the time</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I am 47 and in good health, but over the past few months I have been yawning a lot. I have tried the usual remedies - sleeping at least eight hours a night, exercising two or three times a week - but this makes no difference. </p> <p>I am often in a meeting or seeing a client (I work as a psychologist) and have to stifle yawns. I don't think it's boredom as topics that interest me still evoke a yawn. Do you have any suggestions? </p> <p> <strong>A: </strong> Yawning injects oxygen into our bloodstream; it implies that we have been breathing inefficiently and our blood is low on oxygen. You may be yawning more than usual if the room you are in is poorly ventilated, so open a window and turn off any heaters. It may also be a sign that you are tired. To ensure good-quality sleep, cut out night-time alcohol, don't work in the evenings and have a \"wind-down\" routine. </p> <p>If you think you're sleeping enough, you may have sleep apnoea, which is associated with snoring and disturbed sleep. There are now specialised sleep clinics to which you can be referred by your GP. </p> <p><strong> My hand has extra bones</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I had an x-ray on Saturday as I have broken a bone in my thumb. I noticed five or six floating things in the x-ray of my left hand and the nurse assured me it is quite common to have sesamoid bones. I looked up this word on the internet and discovered that sesamoids are common in thoroughbred horses. Where do they come from, will they develop and should I be worried? </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> Some of us have sesamoid bones in our feet and hands, some don't. They don't appear to have any useful function and, as you say, they show up on x-ray as little floating bones. I can't find out whether they had any useful function at an earlier stage of our evolution - perhaps a reader will be able to enlighten us. </p> <p><strong> Will Viagra hurt him?</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> Can my husband take Viagra? He has high blood pressure and high cholesterol and I have heard that it could be dangerous. </p> <p><strong> A</strong> A new analysis of 53 studies of men treated for erectile problems showed that those on Viagra had a lower risk of heart attacks and death than those taking a placebo. The guidance now is that anyone with a stable heart condition can take it without too much concern. I'd recommend that your husband perhaps have an electrocardiogram as it's not the Viagra but sex that could be a bit much for him. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

And how would surgeons ever be trained, if no one ever wanted to go to a surgeon who had performed fewer than a given number of operations?

This is much easier said than done. The age, sex, social class, extent of the original condition, smoking history etc must be controlled for. And patients have to be aware that a 20% increase in a common complication might be far more significant, from the point of view of their personal safety, than a threefold increase in a very rare complication.

      "body": "<p>Dust down the familiar cliches. Prepare the souped-up superlatives. And fetch the half-empty can of Brasso out of the Old Trafford storeroom. </p> <p>Because according to the press, the pundits and just about everybody else, Manchester United's glorious ascension to the 2001 Premiership title is already a fait accompli. The bookies have them as odds-on favourites, Gianluca Vialli admits they're streets ahead, and today's Express wonders whether they are the best club side this country has ever seen. </p> <p>And now they've signed Ruud van Nistelrooy - and with Sol Campbell apparently on his way - you'd be forgiven for thinking that the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds should stop worrying about the title, and downsize their ambitions to a Champions League place.</p> <p>But United - brilliant though they are - aren't unbeatable. They have obvious flaws, especially at the back. It just needs their so-called rivals to have the guts to have a real go at them - home and away - and to match their relentless will to win.</p> <p>Of course that's easier said than done, and anybody who saw them swatting aside Southampton and strolling past a Chelsea side supposedly fighting for a Champions League place knows their title thirst remains as strong as ever. </p> <p>But let's be honest. This year United's rivals were a pathetic bunch, who virtually handed over the Premiership wrapped up in the white flag of surrender. </p> <p>Liverpool started so badly - losing to Watford at home for heaven's sake - that they were out of it by September.

      "bodyText": "Dust down the familiar cliches. Prepare the souped-up superlatives. And fetch the half-empty can of Brasso out of the Old Trafford storeroom. Because according to the press, the pundits and just about everybody else, Manchester United's glorious ascension to the 2001 Premiership title is already a fait accompli. The bookies have them as odds-on favourites, Gianluca Vialli admits they're streets ahead, and today's Express wonders whether they are the best club side this country has ever seen. And now they've signed Ruud van Nistelrooy - and with Sol Campbell apparently on his way - you'd be forgiven for thinking that the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds should stop worrying about the title, and downsize their ambitions to a Champions League place. But United - brilliant though they are - aren't unbeatable. They have obvious flaws, especially at the back. It just needs their so-called rivals to have the guts to have a real go at them - home and away - and to match their relentless will to win. Of course that's easier said than done, and anybody who saw them swatting aside Southampton and strolling past a Chelsea side supposedly fighting for a Champions League place knows their title thirst remains as strong as ever. But let's be honest. This year United's rivals were a pathetic bunch, who virtually handed over the Premiership wrapped up in the white flag of surrender. Liverpool started so badly - losing to Watford at home for heaven's sake - that they were out of it by September. Arsenal, who looked a decent bet at the start of the season, crashed out of the Champions League and then went on a three-month sulk. Leeds battled bravely, but never had the squad to keep it up. And Chelsea's expensive ensemble of prima-donnas could be brilliant against Barcelona, but too often couldn't be bothered against the likes of Bradford. So what must they do different next time round? First off, they must realise that even a team as dominating as Manchester United can't sustain their red-hot form over an entire season. In fact this year they barely got out of second gear until late February, and stuttered to home draws against Wimbledon and Southampton. The trouble was that nobody capitalised on it, and when it really mattered - helped no doubt helped by their mid-season holiday in Brazil and not bothering with the FA Cup - United proved unstoppable. Unstoppable in the Premiership anyway. Because Vicente del Bosque's gung-ho attacking philosophy, which inspired Real Madrid to a brilliant win at Old Trafford last week, is the second thing that must be taken on board by our leading clubs. Rather than coming to Old Trafford happy with a draw, teams must be prepared to go for the kill. The same applies to mid-table clubs when they entertain the Reds. They should tear into them with the gusto of a rottweiler ripping into his supper, rather than merely kow-tow down and hope that a benevolent United will settle for an away draw. Third, the clubs must develop the Manchester United mindset. Ferguson's tactical acumen is often questioned (being out-manoeuvred by del Bosque and playing Beckham in midfield and Giggs on the right-wing during the Champions League final are two examples that come to mind) but the way he cajoles and bullies his players into producing something near their best in every game sets them apart. Other teams must realise that the Premiership isn't a part-time option, even if they have played in Europe during midweek, and that they must scrap for every point in every game. Finally, if all else fails they should remember that footballing dynasties never last forever. When Liverpool sauntered to the League title in 1988 they too were hailed as the greatest English club side ever. A year later they lost in a thrilling match against Arsenal. It marked the beginning of end of their long and imperious reign. You never know, the clubs must tell themselves, the same thing might happen to United.

But people can take occupational and private pensions at 50. <p><b>What is an occupational pension?</b><br> Often called 'superannuation' in the public sector, an occupational pension is an arrangement an employer makes, or a group of employers make, to provide pensions for their workers when they retire.

An occupational pension can be paid as well as the basic retirement pension.</p> <p><b>What is the basic retirement pension?</b><br> The basic retirement pension is the foundation of pension schemes. Paying into this pension is obligatory, but other pensions can be added, such as the occupational pension. When you work, you pay national insurance contributions if your earnings are above a certain level (the 'lower earnings limit'). Your employer takes these out of your pay (as well as making payments for you). If you are self-employed, you pay national insurance contributions yourself. These contributions build up your rights to the basic retirement pension, often called the 'old-age pension'.

As the post-war baby boom is now approaching pensionable age, it is calculated that by 2040 there will be only two workers to support each pensioner, compared with 3.7 now.

The change would coincide with the planned equalisation of the state pension age at 65.

Changes will also be made to allow older people to engage in voluntary work without losing state benefits.</p> <p><b>Isn't this a reversal of recent trends?</b><br> Yes. In the 1990s, companies wanted to get rid of older workers on the grounds that they were inflexible and too expensive in preference for younger employees, who were more malleable and cheaper. Early retirement (typically, where the pension starts earlier but at a lower rate, or where a firm offers a pay-off as an alternative to redundancy) was common in the last decade. But pension companies warn it will not be an option in the future.

The zoo was packed yesterday, a school holiday for many local children, with families and children enjoying live music performances, storytellers, dancers and African drummers in a traditional post-Easter event dating back over 100 years. The shootings come less than a week after the first anniversary of the Columbine high school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, in which two teenage boys killed 12 other pupils and a teacher before shooting themselves. It will add to mounting concern about gun violence involving children in the US, particularly after the recent shooting in Michigan by a six-year-old boy of his six-year-old classmate. Vice-President Al Gore, in New York for a fundraising dinner, said the incident emphasised the need for tougher gun control laws. \"It goes on. What does it take?

Last month, Shere Hite published her account of fame, feminism and self-imposed exile; in July, Sheila Rowbotham publishes a memoir of the 60s; this month comes In Our Time, from the author of Against Our Will, one of the first feminist texts on rape. An act of loving remembrance, it charts the history of a wave of radical activism, from the first meetings of New York Radical Women in the late 60s to the last staggerings of the anti-pornography movement in the mid-80s, and is a salute to a kind of radical feminism that seems almost perverse in this safe, self-contained era.</p> <p>There is more than a touch of Hollywood to Brownmiller's storytelling skills: \"I set my eyes on the memory channel and 'image' the room.\" Here is the March 1970 sit-in at Ladies Home Journal, where Brownmiller reads out their \"non-negotiable demands\" (\"We demand that the magazine cease to publish 'Can this Marriage be Saved?' and all contributions by Drs Bruno Bettleheim and Theodore Rubin\"). Here is an account of the 1971 whirlwind visit to America of that \"improbable self-made creation\" Germaine Greer, who clearly irritated Brownmiller beyond measure. But there are solid and moving accounts of the first speak-outs on abortion, rape and sexual harassment which remind us how much radical feminism was, and remains, the only movement to make women's bodies the site of political struggle.</p> <p>Brownmiller's racy, popular style captures well the rawness of street politics, the feel of that economically buoyant era when you could rent a cheap flat, work part-time and still have time left over to change the world.

Mr Rutelli's supporters retaliated by highlighting Milan's years of neglect. That Awful Mess on Via Merulana is the southerners' trump card. A philosophical meditation on a murder in a middle-class house during fascist rule, it is set in Rome. But Rome's ownership is undermined by its flouting of Gadda's request to be buried near John Keats in the city's Protestant cemetery. He was buried in a different cemetery. Both sides claim that their plots would fulfil the writer's request, made in a final interview which he titled himself: \"Please, leave me in the shade.\"",

A couple of hours later, after the farmer had been confirmed dead, Mugabe was on television delivering his independence day speech.

When Mugabe took over in 1980 he was the toast of the liberal world. He did not have the stature of Nelson Mandela - who does? - but he did have democratic legitimacy and vowed to work towards reconciliation in the interests of the many rather than the few, which was more than can be said for his predecessor, Ian Smith. As recently as three years ago the country was regarded as one of Africa's success stories. Economic growth, at 8%, was strong, and investment was pouring in.</p> <p>\"Our economic outlook is the brightest and strongest it has been for 15 years, even 20 years,\" said Isaac Takawira, the managing director of Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe in early 1997. \"Our clients are dusting off projects that have been on the shelf for years. Businesses are making expansion plans. With good cooperation between government and the private sector we should enjoy a stable macroeconomic situation and sustainable growth.\"</p> <p>Although Amnesty International had severe criticisms of the country's proposed constitutional reform - which was rejected by the voters last month - it nonetheless concluded that \"the draft constitution represents major human rights improvements compared to the present constitution\".</p> <p>But even as the world has praised Mugabe it has expressed concern over the cronyism and despotism that has become endemic through his 20 years in power.</p> <p>During the 80s he cemented his rule through a murderous campaign against the Ndebele in general and his former liberation allies, the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (Zapu), in particular. He only abandoned his commitment to one-party rule, under considerable duress, about five years ago. His portrait still hangs everywhere, from the Kentucky Fried Chicken to the car hire offices. Desmond Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town, once described Mugabe as \"almost a caricature of all the things people think black African leaders do\".</p> <p>The financial world has been disdainful of his economic performance partly because it has concentrated on the interests of the poor. Much of spending has gone to education - at 92% Zimbabwe has one of the highest rates of literacy in Africa - health and infrastructure. But his claims that the democratically decided priorities of his government were being overruled by economic imperialism have been undermined by his tendency to line the pockets of the political elite and to use inflationary pay rises to buy off discontent among civil servants. If that were not enough, his senseless and unpopular war in the Congo is costing money that his country simply does not have.</p> <p>If Mugabe had left government in 1995, says Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of opposition party the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), he would have gone with his reputation intact, but \"the past five years have been a disaster\".</p> <p>Ironically, the one area in which he gains most sympathy in this part of the world is land reform. The first law passed by South Africa's African National Congress in 1994 was to permit those who had been evicted from their land during apartheid to reclaim their property, and a recent survey showed that a slim majority of South Africans believe Zimbabwe's squatters were right to seize land. Ever since Zimbabwe was liberated from white minority rule the thorny question of the redistribution of land has been simmering.</p> <p>This has always been an essentially political issue, although race has never been far away. In a country where history has both racialised politics and politicised race it is difficult to see how it could be otherwise. Those who own the best land are white; those who want it are black. Whites stole the land from blacks for several decades at gunpoint; now blacks want some of it back and they are prepared to get it in the same way they lost it if they have to.</p> <p>Contrary to what many white farmers here would have you believe, Zimbabwe was not an oasis of racial harmony before Mugabe started to stoke up tensions. The white-owned estates are collectively the country's largest employer and pay the lowest wages. Maids earn more than farm labourers and many white farmers treat their staff with racist contempt resonant of the bad old days of Rhodesia. \"The farmer here is not a good man,\" said Gladman T, who works as a labourer near Ventersburg. \"When he gets angry he throws things at us or lets the dogs on us. He got angry one day when the machinery broke and cut the electricity off to all our houses.</p> <p>\"He is like many whites. They only want to deal with blacks as workers. His attitude creates a bitterness among us. If there were to be trouble here with the war veterans I don't think any of his workers would help him.\" But nor has it merely been a tale of bitter racial conflict. In the cities a black middle class is both thriving and growing. In the countryside some white farmers have been slowly coming around to the idea that their black workers are staff rather than hired chattels, although an insipid strand of paternalism remains firmly lodged in their psyche. Black Zimbabweans want land reform not to spite whites but because they feel it is just and because that is what they fought for 20 years ago. Tales of them defending the farms where they work against squatters tell us more about their fear that the squatters will take the land for themselves and leave them with nothing than any great love for their bosses.</p> <p>While Mugabe has painted him self as the champion of the landless in recent months, it has been the landless who have been forcing him to act over the past few years.</p> <p>Almost two years ago squatters occupied white farms, pointing to family grave sites and grinding stones used by their mothers to illustrate how their land was seized by British colonialists without a penny of compensation. Their immediate actions were directed at white farmers, but they were motivated by frustration after years of waiting for the government to tackle the issue. At the time, Mugabe imposed a two-week ban on public demonstrations and strikes after a veterans' demonstration which took place while African-American businessmen were here for an investment conference.</p> <p>Nor is the death of white farmers anything new. As far back as 18 months ago one elderly farmer was killed and another white couple assaulted. At the time white farmers barricaded themselves into their houses, armed themselves, and vowed they would never leave their land. \"Our hard-won peace and sta bility is threatened by our people's urgent need for fertile land,\" said the then minister of state, Joseph Msika. \"I shudder to think what the future holds for us if we do not achieve an equitable distribution of our land.\" Welcome to the future. Msika has been promoted to vice president, equitable distribution has not been achieved and the entire nation is shuddering with the consequences.</p> <p>At the Old Vic pub in Bulawayo the great and good of the ruling Zanu-PF party are knocking back the Mikuyu Pinot Noir, a popular Zimbabwean red wine. They are in town in Msika's honour. Those who checked into the adjacent Rainbow hotel paid in cash - huge wads of Zimbabwean dollars which bear testament to the 50% inflation for which their government is responsible. If there was ever an illustration of an effete ruling elite, it is this.</p> <p>A few miles away, in the plush suburb of Hillside, big men are weeping at the funeral of the white farmer Martin Olds, who was murdered by squatters last Tuesday. Like the corpse, they are dressed in khaki. Black ties and jackets were left behind when they left their homes in haste following the killing. Following Olds' death we learned that \"he had the gentlest eyes you have ever seen\". What we did not hear was that his objectionable manner made him deeply unpopular with black people in the district of Nyamandlovhu where he lived. During the liberation war he served in the Grey Scouts, a mountain reconnaissance team that fought determinedly to preserve minority rule. He had been in trouble with the police in the past for shooting at poachers; he had promised that squatters would receive the same treatment.</p> <p>From the pulpit Reverend Paul Andrianatos pulls no punches. Voting for Zanu-PF \"would be a vote for the devil\", he says, before going on to compare Mugabe with Hitler. If ever there was an illustration of a besieged, privileged and panicked minority, it is this.</p> <p>Mugabe is not the devil any more than Olds was an angel. That doesn't mean the former deserved to rule any more than the latter deserved to die. What is going on in Zimbabwe is not a black and white issue. It is about politics, fuelled by history and propelled by self-interest.</p> <p>The reason the Zimbabwean president wavers between reconciliation and revenge is that there is disquiet among many in Zanu-PF - including Msika, who ordered the occupations to stop less than a fortnight ago - that he is going about land reform in the wrong way. But their concern is electoral rather than moral.</p> <p>An election is scheduled for May - although it is not likely to take place until July, and the party's defeat in the referendum has taught it that it is no longer invincible. It has come to consider itself not only as the natural party of government but the only party of government. In the past, opposition has either been hopelessly divided or crippled by ethnic associations that were unable to reconcile disparate forces. Now the MDC has emerged, bringing together everyone from the trade union movement to the white farmers, who want a change of government. Zanu-PF has not delivered and is running out of wriggle room. It has no money left to buy off dissenters and there are few minorities left to persecute. Now it is desperate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The funeral of white farmer David Stevens took place on Tuesday as a British-born man forced to flee Zimbabwe called on Tony Blair to intervene in the crisis. Mr Stevens was abducted and shot when squatters invaded his farm on 15 April. He was the first white farmer to die in the violence in the country where up to 1,000 farms have been occupied by veterans of the independence war since February in a political row over land redistribution. Some of the families who fled the Macheke district near Marondera in the wake of Mr Stevens' murder have returned to their homes. About 45 farmers and their families, out of about 80 who fled, were given a police escort back to their land yesterday. But mobs have continued to attack farms, stepping up attacks on black farm workers and torching a tobacco barn in the east of the country. An unspecified number of workers were being treated at a hospital in the provincial centre of Marondera, 45 miles east of the capital Harare, the Commercial Farmers Union said. The extent of their injuries was unclear. Stephen Murray, who arrived back in Britain after being forced to flee for his life, told how he and his wife feared for their lives after they were tied up and robbed by squatters in their home. He warned the situation could be worsening in the African country where he had left his daughter and son-in-law trapped on their remote farm surrounded by 200 squatters. Mr Murray, 64, originally from Liverpool, has lived in Zimbabwe for 35 years. He said: \"Any reports of tension lifting in the country are rubbish. \"Mugabe is laughing at the British Government because he knows they won't do anything.\" Talks aimed at resolving the crisis are due to be held in London on Thursday by the British Government and an official delegation from Zimbabwe. There have been some signs of an easing in tension. Armed farm occupiers withdrew from a homestead near Mvurwi, 75 miles north of Harare, freeing farm manager Duncan Hamilton and two women who were trapped in the house overnight, it was reported. A spokesman for United Nation Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was in regular contact with Mr Mugabe, but was not planning any further intervention in what he regarded as \"a domestic matter\" for Zimbabwe. \"The Secretary-General met with President Mugabe in Havana. They have been in contact several times since then and President Mugabe has briefed the Secretary-General about what is happening there,\" spokesman Patrick Heyford told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"The Secretary-General has encouraged him to find a peaceful solution to the problem in that country. \"This situation is essentially a domestic matter for Zimbabwe.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Combining a fluid watercolour technique with the dry textures of pastel and crayon and even oil paint - \"I use a bit of everything\" - Foreman's illustrations have a luminosity that can rise from the page like a morning mist, creating atmospheric shifts of mood and colour. But the key to his work is draughtsmanship. He makes few concessions to the very young: \"I don't think about 'age groups'.\" But his drawing is easy to read, and his line - usually soft pencil - has a subtle authority that delivers truckloads of information with eloquent economy. </p> <p>He's one of a handful of contemporary children's illustrators whose work, beyond the wit and warmth you'd expect, has real breadth and integrity. </p> <p>Meeting him, it's hard to believe that his career now spans 40 years. But he had an early start, he tells me. He grew up in rural Suffolk, where his mother ran a village shop. As the only one of her paper-boys unable to ride a bike, he did his round on foot, and that was how he got to know one of the customers who was an art teacher. </p> <p>Michael, who was obsessed by drawing but \"never dreamed it could be 'a job',\" was invited to join a free Saturday class at Lowestoft Art School. Then, at 15, he left school to study painting full-time. \"So, if I'd been able to ride a bike, I'd never have heard of art school, let alone gone to one.\" He later came to London, to St Martin's and the Royal College of Art, where he studied graphics - \"illustration, as such, wasn't taught in those days\" - and where his teachers included Edward Ardizzone. He agrees he was lucky to have started art school so young, \"and luckier still,\" he says with some vehemence, \"that art schools in those pre-formaldehyde days actually taught ART - it was a rigorous training - not just painting and drawing from life, but hours of anatomy and perspective - boring at the time, but it really taught you to understand what you were looking at. But art schools have changed now. I've done a bit of teaching, but I gave it up - I felt uneasy teaching illustration to people who hadn't yet learned to draw.\" </p> <p>With an astonishing 158 books to his name, he's illustrated everything from Grimm, Andersen and Mother Goose to new fiction - including a series of books with Michael Morpurgo that range from retellings of Robin Hood and King Arthur to the forthcoming Billy the Kid, an epic story about a footballer. He's also illustrated his own texts - notably War Boy, an evocative memoir of his war-time childhood, and War Game, a profoundly moving story about the Great War - and these stunning books show to perfection the impact non-fiction for children can have. </p> <p>As a student, he did lots of freelance work, learning \"to respond instantly to text\" by drawing for newspapers, and also assisting the police in their inquiries, drawing female suspects \"in the days when Identikit only did men\". And he was still a student when his first book - The General, a pacifist tale - was published in 1960. </p> <p>\"In the US, it was labelled \"a Communist tract for the nursery,\" he laughs, \"but here it got terrific reviews and I really thought I'd cracked it.\" But it was years before he got another book accepted and, in the meantime, with a travel scholarship he worked as a \"commercial artist\", on commissions that took him, literally, all round the world. </p> <p>\"A fantastic education in itself,\" he says as he shows me sketchbooks he kept on those travels, bursting with exquisite drawings: figures, landscapes, architectural details, wildlife studies. He still travels a lot with authors to research locations. \"It's part of the deal criss-crossing the globe with the likes of Madhur Jaffrey, Edna O'Brien, Kiri te Kanawa and Terry Jones,\" he laughs. \"We're doing the story of the Crusades - but we've finished the first volume, and we still haven't got beyond Calais.\" </p> <p>We talk in Foreman's west London studio, in the garden of his elegant 18th-century house. In one corner his youngest son, Jack, is immersed in homework, surrounded by books. There's a strong resemblance between father and son, and, as Foreman talks about his childhood, 13-year-old Jack provides a sort of visual flashback . . . apart from the spacious surroundings and the books, that is. </p> <p>\"I grew up completely without books, apart from the family Bible. I never read any fairy tales or classics until I was an adult, all we ever had was comics . . . No television either,\" he adds for good measure. \"If we wanted entertainment, we hung around the fish shop,\" he says, warming to his theme. \"It was the only place that was lit up at night.\" </p> <p>Coming late to literature meant that, as an illustrator, he could approach fairy tales and classics with a fresh eye, with none of the visual baggage that most of us carry from childhood. So what were his influences? Other artists? \"No, not really . . . as a painting student I'd tended towards abstract expressionism . . .\" </p> <p>He listens patiently while I suggest there might be an echo of Rackham in his early work, or Dulac, perhaps, in his sumptuous, romantic illustrations for The Arabian Nights? He admires them, but sees Rackham as more of \"a line merchant,\" while Dulac is \"more painterly . . . allowing the paint to make its own edges,\" and, yes, he concedes, \"that's something I try to do\". </p> <p>But the influence he readily acknowledges is that of Brueghel and Bosch. \"It's the period detail - the difference between cheap and expensive clothing . . . in a crowd, that lets you see things from both sides. In big battle scenes, like King Arthur, you see the knights in all their fine armour, but they're not in the thick of it: follow the perspective, and you'll find some poor little sod, who didn't want to be there, anyway, with his head split.\" </p> <p>And does the work get easier? \"No. In many ways I keep making it more difficult for myself, trying to make things more real - not in a literal, photographic sense, but in an emotional sense . . . telling a story by capturing the essence of the situation, giving it some meaning. Ardizzone did it, not just in books, but also as a war artist. It's a question of creating another world, believable in its own right. Quentin Blake does it too - it's all in the drawing.\" </p> <p>The Foremans have a second home in St Ives. Cornwall is a \"rich source of inspiration,\" and his recent illustrations for The Merrymaid of Zennor, by Cornish poet Charles Causley, vigorously reflect both the harsh realities and the haunting magic of the place. </p> <p>Interestingly, he's about to start work on The Wind In The Willows - another classic he missed out on as a young child. Boldly uprooting it from the home counties, he's setting that, too, in the Cornish landscape, which, he says, Grahame also knew and loved. </p> <p>Soft-spoken, easygoing and straightforward, the only mystery about Foreman is how does he find the time for such a colossal output, with so many other commitments? He's currently involved with the film version of The Rainbow Bear - \"I'm having to draw to music now!\" he says, explaining the vast musical score on his desk - and he runs Ambit, the arts magazine. \"No mystery,\" says his wife, Louise. \"It's a struggle to stop him working - even on Christmas Day.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Michael Foreman will be giving a talk and slide show at Random House in London, SW1 on Thursday May 18 at 6.30pm.

He agrees he was lucky to have started art school so young, \"and luckier still,\" he says with some vehemence, \"that art schools in those pre-formaldehyde days actually taught ART - it was a rigorous training - not just painting and drawing from life, but hours of anatomy and perspective - boring at the time, but it really taught you to understand what you were looking at. But art schools have changed now. I've done a bit of teaching, but I gave it up - I felt uneasy teaching illustration to people who hadn't yet learned to draw.\" With an astonishing 158 books to his name, he's illustrated everything from Grimm, Andersen and Mother Goose to new fiction - including a series of books with Michael Morpurgo that range from retellings of Robin Hood and King Arthur to the forthcoming Billy the Kid, an epic story about a footballer. He's also illustrated his own texts - notably War Boy, an evocative memoir of his war-time childhood, and War Game, a profoundly moving story about the Great War - and these stunning books show to perfection the impact non-fiction for children can have. As a student, he did lots of freelance work, learning \"to respond instantly to text\" by drawing for newspapers, and also assisting the police in their inquiries, drawing female suspects \"in the days when Identikit only did men\". And he was still a student when his first book - The General, a pacifist tale - was published in 1960. \"In the US, it was labelled \"a Communist tract for the nursery,\" he laughs, \"but here it got terrific reviews and I really thought I'd cracked it.\" But it was years before he got another book accepted and, in the meantime, with a travel scholarship he worked as a \"commercial artist\", on commissions that took him, literally, all round the world. \"A fantastic education in itself,\" he says as he shows me sketchbooks he kept on those travels, bursting with exquisite drawings: figures, landscapes, architectural details, wildlife studies. He still travels a lot with authors to research locations. \"It's part of the deal criss-crossing the globe with the likes of Madhur Jaffrey, Edna O'Brien, Kiri te Kanawa and Terry Jones,\" he laughs. \"We're doing the story of the Crusades - but we've finished the first volume, and we still haven't got beyond Calais.\" We talk in Foreman's west London studio, in the garden of his elegant 18th-century house. In one corner his youngest son, Jack, is immersed in homework, surrounded by books. There's a strong resemblance between father and son, and, as Foreman talks about his childhood, 13-year-old Jack provides a sort of visual flashback . . . apart from the spacious surroundings and the books, that is. \"I grew up completely without books, apart from the family Bible. I never read any fairy tales or classics until I was an adult, all we ever had was comics . . . No television either,\" he adds for good measure. \"If we wanted entertainment, we hung around the fish shop,\" he says, warming to his theme. \"It was the only place that was lit up at night.\" Coming late to literature meant that, as an illustrator, he could approach fairy tales and classics with a fresh eye, with none of the visual baggage that most of us carry from childhood. So what were his influences? Other artists? \"No, not really . . . as a painting student I'd tended towards abstract expressionism . . .\" He listens patiently while I suggest there might be an echo of Rackham in his early work, or Dulac, perhaps, in his sumptuous, romantic illustrations for The Arabian Nights? He admires them, but sees Rackham as more of \"a line merchant,\" while Dulac is \"more painterly . . . allowing the paint to make its own edges,\" and, yes, he concedes, \"that's something I try to do\". But the influence he readily acknowledges is that of Brueghel and Bosch. \"It's the period detail - the difference between cheap and expensive clothing . . . in a crowd, that lets you see things from both sides. In big battle scenes, like King Arthur, you see the knights in all their fine armour, but they're not in the thick of it: follow the perspective, and you'll find some poor little sod, who didn't want to be there, anyway, with his head split.\" And does the work get easier? \"No. In many ways I keep making it more difficult for myself, trying to make things more real - not in a literal, photographic sense, but in an emotional sense . . . telling a story by capturing the essence of the situation, giving it some meaning. Ardizzone did it, not just in books, but also as a war artist. It's a question of creating another world, believable in its own right. Quentin Blake does it too - it's all in the drawing.\" The Foremans have a second home in St Ives. Cornwall is a \"rich source of inspiration,\" and his recent illustrations for The Merrymaid of Zennor, by Cornish poet Charles Causley, vigorously reflect both the harsh realities and the haunting magic of the place. Interestingly, he's about to start work on The Wind In The Willows - another classic he missed out on as a young child. Boldly uprooting it from the home counties, he's setting that, too, in the Cornish landscape, which, he says, Grahame also knew and loved. Soft-spoken, easygoing and straightforward, the only mystery about Foreman is how does he find the time for such a colossal output, with so many other commitments? He's currently involved with the film version of The Rainbow Bear - \"I'm having to draw to music now!\" he says, explaining the vast musical score on his desk - and he runs Ambit, the arts magazine. \"No mystery,\" says his wife, Louise. \"It's a struggle to stop him working - even on Christmas Day.\" \u0095 Michael Foreman will be giving a talk and slide show at Random House in London, SW1 on Thursday May 18 at 6.30pm.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Neve Campbell is curled up, shoeless, in an armchair in London's Dorchester hotel, and she is smoking. \"Smoking!\" A whisper goes up in the press suite next door, until someone remembers she is Canadian, not American, and it can't be read as an act of protest. </p> <p>Campbell is small and sensible; the PR machine around her is big and absurd and whirring because Scream 3, the conclusion to Wes Craven's horror trilogy in which Campbell survives successive stabbing attempts while sending up the genre, premiered in London the night before. Since then she has been confined to a hotel suite, padding about in stretch fabrics while the studio people flash through the corridors, marshalling journalists. </p> <p>\"I don't enjoy all this, the circus,\" says Campbell, hugging herself further into the chair. \"I was never going to be an actor. I was going to be a classical ballerina. This all just happened.\" Her third outing as Sidney Prescott sees her back on form as the terrorised victim whose friends keep dying, or trying to kill her. The denouements have become weaker, but Scream 3 is as funny and as scary as its predecessors. Campbell was 23 when she was first cast in the role. With each instalment her haircuts have got sharper, her action sequences longer and more demanding: in Scream 3 she has a fight scene that borrows heavily from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There are other changes too. Campbell is now on an equal footing with Courtney Cox, who was the only name in the cast of the first Scream in 1996. </p> <p>\"We shot the first film outside San Francisco in the summer. We were all staying in the same hotel, shooting really weird hours, so we were hanging out all the time and we had a blast. We all just really hit it off and that's part of why that movie was so successful, because the energy between us was really good. Doing this film felt like returning to summer camp.\" </p> <p>Without make-up, Campbell is freckled and studenty, pretty in an unobtrusive way and prone to an earnest frown that comes from a determination to see things positively. </p> <p>While in Britain she plans to visit her father's native Glasgow for the first time and meet the aunts and uncles living there. Gerry Campbell emigrated to Canada as a child and after becoming a high school drama teacher, married Marnie Neve, a Dutch psychologist. They divorced when Neve was a baby and she and her older brother grew up with their father in Toronto. \"I was brought up in a very Scottish and Dutch atmosphere. I was surrounded by a European culture.

      "bodyText": "Neve Campbell is curled up, shoeless, in an armchair in London's Dorchester hotel, and she is smoking. \"Smoking!\" A whisper goes up in the press suite next door, until someone remembers she is Canadian, not American, and it can't be read as an act of protest. Campbell is small and sensible; the PR machine around her is big and absurd and whirring because Scream 3, the conclusion to Wes Craven's horror trilogy in which Campbell survives successive stabbing attempts while sending up the genre, premiered in London the night before. Since then she has been confined to a hotel suite, padding about in stretch fabrics while the studio people flash through the corridors, marshalling journalists. \"I don't enjoy all this, the circus,\" says Campbell, hugging herself further into the chair. \"I was never going to be an actor. I was going to be a classical ballerina. This all just happened.\" Her third outing as Sidney Prescott sees her back on form as the terrorised victim whose friends keep dying, or trying to kill her. The denouements have become weaker, but Scream 3 is as funny and as scary as its predecessors. Campbell was 23 when she was first cast in the role. With each instalment her haircuts have got sharper, her action sequences longer and more demanding: in Scream 3 she has a fight scene that borrows heavily from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There are other changes too. Campbell is now on an equal footing with Courtney Cox, who was the only name in the cast of the first Scream in 1996. \"We shot the first film outside San Francisco in the summer. We were all staying in the same hotel, shooting really weird hours, so we were hanging out all the time and we had a blast. We all just really hit it off and that's part of why that movie was so successful, because the energy between us was really good. Doing this film felt like returning to summer camp.\" Without make-up, Campbell is freckled and studenty, pretty in an unobtrusive way and prone to an earnest frown that comes from a determination to see things positively. While in Britain she plans to visit her father's native Glasgow for the first time and meet the aunts and uncles living there. Gerry Campbell emigrated to Canada as a child and after becoming a high school drama teacher, married Marnie Neve, a Dutch psychologist. They divorced when Neve was a baby and she and her older brother grew up with their father in Toronto. \"I was brought up in a very Scottish and Dutch atmosphere. I was surrounded by a European culture. Then suddenly I find myself in somewhere like LA, where blacks and whites don't mix and there's racism like I've never seen before.\" She arrived in LA two weeks after the earthquake in 1994 and started hawking her portfolio around agents' offices.

They come across it on a number of occasions but do not have space within the course to talk to sufferers or carers about the experience beyond discussing what drug to administer when. </p> <p>\"It is not just a matter of understanding how people feel but how they view things - what it is actually like to live with the sword of Damocles hanging over you or to care for somebody - your nearest and dearest - who is dying, or to have to tell somebody they have a terminal illness.\" </p> <p>For many years, Dr Meakin said, there have been fears that as medicine has become more and more science-based that there has been a danger of losing the art of medicine. In the 1970s in the US a number of people started saying, \"Hang on, can we learn something from the arts and humanities about illness and suffering and relate what we learn to the practice of medicine?\" </p> <p>Traditionally, medicine was always regarded as an art in the sense that it was based on practice, he said.

He won a \u00a320,000 prize from the Cancer Research Campaign to develop and evaluate the living with cancer module. </p> <p>He was able to set up the new module because the General Medical Council's review of medical education, Tomorrow's Doctors, for the first time allowed students of medicine to opt to do courses in areas that were non-medical but related to medicine. </p> <p>The course, which consists of interactive small group sessions, is taught by doctors, a professional artist who has recovered from cancer, a drama teacher, a psychotherapist, and the widow of Martyn Harris, a national newspaper journalist who died from leukaemia. </p> <p>It involves students studying pieces of writing about the experience of living with and dying from cancer. It also requires them to critically examine paintings depicting the experience of having cancer and evaluate the film Shadowlands, which chronicles the death from cancer of CS Lewis's wife. Caroline Heler, Martyn Harris's widow, leads a seminar on why people write about having cancer and how it helps them face up to their illness. </p> <p>\"Caroline is a remarkable woman,\" said Dr Meakin. \"She is very brave and extremely open with the students, so much so that on one of the first courses the students were completely nonplussed by it.

      "bodyText": "An investigation into allegations that the jury in the murder trial of Tony Martin was \"nobbled\" is to be launched today by the lord chancellor's department. Officials will meet at Norwich crown court to discuss suggestions that members of the jury felt intimidated into convicting the Norfolk farmer of murder at the end of his trial last week. The sentencing to life imprisonment of the man who shot two burglars at his isolated farmhouse has sparked a nationwide debate about the rights of householders to defend their property and the level of policing in rural areas. A group of Conservative MPs warned yesterday that a breakdown of law and order in the countryside was a \"real possibility\" as people had lost faith in the ability of the police to protect them against criminals. Their comments came after the Guardian revealed the government's decision to increase police funding to rural areas following a Home Office commissioned report that found that spending policy had failed to take account of the special costs of policing sparsely populated areas. The four Norfolk MPs - the former cabinet ministers, Gillian Shephard (Martin's MP), and John MacGregor, as well as David Prior and Keith Simpson - have urged the government to \"look seriously\" at the consequences of the Martin case and act fast. \"People no longer have confidence in the ability of the police to defend them and their property,\" their statement said. \"They are, as a consequence, likely to be tempted to take the law into their own hands, as the Martin case, and its aftermath, have demonstrated. Many are saying that, like Tony Martin, they too would have defended themselves if the police were unable to help them.\" The MPs added: \"Ministers must put right their neglect of rural policing, and fast ... action is needed now.\" Jim Wilson, chairman of the Norfolk police authority, called for greater clarity in the law on self defence. In a letter to the Norwich-based Eastern Daily Press he said: \"The minds of householders would be set at rest if our legislators could define with greater clarity the law which governs a citizen's right to defend his home and property.\" Martin, 55, was found guilty by a majority verdict of murdering 16-year-old Fred Barras and of attempting to murder Brendon Fearon, another burglar, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The farmer was cleared of attempting to murder Mr Fearon and of possessing a pump-action shotgun with intent to endanger life. Martin claimed he acted in self defence after he found the burglars inside his home. Last night, the farmer's lawyers said they would launch an appeal at the high court on Friday. They are conducting their own investigation into the allegations of jury intimidation following a call to a local radio station by a woman claiming to have been on the jury. The radio station, Broadland 102 FM, insisted that the woman caller had not spoken of being \"intimidated, pressured or nobbled\". A spokeswoman said the caller claimed the trial had \"changed her life\" and that now she felt \"frightened to leave her house\" because of what she had heard during the trial. Michael Ballinger, one of Martin's legal team, said it was important to \"get to the bottom\" of the allegations. \"We shall be talking to the court,\" he said. \"Our first aim is to get to the bottom of this.

      "body": "<p>Miami residents have threatened to turn the city into a ghost town for the day in protest at the seizure of Elian Gonzalez, the six-year-old Cuban boy in a custody dispute between his Miami relatives and his father.</p> <p>Dozens of businesses pledged to shut their doors, many workers said they would stay home and the protest organisers urged parents to keep children home from school. But city officials said Miami airport, the port of Miami, police and schools would operate as normal. Many non-Cuban businesses also said they expected to open as usual.</p> <p>Four Florida Marlins baseball players and several coaches - all of Cuban descent - said they plan to miss tonight's game in San Francisco to honour the protest. Their manager said they would be excused with pay for the day. While many non-Cuban businesses said they expected no interruptions in service, several workers in Little Havana and demonstrators outside the house, where Elian stayed, said that much of the city would not be spared from the effects of the protest.</p> <p>\"It's going to look like a ghost town,\" said Antonio Pazos, 45, a warehouse clerk who said he would go to work. The owner of the El Paisa Cafeteria, a few blocks from the Gonzalez home, said he felt pressured to go along with the strike but would stay open. \"I am Hispanic, but that doesn't mean I have to agree,\" said the Nicaraguan owner. \"I have to pay my rent, I have to pay my bills.\"</p> <p>Attorney general Janet Reno has expressed \"no regrets whatsoever\" for the raid that returned Elian to his Cuban father, in advance of an expected grilling today from Republicans on Capitol Hill. The attorney general was to meet a bipartisan group of 11 senators selected by senate majority leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican.</p> <p>The session coincides with the start of preliminary inquiries in the Senate and the House of Representatives into Saturday's pre-dawn raid. Jesse Helms, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, decried \"the grotesque image\" of the seizure at gunpoint. The administration in turn accused Republicans of playing politics, with White House spokesman Joe Lockhart denouncing \"wild statements\" by senior Republicans.</p> <p>\"Everyone's got to take a deep breath,\" Mr Lockhart said. Ms Reno yesterday defended her actions in several television interviews. \"It was time he was returned to his daddy,\" Ms Reno said of the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor. She said she struggled with different options before giving the go-ahead for the seizure - including \"going up there myself\" to claim the boy.</p> <p>Elian was removed from his great uncle's home in Miami on Saturday, where he has been staying since his rescue from the Atlantic last November. He is currently in seclusion with his father at Andrews Air Force base. Despite the outrage voiced by Elian's Miami relatives, most Americans said they supported the government's decision to return the boy to his father. But Elian has to stay in the US until at least a May 11 hearing on an application for asylum he filed, when he was staying with his Miami relatives.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Miami residents have threatened to turn the city into a ghost town for the day in protest at the seizure of Elian Gonzalez, the six-year-old Cuban boy in a custody dispute between his Miami relatives and his father. Dozens of businesses pledged to shut their doors, many workers said they would stay home and the protest organisers urged parents to keep children home from school. But city officials said Miami airport, the port of Miami, police and schools would operate as normal. Many non-Cuban businesses also said they expected to open as usual. Four Florida Marlins baseball players and several coaches - all of Cuban descent - said they plan to miss tonight's game in San Francisco to honour the protest. Their manager said they would be excused with pay for the day. While many non-Cuban businesses said they expected no interruptions in service, several workers in Little Havana and demonstrators outside the house, where Elian stayed, said that much of the city would not be spared from the effects of the protest. \"It's going to look like a ghost town,\" said Antonio Pazos, 45, a warehouse clerk who said he would go to work. The owner of the El Paisa Cafeteria, a few blocks from the Gonzalez home, said he felt pressured to go along with the strike but would stay open. \"I am Hispanic, but that doesn't mean I have to agree,\" said the Nicaraguan owner. \"I have to pay my rent, I have to pay my bills.\" Attorney general Janet Reno has expressed \"no regrets whatsoever\" for the raid that returned Elian to his Cuban father, in advance of an expected grilling today from Republicans on Capitol Hill. The attorney general was to meet a bipartisan group of 11 senators selected by senate majority leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican. The session coincides with the start of preliminary inquiries in the Senate and the House of Representatives into Saturday's pre-dawn raid. Jesse Helms, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, decried \"the grotesque image\" of the seizure at gunpoint. The administration in turn accused Republicans of playing politics, with White House spokesman Joe Lockhart denouncing \"wild statements\" by senior Republicans. \"Everyone's got to take a deep breath,\" Mr Lockhart said. Ms Reno yesterday defended her actions in several television interviews. \"It was time he was returned to his daddy,\" Ms Reno said of the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor. She said she struggled with different options before giving the go-ahead for the seizure - including \"going up there myself\" to claim the boy. Elian was removed from his great uncle's home in Miami on Saturday, where he has been staying since his rescue from the Atlantic last November. He is currently in seclusion with his father at Andrews Air Force base. Despite the outrage voiced by Elian's Miami relatives, most Americans said they supported the government's decision to return the boy to his father. But Elian has to stay in the US until at least a May 11 hearing on an application for asylum he filed, when he was staying with his Miami relatives.",

      "bodyText": "Six children were wounded by gunfire at the national zoo in Washington yesterday as a violent feud between groups of teenagers turned one of America's most visited landmarks into the scene of the country's latest shooting outrage. A hospital spokesman at Washington children's hospital said that three of the victims involved were in critical condition. A teenage boy was reported to have been shot in the head, said Brian Lee, a spokesman for the district of Columbia fire and emergency services. One girl was in a serious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest. A seventh victim, a pregnant woman, was taken to hospital after going into labour after the shooting broke out. The zoo, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution group of national museums, was holding an African-American family celebration day at the time. The ethnic origin of the victims and the shooters was not clear from early reports. As reports of the shooting broke, the street outside the zoo was rapidly filled with anxious parents and many small children who had been visiting the zoo. Sandra Edwards, who was visiting the zoo with her grandchildren when she heard the shots and saw youths fighting, said: \"I am not bringing them back. These are my grandkids. It is not safe.\" Nakisha Johnson, 17, said she saw one young man open fire after a feud between youths became violent. She said the children who were wounded were caught in the middle of the two groups of young people. \"He was just shooting at the people he was fighting,\" she said. But the bullets hit the children. Other witnesses said the shooting occurred when a bottle was thrown from one group of youths to others. A piece of glass struck a young woman in the face, and then shots rang out, the witnesses said. The city's mayor, Anthony Williams, went to the scene shortly after the incident and visited local hospitals expecting to take in casualties. The annual African-American families day at Washington zoo has been a regular Easter event for the city's black community for more than a century. The shootings come less than a week after the first anniversary of the Columbine high school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, in which two teenage boys shot 12 other students and a teacher dead before killing themselves, the worst teenage shooting incident in modern America. Vice-President Al Gore announced the shootings at a Democratic party fundraising meeting in New York, bringing gasps from members of an audience that included the actress Lauren Bacall. Mr Gore took the opportunity to press for tighter gun control laws of the kind at present being pushed by the Clinton administration but opposed by Republican leaders in Congress. \"We really have to have mandatory child safety trigger locks and photo licence IDs for the purchase of new handguns,\" Mr Gore told the crowd.",

The targeting of black farm workers, who are among the most poorly paid in the country, means there is no longer any pretence that the wave of violence across Zimbabwe has been prompted by a desire for land or racial hatred. Mr Mugabe has endorsed the land occupations, which have left five MDC activists, two white farmers and a policeman dead. Last week he branded white farmers \"enemies of the state\" for backing the MDC.",

The decision comes as the Guardian delivered a 30,000 word dossier to the minister revealing the background to the year-long investigation into the running of Britain's \u00a31bn \"green tax\". It calls on the authorities and parliament to investigate shortcomings and flaws in the law to stop the illegal dumping of waste and reform the landfill tax credit scheme which should have delivered \u00a3250m for community projects. It says that widespread reform is needed to safeguard the health of the public from illegal dumping and make dramatic progress towards the recycling rather than dumping of rubbish. The dossier, published today on the Guardian's website, reveals a disturbing picture of the operation of the tax and names local councils, trade associations and environmental bodies which should be investigated by the authorities for their stewardship of the tax. It also gives the full background to the six investigations undertaken by Channel 4 and the Guardian into the illegal dumping of waste and the manipulation by waste companies of the tax credit schemes which were aimed to improve the local environment. The report names golf courses and sporting facilities which have been used for dumping. Other investigations revealed for the first time on the website include an examination of the handling of landfill tax money by Devon county council and an investigation into the refuse collection service in the south London borough of Wandsworth. The website report poses a series of questions about the competence of Entrust, a private regulatory company, responsible for supervising the \u00a3250m given to environmental bodies. It poses questions about a big serious fraud squad innvestigation into one of the environmental bodies, the Global Wildlife Trust.

      "body": "<p>Microsoft yesterday was on the brink of being stripped of its mantle as the world's most powerful computer software company, as rumours emerged that it could be split into three separate groups. </p> <p>American newspapers, including the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, agreed that US regulators wanted Microsoft to be broken up to curb the software giant's monopoly of PC software and access to the internet. The papers quoted sources close to the US justice department saying the company should be broken into two or three parts. </p> <p>The growing likelihood of a breakup alarmed Microsoft shareholders, who sent the company's shares plunging in early trading yesterday. They fell $13.38 to $65.56 (\u00a341.52), wiping $70bn off the company's market value within minutes. Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and 15% shareholder, saw his fortune slide $10.4bn to $51.5bn. </p> <p>It would be the first time since 1974 that the American justice department has forced a company to sell parts of its business because its size has made it anti-competitive. In 1974 telephone giant AT&amp;T was forced to demerge divisions of its company. </p> <p>The reports said the plan was to break up Microsoft along its product lines, which would see it forced to spin off the hugely successful Windows operating system. But the software functions that al low users to browse the internet could possibly be kept with the Windows company. </p> <p>Microsoft's decision to integrate its internet browser software, Explorer, with Windows 95 sparked the first accusations that the company was abusing its effective monopoly of the PC operating system market. Microsoft has vowed to appeal against a federal court ruling earlier this month which supported claims that it had violated competition laws. </p> <p>The court also found that Microsoft had used its dominance of the software applications market, such as word proces sors and other programmes, to protect its monopoly in the operating system market. </p> <p>Microsoft's software applications arm may become a stand-alone company as well as a separate Microsoft internet group that would include Microsoft Network, the company's internet service provider and web portal. </p> <p>The case against Microsoft has been in the courts for the past two years. The company argued that a breakup is not in the interest of the industry or its customers. Yesterday, a Microsoft spokesman said: \"The department of justice has un til April 28 to submit its remedies to the court and Microsoft has until May 10 to respond. We are confident the judicial system will rule that Microsoft's innovation is good for consumers and good for the computer industry.\" </p> <p>Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, has said the company is still open to a possible settlement. </p> <p>The decline in Microsoft shares was also driven by the release last Thursday of the company's third-quarter results, which disclosed revenue that was below analysts' expectations. The revenues were up 23% to \u00a35.66bn, but analysts had been looking for \u00a35.9bn. Failure to meet the expectations was blamed on slower sales in PCs to the corporate market. </p> <p>George Gilbert, an analyst with the Northern Trust technology fund in Chicago, said yesterday: \"The combination of the earnings figures and the anti-trust news I suspect is keeping buyers of Microsoft at bay. The earnings conference call on Thursday night was about as sombre as any [it] has held. This is the third time in the last four years they have tried to tone down estimates for the final-quarter.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Microsoft yesterday was on the brink of being stripped of its mantle as the world's most powerful computer software company, as rumours emerged that it could be split into three separate groups. American newspapers, including the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, agreed that US regulators wanted Microsoft to be broken up to curb the software giant's monopoly of PC software and access to the internet. The papers quoted sources close to the US justice department saying the company should be broken into two or three parts. The growing likelihood of a breakup alarmed Microsoft shareholders, who sent the company's shares plunging in early trading yesterday. They fell $13.38 to $65.56 (\u00a341.52), wiping $70bn off the company's market value within minutes. Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and 15% shareholder, saw his fortune slide $10.4bn to $51.5bn. It would be the first time since 1974 that the American justice department has forced a company to sell parts of its business because its size has made it anti-competitive. In 1974 telephone giant AT&amp;T was forced to demerge divisions of its company. The reports said the plan was to break up Microsoft along its product lines, which would see it forced to spin off the hugely successful Windows operating system. But the software functions that al low users to browse the internet could possibly be kept with the Windows company. Microsoft's decision to integrate its internet browser software, Explorer, with Windows 95 sparked the first accusations that the company was abusing its effective monopoly of the PC operating system market. Microsoft has vowed to appeal against a federal court ruling earlier this month which supported claims that it had violated competition laws. The court also found that Microsoft had used its dominance of the software applications market, such as word proces sors and other programmes, to protect its monopoly in the operating system market. Microsoft's software applications arm may become a stand-alone company as well as a separate Microsoft internet group that would include Microsoft Network, the company's internet service provider and web portal. The case against Microsoft has been in the courts for the past two years. The company argued that a breakup is not in the interest of the industry or its customers. Yesterday, a Microsoft spokesman said: \"The department of justice has un til April 28 to submit its remedies to the court and Microsoft has until May 10 to respond. We are confident the judicial system will rule that Microsoft's innovation is good for consumers and good for the computer industry.\" Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, has said the company is still open to a possible settlement. The decline in Microsoft shares was also driven by the release last Thursday of the company's third-quarter results, which disclosed revenue that was below analysts' expectations. The revenues were up 23% to \u00a35.66bn, but analysts had been looking for \u00a35.9bn. Failure to meet the expectations was blamed on slower sales in PCs to the corporate market. George Gilbert, an analyst with the Northern Trust technology fund in Chicago, said yesterday: \"The combination of the earnings figures and the anti-trust news I suspect is keeping buyers of Microsoft at bay. The earnings conference call on Thursday night was about as sombre as any [it] has held. This is the third time in the last four years they have tried to tone down estimates for the final-quarter.\"",

RAF bombers faced the prospect of \"a critical\" shortage of weapons and suffered from an acute lack of spare parts, according to a draft report from the national audit office on problems facing the armed forces ranging from ammunition to toilets. The report, leaked to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, echoes criticism about inadequate equipment made earlier this year by senior British commanders engaged in the Kosovo operation. \"The rate of consumption of munitions was such that munition stocks were only just adequate,\" said the report. \"Had the air campaign continued it would quickly have exhausted munitions stocks in a number of areas.\" The report also detailed problems with fuselage-mounted missiles on Royal Navy Harriers that suffered from proximity to heat and vibration during take-off and were so troublesome that within two months of the 78-day bombing campaign over half the missile stocks were unserviceable. British aircraft dropped over 1,000 weapons during Nato's air assault on Serbia, including 531 cluster bombs. The report said the MoD failed to learn lessons from Bosnia over the need for secure communications. At times, the only functioning communications available were civilian mobile phones and satphones with the result that the 4th armoured brigade had to compete with others, including the media, to get \"on air\". The report pointed to some improvements. It said food for British troops was \"of high quality and good variety\". But it said there were insufficient chefs, a shortage of portable toilets, and that legs of 10,000 new camp beds bought by the MoD were prone to collapse. There was a shortage of signals personnel, logistics experts, and medical staff, leading to what the NAO describes as \"an adverse implication for morale and retention\". It said that while there were \"vast surpluses\" of some medical stores - for example, 47 years' supply of ampicillin injectors - the MoD sent 6,000 \"morphine autojets\" to the Balkans in March 1999 with a shelf life lasting until April 1999. The report revealed that the MoD estimates the Kosovo operation will have cost it \u00a3810m by the year 2003, though this excludes the cost of replacing some categories of weapons. Despite their problems, the success of British peacekeeping troops in Kosovo was a \"testament to [their] professionalism and commitment\", the report said. However, it raises further questions about the ability of Britain's armed forces to conduct the kind of expeditionary operations emphasised in the 1998 strategic defence review. Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs and defence spokesman said yesterday that the report, if published in the same form, would be \"extremely disturbing\". Shadow defence secretary Iain Duncan Smith said soldiers had complained of a \"just in time\" supply system. He said: \"You either have to say we can do fewer things and we want to do those things we do well, or you have to say we need to spend more money.\" An MoD spokesman said: \"Kosovo remains a very successful campaign which met all its objectives without a single combat casualty. \"Overall the report is very positive about the British performance and about how the lessons of previous campaigns have been learned.\" Under fire: Front line failures Bureaucratic incompetence, budget constraints and procurement failings lie behind the shortcomings suffered by the armed forces during the Kosovo war identified in the leaked national audit office report. Weapons systems \"Having deployed 16 Tornado GRI aircraft and 12 Harrier GR7 aircraft, the UK faced the prospect of a critical munitions shortage. \"RN [navy] Harrier aircraft flew with fuselage-mounted missiles which suffered from proximity to heat and vibration during take-off and recovery.

The capital costs of the trial, which are being met by the Treasury, have reached \u00a312.9m, and the running costs have hit \u00a321.9m. It costs \u00a32m a month to run Camp Zeist and this figure is expected to increase dramatically when the trial gets under way.

The trial could run for much longer than a year. The prosecution witness list is understood to run to more than 1,000 names, alongside 1,500 documents and 550 articles of evidence. The defence list may be similarly lengthy.

In perhaps a year the proceedings will be over, we will have a verdict and we will also be able to get to the truth about many other things - from the failure of airport security to the failure of British intelligence.\"</p>",

It costs \u00a32m a month to run Camp Zeist and this figure is expected to increase dramatically when the trial gets under way. The final bill will total at least \u00a3100m and, although the US has said it will help with any costs over and above those it would have taken to run the trial in Scotland, so far it has contributed only \u00a34.77m. The bulk of the money - around 80% - will come from UK reserves, with the burden of the remaining 20% falling on the Scottish executive. These figures are only estimates and the costs could rise further still. The trial could run for much longer than a year. The prosecution witness list is understood to run to more than 1,000 names, alongside 1,500 documents and 550 articles of evidence. The defence list may be similarly lengthy. And, in the event of a conviction, an appeal before five other Scottish judges in the Netherlands would push demands on time and money even higher. But time and expense is, for the families of the 270 people who died - 259 on board the Pan Am flight and 11 Lockerbie residents - an irrelevance. May 3 is a date they thought they would never see. Long wait But beyond the years of diplomatic wrangling and the staggering logistics of staging the trial there is at last the opportunity to properly scrutinise the piles of evidence. The families will finally hear in detail the circumstances surrounding their loved ones' deaths. And there will be the opportunity, whatever the verdict, for the families to have their questions answered. \"In a sense, the verdict here is almost not the important thing,\" says Dr Swire. \"Whenever we have pushed for an inquiry or other such thing we were told we couldn't have it because criminal proceedings were pending. In perhaps a year the proceedings will be over, we will have a verdict and we will also be able to get to the truth about many other things - from the failure of airport security to the failure of British intelligence.\"",

He is sending all Labour MPs a letter showing that most air traffic in Britain is already handled by private firms. The rebels claim that the \u00a31bn part privatisation of the national air traffic service (Nats) will put passenger safety at risk. Mr Prescott, deputy prime minister and secretary for the environment, transport and the regions, has been angered by a report from the Labour-controlled Commons transport select committee criticising his proposed public-private partnership as the worst possible option. He is equally angry that Labour rebels have been claiming the support of as many as 100 backbenchers. Figures he produced yesterday show that most aircraft movements are overseen by commercial contracts. In 1998 1.9m movements, more than half the total for UK airports, occurred at airports where air traffic control is not provided by Nats. Many of these airports are run by municipal councils, with contracts given to private companies. Mr Prescott said: \"There has been a misapprehension that somehow Nats controls everything in this country. It does not.

A part privatised Nats would be in an ideal position to bid for these contracts, he said. He also claimed that it was fraudulent to suggest that he was facing a huge rebellion over the issue in a fortnight's time, when the transport bill covering the part privatisation returns to the Commons for its final stages. He said the 100 or so \"rebel\" MPs, not all Labour, had only urged him to publish his response to the select committee report before the Commons debate, a pledge he had met.

      "bodyText": "Athletes coming to Britain to compete in the 2005 world championships will be in danger of damaging their health by breathing in noxious fumes from the country's largest incinerator, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. They show that the rushed scheme to build a \u00a3120m athletics stadium at Pickett's Lock in Edmonton, north London, does not appear to have taken account of a controversial plan to expand Britain's biggest waste-burning incinerator nearby. The expansion has been given the go-ahead by Nick Raynsford, the minister for London, and is now on the desk of Stephen Byers, the industry secretary, for final approval. The proposal was given initial approval before UK Athletics and Sport England, with the backing of Chris Smith, the culture and sports secretary, put forward the plan for the new sports ground. The stadium could also be the venue for the 2012 Olympics and a new stadium for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. An environmental impact study commissioned by London Waste, the company seeking to expand the incinerator, reveals that emissions from a new chimney will be concentrated on the very area where the stadium is to be built. According to the report most prevailing winds in the area come from the south-west, blowing the plume from the bigger incinerator straight on to the stadium site in the Lee Valley country park. \"As the distance from the stack increases, the ground level concentration rises to a maximum and then falls away,\" the report says. \"Depending on the wind speed, the point of maximum impact will lie some where between 500 metres and 2,000 metres from the stack.\" It goes on: \"The location of this point of maximum impact is approximately 1,200 metres to the north-east of the plant, or in the William Girling reservoir.\" This is alongside the stadium site. Alan Watson, a scientist and environmental consultant from Public Interest Consultants in Swansea, told the Guardian: \"The emissions known as NOx - or nitrate oxides similar to car exhausts - are the most likely to irritate the lungs or aggravate asthmatic conditions. \"If you are an athlete you are taking large lung fulls of air through your respiratory system.

      "bodyText": "A teachers' leader yesterday launched a blistering personal attack on Tony Blair claiming he was systematically \"dismantling' the comprehensive schools system by building on elitist education policies introduced by the Tories. Martin Johnson, the incoming president of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers and a man considered a moderate, accused the prime minister of being completely out of touch with the needs of ordinary schools, and of strengthening academic selection beyond the surviving grammar school sector. Attacking him as \"bourgeois\", he reignited the debate over Mr Blair's decision to send his two sons to a school outside his family's home borough, saying that local schools would have been just as good. In his opening address to the union's annual conference in Llandudno, north Wales, Mr Johnson singled out Mr Blair, rather than his education secretary, David Blunkett, for creating a hierarchical structure whereby some schools, such as so-called specialist and beacon schools, receive more funding than others. Specialist schools, for example, receive extra government cash to fund specialist teaching in a range of subjects, including arts, science, sports and media, and are allowed to select up to 10% of their pupils according to aptitude. This is helping to encourage academic selection by stealth, Mr Johnson told delegates. \"Grammar schools are not the only problem. The promotion of Tory innovations such as beacon schools and specialist schools... threatens to undermine the whole comprehensive secondary school system, a system... now being dismantled.\" Mr Blunkett has famously pledged \"no more selection\" but was recently forced to clarify the government's policy on selection and the fate of grammar schools, which is being left up to parents to decide. Making deliberate reference to Mr Blair's decision to send his two sons to a top-performing state school outside their original home borough of Islington, Mr Johnson said that the gap between good and poor state schools was being widened under Labour. \"The government causes a quite unequal distribution of available potential, and then lauds the schools which received great potential and converted it, and assaults with complete brutality the schools which received little potential and converted that. \"This might be the policy of a Tory prime minister; it is certainly the policy of a bourgeois prime minister. A prime minister with absolutely no understanding of how ordinary schools work... who unlike his secretary of state does not even realise that his own children's potential would have been fulfilled quite adequately in his local secondary schools.\" Stating his union's policy of unequivocal opposition to academic selection, Mr Johnson said he regretted that under Labour it was systematically being strengthened. \"We are back to selection, a more subtle form of selection, a selection which brings in the marvels and mysteries of the middle class housing market, a selection which may be by the parents, is more likely to be by the school, and certainly is nothing to do with establishing an intake which reflects the whole community served by the school.\" He said the union opposed \"the expansion of a structure of differentiated secondary schools as inequitable and damaging to teachers and pupils alike\". The conference is the only one being addressed this Easter by Mr Blunkett, who in his speech tomorrow is expected to announce \u00a3500m of funding for \"sin bins\" for disruptive pupils. Some delegates were surprised by the tone of the attack on Mr Blair. Mr Johnson has taught in some of London's most challenging schools and is the author of an acclaimed book, Failing School, Failing City. He recently appeared with the chief inspector of schools, Chris Woodhead, at the launch of an Ofsted report on inner-city schools. A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment yesterday dismissed the claim that comprehensive education was being dismantled. \"We want all schools to be centres of excellence\", he said. \"That is why we give beacon schools and specialist schools extra help so they can spread their expertise to other local schools.\"",

The attacks have led police to warn parents of the dangers of allowing their children to carry valuable cards around with them. Mr Hart said teachers were having to cope with the more sinister consequences of this latest craze. He suggested the price of the cards was also a factor in the recent spate of attacks. A starter pack of 60 cards retails at \u00a37.25. Mr Hart said: \"They are just outside the sort of money that a child might get for pocket money and that is leading to children fighting each other for them and these extreme incidents such as knifing and stabbing of young children.\" But a spokesperson for Wizards of Coast UK, the manufacturers, defended the craze as an aid to social interaction. The company expressed \"extreme concern\" at the attacks and in response has set up a Pokemon trading card game league which it claims provides a \"controlled, supervised environment for children to play, collect and swap cards\". The Pokemon phenomenon began life four years ago as a Japanese electronic game. Since then it has boomed into a multi-million pound empire boasting collectors' cards, computer games, soft toys and plastic figures.",

Sixteen months ago I was approached by the Hayward Gallery, interested to hear my ideas about the art of sound. Tantalised as I was by the prospect of curating an exhibition called Sonic Boom, I harboured a few misgivings. Despite a visual art training, my background is in music. My personal memory archive of seeing Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix and the Doors has left me less than enchanted by the dilettante end of sound dabbling. The question to answer, then and now, was why look at sound?

As for the past, the marriage of music with the plastic arts has a history that goes back at least as far as the Italian Futurists at the beginning of the 20th century.

A frail looking painter from Milan named Luigi Russolo was so enthused by the unprecedented racket of modern warfare and urban life that he built a collection of noise-making machines, christening them with names like Burster, Gurgler, Hisser and Whistler. His legacy has been kept on life support by Art of Noise, who appropriated the title he gave to his manifesto and formed a pop band. </p> <p>Now Russolo's star is in the ascendant. Nearly 100 years ago, the Futurists predicted that electricity and machines would change the world beyond all recognition. The truth of that was evident in the performance I witnessed in Tokyo, a have-laptop-will-travel aesthetic unthinkable even a decade ago. It was also illustrated by Ryoji Ikeda's sold-out London performance in January, a concert directed by Ikeda from within the audience using a laptop computer and zip drive. Based in Tokyo but living in a state of permanent jet lag, Ikeda has been quietly building a global reputation for himself as one of the new gods of audio-visual minimalism. While the musical mainstream wanders into a dead end street of boy bands and Shania Twain, electronic nomads such as Ikeda, Pan Sonic and Scanner are working in outlets as diverse as clubs, radio, theatre performances, gallery exhibitions and huge annual events such as Barcelona's Sonar Festival. Ikeda even contributed to the Mind Zone in the Millennium Dome, though he might want to forget about that. </p> <p> This dismantling of the wall between pop music and high art was begun by musicians such as Brian Eno in the late 60s, helped by the education system of the time.

With this background, Eno can now float freely between the worlds of U2, Pavarotti, art galleries and lecture halls. A natural choice for Sonic Boom, Eno will be a neighbour in the Hayward Gallery to the likes of Ikeda, Mariko Mori, the Japanese artist who dresses herself up as a pop icon or sci-fi shamaness in her own videos, and John Oswald, the Canadian composer who makes complex music with thousands of tiny fragments sampled from the work of artists such as the Grateful Dead, Dolly Parton, Michael Jackson and Igor Stravinsky.

Sitting quietly in rows of chairs, listening to a group of musicians pluck, bang and scrape for a designated time is a fairly recent notion in the history of music.

Protests from environmental groups, the Kurdish people and Syria and Iraq have all been overruled by No 10 which wants Turkey to join the EU and seeks stronger trade links including new arms sales. Three law professors have warned the government that it will be in breach of international law if it proceeds as planned. They say Turkey is obliged to consult countries downstream of the project before starting it - Syria and Iraq - something that Ankara has refused to do. James Crawford, from Cambridge University, Philippe Sands, of London University, and Laurence Boiusson de Chazournes, of the University of Geneva, say that supporting Turkey would put Britain in breach of international law too. The UN Charter, the International Court of Justice and the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses all required consultation and constructive negotiations before water rights of downstream neighbours were affected. Richard Caborn, the trade minister, was sent a copy of the legal opinion last week by Friends of the Earth, which said that it could not believe that the government would want to ignore its obligations and thus risk facing high court proceedings. The letter said: \"Parliament cannot be supposed to have intended the Export Credit Guarantee Act to be exercised so as to support an enterprise in breach of international law.\" Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, announced in December that the UK was minded to support the dam, but expressed concerns about the fate of 36,000 Kurds who had not been consulted about the loss of their homes, farms and jobs.

It would drown 80 settlements including the ancient town of Hasankeyf, a centre of Kurdish culture where there are many historic buildings and cave dwellings, some still occupied. The dam would cover 2,000 sq kilometres, the thin reservoir more than 120 metres deep snaking 135 miles to the north through the mountains. Turkey broke off talks with its neighbours about its plans to build a series of dams on the Tigris and Euphrates nearly 10 years ago, and last year said it was not prepared to re-open them. Syria, Iran and the League of Arab States have all complained to the Foreign Office about the British government's support for the project and warned that it could lead to conflict. Tony Juniper, the FoE policy director, said: \"Our legal advice is that Turkey has binding obligations to consult its downstream neighbours prior to going ahead with this dam.

      "body": "<p>Call it a compulsion to paint. On mornings when the light is good, \"the north light, a cool light without reflections\", the painter known as Balthus is eased into a wheelchair, wrapped up against the chill spring air, and pushed by his \"Chinese slave\" from his Swiss chalet across the road to his studio. At 92, purblind and hunched, sucking on his cigarettes, he sometimes paints till five in the afternoon, although he doesn't always remember that he has. His Japanese wife, Setsuko, some 30 years younger, says he always has painting on his mind. </p> <p>The studio, an old stable, is kept at oven temperature. A huge window frames the mountain and, in the pool of light, we are shown two large canvases. The landscape is complete; the nude of a young girl awaits finishing touches. He has been working on A Midsummer Night's Dream for two years; it is the excuse for our visit. His sources are scattered among the paint pots: there's a reproduction of Poussin's Sleeping Nymphs Surprised by Satyrs, along with photos of his long-time model, a local doctor's daughter, now 17. The Balthus and the Poussin will hang side by side in the National Gallery in June in a show called Encounters - New Art from Old. </p> <p>In his 1935 self-portrait, The King of the Cats, Balthus - or to use his real name, Comte Balthazar Klossowski de Rola - is aristocratic and dandyish, a sleek and handsome 6ft 2in, a cat nuzzling against his leg. \"I've always loved cats. I was always surrounded by them,\" he says. It has been a mutual lifetime attraction; as a boy, he was followed by them. His first published work, at 13, was a series of illustrations for a story about cats. A cat observes our arrival from a high chalet window; a Burmese sidles through the living room while we talk. </p> <p>There is no other 20th-century painter quite like Balthus. He resolutely ignored the art-isms of his time - \"I was never interested in other modern painters because I had my painting, which preoccupied my mind more than anything else.\" From the 30s to the 50s he created an extraordinary series of realist paintings, often of adolescent girls, often charged with their own mysterious atmosphere, often erotic. \"You can't explain why a painting is good or not,\" he says. \"You have to look at it.\" </p> <p>His work is where you'd expect it - in the Louvre, the Tate, the Metropolitan in New York, and in the hands of private collectors such as Billy Wilder, Mike Nichols, the Agnelli and Niarchos families. The most widely disseminated Balthus is Girl and Cat (1937), from 1989 till this month the cover of the Penguin paperback of Nabokov's Lolita. Martin Summers, his agent at London's Lefevre Gallery, advises against two things. Balthus does not like mention of paedophilia when talking about the work, and on meeting him, it somehow seems irrelevant. He is also \"incensed\" by biography of him by Nicholas Fox Weber, published last year, which dismisses his recent painting. </p> <p>I bring Balthus a bottle of Drambuie and a box of shortbread biscuits. Born in Paris of Polish parents, he claims to be \"a quarter Scottish\". I am invited to take tea by Setsuko, who tells me to speak loudly and deliberately into his better left ear. I seem to be liked. There are a few long pauses, his delivery is slow. Yes, he remembers the Paris exhibition in 1934 that launched his career. By painting The Guitar Lesson, he'd deliberately courted controversy. The image is of a sexual awakening; the aroused girl lies across her music teacher, pudenda exposed, guitar discarded. \"I remember I was very poor,\" he says. \"The only way to get out of that state was to make a scandal. It worked well, too well.\" </p> <p>Balthus belongs to another age, the Paris of the 30s. His parents were friends of Matisse and Bonnard. His dealer was Pierre Matisse, who chose the titles for all his paintings. He admired Bacon, counted him a friend; they agreed about painting. He was very close to Giacometti. But modern painters \"have forgotten the metier. That's why the work is always so bad.\" Balthus once sat for Lucian Freud, but was never shown the result - \"he probably wasn't pleased with it.\" The young Balthus would have painted a magical portrait of his declining self. </p> <p>It is impossible to imagine Balthus without his wife. Herself a painter, Setsuko once modelled for him. She is his guardian, his memory and sometimes probably his eyes. She organises the chalet, its Asian staff, the Chinese doctor in almost constant attendance. When she is not in the room, he looks for her, calls out for her like a little lost boy. She tidies him up for the interview, finds a silk scarf to hide the T-shirt, stands behind me to help him with the questions. She's now preparing to establish a Balthus Foundation on land near the chalet. She has just organised an elaborate 92nd birthday party for him. Bono came and sang; Tony Curtis gave him \"a bright painting\". There have only been 23 birthdays; Balthus was born on February 29. He still remembers his first birthday, the four-year-old cajoling his \"little comrades\" into covering themselves in chocolate cake while he remained spotless. </p> <p>The 92-year-old retains a sense of mischief. The first thing he asks me over tea and Easter cake - and teasingly he asks it three times - is \"Do you like Matisse?\". For the record, Balthus thinks Bonnard was infinitely the greater artist. </p> <p>\u0095 Nicholas Glass is Channel 4 News arts correspondent. His interview with Balthus is broadcast tonight at 7pm.</p>",

Malaysian officials said they knew where the hostages were being held and believed they were safe. \"We have found out the exact location,\" the defence minister, Najib Razak, said, without specifying it. Six gunmen arrived in two boats on Sunday evening on the tiny Sipadan island, a world-renowned diving spot about 20 miles off the coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah, on Borneo island, and took the hostages out to sea. The captives include nine Malaysians, three Germans, two French people, four South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and a Filipino. An American couple, James Murphy and his wife Mary, both 51, from Rochester, New York, escaped into the woods before the hostages were ordered into the boats. There have been no reports of demands by the abductors. The Philippines said a Muslim rebel group in the southern Philippines might be responsible. Its defence chief said the gunmen were believed to be heading for the Philippines and the navy had been ordered to intercept them. \"They are not yet here, although there is a strong reason to believe that they are going either to Sulu or Zamboanga, where there are many Tausugs,\" Orlando Mercado said in Manila. Earlier Mr Mercado said that the kidnappers spoke Tausug, a dialect used in the Mindanao region of the southern Philippines. But the Malaysian police chief, Norian Mai, said the kidnappers also spoke English. \"From the description we obtained, we conclude they are foreign elements, fluent in English but not in the local accent,\" he said. Mr Mai said the captors stormed the police station and the local wildlife and forestry office on the island before heading for the resort. \"At the moment we still don't know what their motive is, but we are considering ransom, revenge and international politics as the possible motive,\" he said. \"Among these, we are most seriously considering international politics.\" Sabah state is on the northeastern tip of the island of Borneo, which also includes Brunei and part of Indonesia. Sipadan is near the border between the Philippines and Indonesia, and a 45-minute boat ride from the southern Philippines. Mr Mercado said he had received information from Malaysia that the kidnappers might belong to the Abu Sayyaf group, one of two rebel militias fighting for an Islamic state in the southern Philippines. Twenty Abu Sayyaf rebels are believed to have been killed on Sunday when the armed forces mounted an assault to try to free dozens of hostages held by the guerrillas in their mountain lair on Basilan island in the southern Philippines. The rebels have demanded the release of three Islamic militants held in US jails, including one believed to have been involved in the 1993 bomb attack on New York's World Trade Centre.",

According to research by the retail consultant Verdict, profit-squeezed retailers will be forced to abandon their fixation with the 25 to 34 year-old sector, traditionally suckers for brand names, and instead focus on older, more mature customers whose numbers are rising rapidly. \"They [older customers] are affluent, demanding and very poorly catered for. The prize is very significant. The penalty for trying to adhere to the old order could well be terminal,\" says the Verdict report published today. The consultant believes that retailers will have to be more focused - producing more brands and ranges over the next decade to accommodate demographic changes. Verdict, studying population trends and consumer usage of the leading retail companies, finds some good news for fashion and personal care sectors on the basis of an expected 9% rise this decade in the youngest band of customers, aged 15 to 24. However, while this group is wealthier than any young generation since the 1960s, Verdict points out that the buying behaviour of the group is more difficult to predict with any accuracy for retailers because of the \"notoriously fickle\" nature of the changing fashions and trends. With 20 to 30 year-olds decreasing in numbers, Verdict notes that the number of fortysomethings will increase over the course of the decade as the 1960 baby boomers hit middle age. Although it will be another 10 years before these reach their 50s, Verdict predicts that this \"generation of greys\" will be different to those of previous decades. None will have experienced the frugality of the war years \"but many will remember the boom times of the 1960s and 1980s\". Improvements in health mean members of this group are likely to be more energetic and have a higher level of disposal income. Verdict acknowledges that a 10-year time frame might be long, but insists that it is legitimate given the extended property leases retailers are often locked into. The retail consultant makes its predictions against what it characterises as a weakness of consumer demand - not because of less affluence but because customers are spending their money elsewhere.",

Far from being a rebel against contemporary political norms, which is the reason many people think they will support him when voting starts on Thursday, he perfectly personifies them. Whereas Tony Blair, who has presided over the making of these norms, is far more substantial than they make him seem, Livingstone, who affects to despise them, could not succeed without them.</p> <p>They favour image over substance, sound-bite over content, perception over reality, personality over programme, movement over party. Each of these priorities has been laid at the door of Blairism, and not exclusively by its enemies. There are loyal but anxious members of the Labour party who think this roughly sums up what Blair's politics have become, an impression they receive largely because the Blair machine has been so damned proficient at the business of spinning, otherwise known as news management, to pre-empt opinion. Spin persistently makes Blair seem a less substantial politician than he really is.</p> <p>But the prevalence of this view of politics has been the making of Livingstone. He is good at sound bite, image and personality, so good that he's excused from the rules and penalties of the old politics. He's a bright face in a dull world, a cheeky chappy defying the robots. He can say that capitalism has killed more people than Nazism, and nobody turns a hair. He can take the side of rioters against the City, and the City scarcely lifts an adjective against him. In this unserious world, frivolity and cynicism are combining to promise him a landslide. His most perfect postmodern trick, a brilliant insight, was to turn to his advantage the lies he told about never leaving the Labour party: yes he's a liar, the people said, but he's the first politician ever to confess to lying. What a miracle of honesty this liar is!</p> <p>In democracy, however, the people are seldom wrong. At any rate, their decisions need to be taken seriously, especially when these are so emphatic, in the teeth of a great deal of recorded damage to Livingstone's reputation, as the London vote looks set to be. Since there is no question of vote-rigging or strong-arming or other corruption, there have to be different explanations.</p> <p>One is that this isn't a very serious vote anyway. The irrelevance of the mayor's power gives the maverick outsider support he would never get if people knew he could get his hands in their pockets. That is certainly part of the answer. He is a good vehicle for the showbiz vote, on the one hand, which likes to make a pious show of its right-on independence, and the radical lefty vote on the other, combining with the Tories to give Blair a bloody nose. The set-up offers the easiest free ride to every kind of anti-regime protester, unburdened by the need to secure support for a constructive agenda.</p> <p>Alternatively, people could be reacting just as was always intended. Perhaps they are doing the duty Blair had in mind when he went for the mayoral system, which he has said he will go on supporting for other cities whatever happens in London. Maybe the loosening of centralised power, which mayorism is ultimately intended to produce, is hereby matched in the collective subconscious by a rejection of things that help build up this power, such as the tired-out party system. At the grand level, Livingstone might come to be seen as a battering-ram for the Blair experiment: a loveable rogue, a charlatan maybe - but one who inflames public demand for a newer new politics, and thereby becomes a historic hero.</p> <p>Somewhere in the support for this rootless opportunist, both these elements are at work. They might even offer consolation to Mr Blair for the coming calamity. On the one hand, the Livingstone mayoralty can be dismissed as the trivial gesture of bloody-minded Londoners, making trouble where it won't really count. On the other, it could be elevated into a serious statement, vindicating what the prime minister always said he wanted to achieve, albeit rather more slowly.</p> <p>In fact neither of these comforting explanations meets the case. Baser factors are at work, about which Blair has every reason to be anxious. They cannot be shepherded into a London ghetto. They say something systemic about the state of Britain and the state of politics, and the future the leader has to guard against.</p> <p>Although the mayor has little power to act, he has a big platform from which to speak. A stroppy mayor can make hay with his own impotence. Livingstone will be that mayor. He's a posturer and grandstander supreme. The very emptiness of his pocket will provoke his righteous demand to raid the chancellor's. If he had real power, he would have to be really accountable: if he had real power, he would never be elected. With the little bit of power he does have, which is the power to grandstand and complain, there is no reason to doubt he will use it to make war not love with central government. Constrained elsewhere by the London assembly - on the police and transport, where local power will matter - that's the only choice before him, and he has already indicated which one he will make.</p> <p>To some people, this is an attractive prospect. Could there be a better way of rubbishing Blair, and declaring against the system he controls? Control-freakery is the easiest count against him. He made a big mistake when he approved Millbank's twisting of the electoral system to keep Livingstone out and would do well to apologise, as he already has done for making the same mistake in Wales. Meanwhile, doesn't the anarchic nullity of Ken offer sweet revenge? The Tories are getting ready to play this to its maximum. Awaiting the day when Mayor Livingstone seeks readmission to the Labour party, they win both ways - either the loony lefty returns, or the control freak rules.</p> <p>But excessive control is not, in truth, the source of Blair's biggest vulnerability. Much worse would be his failure to persuade the British public that he has been engaged for three years on a serious project. He is a very serious politician, whose energies, as far as I can see, are devoted entirely to the public interest. He has a driven but selfless view of his job. If spinning is artifice verging on mendacity, he needs less spinning than any prime minister in the past 30 years. Yet he has employed more of it than all of them put together, and thereby helped engender the raucous disbelief in politics that has put Ken Livingstone where he's about to be in London.</p> <p>A vote for Livingstone is, at a deep level, an entirely negative act. The other candidates are an indifferent lot, but even the more plausible ones, such as Steve Norris and Susan Kramer, are nowhere. Rejectionism rules. It is the sea change that must most disturb a prime minister who least expected it.</p>",

Whereas Tony Blair, who has presided over the making of these norms, is far more substantial than they make him seem, Livingstone, who affects to despise them, could not succeed without them. They favour image over substance, sound-bite over content, perception over reality, personality over programme, movement over party. Each of these priorities has been laid at the door of Blairism, and not exclusively by its enemies. There are loyal but anxious members of the Labour party who think this roughly sums up what Blair's politics have become, an impression they receive largely because the Blair machine has been so damned proficient at the business of spinning, otherwise known as news management, to pre-empt opinion. Spin persistently makes Blair seem a less substantial politician than he really is. But the prevalence of this view of politics has been the making of Livingstone. He is good at sound bite, image and personality, so good that he's excused from the rules and penalties of the old politics. He's a bright face in a dull world, a cheeky chappy defying the robots. He can say that capitalism has killed more people than Nazism, and nobody turns a hair. He can take the side of rioters against the City, and the City scarcely lifts an adjective against him. In this unserious world, frivolity and cynicism are combining to promise him a landslide. His most perfect postmodern trick, a brilliant insight, was to turn to his advantage the lies he told about never leaving the Labour party: yes he's a liar, the people said, but he's the first politician ever to confess to lying. What a miracle of honesty this liar is! In democracy, however, the people are seldom wrong. At any rate, their decisions need to be taken seriously, especially when these are so emphatic, in the teeth of a great deal of recorded damage to Livingstone's reputation, as the London vote looks set to be. Since there is no question of vote-rigging or strong-arming or other corruption, there have to be different explanations. One is that this isn't a very serious vote anyway. The irrelevance of the mayor's power gives the maverick outsider support he would never get if people knew he could get his hands in their pockets. That is certainly part of the answer. He is a good vehicle for the showbiz vote, on the one hand, which likes to make a pious show of its right-on independence, and the radical lefty vote on the other, combining with the Tories to give Blair a bloody nose. The set-up offers the easiest free ride to every kind of anti-regime protester, unburdened by the need to secure support for a constructive agenda. Alternatively, people could be reacting just as was always intended. Perhaps they are doing the duty Blair had in mind when he went for the mayoral system, which he has said he will go on supporting for other cities whatever happens in London. Maybe the loosening of centralised power, which mayorism is ultimately intended to produce, is hereby matched in the collective subconscious by a rejection of things that help build up this power, such as the tired-out party system. At the grand level, Livingstone might come to be seen as a battering-ram for the Blair experiment: a loveable rogue, a charlatan maybe - but one who inflames public demand for a newer new politics, and thereby becomes a historic hero. Somewhere in the support for this rootless opportunist, both these elements are at work. They might even offer consolation to Mr Blair for the coming calamity. On the one hand, the Livingstone mayoralty can be dismissed as the trivial gesture of bloody-minded Londoners, making trouble where it won't really count. On the other, it could be elevated into a serious statement, vindicating what the prime minister always said he wanted to achieve, albeit rather more slowly. In fact neither of these comforting explanations meets the case. Baser factors are at work, about which Blair has every reason to be anxious. They cannot be shepherded into a London ghetto. They say something systemic about the state of Britain and the state of politics, and the future the leader has to guard against. Although the mayor has little power to act, he has a big platform from which to speak. A stroppy mayor can make hay with his own impotence. Livingstone will be that mayor. He's a posturer and grandstander supreme. The very emptiness of his pocket will provoke his righteous demand to raid the chancellor's. If he had real power, he would have to be really accountable: if he had real power, he would never be elected. With the little bit of power he does have, which is the power to grandstand and complain, there is no reason to doubt he will use it to make war not love with central government. Constrained elsewhere by the London assembly - on the police and transport, where local power will matter - that's the only choice before him, and he has already indicated which one he will make. To some people, this is an attractive prospect. Could there be a better way of rubbishing Blair, and declaring against the system he controls? Control-freakery is the easiest count against him. He made a big mistake when he approved Millbank's twisting of the electoral system to keep Livingstone out and would do well to apologise, as he already has done for making the same mistake in Wales. Meanwhile, doesn't the anarchic nullity of Ken offer sweet revenge? The Tories are getting ready to play this to its maximum. Awaiting the day when Mayor Livingstone seeks readmission to the Labour party, they win both ways - either the loony lefty returns, or the control freak rules. But excessive control is not, in truth, the source of Blair's biggest vulnerability. Much worse would be his failure to persuade the British public that he has been engaged for three years on a serious project. He is a very serious politician, whose energies, as far as I can see, are devoted entirely to the public interest. He has a driven but selfless view of his job. If spinning is artifice verging on mendacity, he needs less spinning than any prime minister in the past 30 years. Yet he has employed more of it than all of them put together, and thereby helped engender the raucous disbelief in politics that has put Ken Livingstone where he's about to be in London. A vote for Livingstone is, at a deep level, an entirely negative act. The other candidates are an indifferent lot, but even the more plausible ones, such as Steve Norris and Susan Kramer, are nowhere. Rejectionism rules. It is the sea change that must most disturb a prime minister who least expected it.",

Not according to Talgat Kaliyev, the embassy's first secretary: \"We understand we are in a foreign country and everyone has the right to express their opinions. But he is absolutely nothing like the people in Kazakhstan.\" Well, he would say that, wouldn't he? And plenty more besides. Worse still, the moustache is all wrong. \"He looks like some Turk or Arab,\" bemoans Kaliyev. Do say: \"Kazakhstan - isn't that that wonderful country where they love animals and treat the horse as a saint? We must go!\" Don't say: \"You're having a party? Great! When do the prostitutes arrive?\" Not to be confused with: Kazak-Staines.",

Levick and the rest made a tent out of skis and, with completely numb feet, walked two miles a day to hunt for seal meat. \"Whatever we went through later on I am sure we were never all of us so thoroughly depressed as at this time,\" writes Levick. \"Such is the effect of uncertainty and disappointment.\"</p> <p>Levick's men butchered 100 penguins and eight seals and installed themselves in Campbell's igloo creation. They melted down blubber for lamps and a stove and, without a chimney, lived blackened by soot. Food consisted of oil-laden blubber and seal meat soup and a few mouthfuls of biscuit a day. Preparing a meal, Levick writes, was \"a fearful business\". The meat froze as soon as it was stored and the men hacked at it with a geological hammer only to watch the splinters fly off in the gale.

On Friday, Peter McGregor (of Longworth, Oxfordshire, but he doesn't say which planet) wrote that if Jesus had not been a Jew, then the Jews would now be \"a relatively insignificant tribe of troublesome peasants... without any kind of developed civilisation\". Deep breath, I'm afraid there's more. \"As Jews celebrate Passover, I have a question for them: if God got them out of Egypt by miraculous intervention, what was he doing when Hitler tried to exterminate them?\" A fascinating question, but alas not an original one: Nazi concentration camp guards would ask Jewish inmates: \"So where is your Jehovah now?\"</p> <p>\u0095 Letters like Mr McGregor's do at least make Boris \"the Jackal\" Johnson sound sane, even when he drones on in both the Telegraph and Spectator about how the real problem with asylum seekers is the corrupting influence of Britain's welfare system. Boris's solution is to let all the refugees in, but to not give them any benefits. A brilliant idea - as long as you don't think about it for longer than two seconds.</p> <p>\u0095 While gun-totting farmer Tony Martin would probably have a better chance of getting elected mayor of London now than Frank Dobson does, dear old Dobbo is currently inspiring new works of art:</p> <p>\"Dobbo #96 - representations of Frank Dobson within a politico-cultural context\", it says on the back of the preview card from the Gordon Reece Gallery in London.</p> <p>\u0095 Oh dear, another leak.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Satirising New Labour and its acolytes gets harder all the time. Just take a look at this website [www.howarddawber.org.uk] set up by Howard Dawber, a puppy who failed to win the nomination for the Ashton under Lyne seat. \"Howard has been engaged since Labour Conference 1999 to Jessica,\" the website says. \"The happy news was announced at a fringe meeting by Peter Mandelson.\" How much more romantic could you get? \u0095 The Daily Telegraph's editorial pages are a well-known refuge for fruitcakes, but it still manages to print letters to the editor that leave one's gob well and truly smacked. On Friday, Peter McGregor (of Longworth, Oxfordshire, but he doesn't say which planet) wrote that if Jesus had not been a Jew, then the Jews would now be \"a relatively insignificant tribe of troublesome peasants... without any kind of developed civilisation\". Deep breath, I'm afraid there's more. \"As Jews celebrate Passover, I have a question for them: if God got them out of Egypt by miraculous intervention, what was he doing when Hitler tried to exterminate them?\" A fascinating question, but alas not an original one: Nazi concentration camp guards would ask Jewish inmates: \"So where is your Jehovah now?\" \u0095 Letters like Mr McGregor's do at least make Boris \"the Jackal\" Johnson sound sane, even when he drones on in both the Telegraph and Spectator about how the real problem with asylum seekers is the corrupting influence of Britain's welfare system. Boris's solution is to let all the refugees in, but to not give them any benefits. A brilliant idea - as long as you don't think about it for longer than two seconds. \u0095 While gun-totting farmer Tony Martin would probably have a better chance of getting elected mayor of London now than Frank Dobson does, dear old Dobbo is currently inspiring new works of art: \"Dobbo #96 - representations of Frank Dobson within a politico-cultural context\", it says on the back of the preview card from the Gordon Reece Gallery in London. \u0095 Oh dear, another leak. This time it's from the Labour party's resource centre at parliament. \"Dear colleague, it has been brought to our attention that emails have been sent to Labour MPs supposedly from the prime minister personally,\" write Veronica Martell and Liz Shannon. \"It's quite clearly a spoof, so please ignore it if you receive it.\" Yes, clearly a spoof, as we all know that Mr Tony Blair can barely even use the internet that he so often bangs on about.

Barely had the credits rolled on the last ever Twin Peaks, and there was Kyle MacLachlan, dolled up in his FBI macintosh, hawking crisps in a TV ad. The cryptic, cerebral Agent Dale Cooper, baffled by Ruffles' cheese and onion ridges: it was a sad end to a strange story. </p> <p>Rewind 18 months, to early April 1990. The debut episode of David Lynch's absurdist take on Peyton Place, which returns tonight, had just premiered, and the world was freshly smitten with the quintessential American small town behind whose soporific theme tune lurked soap opera the like of which we'd never seen before. You wanted log ladies? Backwards-talking dwarves? They were yours. Twin Peaks had the lot: sex, death, doughnuts and damn fine coffee.

      "bodyText": "With hindsight, I blame Ruffles. That was the final nail. Barely had the credits rolled on the last ever Twin Peaks, and there was Kyle MacLachlan, dolled up in his FBI macintosh, hawking crisps in a TV ad. The cryptic, cerebral Agent Dale Cooper, baffled by Ruffles' cheese and onion ridges: it was a sad end to a strange story. Rewind 18 months, to early April 1990. The debut episode of David Lynch's absurdist take on Peyton Place, which returns tonight, had just premiered, and the world was freshly smitten with the quintessential American small town behind whose soporific theme tune lurked soap opera the like of which we'd never seen before. You wanted log ladies? Backwards-talking dwarves? They were yours. Twin Peaks had the lot: sex, death, doughnuts and damn fine coffee. And right in the middle was Cooper, homing in on whoever did kill Laura Palmer between regular endorsements of the Dalai Lama. Of course, in among a cast of relative nobodies, MacLachlan had the plum gig. Except he was never the main attraction; that was always Lynch. Despite directing no more than six of an eventual 30 episodes, the show was forever his: designed after his sardonic gosh-darnit persona; informed by his obsession with diners and dirty little secrets; made off the back of his bona fide cinematic kudos.

From Friday until Tuesday, the city's three main libraries will double as polling stations while \"mobile polling\" will be introduced for the first time. Election officers will take ballot boxes to 35 old people's homes before the official polling day. Manchester is introducing early voting, next Saturday and Sunday, in shops in each of the five constituencies with an additional polling station in the city centre.

Keeper of the Armouries, Guy Wilson, rewrote part of the libretto, which will fit together with music already composed for the sell-out concert, in order to avoid breaching copyright on the work of first world war poet Maurice Baring. The rewrite followed the discovery that the text by Mr Baring, a member of the banking family and a Royal Flying Corps officer, had gone back into copyright after changes to the law. Mr Baring's work became freely available in 1995, 50 years after his death, but then went back under copyright for a further 20 years, in line with a new European 70-year rule. The Armouries would not comment on the details of the problem, but it is understood that negotiations with the poet and novelist's estate came too close to the deadline to risk a gap in the piece. A score had been composed by Karl Jenkins, a former band member of Soft Machine, to accompany the words of Mr Baring's In Memoriam AH, an elegy for his RFC colleague Auberon Herbert, Lord Lucas. \"Karl's setting was simply too good to lose,\" said Mr Wilson, whose words will now fit between extracts from Kipling and the Mahabharata.",

      "bodyText": "The declining influence of the far-right National Front was accelerated at the weekend by a government decision to ban its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from sitting in the European parliament, of which he has been a member since 1984. Mr Le Pen, 71, whose party split last year after he was involved in a power struggle with his deputy, Bruno M\u00e9gret, said he was \"mad with rage\" after reading the banning order, signed by the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, and published in the official state bulletin. The national assembly's approval of the decree is considered a formality, but Mr Le Pen said he was preparing \"a long and hard judicial battle\" for reinstatement. The timing of the ban, a week before the first congress of the diminished Front, appeared to be an attempt by the government to discredit Mr Le Pen before a series of Front celebrations, including the national Joan of Arc march in Paris on May 1. Mr Le Pen, who five years ago was seen as a possible member of a coalition government, has been struggling to regain his position on the right since he assaulted a Socialist woman candidate during campaigning for local elections in Mantes-la-Jolie, west of Paris, in 1997. He received a three-month suspended jail sentence and was disqualified from public office for a year. His mandate as a regional councillor in Marseille was removed in February, detaching him from the strongest area of the Front's anti-immigrant crusade. He also faces possible prosecution by the European parliament for the revisionist views on the Holocaust he expressed during a visit to Germany. His troubles have been compounded by the drift of far-right voters towards the breakaway Gaullist movement led by the former interior minister Charles Pasqua, who once said that his political views were close to those of Mr Le Pen. Last month Mr Le Pen said he would stand for president in 2002, for the fourth time.",

Digital sound files (often called PCM audio) usually demand more expensive editing software. Rees recommends Cool Edit, Sound Forge and Steinberg Wavelab, but most packages cost at least \u00a3200. </p> <p>It's worth trawling the audio section of <a href=\"http://download.cnet.com\">download.cnet.com</a> to see if any of the shareware and/or free software is of use. </p> <p>Bear in mind that online music and sounds are not just for music lessons. The ease of creating and sending files means flute solos and violin practice can be sent to relatives or dubbed into an existing recording. </p> <p>Language teachers can use the audio files on foreign TV news sites as listening practice; dance, drama and aerobics lessons have another source of music; and 20th-century history can be enhanced with recordings of key speeches.</p>",

Simon Rees, a former music producer, explains: \"A PC sound card normally has a basic MIDI synthesiser [recorder] on it and you can connect a MIDI cable to a keyboard to allow you to record to it.\" Cheap software such as Evolution Audio (available for just under \u00a320 at www.evolution.co.uk) enables you to edit MIDI files using a PC keyboard. Digital sound files (often called PCM audio) usually demand more expensive editing software. Rees recommends Cool Edit, Sound Forge and Steinberg Wavelab, but most packages cost at least \u00a3200. It's worth trawling the audio section of download.cnet.com to see if any of the shareware and/or free software is of use. Bear in mind that online music and sounds are not just for music lessons. The ease of creating and sending files means flute solos and violin practice can be sent to relatives or dubbed into an existing recording. Language teachers can use the audio files on foreign TV news sites as listening practice; dance, drama and aerobics lessons have another source of music; and 20th-century history can be enhanced with recordings of key speeches.",

Wearers will not be expected to donate an arm or a leg, but will merely be photographed. The museum is interested not just in a trendy, contemporary tank top/short shorts line in butterflies and bluebirds, but also in tattoos the wrinklies acquired in their own reckless youth.

Do you have any advice as to what is a \"reasonable\" amount of work for a child to do over (supposedly) school holidays?</p> <p><strong>Alwyn Morgan is a trainer and education department consultant in \"out of school hours\" learning. </strong></p> <p>If you go away during a school holiday, it's inevitable that your child cannot complete the same amount of homework that a child who doesn't go away could. Notifying schools as early as possible can help teachers when planning work to be set over the holidays. </p> <p>For young people in their last year at school, this is \"crunch\" time, with the start of revision or completion of exam syllabuses. It's not unreasonable, therefore, to expect them to strike a balance between leisure time and studying over the holiday period. </p> <p>This isn't so with younger pupils, but if children - or indeed, adults - see homework as a burden, this highlights the need for a new attitude towards out of school learning.

      "bodyText": "My child has come home with what seems to me to be a lot of homework to be completed over the Easter \"break\". Do you have any advice as to what is a \"reasonable\" amount of work for a child to do over (supposedly) school holidays? Alwyn Morgan is a trainer and education department consultant in \"out of school hours\" learning. If you go away during a school holiday, it's inevitable that your child cannot complete the same amount of homework that a child who doesn't go away could. Notifying schools as early as possible can help teachers when planning work to be set over the holidays. For young people in their last year at school, this is \"crunch\" time, with the start of revision or completion of exam syllabuses. It's not unreasonable, therefore, to expect them to strike a balance between leisure time and studying over the holiday period. This isn't so with younger pupils, but if children - or indeed, adults - see homework as a burden, this highlights the need for a new attitude towards out of school learning.

So they are quite safe,\" he explains. </p> <p>He argues that the very act of asking the question about the safety of crocodiles shows how even ideas that purport to be objective \"scientific\" fact, such as \"crocodiles are dangerous\", are actually culturally determined. \"We see crocs as dangerous man-eating killers. But in Africa south of the Sahara, they are revered as symbols of life. Crocodiles only live where there is a constant supply of water. In an environment where water is scarce, crocodiles therefore became associated with fertility and birth.\" </p> <p>But Moiser concedes that taking a large group of excited teenagers to Africa does require a very firm touch - although he prefers to administer it lightly. \"One condition of going is that they have to attend a health briefing which deals with issues like immunisation and anti-malaria strategies.\" </p> <p>Acknowledging the potential for teenage high-jinx, he also gives a take-no-prisoners legal briefing on the dangers of drink, drugs and sex. \"I warn them that getting drunk in the tropics where there is 50% humidity will result in dehydration and at best an appalling hangover, at worst death.

      "body": "<p>Britons have been traditionally reluctant to complain about bad service. How many times have you been to a restaurant, had a truly terrible meal and when asked by the waiter \"is everything alright with your food\" simply nodded in begrudging agreement? We would rather leave the restaurant vowing never to return than say to the waiter \"well actually the food tasted like old boots\". We, in the UK, are generally not powerful consumers, particularly when it comes to the services provided by the state. </p> <p>Up until now that is. A new trend is creeping into public policy. We are being asked to question the value for money we receive for goods and services provided by both the state and private enterprise. This may be enough to bring a blush to the face of every restaurant goer in the UK. </p> <p>Early evidence was in the health service, which began publishing waiting lists. It encouraged people to question the efficiency with which the service was managed. It was followed by the Department of Trade and Industry and its white paper, Modern Markets: Confident Consumers - which spurned the popularly known Rip Off Britain campaign. This encourages us to complain about bent plumbers and dodgy second-hand car dealers. Or, in the words of Kim Howells, Minister for Consumers and Corporate Affairs, \"We don't whinge much in this country as consumers - we're pretty bad at it.\" </p> <p>\"I certainly want people to complain more about goods.\" </p> <p>Now it is the turn of post-16 education and training. The Learning and Skills Bill creates a system that is demand led. The Bill ensures consumers have more say in the type of courses they have in a local area. It paves the way for learners to be able to access more information on what choices are available. It also creates a local \"fair and competitive market\" amongst school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges, further education, voluntary and community organisations and private training providers. </p> <p>In effect, the bill could turn students into informed consumers who will be offered more choice at the age of 16 and throughout life. </p> <p> But, is education and training ready for consumerism? Asking learners and employers to exercise choice is all right; but providing them with the necessary information is essential. Learning, of course, is far more complex than buying a meal. It requires feedback that can be measured and evaluated. Measuring customer satisfaction might be one option. Focusing on the satisfaction of the learner does not mean that we believe that learning is endless fun - we all know that effort is needed. As I tell my 15- year old son, he will have to learn how to conjugate French verbs and learn grammatical patterns. </p> <p>Systems for measuring satisfaction will need to focus the attention of customers like my son on whether they feel they are being taught efficiently and effectively, whether they are clear about what it is they are learning and why. This begins to point towards a relationship between the teacher and the learner that is uncommon.

      "bodyText": "Britons have been traditionally reluctant to complain about bad service. How many times have you been to a restaurant, had a truly terrible meal and when asked by the waiter \"is everything alright with your food\" simply nodded in begrudging agreement? We would rather leave the restaurant vowing never to return than say to the waiter \"well actually the food tasted like old boots\". We, in the UK, are generally not powerful consumers, particularly when it comes to the services provided by the state. Up until now that is. A new trend is creeping into public policy. We are being asked to question the value for money we receive for goods and services provided by both the state and private enterprise. This may be enough to bring a blush to the face of every restaurant goer in the UK. Early evidence was in the health service, which began publishing waiting lists. It encouraged people to question the efficiency with which the service was managed. It was followed by the Department of Trade and Industry and its white paper, Modern Markets: Confident Consumers - which spurned the popularly known Rip Off Britain campaign. This encourages us to complain about bent plumbers and dodgy second-hand car dealers. Or, in the words of Kim Howells, Minister for Consumers and Corporate Affairs, \"We don't whinge much in this country as consumers - we're pretty bad at it.\" \"I certainly want people to complain more about goods.\" Now it is the turn of post-16 education and training. The Learning and Skills Bill creates a system that is demand led. The Bill ensures consumers have more say in the type of courses they have in a local area. It paves the way for learners to be able to access more information on what choices are available. It also creates a local \"fair and competitive market\" amongst school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges, further education, voluntary and community organisations and private training providers. In effect, the bill could turn students into informed consumers who will be offered more choice at the age of 16 and throughout life. But, is education and training ready for consumerism? Asking learners and employers to exercise choice is all right; but providing them with the necessary information is essential. Learning, of course, is far more complex than buying a meal. It requires feedback that can be measured and evaluated. Measuring customer satisfaction might be one option. Focusing on the satisfaction of the learner does not mean that we believe that learning is endless fun - we all know that effort is needed. As I tell my 15- year old son, he will have to learn how to conjugate French verbs and learn grammatical patterns. Systems for measuring satisfaction will need to focus the attention of customers like my son on whether they feel they are being taught efficiently and effectively, whether they are clear about what it is they are learning and why. This begins to point towards a relationship between the teacher and the learner that is uncommon. It requires a dialogue about the best way to learn something, the sort of effort that they are willing to make and the kind of learner they are inclined to be. This requires reflective learners and responsive teachers. It is in this way that learners will become not just customers but influential customers. As I say in The New Learning Markets, about to be published by the Further Education Development Agency and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). \"The influential customer is essential in raising the quality of provision in any sector of the market. In a service as vital as education, a typical response of choosing not to consume a product, is not an acceptable solution.\" Welcome to the age of consumerism. \u0095 Caroline Mager is Policy Unit Manager at the Further Education Development Agency.

      "body": "<p>Most people would agree that we value the academic over the vocational more in theory than in practice; after all, when your pipes burst, it is the plumber not the philosopher you want to see coming through the door. The world of academia has its place, but in order to keep the wheels of industry and commerce turning as we race into the information age, our country needs the best trained, best qualified and most highly skilled workforce achievable. </p> <p>Right now - with the experiments of the past behind us and a huge amount of experience accumulated, particularly over the last 20 years - our relatively young vocational training industry is well place to deliver to employers and individuals the quality of practical education and training that both groups of customers respectively demand and deserve. </p> <p>The present model of work-based training has been achieved by taking the most successful models from other countries and then - over 20 years of trial and error - moulding them to meet the particular requirements of the United Kingdom and its employers. </p> <p>The work-based method of preparing young people and adults for employment opportunities, and upskilling and developing them within their careers, has proved beyond any doubt to be the most successful and cost-effective system in existence. A structured and supported plan of learning for the individual, coupled with real work experience on an employer's premises, enables the learner to develop their own capabilities in the world of work with the employer giving them their own particular slant on the skills and the culture required for their enterprise. This concept is supported and actively encouraged by government, industry and commerce - and it works. </p> <p>The Association of Learning Providers (ALP) was born last December, when a group of providers and representatives of established networks spontaneously decided to join together as a unified voice for all public, private and voluntary sector training organisations. </p> <p>It is a \"network of networks\", able to work closely with the government and government departments, both with employers and the large number of other agencies concerned, to drive forward solutions to strategic and policy issues, and to help achieve a truly world-class workforce for the United Kingdom. </p> <p>The only two criteria for an organisation's involvement with the Association of Learning Providers are that it should be delivering work-based training and that it should be in pos session of contracts with one or other of the government funding agencies. The association is totally inclusive, embracing the best interests of all providers and of the many hundreds of thousands of young people and adults for whom providers are directly and daily responsible. It concerns itself as little as possible with institutional structures, but devotes its energies to addressing the issues of the day. </p> <p>The Learning and Skills Council will soon replace all Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and will be operational by April 2001 with its 47 local outstations, all of which will work to a common pattern. This entirely new structure will have a \u00a36bn annual budget and amongst many other responsibilities will be the government agency for managing vocational education and training in England for young people over the age of 16. There will inevitably be slightly different arrangements in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ire land, with Scotland currently undergoing a review of its training and enterprise agencies. </p> <p>The actual delivery will be in the hands of the 2,500 providers, covering both geographical areas and the vast array of skills required by employers. </p> <p>Many of these learning providers are very small and make invaluable contributions in niche markets, covering every skill imaginable within their own local communities - from upholsterers to signwriters; from wood turners to beekeepers; from photographers to silversmiths. </p> <p>The largest work nationally, with many thousands of young people and unemployed adults on their multiplicity of programmes. Providers deliver programmes varying from help for the disadvantaged or those with special training needs, right through the spectrum of National - or Scottish - Vocational Qualifications at level 1 up to level 5 (degree standard). They come from the public, voluntary and private sectors; all basically delivering the same series of products and all with a part to play. </p> <p>It is, over the years, the providers, working with others, who have developed all government programmes; who are the interface with schools and the careers service, and who recruit unemployed and employed clients - knocking on doors and going out into the highways and byways to involve employers large and small. They carry out induction and careers counselling; arrange work placements with employers; match clients to the jobs available; and in particular engage small businesses in the training process, with local labour market intelligence being updated daily. </p> <p>The providers create job opportunities, and act as the normal recruitment agency for young people, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of employers, mostly small businesses, and deliver the entire training, assessment and internal verification processes, working with other agencies and acting as de facto training managers for small businesses. They develop quality and best practice in every aspect of their work; provide all administration and pastoral care for clients from 16 to 65 years of age -soon to be from age 14 due to changes in the national curriculum. They work in partnership with employers towards successful outcomes, normally jobs and vocational qualifications. </p> <p>There is no need to look for the new next big thing. We already have the delivery system in place. All we need to do is to use it.</p> <p>\u0095 Hugh Pitman - whose family has provided leaders in vocational skills training for individual development and business improvement since 1812 - is Chairman of the Association of Learning Providers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Most people would agree that we value the academic over the vocational more in theory than in practice; after all, when your pipes burst, it is the plumber not the philosopher you want to see coming through the door. The world of academia has its place, but in order to keep the wheels of industry and commerce turning as we race into the information age, our country needs the best trained, best qualified and most highly skilled workforce achievable. Right now - with the experiments of the past behind us and a huge amount of experience accumulated, particularly over the last 20 years - our relatively young vocational training industry is well place to deliver to employers and individuals the quality of practical education and training that both groups of customers respectively demand and deserve. The present model of work-based training has been achieved by taking the most successful models from other countries and then - over 20 years of trial and error - moulding them to meet the particular requirements of the United Kingdom and its employers. The work-based method of preparing young people and adults for employment opportunities, and upskilling and developing them within their careers, has proved beyond any doubt to be the most successful and cost-effective system in existence. A structured and supported plan of learning for the individual, coupled with real work experience on an employer's premises, enables the learner to develop their own capabilities in the world of work with the employer giving them their own particular slant on the skills and the culture required for their enterprise. This concept is supported and actively encouraged by government, industry and commerce - and it works. The Association of Learning Providers (ALP) was born last December, when a group of providers and representatives of established networks spontaneously decided to join together as a unified voice for all public, private and voluntary sector training organisations. It is a \"network of networks\", able to work closely with the government and government departments, both with employers and the large number of other agencies concerned, to drive forward solutions to strategic and policy issues, and to help achieve a truly world-class workforce for the United Kingdom. The only two criteria for an organisation's involvement with the Association of Learning Providers are that it should be delivering work-based training and that it should be in pos session of contracts with one or other of the government funding agencies. The association is totally inclusive, embracing the best interests of all providers and of the many hundreds of thousands of young people and adults for whom providers are directly and daily responsible. It concerns itself as little as possible with institutional structures, but devotes its energies to addressing the issues of the day. The Learning and Skills Council will soon replace all Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and will be operational by April 2001 with its 47 local outstations, all of which will work to a common pattern. This entirely new structure will have a \u00a36bn annual budget and amongst many other responsibilities will be the government agency for managing vocational education and training in England for young people over the age of 16. There will inevitably be slightly different arrangements in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ire land, with Scotland currently undergoing a review of its training and enterprise agencies. The actual delivery will be in the hands of the 2,500 providers, covering both geographical areas and the vast array of skills required by employers. Many of these learning providers are very small and make invaluable contributions in niche markets, covering every skill imaginable within their own local communities - from upholsterers to signwriters; from wood turners to beekeepers; from photographers to silversmiths. The largest work nationally, with many thousands of young people and unemployed adults on their multiplicity of programmes. Providers deliver programmes varying from help for the disadvantaged or those with special training needs, right through the spectrum of National - or Scottish - Vocational Qualifications at level 1 up to level 5 (degree standard). They come from the public, voluntary and private sectors; all basically delivering the same series of products and all with a part to play. It is, over the years, the providers, working with others, who have developed all government programmes; who are the interface with schools and the careers service, and who recruit unemployed and employed clients - knocking on doors and going out into the highways and byways to involve employers large and small. They carry out induction and careers counselling; arrange work placements with employers; match clients to the jobs available; and in particular engage small businesses in the training process, with local labour market intelligence being updated daily. The providers create job opportunities, and act as the normal recruitment agency for young people, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of employers, mostly small businesses, and deliver the entire training, assessment and internal verification processes, working with other agencies and acting as de facto training managers for small businesses. They develop quality and best practice in every aspect of their work; provide all administration and pastoral care for clients from 16 to 65 years of age -soon to be from age 14 due to changes in the national curriculum. They work in partnership with employers towards successful outcomes, normally jobs and vocational qualifications. There is no need to look for the new next big thing. We already have the delivery system in place. All we need to do is to use it. \u0095 Hugh Pitman - whose family has provided leaders in vocational skills training for individual development and business improvement since 1812 - is Chairman of the Association of Learning Providers.",

He got a scholarship for performing arts, but he was upset at making no academic progress.\" </p> <p>Then there was the trouble on the bus home, even with a teacher on board: fighting, swearing, torn coats, threats with broken bottles. The Huttons began to seriously consider educating both their son and 10-year-old daughter from home. </p> <p>\"We weren't starting from nothing as we had friends who had home-schooled their kids as well as some American connections, and did some net surfing to improve our knowledge,\" says Wendy. </p> <p>They talked over their intentions and two other Leeds families said they, too, were unhappy at their youngsters' progress in the conventional schooling system and could they join the project? That made eight children from three families in all, and by the education department's definition, more than five children is a school, provided they are from more than one family. </p> <p>As anyone who has ventured along this road knows, there are four basic requirements: children, premises, teachers and curriculum. This last was a tricky problem, in that they did not want to concoct more of the same dull brew that was already associated with failure for their children. </p> <p>\"There were lots of good schemes like English for seven-year-olds and science for key stage 2, but we didn't want something like a patchwork quilt,\" says Wendy. \"We wanted something that put minimum bureaucratic pressure on the teachers. The main possibilities were North American and we eventually settled on the School for Tomorrow curriculum, which is used by 7,000 schools internationally\". </p> <p>For the \u00a3650 initial contract, the school receives manuals, literature and one week's residential training for five people. </p> <p>\"What the parents liked best,\" says Les Hutton, \"was the diagnostic testing we were able to carry out on our pupils after this training. We looked at five basic subjects and some people were shocked to find their youngster was up to four years behind\". </p> <p>Rosemary Foster, a friend of the Huttons, had been a special needs co-ordinator at a state school before retiring in December 1998. Having seen what the Huttons had managed thus far, she offered her services for free as their principal teacher, and she and her husband John offered their house in central Leeds as a base for the school. </p> <p>\"At first the plan was to convert the living room to a classroom for our eight pupils, but as people heard of our progress, the eight went up to 12,\" Foster says. </p> <p>By the time the Fosters went away for a week's holiday last summer, the school's roll had grown to 17 pupils, now housed in two bedrooms and the living room. For those seven days the house was like a set of Changing Rooms, as parents and grandparents set about the conversion financed by \u00a33,600 of the Huttons' money and a favourable deal with MDF for building materials. </p> <p>\"None of these are well-off parents,\" Wendy Hutton remarks. \"They are making huge sacrifices to make sure the school works.\" </p> <p>As it reaches the end of its second term, the Victory Academy has seen an HMI visit (encouraging words in January but as yet no written report) and its staffing capacity has risen to one full-time and three part-time teachers, working for free. </p> <p>\"Yes, we need a science lab, an art room and a drama studio, but these are matters which will be addressed when we have a new building, hopefully an old pub, church or hall sited on the route of the inner-city circular bus,\" Wendy Hutton says. </p> <p>In the US funding follows the child, but in the UK it is different. The funding for these 17 pupils goes to their neighbourhood schools even though the places have not been taken up. The Huttons' only hope is that some benefactor who recognises the experimental value of what the academy is doing will magically appear. </p> <p>\"We need \u00a350 a week per child to cover the cost of the building and one teacher, but the only hope we can see is in the nursery voucher system, where the \u00a31,000 per child might extend into our school.\" </p> <p>And what of the children themselves and the quality of learning? The uniform is a yellow sweatshirt and each pupil has an individual office that they are free to customise. </p> <p>One of the mothers is a doctor and she teaches practical science on Tuesday afternoons.

      "body": "<p>The Parable of the Good Shopper is what children learn in their French and German lessons, argues Alison Farnell of the Stapleford Centre, a Nottingham-based Christian educational trust that recently began publishing secondary school textbooks. \"When you learn French in school, you learn what to say in a cafe, or a railway station, or a market,\" she says. \"The whole content of foreign language teaching in England assumes you are a tourist, or a spender, or a consumer.\" </p> <p>The Stapleford Centre's new GCSE textbooks for French and German are rather different: \"We do all the same grammar, but we set it in a different context. We look at the faith beliefs of people in France and Germany. We look at light as a symbol of hope. We look at the way people held candles when the Berlin Wall came down. Our French books show how to buy bread in a patisserie, but they also show bread as a symbol in Christianity and in Islam.\" </p> <p>The centre, which has links with St John's Theological College in Nottingham, now publishes GCSE-level textbooks in science, maths, French, German and English. They cover the material required by the national curriculum, but from a spiritual point of view. Ordinary GCSE maths books, for example, often teach percentages by asking children to work out how much interest they will gain on money deposited in a bank. Stapleford's maths book asks children to calculate the percentage of their future income they might give away. </p> <p>Next month, the centre brings out textbooks in the same five subjects for younger secondary students. History, geography, technology and Spanish books for both age groups are also planned. The books, written by Christian teachers, have proved very popular: almost the entire first run of 9,000 copies have been sold. Church secondary schools have bought about a third of them; the other two thirds have been bought by ordinary, non-religious state schools. </p> <p>So why would these local schools buy religious textbooks for teaching maths or science from an avowedly Christian publisher? The answer lies in the law, which - surprisingly to many parents and pupils - not only permits but promotes the presence of religion throughout the English state education system. </p> <p>Since 1992, schools have been under a legal obligation to \"promote spiritual and moral values throughout the curriculum\" . The demand for the Stapleford books, published under the name \"The Charis Project\", is a direct result of this, says Alison Farnell. \"Our books enable teachers to bring out spiritual and moral issues. They are not for use in teaching RE; they are for languages, or maths, or science with a spiritual and moral dimension.\" </p> <p>Spirituality throughout the curriculum is only one of several religious obligations on state schools. What most schools call \"assembly\" is actually defined in law as \"daily collective worship\", compulsory for all pupils (unless their parents withdraw them) up to the age of 18. This must be \"wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character\" except in exceptional circumstances. (An opt-out for schools where children are predominantly Muslim, for example.) </p> <p>All state schools must also provide religious education for all pupils up to the age of 18. This includes 14- to 16-year-old pupils who drop other subjects. It is possible for some pupils to replace science and languages with vocational-style courses, for example, but their school must still insist they study RE unless their parents withdraw them from it. </p> <p>All of these regulations apply to the three-quarters of state schools that have no official link with any religion. In the other quarter, the schools that are affiliated to particular denominations and for which the state pays 85-100% of the running costs, religion will be more overt still. </p> <p>Several governors of these schools will be chosen by the church or other religious group. Children may be offered or denied places on the basis of their parents' religion and/or attendance at services. The school itself may become a place of worship: at St Aidan's Memorial C of E primary in Hartlepool, for example, parents are invited to communion services held by the local vicar in the school. </p> <p> St Aidan's, like many Anglican schools, serves a catchment area taking in children from Christian and non-Christian families alike. Many rural primary schools are in this situation - a fact that is causing a stir in Leicestershire, and may lead to a case being taken to the European Court of Human Rights. </p> <p>Eric Goodyer lives in the village of Hathern, Leicestershire, where the local C of E primary school is the only one in the village. Included in the school's aims is the phrase \"to promote Christian values\". Goodyer has protested at this, and at the requirement for parents to support it in the home-school agreement. </p> <p>In a one-school village he cannot exercise his right to freedom of religious expression, which from next year will be his under European and English law, he argues: \"If the church is going to impose Christianity when the school is the only one in the catchment area, then that denies people the choice of having their children educated in a pluralist environment.\" </p> <p>But pluralism is not the current trend. Until 1997, virtually all state religious schools were Anglican or Roman Catholic. These were justified as the product of history. (The churches had a 19th-century school system long before compulsory state education). Applications from other religious groups to set up state-funded schools were turned down by successive government ministers as smacking of separatism. </p> <p>However, since May 1997, the government has approved the first two Muslim state primaries in Birmingham and Brent, two Sikh schools in Middlesex, a Seventh Day Adventist school in Haringey, five Jewish primaries and three new Roman Catholic schools. The first Greek Orthodox state school, St Cyprian's, is due to open in Croydon later this year. Various London communities are drawing up plans for four more Jewish primaries, a non-Orthodox Jewish secondary school, and the first state Hindu school. </p> <p>David Blunkett, education secretary, justifies this change in policy on the grounds of fairness between denominations, and parental choice. But it is also true that in recent months, as well as protracted haggling with the bishops over how sex and relationships education should be taught in state schools, ministers have signalled a new enthusiasm for religious schools. Blunkett recently called for the church to take over failing inner-city schools. </p> <p>For the first time since 1970, the Church of England has set up a review of Anglican schools, with an expansionist agenda. Its conclusions are due by the middle of next year - but even as it was announced, the secretary of the church's board of education, Canon John Hall, was pointing out that current Anglican provision, particularly at secondary level, falls far short of demand. </p> <p>He spoke of church schools turning away \"large numbers of potential pupils for no other reason than lack of space\" and of doubling the current number of C of E secondary schools to 400 (there are currently 198 secondaries, and 4,550 primaries) over the next 10 years. </p> <p>If Anglicans achieve that expansion, they will overtake the Roman Catholic provision for 11-18s - there are 363 RC secondaries, and 1,760 primaries. Both churches are talking of the need to train more Christian teachers and headteachers; no one knows how many there are at present, but 40 of the 104 teacher-training providers are church foundations. </p> <p>Humanists and secularists are shocked by this resurgence of religion. They argue that religious schools are divisive, that as religious schools assert their excellence, then local non-denominational schools will be perceived as second best. Parents may be able to withdraw children from assemblies and RE, but they cannot withdraw them from an all-pervasive \"ethos\", they say. Families are increasingly faced with travelling long distances to find a pluralist school, or acquiescing to teachings they reject, according to both the National Secular Society and the British Humanist Association. </p> <p>One BHA member, Julie Norris, set up a support network for parents who were faced with incidents like the one in which her son, having been told by his parents that he did not have to put his hands together and close his eyes during prayers, was \"poked by a teacher who said 'you think this is all a joke, don't you?' \" </p> <p>Children's rights of access to an equal curriculum are also infringed in some religious schools, argue their critics. They point to the Kent C of E primary school in which the head recently denounced the best-selling \"Harry Potter\" books on the grounds that they subverted biblical teaching. </p> <p>Yet religious schools are immensely popular with parents. Most of them turn away some children; many could fill their classrooms twice over. Some of this may be to do with perceptions of orderliness and discipline. But according to Ofsted evidence, church schools do achieve a higher level of moral and spiritual input to children than non- denominational counterparts. </p> <p>And that may have far-reaching effects. For there is unpublished research evidence, funded by the Teacher Training Agency, which suggests that standards of teaching and learning appear to go up in line with a school's spiritual input. </p> <p>University researchers have been monitoring an experiment in a Bristol C of E secondary school, St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School, in which pupils, teachers and parents discussed core values - justice, truth, forgiveness, stewardship - and then introduced them overtly into teaching. </p> <p>So in a series of science lessons on the circulation of the blood, St Mary's teenage pupils began not by learning facts about red cells and white cells, but about the American pioneer of the blood transfusion service, Charles Drew, who died after a whites- only hospital refused him a blood transfusion because he was black. </p> <p>In geography lessons about the structure of Bristol, they began by looking at the effect of second world war bombing, and compared them with the bombing of Dresden. Discussion about forgiveness followed, before they returned to geography. </p> <p>This may be valuable morally and spiritually anyway. But the reason why the TTA and ministers are watching St Mary's lessons carefully is that its pupils also appear to be reaching higher standards. Teachers are more thoughtful about what they are teaching; pupils see the point of what they are learning and are more motivated to learn it, according to St Mary's deputy head Richard Badley. </p> <p>\"What you get is the motivation that comes from challenging people about real things, real issues.\" St Mary's, which is vastly over-subscribed, restricts its intake to the children of practising Christian families. It might take longer to establish core values in a school where views were more diverse, Badley believes, but the relevance of the issues would be the same. </p> <p>And in any case, says Alison Farnell, just because beliefs are not overtly discussed does not mean they are not there: \"Nothing is neutral. Whoever you are, you bring values into education. You may be bringing in Christian values, you may be bringing in secular humanism - but that is a belief system, too. Nothing is value-free.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Parable of the Good Shopper is what children learn in their French and German lessons, argues Alison Farnell of the Stapleford Centre, a Nottingham-based Christian educational trust that recently began publishing secondary school textbooks. \"When you learn French in school, you learn what to say in a cafe, or a railway station, or a market,\" she says. \"The whole content of foreign language teaching in England assumes you are a tourist, or a spender, or a consumer.\" The Stapleford Centre's new GCSE textbooks for French and German are rather different: \"We do all the same grammar, but we set it in a different context. We look at the faith beliefs of people in France and Germany. We look at light as a symbol of hope. We look at the way people held candles when the Berlin Wall came down. Our French books show how to buy bread in a patisserie, but they also show bread as a symbol in Christianity and in Islam.\" The centre, which has links with St John's Theological College in Nottingham, now publishes GCSE-level textbooks in science, maths, French, German and English. They cover the material required by the national curriculum, but from a spiritual point of view. Ordinary GCSE maths books, for example, often teach percentages by asking children to work out how much interest they will gain on money deposited in a bank. Stapleford's maths book asks children to calculate the percentage of their future income they might give away. Next month, the centre brings out textbooks in the same five subjects for younger secondary students. History, geography, technology and Spanish books for both age groups are also planned. The books, written by Christian teachers, have proved very popular: almost the entire first run of 9,000 copies have been sold. Church secondary schools have bought about a third of them; the other two thirds have been bought by ordinary, non-religious state schools.
