      "body": "<p>England produced what was arguably their finest victory in one-day cricket here last night when, chasing 305 to win the first of their three limited-overs matches against Pakistan, they reached their target with five wickets and 16 deliveries to spare. </p> <p>This was the fourth highest successful chase in international one-day history; only India, Australia (both 316) and Sri Lanka (313) have done better than this. England's previous best was the 286 for four they scored against New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1986. </p> <p>In the most exciting chase since Steve McQueen took to the streets of San Francisco in Bullet, England overcame not only one of the world's leading one-day sides but also some familiar umpiring problems and the early loss of both openers. </p> <p>A partnership of 114 in 18 overs between the captain Nasser Hussain (73) and Graeme Hick (56) made it all possible. But, even when Hussain was fourth out at 164 in the 31st over, England's hopes looked far-fetched. </p> <p>Andrew Flintoff, with 84 from 60 balls, and Graham Thorpe, with an unbeaten 64 off 66, then added 138 for the fifth wicket in 16 overs. </p> <p>Flintoff hit six muscular fours and three sixes. In successive overs he pulled Abdur Razzak and Wasim Akram over the ropes and then - a remarkable shot - he check-drove Waqar Younis for another six before falling just before the end. </p> <p>\"It's something I've wanted to do and been threatening to do for a while - win a match for England,\" Flintoff said, \"and that's why I was so annoyed about getting out.\" </p> <p>But, just when England thought it was safe to go back into the hot water of another Pakistan tour, they discovered it can still leave scald marks. </p> <p>They were four balls into their first meaningful innings in this country for 13 years when something happened that stirred uncomfortable memories of the umpiring of Shakeel Khan and Shakoor Rana, whose dark deeds did so much to dissuade them from returning. </p> <p>Wasim appealed for a catch behind against Alec Stewart. Stewart, who did not appear to touch the ball, stood his ground. The umpire, Riazuddin, did not move either. But then, under intense pressure from the fielding side, the official gave Stewart out, some five seconds after the original appeal. </p> <p>Stewart showed dissent. First he dropped his bat in an abject attitude of disbelief. Then he started a slow, head-shaking return to the dressing room. </p> <p>England's attitude has been commendably positive but just over a week into their tour all those fears, of dazzling batting, fizzing fast bowling and iffy umpiring, not to mention the heat and turbulent tummies, had proved justified. But England's response to this setback was emphatic and heroic. </p> <p>The Pakistan innings was a beast of a thing. It attacked the England bowlers with a chilling voracity at the start and then slumbered in a post-prandial, lip-smacking sort of way before slaying once more in the final overs, the last 10 of which yielded 106 runs. </p> <p>Its pattern was set by the openers Saeed Anwar and Imran Nazir who plundered 21 runs from the first 12 deliveries. The fifty had come up in the eighth over and by the end of the important 15-over stage 92 had been scored. </p> <p>Imran Nazir was third out, at 97, but Inzaman-ul-Haq then added 100 in 26 overs with Yousuf Youhana. By the time Inzamam was fifth out for an 87-ball 71 the remarkable Razzak was into his electric stride. He hit Craig White, Mark Ealham and Darren Gough for audacious sixes and there were also five fours in his 40-ball 75. </p> <p>Gough and White together cost 141. They looked shell-shocked. It seemed unlikely that before the day was through they would be sharing a jig of pure joy. </p> <p>Hussain said afterwards: \"This was my most satisfying one-day win. We did something very special today. Andy Flintoff played as well as he can and showed how fit he was.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "England produced what was arguably their finest victory in one-day cricket here last night when, chasing 305 to win the first of their three limited-overs matches against Pakistan, they reached their target with five wickets and 16 deliveries to spare. This was the fourth highest successful chase in international one-day history; only India, Australia (both 316) and Sri Lanka (313) have done better than this. England's previous best was the 286 for four they scored against New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1986. In the most exciting chase since Steve McQueen took to the streets of San Francisco in Bullet, England overcame not only one of the world's leading one-day sides but also some familiar umpiring problems and the early loss of both openers. A partnership of 114 in 18 overs between the captain Nasser Hussain (73) and Graeme Hick (56) made it all possible. But, even when Hussain was fourth out at 164 in the 31st over, England's hopes looked far-fetched. Andrew Flintoff, with 84 from 60 balls, and Graham Thorpe, with an unbeaten 64 off 66, then added 138 for the fifth wicket in 16 overs. Flintoff hit six muscular fours and three sixes. In successive overs he pulled Abdur Razzak and Wasim Akram over the ropes and then - a remarkable shot - he check-drove Waqar Younis for another six before falling just before the end. \"It's something I've wanted to do and been threatening to do for a while - win a match for England,\" Flintoff said, \"and that's why I was so annoyed about getting out.\" But, just when England thought it was safe to go back into the hot water of another Pakistan tour, they discovered it can still leave scald marks. They were four balls into their first meaningful innings in this country for 13 years when something happened that stirred uncomfortable memories of the umpiring of Shakeel Khan and Shakoor Rana, whose dark deeds did so much to dissuade them from returning. Wasim appealed for a catch behind against Alec Stewart. Stewart, who did not appear to touch the ball, stood his ground. The umpire, Riazuddin, did not move either. But then, under intense pressure from the fielding side, the official gave Stewart out, some five seconds after the original appeal. Stewart showed dissent. First he dropped his bat in an abject attitude of disbelief. Then he started a slow, head-shaking return to the dressing room. England's attitude has been commendably positive but just over a week into their tour all those fears, of dazzling batting, fizzing fast bowling and iffy umpiring, not to mention the heat and turbulent tummies, had proved justified. But England's response to this setback was emphatic and heroic. The Pakistan innings was a beast of a thing. It attacked the England bowlers with a chilling voracity at the start and then slumbered in a post-prandial, lip-smacking sort of way before slaying once more in the final overs, the last 10 of which yielded 106 runs. Its pattern was set by the openers Saeed Anwar and Imran Nazir who plundered 21 runs from the first 12 deliveries. The fifty had come up in the eighth over and by the end of the important 15-over stage 92 had been scored. Imran Nazir was third out, at 97, but Inzaman-ul-Haq then added 100 in 26 overs with Yousuf Youhana. By the time Inzamam was fifth out for an 87-ball 71 the remarkable Razzak was into his electric stride. He hit Craig White, Mark Ealham and Darren Gough for audacious sixes and there were also five fours in his 40-ball 75. Gough and White together cost 141. They looked shell-shocked. It seemed unlikely that before the day was through they would be sharing a jig of pure joy. Hussain said afterwards: \"This was my most satisfying one-day win. We did something very special today. Andy Flintoff played as well as he can and showed how fit he was.\"",

      "body": "<p>Lembit Opik had a good day at the office yesterday. Perhaps it was the sensual contours of his hand-made leather in-tray that did it, or the way the luxurious (and luxuriously priced) carpet caressed his shoes; or the way the light in the atrium glinted off the water in the fountain. Either way, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire - usually perceived as a man of rather more apocalyptic temperament, given his role as a key voice in the campaign to warn the world of the catastrophic consequences of being hit by a meteorite - certainly enjoyed his first day at work in what is, yard for yard, Britain's most expensive, and arguably most contentious office building, Portcullis House. \"Despite all the controversy, it feels good and I think it will feel good for our visitors,\" he says of the new Westminster home for 210 MPs. \"And it did feel great walking into the building.\" </p> <p>Once upon a time, the opulent office could be justified - if it needed to be justified at all - on the old-fashioned principles of conspicuous consumption: who could doubt the power and credibility of a government - or a bank, or a management consultancy - that could afford to transform countless tonnes of marble and gleaming steel into a vast, mortality-defying, space-wasting monument to corporate might? But in an age of efficiency, the more likely rationalisation speaks of the need to attract the best talent; to provide them with airy cathedrals in which to worship the god of productivity. Which rather prompts the question: do they work? </p> <p>Luxury has always been a critical part of the subtle lines of power that crisscross every office floor: used aggressively, the ostentatious demonstration of opulence can be wonderfully flattering - or absolutely terrifying. \"The chief executive's office was amazing: awesome mahogany, indescribably deep carpets,\" recalls a former employee of a major London bank. \"If you were summoned, you knew it was because you were pretty special - or because you were in for a serious dressing-down.\" But whether the marble and the gurgling fountains actually make a serious difference to workplace morale and productivity - whether, in other words, Lembit Opik and his fellow MPs would be one iota less effective in their work if a few thousand pounds less had been spent on the office carpet - seems rather more questionable. </p> <p>Those who have worked in similarly plush environments testify to the little jolt of happiness - of being wanted - that hit them every time they showed up for work. \"Every day I worked in that building I walked through the doors and thought: this feels good ,\" says one City worker. \"You walked off the street and immediately you felt special,\" another recalls. </p> <p>Yet complacency settles in pretty fast, even in palaces such as the notorious European Bank of Reconstruction and Development near London's Liverpool Street, where a \u00a366m marble-heavy refurbishment earned it the epithet \"the Glistening Bank\" and was a key factor in the resignation of its president, Jacques Attali. At one point, more had been spent on revamping the office than on the projects the bank had been established to support. \"There was a lot of marble - it was real Bonfire of the Vanities stuff,\" one former employee recalls. \"But, hey - you got used to it.\" </p> <p>Organisational psychologists don't buy the luxury-productivity link either (although that might just be jealousy). \"There are hygiene factors and motivating factors,\" says Dr Rob Yeung, a business psychologist at the consultancy Kiddy and Partners. \"Hygiene factors are things like having a sufficiently warm office, access to food, drink, shelter - the physiological needs. Once these are satisfied, they no longer actually motivate any further or produce greater performance or quality of thought or things like that. Pay, even, is quite often described as a hygiene factor: once people are paid enough to live OK and go on a few holidays, it doesn't actually motivate people to work any harder.\" </p> <p>Forget deep-pile carpets and deeper leather armchairs: quality relationships and control over one's working environment - however grotty - matter more. \"The kind of things that make people work harder are feeling valued, feeling like their efforts are recognised, having a good working relationship with colleagues, customers and suppliers, and feeling their needs for achievement are being met in the workplace.\" </p> <p> Luxurious surroundings \"can make people feel good about themselves, but can have a rebound effect,\" says Dr Valerie Lamont, a chartered counselling psychologist. \"In some people, it creates a sense of 'What am I doing here? This doesn't feel like a comfortable place to work', particularly if there is any discrepancy between the image of the office and the actual working practices.\" </p> <p>Then there is the famous \"lobby factor\" - the predictable tendency for spacious grandeur to be rapidly replaced by low-ceilinged, fluorescent-lit squalor the moment employees pass from the public areas to the private offices. \"The lobby was full of marble and chrome and big fountains with goldfish and lovely plants,\" is a typical observation. \"The communal areas were lovely, but the actual offices were horrid. I had to leave because there was a real culture of terror, backstabbing and bullying that was so awful, the lobby frankly wasn't going to keep me.\" </p> <p>There is, in any case, something almost embarrassingly old-fashioned about Portcullis House's approach to luxury - the armchairs with snooze buttons, the notorious fig trees. The new economy it ain't: ask any of the burgeoning ranks of edgy, up-to-the-minute office designers to work you up a symphony in marble and cascading fountains, and they would drop their laptops in horror. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago, maybe,\" says Arnold Levin, director of the Center for Workplace Innovation, a Washington DC-based office design firm. \"Then, the law firms we designed for would always be opulent; always stone, wood, marble. But even our law firm clients, though they spend a bit more than our dot.com startups, are very concerned that their clients don't get the impression their fees are being poured into the workplace. Across the board, there's so much more money being spent on technology and wiring and cabling that opulence is the last thing on anybody's mind.\" </p> <p>Back at Portcullis House, in his deluxe third-floor office, however, Lembit Opik is understandably keen to emphasise the productivity benefits of all that spending. \"There has been a dramatic improvement in the work environment - it's acoustically well-designed, natural light is used well - it feels good, and that's got to be good for productivity ... It makes very good sense for the long term.\" And perhaps there are other advantages: if a meteorite does ever hurtle from the heavens and land on London, maybe the carpet at Portcullis House will break its fall.</p>",

Those who have worked in similarly plush environments testify to the little jolt of happiness - of being wanted - that hit them every time they showed up for work. \"Every day I worked in that building I walked through the doors and thought: this feels good ,\" says one City worker. \"You walked off the street and immediately you felt special,\" another recalls. Yet complacency settles in pretty fast, even in palaces such as the notorious European Bank of Reconstruction and Development near London's Liverpool Street, where a \u00a366m marble-heavy refurbishment earned it the epithet \"the Glistening Bank\" and was a key factor in the resignation of its president, Jacques Attali. At one point, more had been spent on revamping the office than on the projects the bank had been established to support. \"There was a lot of marble - it was real Bonfire of the Vanities stuff,\" one former employee recalls. \"But, hey - you got used to it.\" Organisational psychologists don't buy the luxury-productivity link either (although that might just be jealousy). \"There are hygiene factors and motivating factors,\" says Dr Rob Yeung, a business psychologist at the consultancy Kiddy and Partners. \"Hygiene factors are things like having a sufficiently warm office, access to food, drink, shelter - the physiological needs. Once these are satisfied, they no longer actually motivate any further or produce greater performance or quality of thought or things like that. Pay, even, is quite often described as a hygiene factor: once people are paid enough to live OK and go on a few holidays, it doesn't actually motivate people to work any harder.\" Forget deep-pile carpets and deeper leather armchairs: quality relationships and control over one's working environment - however grotty - matter more. \"The kind of things that make people work harder are feeling valued, feeling like their efforts are recognised, having a good working relationship with colleagues, customers and suppliers, and feeling their needs for achievement are being met in the workplace.\" Luxurious surroundings \"can make people feel good about themselves, but can have a rebound effect,\" says Dr Valerie Lamont, a chartered counselling psychologist. \"In some people, it creates a sense of 'What am I doing here? This doesn't feel like a comfortable place to work', particularly if there is any discrepancy between the image of the office and the actual working practices.\" Then there is the famous \"lobby factor\" - the predictable tendency for spacious grandeur to be rapidly replaced by low-ceilinged, fluorescent-lit squalor the moment employees pass from the public areas to the private offices. \"The lobby was full of marble and chrome and big fountains with goldfish and lovely plants,\" is a typical observation. \"The communal areas were lovely, but the actual offices were horrid. I had to leave because there was a real culture of terror, backstabbing and bullying that was so awful, the lobby frankly wasn't going to keep me.\" There is, in any case, something almost embarrassingly old-fashioned about Portcullis House's approach to luxury - the armchairs with snooze buttons, the notorious fig trees. The new economy it ain't: ask any of the burgeoning ranks of edgy, up-to-the-minute office designers to work you up a symphony in marble and cascading fountains, and they would drop their laptops in horror. \"Ten years ago, maybe,\" says Arnold Levin, director of the Center for Workplace Innovation, a Washington DC-based office design firm. \"Then, the law firms we designed for would always be opulent; always stone, wood, marble. But even our law firm clients, though they spend a bit more than our dot.com startups, are very concerned that their clients don't get the impression their fees are being poured into the workplace. Across the board, there's so much more money being spent on technology and wiring and cabling that opulence is the last thing on anybody's mind.\" Back at Portcullis House, in his deluxe third-floor office, however, Lembit Opik is understandably keen to emphasise the productivity benefits of all that spending. \"There has been a dramatic improvement in the work environment - it's acoustically well-designed, natural light is used well - it feels good, and that's got to be good for productivity ... It makes very good sense for the long term.\" And perhaps there are other advantages: if a meteorite does ever hurtle from the heavens and land on London, maybe the carpet at Portcullis House will break its fall.",

Its failure is not her failure but the failure of those producing it to shape, prune and develop it into a story worth telling and one that tells us more than that life's a zoo. \u0095 Until November 18.

But PR isn't what drives him. The same spirit that makes him an entrepreneur, a corporate risk-taker, drives him to daredevil activities in his leisure time. And the more on-edge his business life, the more dangerous his out-of-hours pursuits are likely to be because the way we work impacts enormously on the way we play. Air traffic controllers are much more likely to have challenging hobbies, such as rock-climbing, than civil servants, who are keener on a game of chess. We carry our work-shaped traits into the rest of our lives. </p> <p>Of course, it is possible that we simply choose jobs and hobbies that suit our personalities. But there is good evidence that the nature of our work has an influence on what we do after we clock off. The sociologist Stanley Parker tracked workers over a six-year period and found that those whose jobs had become more passive had become more passive in their leisure hours (TV watching increased, for example), while workers in jobs that had become more active took up more stimulating leisure pursuits. Work maketh the man. </p> <p>All of which makes even more worrying the recent comments by Labour MP Tess Kingham on the working culture of the House of Commons. She describes the worst part of the job as \"hanging around a dank, dark, claustrophobic place until 2am\" and the whipping process as \"an appalling, bullying system\" which supports \"schoolboy politics\". The pettiness of the systems and debates has driven her away: she is standing down at the next election. </p> <p>We often criticise our politicians for being bullies, egomaniacs, in love with the sound of their own voices, full of petty jealousies and generally socially dysfunctional - and assume these are the traits that made them go into politics. Perhaps, though, it is the absurd nature of the work that creates the absurd natures of many politicians. </p> <p>At the other end of the occupational scale, Joanne Ciulla, a US academic, cites bingo as an example of the work-leisure link. Bingo is most popular among workers with low-skilled, production line jobs - disproportionately women. Ciulla points out the eerie similarities between bingo and routine work: \"It is played in a large hall and the players sit at tables in rows. There is a caller and a 'supervisor'. Players ... 'work' through their card and if it goes well they get paid. The supervisor designates periods for refreshment. There is no skill or personal challenge in the game. Bingo allows for socialising, but that, too, is somewhat limited by the nature of the game.\" </p> <p>If you find yourself TV-watching for long periods, it's probably time for a new job. Recruitment firms might want to set up in bingo halls. </p> <p>The umbilical cord between our work and play personas demonstrates the falsity of the division between work and home, labour and leisure. Pat Kane, the former pop singer and social commentator, has called for a new \"play ethic\" to replace the obsolete work version, arguing that we need to rediscover creativity, freedom, fun. He's right that we need a more playful philosophy of life - but he is wrong to counterpoise work and play. His call for a 35-hour week is based on an assumption that work cannot be playful, when it can and should be. Indeed, a fun and friendly environment consistently tops polls of what workers want from their jobs. </p> <p>The play ethic is a great idea, but we won't get it by corralling work into a corner of our lives and treating it as the penance we pay for our hours of fun. If work is drudgery, chances are the rest of our lives will be, too. The point is to inject play into work, not take it away.

He says little bar a repeated, oleaginous \"thank you sooooo much\", but the set is so brisk that his versatile band swap instruments while finishing the previous song. Given his age and rate of touring, it may be some time before Britain sees Paul Simon again, but this was special. \u0095 Ends tonight. Box office: 0870 606 3400).",

      "body": "<p>The government is likely to come under renewed pressure to put a stop to the wholesale - and unchecked - employment of locums after the General Medical Council yesterday struck off an anaesthetist whose blunders led to the death of a 10 year-old boy. </p> <p>John Evans-Appiah worked for more than 20 years as an NHS locum doctor before finally getting full registration just a year before the boy, Darren Denholm, died after dentistry treatment. Three weeks later, a woman was put through a nightmare of pain when Evans-Appiah inadequately anaesthetised her for a caesarean section. </p> <p>Despite a devastating report by the audit commission 18 months ago, which said that patient safety was being put at risk by the failure of hospital trusts and health authorities to check employed locums, nothing has yet been done. </p> <p>The audit commission found that although just over 70% of trusts saw references from past employers, only 38% checked them, and fewer than 10% saw certificates establishing the doctors' qualifications. </p> <p>Evans-Appiah was described by the fatal accident inquiry held in Edinburgh, following Darren's death, as one of \"a tribe of wandering locums\". The audit commission report said there could be 3,500 locums working in the NHS on any day. A third of the trusts had reported adverse events of some kind, from very minor to serious, associated with locums in the past year. </p> <p>Evans-Appiah was one of the 70% who qualified overseas - a group considered insufficiently trained to have full status and a permanent job and yet who were employed often without question. The NHS relies upon them to fill its staff shortfalls. </p> <p>The GMC's professional conduct committee found 17 charges proved against Evans-Appiah. Yesterday it said it amounted to professional misconduct and ordered his name be erased from the register. </p> <p>Mary Clark-Glass, chairing the committee, said EvansAppiah had been guilty of \"critical failings\" and failed to meet \"basic standards\" of patient care. The Ghanaian-born doctor, who trained in Ukraine, was also found guilty of dishonestly trying to cover his tracks by creating false medical records relating to Darren's death and trying to get staff at the Peffermill dental clinic to agree to them. </p> <p>The British Medical Association said it had supported the audit commission's call for reform of the locum system. Ian Bogle, BMA chairman, said: \"We said action was needed to provide effective supervision and careers guidance for such doctors early in their careers, otherwise they tend to become permanent locums without access to proper training and study leave. When doctors are moving from post to post, often for short periods of employment, quality checks on their competence are vital.\" </p> <p>Last November, the government published a consultation document on dealing with poorly performing doctors, which recognised that locums represented \"a particular problem because there is seldom an on-going relationship with a single employer\". It suggested \"smart cards\" for locums to prove they had no black marks against them. Last night a Department of Health spokesman said the system needed \"someone to own and be responsible for locums\". </p> <p>Delivering the GMC's decision on Evans-Appiah, Mrs Glass told him: \"You failed to ensure an adequate level of anaesthesia before instructing the dentist to go ahead. When Darren moved you compounded this by failing to administer more anaesthetic. Instead you instructed the dentist to administer a local anaesthetic which [had] adrenaline and which you should have known was contraindicated.\" She said he had failed to adequately monitor Darren's physiological state and to follow even \"the basic life support procedure\". </p> <p>Three weeks later Evans-Appiah had failed to ensure an adequate level of anaesthesia during a caesarean operation on 33-year-old Hazel Woolger. In July 1993, while he was a locum registrar at the Falkirk and district hospital, he had also put a patient's life in danger by mistakenly giving a paralysis-inducing drug for a caesarean, which stopped the woman breathing. He was then put on limited registration on condition that his performance be monitored.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is likely to come under renewed pressure to put a stop to the wholesale - and unchecked - employment of locums after the General Medical Council yesterday struck off an anaesthetist whose blunders led to the death of a 10 year-old boy. John Evans-Appiah worked for more than 20 years as an NHS locum doctor before finally getting full registration just a year before the boy, Darren Denholm, died after dentistry treatment. Three weeks later, a woman was put through a nightmare of pain when Evans-Appiah inadequately anaesthetised her for a caesarean section. Despite a devastating report by the audit commission 18 months ago, which said that patient safety was being put at risk by the failure of hospital trusts and health authorities to check employed locums, nothing has yet been done. The audit commission found that although just over 70% of trusts saw references from past employers, only 38% checked them, and fewer than 10% saw certificates establishing the doctors' qualifications. Evans-Appiah was described by the fatal accident inquiry held in Edinburgh, following Darren's death, as one of \"a tribe of wandering locums\". The audit commission report said there could be 3,500 locums working in the NHS on any day. A third of the trusts had reported adverse events of some kind, from very minor to serious, associated with locums in the past year. Evans-Appiah was one of the 70% who qualified overseas - a group considered insufficiently trained to have full status and a permanent job and yet who were employed often without question. The NHS relies upon them to fill its staff shortfalls. The GMC's professional conduct committee found 17 charges proved against Evans-Appiah. Yesterday it said it amounted to professional misconduct and ordered his name be erased from the register. Mary Clark-Glass, chairing the committee, said EvansAppiah had been guilty of \"critical failings\" and failed to meet \"basic standards\" of patient care. The Ghanaian-born doctor, who trained in Ukraine, was also found guilty of dishonestly trying to cover his tracks by creating false medical records relating to Darren's death and trying to get staff at the Peffermill dental clinic to agree to them. The British Medical Association said it had supported the audit commission's call for reform of the locum system. Ian Bogle, BMA chairman, said: \"We said action was needed to provide effective supervision and careers guidance for such doctors early in their careers, otherwise they tend to become permanent locums without access to proper training and study leave. When doctors are moving from post to post, often for short periods of employment, quality checks on their competence are vital.\" Last November, the government published a consultation document on dealing with poorly performing doctors, which recognised that locums represented \"a particular problem because there is seldom an on-going relationship with a single employer\". It suggested \"smart cards\" for locums to prove they had no black marks against them. Last night a Department of Health spokesman said the system needed \"someone to own and be responsible for locums\". Delivering the GMC's decision on Evans-Appiah, Mrs Glass told him: \"You failed to ensure an adequate level of anaesthesia before instructing the dentist to go ahead. When Darren moved you compounded this by failing to administer more anaesthetic. Instead you instructed the dentist to administer a local anaesthetic which [had] adrenaline and which you should have known was contraindicated.\" She said he had failed to adequately monitor Darren's physiological state and to follow even \"the basic life support procedure\". Three weeks later Evans-Appiah had failed to ensure an adequate level of anaesthesia during a caesarean operation on 33-year-old Hazel Woolger. In July 1993, while he was a locum registrar at the Falkirk and district hospital, he had also put a patient's life in danger by mistakenly giving a paralysis-inducing drug for a caesarean, which stopped the woman breathing. He was then put on limited registration on condition that his performance be monitored.",

They reached their target of 305 with 16 balls to spare - only three sides have scored more to win a one-day international. Four batsmen passed fifty, but the best innings was played by Andy Flintoff, whose 84 from 60 balls contained the sort of clean hitting he had previously reserved for the county game. He shared a matchwinning fifth-wicket stand of 105 with Graham Thorpe, who finished unbeaten on 64.</p> <p>England began the final 15 overs still needing 106 to win and with the game in the balance. But Thorpe used his feet to drive Abdur Razzaq through the covers on the up, and when Flintoff pulled Razzaq for six in the next over, it began to look as if England could do it.</p> <p>Flintoff pulled a waist-high no-ball from Wasim Akram into the stands at midwicket in the next over and soon after moved to a 39-ball half-century. It was awesome stuff, and a crowd that had heaved with delight during Abdur Razzaq's dazzling 75 not out from 40 balls was reduced to a quiet hum.</p> <p>Thorpe got to 50 himself, from 51 deliveries, and the 100 stand came up in the 42nd over. Flintoff promptly lifted Waqar Younis over long-off for his third six. Maybe England will think twice before sending him home after the one-day series.</p> <p>It looked as if Flintoff would be there at the end, but with three runs needed he edged Razzaq to Moin Khan and left cursing angrily. He needn't have been so harsh on himself: he had just played one of England's great one-day knocks.</p> <p><strong>35-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>England and Pakistan were on course for a tight finish in the first one-day international at Karachi. Set 305 to win, England had reached 199 for 4 after 35 overs, and needed a further 106 to win off 15 overs. A lot depended on Graham Thorpe (35) and Andy Flintoff (13).</p> <p>England were happy to let thnigs tick over at around four an over during the middle of the innings, as Thorpe played himself in busily and Nasser Hussain, coated in sweat, coasted for a while. But the feeling was that the batsmen were taking their foot off the gas just a little bit too much. </p> <p>The pressure finally got to Hussain, who had already got away with a couple of mishits into empty spaces. He lunged forward at Mushtaq Ahmed and was beaten by a ball that didn't turn much. Video replays confirmed Moin Khan's stumping had been successful, and Hussain departed for 73 to make it 164 for 4.</p> <p>Thorpe responded immediately by leaning back and cutting a Mushtaq Ahmed legbreak through point, while Flintoff opened his boundary count with a fierce cut as Waqar Younis dropped short. Thorpe cut Waqar for four in his next over, and England were just about keeping on top of the seven or so runs required an over.</p> <p><strong>25-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>England were making a brave attempt to overhaul Pakistan's total of 304 for 9 in the first one-dayer at Karachi, and after 25 overs had reached 143 for 3. They required another 162 at 6.48 an over. Only three sides have ever chased more to win in an ODI, but, for a while, Nasser Hussain and Graeme Hick played with little regard for history.</p> <p>The 100 came up in the 16th over, and Hussain moved to 50 in the 17th, when he also brought up an excellent century stand off just 96 balls. He was even working the gaps well for the ones and twos - something he hasn't always managed to do in previous one-day knocks.</p> <p>Hick got his half-century with a thumping straight-drive for four off Mushtaq Ahmed via umpire Riazuddin's shin, and after 20 overs England were 118 for 2, compared with Pakistan's 100 for 3 at that stage. England needed Hick to go on and do a Razzaq. Instead Razzaq did for Hick, having him caught behind off a lazy waft with the second ball of a new spell for a 51-ball 56. It left England 127 for 3 in the 21st over - and reliant on Hussain. </p> <p>Andy Flintoff was still to come, of course, but England faced a huge task.</p> <p><strong>15-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>After the controversial dismissal of Alec Stewart, England were in even further trouble when Marcus Trescothick top-edged a pull off Waqar Younis to Mushtaq Ahmed at midwicket for 11 to make it 13 for 2. But Nasser Hussain and Graeme Hick went about batting them back into the match, and after 15 overs England had progressed to 89 for 2. At the same stage Pakistan were 95 for 2. But that was well before Abdur Razzaq got going.</p> <p>Hussain drove Waqar to third man for four and Hick slashed Wasim Akram for another boundary over the slips. Then they began to play some more authentic strokes. Hussain flicked Waqar to the midwicket boundary and straight-drove him for four in the same over. </p> <p>The 50 came up in the 10th over, with Hick in particular working the gaps well, and when Abdur Razzaq, the hero of Pakistan's innings, was introduced into the attack in the 11th over, Hussain really took charge. He drove his first ball through the covers for four, then edged him to third man and forced him through the covers off the back foot for two more fours in the same over.</p> <p>Hick joined in by lifting Saqlain Mushtaq straight for six and hitting Razzaq back over his head for four. It was the sort of approach England had to maintain throughout the innings if they were to get close to Pakistan's 304.</p> <p><strong>England's innings</strong></p> <p>England's pursuit of 305 began disastrously as Alec Stewart fell first ball to the third legitimate delivery of the innings. He was given out caught behind off Wasim Akram in controversial circumstances. A delivery was angled across him, Stewart played at it and the ball carried through to Moin Khan. A big appeal went up, but umpire Riazuddin seemed unmoved. Then, after Wasim had already stopped appealing, the umpire lifted his finger with an almost apologetic raise of the eyebrows.</p> <p>Stewart stood transfixed for a moment before slowly trudging off for a golden duck. Replays suggested he probably hadn't touched the ball. It had taken four deliveries - one a no-ball - for the old mistrust between English batsmen and Pakistan umpires to rear its head once more. </p> <p><strong>50-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>Pakistan finished their 50 overs on 304 for 9 in the first one-day international against England at Karachi. They were indebted to Inzamam-ul-Haq, who hit an increasingly powerful 71, and to a gloriously free-flowing 75* off just 40 balls from Abdur Razzaq. </p> <p>Inzamam, who became the fifth player to reach 1000 runs in one-dayers in the 2000 calendar year, and Yousuf Youhana had added 100 for the fourth wicket when Yousuf tried to cut a quicker from one from Darren Gough and gave Alec Stewart his third catch behind the stumps. Yousuf out for a slowish 35 off 64 balls, Pakistan 197 for 4.</p> <p>The 200 came up when Inzamam pulled a short delivery from Mark Ealham through midwicket, but Ealham had his revenge in his next over as Inzamam lapped a full toss straight to Andy Flintoff at midwicket for 71 (219 for 5).</p> <p>Then Razzaq took over. He lifted Ealham for six the ball after rapping him on the shins with a hefty drive, then mowed White over long-on for six more to bring a screaming crowd to its feet. But when Moin tried to repeat the shot, he succeeded only in picking out Vikram Solanki at long-on for a 12-ball 18 (267 for 6).</p> <p>In the 48th over, Wasim Akram was run out by Ashley Giles without facing a ball (271 for 7), Razzaq moved to a superb 29-ball 50, and Waqar Younis was run out for 1 by a direct hit from long-on, again by Giles (277 for 8). </p> <p>But Razzaq was undaunted. In the final over he clouted Gough for six over wide long-on, and although Gough bowled Saqlain with a ball to go, Pakistan had already passed 300. The final six overs had cost 73. England limped off to deafening roars. They will need to score at 6.10 an over.</p> <p><strong>35-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana came through a sticky period to lay the base for an all-out assault in the final overs in the first one-dayer in Karachi. After 35 overs Pakistan had moved to 169 for 3, with every stroke cheered to the rafters by a capacity crowd of 45,000.</p> <p>Pakistan had found runs hard to come by after losing Salim Elahi (28) and Imran Nazir (30) in quick succession, but Inzamam and Yousuf know all about pacing a one-day knock. They saw off a fiery burst from Darren Gough (Nasser Hussain's policy today has been to give the quicker bowlers short spells) and began to milk the left-arm spin of Ashley Giles without ever really taking him apart.</p> <p>Craig White returned to the attack after five expensive overs for 35 earlier on, and began well, but when he dropped short and wide, Inzamam unfurled his favourite cut shot and the ball raced through point for four. </p> <p>In the next over Inzamam used his feet to thump Giles through mid-on for another boundary to bring up the 150. But Giles was holding his nerve well, and Hussain felt confident enough to bring on Marcus Trescothick in the 32nd over for some gentle changes of pace. </p> <p>Inzamam moved to 50 from 69 balls with a single off Trescothick. If he stayed in, Pakistan were on course for 280 - or more.</p> <p><strong>25-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>England fought back after Pakistan had threatened to run away with things in the first one-dayer at Karachi. With Mark Ealham settling into a rhythm and Andy Caddick making up for a wayward first spell, Pakistan reached 121 for 3 after 25 overs, having scored just 29 in their previous ten.</p> <p>They had started to lose some momentum after the dismissal of the hard-hitting Salim Elahi for 28 (87 for 2). Five tight overs later it was 97 for 3 when Caddick found some in-swing to bowl Imran Nazir middle and leg through the gate for 30. As so often with Caddick, a wicket meant a transformation, and, supported by some exceptional fielding, he and Ealham (6-0-15-1) began to drag England back into it.</p> <p>They were helped by Inazamam-ul-Haq's reluctance to look for quick singles, but on a flat wicket and in searing heat, it was admirable stuff. The 100 came up in the 20th over, and when Inzamam worked an attempted Caddick yorker through mid-on for four, it was Pakistan's first boundary for 58 deliveries.</p> <p>There's plenty of time left for Pakistan to build a big total, but England have at least shown that they can keep things quiet.</p> <p> <strong>15-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>Pakistan got off to a flyer in the first one-day international against England at Karachi. After winning the toss and batting first on the sort of flat wicket England only ever see on their travels, Pakistan raced away to 92 for 2 after 15 overs. It was a reminder that the comfort zone of skittling Zimbabwe and West Indies on greentops can be misleading.</p> <p>Saeed Anwar can be unstoppable when the ball comes on to the bat, and he worked Andy Caddick's second ball to fine leg for four. In the next over, Anwar took three boundaries off Darren Gough, cutting him hard, then flicking him wristily past leg-slip and whipping him through midwicket. After two overs it was 20 for 0 and Anwar had 19 of them.</p> <p>England didn't help their cause by donating four wides - three of them in a row by Caddick - and three no-balls in the first four overs. But then Pakistan didn't really need much help anyway. Imran Nazir, who had edged Caddick just in front of Alec Stewart behind the stumps, cut the same bowler for four, and after six overs it was 39 for 0.</p> <p>Enter Craig White. With his first ball he found Anwar's outside edge and Stewart held on. With Anwar out for 24, it was 39 for 1. Nazir straight-drove Gough for four, and brought up the fifty next ball with a push into the covers for two - a rare example of a Pakistan batsman not trying to hit the cover off the ball.</p> <p>Two overs later Nazir lofted Mark Ealham over long-on for six, while at the other end, Salim Elahi, who took 120 off just 103 balls when England met Pakistan A on Sunday, was starting to enjoy himself too. He worked White to fine-leg for four, and thumped him over mid-on for four more in the same over. The boundaries were flowing now and the crowd were going wild. This was Pakistan.</p> <p>But Ealham struck in the 14th over to restore some control as Elahi top-edged a cut into Stewart's gloves and departed reluctantly for a 24-ball 28 (87 for 2).</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

After two overs it was 20 for 0 and Anwar had 19 of them. England didn't help their cause by donating four wides - three of them in a row by Caddick - and three no-balls in the first four overs. But then Pakistan didn't really need much help anyway. Imran Nazir, who had edged Caddick just in front of Alec Stewart behind the stumps, cut the same bowler for four, and after six overs it was 39 for 0. Enter Craig White. With his first ball he found Anwar's outside edge and Stewart held on. With Anwar out for 24, it was 39 for 1. Nazir straight-drove Gough for four, and brought up the fifty next ball with a push into the covers for two - a rare example of a Pakistan batsman not trying to hit the cover off the ball. Two overs later Nazir lofted Mark Ealham over long-on for six, while at the other end, Salim Elahi, who took 120 off just 103 balls when England met Pakistan A on Sunday, was starting to enjoy himself too. He worked White to fine-leg for four, and thumped him over mid-on for four more in the same over. The boundaries were flowing now and the crowd were going wild. This was Pakistan. But Ealham struck in the 14th over to restore some control as Elahi top-edged a cut into Stewart's gloves and departed reluctantly for a 24-ball 28 (87 for 2).

Add to the record four years as prime minister, two spells as leader of the opposition and a crowded case of other jobs from chief whip to the father of the House, and Sir Edward's status is established beyond doubt.</p> <p>That makes his decision to retire from the Commons at the next election, announced this afternoon, a landmark in parliament's evolution, a more interesting event than, say, John Major's similar announcement earlier this year. He is one of the last active connections with a political age which took parliament seriously. Tony Blair is unlikely to clock up five decades in the Commons, and would not hope to do so. The Commons is no longer where it is at.</p> <p>Not that Sir Edward Heath was entirely a parliament man. In the late 1960s his party saw him as a telegenic leader who could challenge Harold Wilson, a break with the slow pace of the previous Conservative party leader, Sir Alec Douglas-Home.

      "bodyText": "Sir Edward Heath's unbroken survival as an MP, from the age of Atlee to that of Tony Blair, would be enough to earn him a place in British political history. Add to the record four years as prime minister, two spells as leader of the opposition and a crowded case of other jobs from chief whip to the father of the House, and Sir Edward's status is established beyond doubt. That makes his decision to retire from the Commons at the next election, announced this afternoon, a landmark in parliament's evolution, a more interesting event than, say, John Major's similar announcement earlier this year. He is one of the last active connections with a political age which took parliament seriously. Tony Blair is unlikely to clock up five decades in the Commons, and would not hope to do so. The Commons is no longer where it is at. Not that Sir Edward Heath was entirely a parliament man. In the late 1960s his party saw him as a telegenic leader who could challenge Harold Wilson, a break with the slow pace of the previous Conservative party leader, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. As prime minister, Sir Edward became was famous for his addiction to yacht racing. Less well-known is that he took up sailing on the advice of Conservative image makers. And even Sir Edward's time in parliament after his prime ministership had its mysteries: not least his apparently close relationship with the leaders of communist China and the real nature of his views on Margaret Thatcher. That, though, will not prevent MPs from all sides of the house regretting his impending departure. With Sir Edward in his place on the green leather benches, among the Liberal Democrats, the chamber somehow seemed a little more important than it will once he has gone. Sir Edward Heath factfile Born: 9 July, 1916 Elected to Parliament: February 1950 First political job: Assistant whip, February 1951 Chief whip: December 1955, to Anthony Eden Entered Cabinet: October 1959, as minister of Labour Key role: Negotiating entry to the EEC, 1963, as president of the board of trade Party leader: July 1965, replacing Alec Douglas-Home Became prime minister: June 1970, replacing Harold Wilson Key event: Taking Britain into EEC, 1972 Defeated: February 1974, in wake of three-day week Defeated once more: October 1974 Replaced as leader of the opposition: 1975",

Nationwide, tens of thousands of teachers have had training in using the system, know as Hands On Equations, which was developed by Dr Henry Borenson, a Pennsylvania maths teacher. </p> <p>\"I wanted to literally make algebra child's play,\" explains Borenson, who developed his system with the help of children with learning difficulties. \"We have had a lot of feedback that using the equipment greatly boosts children's self-esteem. Teachers who struggled themselves with algebra have called it a revelation.\" </p> <p>America's National Council for Teachers of Mathematics is spearheading the drive to begin teaching some high school maths concepts, algebra in particular, to children as young as six. According to the council's president, Lee Stiff, results over the past five years have been impressive, aided by educational toys such as Borenson's. \"We have evidence from a number of states showing that nine-year-olds are doing better at basic algebra than older kids who come to it cold,\" he said. </p> <p>The American approach was welcomed last week by British maths experts, many of whom believe algebra is introduced too late into UK schools. Roger Fentem, a maths educator who trains primary and secondary teachers at the College of St Mark and St John in Plymouth, described as \"astonishing\" the prowess shown by Vicki Fisk's class. \"In Britain we would expect a bright 12-year-old or an average 14-year-old to solve that equation,\" he said. </p> <p>Barry Lewis, director of UK Maths Year 2000, launched in January to \"challenge the national fear of figures\", agreed. \"The leap from physical numbers into abstract qualities such as using letters in equations is the critical place where maths leaves many students behind,\" he said. \"We support making algebra accessible and exciting at as young an age as possible. This kind of educational toy, which emphasises the concept of balance as the central principle of algebra, is spot on.\" </p> <p>Such educational toys, however, are not generally used in British schools although many secondary-school textbooks and maths computer games use balance beam illustrations to teach algebra. What's more the national numeracy strategy, launched in September 1999 to raise basic maths standards, explicitly excludes algebra teaching in primary schools. As a result, children do not start learning even the most basic algebraic equations or formulae, such as 5 plus x = 8, therefore x = 3, until they reach 11 or 12. </p> <p>\"Really children should be learning such formulae as soon as teachers start asking them \"five plus what is eight?\" which is usually around seven or eight years old,\" said Fentem. \"Part of the way ahead is to raise primary school teachers' knowledge of basic algebra and their confidence in their ability to link numeracy lessons with algebra. Based on the success of the numeracy strategy so far, I believe we should see great strides in algebra standards among British children over the next few years.\" </p> <p>Making such strides is not just about academic success. American research suggests that pupils who drop out of algebra are less likely to achieve successful careers in well-paid fields such as computing and engineering. And a recent British study found that students achieving maths A-level went on to earn incomes roughly 20% higher than fellow students with only arts A-levels. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a pioneering maths-teaching programme developed by Exeter University's School of Education will give some insight over the next few years into whether teaching algebra early could be as successful here as in the US. Forty primary schools around the country are using specialised lesson plans to introduce simple algebraic concepts to children as young as five. \"I believe teaching algebra at 11 or 12 is far too late. Pupils find it very scary because they have no foundations in place to understand what the x and the brackets mean,\" says Professor David Burghes, who heads Exeter's School of Education and sat on the government's national numeracy task force. </p> <p>\"We find that five-year-olds have no problems understanding that 5 plus a square box equals 7 and then working out that the box equals 2.

A teenager was shot dead in clashes near the Erez crossing and a 13 year-old Palestinian boy, Iyad Shaath, died of a gunshot wound to the head suffered four days ago in the Gaza Strip. Israeli army commander colonel Noam Tivon said the military does not expect the clashes to end soon. \"We definitely need to prepare for a long period of conflict,\" he said. The clashes have now claimed 126 lives in almost four weeks of fighting. Mr Barak called on Sunday for a \"timeout\" in the peace process - a move Sharon had urged - and launched talks with the opposition leader. Mr Sharon, who leads the right-wing Likud party, reportedly demanded measures to ensure his equal say in whether the peace process is renewed. Palestinians and Israeli liberals have warned that Mr Sharon's inclusion in the government will crush the peace process. \"Sharon is simply not interested in the peace process,\" said Ziad Abu Amr, a Palestinian political analyst. Mr Sharon believes that Israel should cling to land captured in the 1967 six day war rather than trade it for a peace with the Palestinians Mr Barak's decision to withdraw from the peace process has put on hold seven years of negotiations with the Palestinians.",

Like Del on the make with a suitcase of Lithuanian Pok\u00e9mon, Crozier is having a bit of difficulty punting his product to punters.

Power, he decided, smelt good. Real good. And at that moment, Sgt Wilko began to dream. He dreamt of his previous triumphs at the FA: of how he seized the office photocopier from some woman from accounts, and how he stole the position of England's U-21 coach from right under Peter Taylor's nose. And surely there was more to come. Like an extended run as England manager, for example.</p> <p>But then Howard woke up to find his empire crumbling. The FA's chief executive Adam Crozier had put Peter Taylor in charge of England for the friendly against Italy. And, worse still, Brian Kidd had been \"asked\" to help out with the U-21s - right in the heart of Wilko's empire. Suddenly, Wilko's friends - well, former Leeds chairman Bill Fotherby - had turned on him too. \"Howard will view Peter Taylor's appointment as an insult,\" said Fotherby. \"I am not criticising Peter because he is a good manager but it appears as though Howard will have to leave the FA.\" </p> <p>Who would want the gruff Yorkshireman? \"I think he could walk out and immediately find himself a new job because everybody knows what a good manager he is,\" claimed Fothers, deftly skipping over the fact that Wilko was sacked from the last proper job he had. However, this afternoon, Wilko stepped in to end all the rumours. \"My position has not changed at all,\" he droned. \"I think everything has been said that needs to be said.\" Apart from the words \"I'm\" and \"off\", of course.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I don't think Steve McClaren or Peter Taylor have done anything in management to warrant being in charge of an England team, at any time.

However, it now transpires that Tamudo is \"almost fully fit\" - so much so that he could be playing for his club in Euro-Vase on Thursday. \"He just has a little bit of liquid on his right knee,\" explained exasperated Espanol club doctor Salvador Oliveras. \"The ligaments are in perfect condition and he is virtually recovered. I don't know what the Rangers doctors have picked up.\" </p> <p>Sadly for the popular Glasgow giants, the broken deal is unlikely to be fixed as easily as Tamudo's so-called knackered peg. \"I would rather play for the team which is in my heart,\" the messed-about player explained in the Scottish Sun. \"Espanol spoke to me and forced me to accept Rangers' offer to save the club but I would rather play for them than Rangers.

Yet such an addiction can be damaging. On the physical side, too much exertion can leave our bodies vulnerable to injury and unable to fight disease and infection. Socially, it can lead to broken marriages, lost jobs and neglected friends and family. </p> <p>With hindsight, Smith realises this. \"I didn't have a relationship for a long time because of my obsession with exercise, and my career was affected because I only took jobs that would allow me to do the routine I wanted,\" she says. \"I'd train if I was ill or injured but I never thought there was something wrong. I just thought I really loved doing sport.\" </p> <p>The medical world is not short on theories explaining why the drive to exercise can become so compulsive that it is actually harmful. Some point to the chemical properties of a strenuous work-out, including an endorphine-induced \"high\": a number of reports have likened the effect to that of the anti-depressant drug Prozac. Others show that exercise can lower anxiety, improve mood and provide a sense of mastery and self-esteem. </p> <p>None of which sounds particularly damaging in the short term: after all, sport is something that complements and enhances our lives. The difference for the exercise addict is that sport is their life. </p> <p>Susan Van Scoyoc, a counselling psychologist, treats exercise addicts, but says most go unnoticed. \"It is seen as a kind of healthy addiction which, of course, is a contradiction in terms. It can be as damaging and all-consuming as a drug or alcohol addiction, but most people don't recognise it because of its association with healthy living.\" </p> <p>Van Scoyoc relates a story of a young girl who, even while preparing food or taking a bath, felt she had to keep exercising and moving. \"She would even hide in her bedroom doing press-ups,\" says Scoyoc. \"Her behaviour was affecting the whole family.\" </p> <p>As with drug and alcohol dependencies, a sporting obsession can provide a sort of quick-fix high that feeds a habit. Smith says she enjoyed \"the really good, fit body that people would comment on\", and describes how, mid-routine, she \"felt really good about myself\" - a feeling that waned as soon as she paused to stop and think. For this reason, some psychologists see exercise addiction as having as many psychological triggers as physical ones and believe that, as a habit, it is just another way of manifesting a problem of low self-esteem. </p> <p>\"We treat exercise addicts no differently from any other addicts,\" says Andrew Vincent, the addictions treatment programme manager at the Priory hospital in Sturt, Surrey. \"They would be in group therapy with alcoholics, drug addicts, shopping addicts and all kinds of other addicts, because it boils down to the same thing - a way of avoiding emotional pain and events.\" </p> <p>Even if they aren't laughed out of the therapy room by the more \"hardcore\" addicts - \"before they get to know each other that's almost always the initial reaction,\" says Vincent - exercise junkies face further obstacles. Where others can set their sights on total abstinence, therapists and patients realise that this impossible for exercise-dependent people who can easily slip back into their old routine. </p> <p>\"We encourage all our patients to get out and about during the day, but we did have to voice concerns about one woman who was doing early morning running with the rest of the group. It was OK for them, but she needed to be a bit careful - just like an alcoholic drinking with friends. You can't just start up again because everyone else is doing it.\" </p> <p>The common thread linking many exercise addicts is that they are female. \"It almost always goes hand-in-hand with anorexia and a poor body image,\" says Van Scoyoc. </p> <p>Twelve years ago, when Jessica Davies's boyfriend made a snide comment about her weight, her confidence hit an all-time low and she became stuck in a cycle of excessive daily exercise in an attempt to lose weight. \"I was 22 and I went down to about seven stone. When my mum saw me she was horrified and took me to the doctor straight away,\" she says. \"I've got over my addiction now but I think I will always be conscious I need to exercise to keep my weight to a stable level.\" </p> <p>Smith says she was vulnerable because of what she now recognises as \"a classical addicted personality\". Just like other addictions she has suffered, she remembers how her habit crept up. \"I just needed to do more and more and more.

      "body": "<p>The Maben-Mead family have been waiting a long time to fly to Australia, but later this week they will finally leave. After a massive fundraising effort, Jill Maben and Robert Mead are taking their eight-year-old son George to Melbourne in the hope that pioneering brain surgery, not currently available in the UK, will remove a rare form of tumour and transform his quality of life. </p> <p>It is certainly not the first time that friends, family and volunteers have rallied round to support an exhausting wave of sponsored walks, jumble sales and raffles in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the costs of \"miracle\" medical treatment on the other side of the world which is not offered by the NHS. American hospitals, in particular, have been marketing themselves aggressively to vulnerable British patients - particularly to candidates for brain-tumour surgery - even though the outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic have been more or less the same. </p> <p>George has a rare benign tumour, known as a hypothalamic hamartoma, deep inside his brain in the region which controls mood, appetite, thirst, sleep and hormones. The little-known condition has given him severe learning and behavioural difficulties, and up to 15 epileptic seizures a day. There is no known cure, apart from complex surgery to remove the tumour - and even that has been largely unsuccessful, under techniques used in Britain. </p> <p>Then, through an international support group on the internet, Jill and Robert learned of pioneering micro-surgery with a high success rate at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. With the encouragement of the surgeons they have talked to all 12 of the previous patients, and their son is due to undergo surgery next month. </p> <p>George talks like a four-year-old and cannot read or write. His motor skills are poor, though like many people with autism - another effect of his condition - he has an amazing memory, able to recite parrot fashion all the names of his vast video collection. \"George's quality of life at the moment is already very poor,\" Robert says. \"He has no friends of his own age and no interest at all in going out or meeting other people. His world revolves around his Postman Pat and Disney videos. Without the operation, there is no doubt that his condition would deteriorate further.\" </p> <p>The normal development of George's younger sister Lola, who at 19 months is just saying her first words, makes the pain greater still. Though George attends a special school in Essex, some distance from the family's home in Hackney, east London, looking after him is so demanding that Robert has given up his job in a respite home, and spends much time teaching George in a specially-designed playroom in the family's garden. The couple raised the \u00a316,500 needed for the operation in three months, though they must still raise \u00a33,500 to cover accommodation, travel and other expenses. </p> <p>It took three years before George's condition was diagnosed. He appeared slow to develop, and did not walk until he was 18 months old; his speech, when it came at age two, was largely restricted to single words. The local clinic talked of \"general global delay\", and George was investigated for hearing loss and provided with speech therapy. But it was the first major seizure - in the middle of the night, with three of them in the bed - that sounded the alarm. </p> <p>A scan revealed a tumour, and neurologists at Great Ormond Street hospital in London said the rest of the brain appeared normal. Only then did his parents realise that George's odd, staccato-like cries as a baby - which everyone had called \"cute\" - had actually been minor seizures. </p> <p>George was born with the tumour, which grows at the same rate as his brain and is now up to 2cm across. Its presence causes him to have a very rare form of \"gelastic\" epilepsy which results in 10 to 15 \"laughing seizures\" every day as a result of constant electrical activity. </p> <p>Great Ormond Street told them George's condition was inoperable, and energies were directed towards \"symptom management\", keeping his seizures under control by regular medication. But it was a lonely and difficult time for Jill, herself trained as a nurse, who started extensive research in search of information. \"It was a relief to find that there was something there. But I remember sitting in the British Library and reading about 'cognitive decline' in relation to gelastic epilepsy.

      "bodyText": "The Maben-Mead family have been waiting a long time to fly to Australia, but later this week they will finally leave. After a massive fundraising effort, Jill Maben and Robert Mead are taking their eight-year-old son George to Melbourne in the hope that pioneering brain surgery, not currently available in the UK, will remove a rare form of tumour and transform his quality of life. It is certainly not the first time that friends, family and volunteers have rallied round to support an exhausting wave of sponsored walks, jumble sales and raffles in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the costs of \"miracle\" medical treatment on the other side of the world which is not offered by the NHS. American hospitals, in particular, have been marketing themselves aggressively to vulnerable British patients - particularly to candidates for brain-tumour surgery - even though the outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic have been more or less the same. George has a rare benign tumour, known as a hypothalamic hamartoma, deep inside his brain in the region which controls mood, appetite, thirst, sleep and hormones. The little-known condition has given him severe learning and behavioural difficulties, and up to 15 epileptic seizures a day. There is no known cure, apart from complex surgery to remove the tumour - and even that has been largely unsuccessful, under techniques used in Britain. Then, through an international support group on the internet, Jill and Robert learned of pioneering micro-surgery with a high success rate at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. With the encouragement of the surgeons they have talked to all 12 of the previous patients, and their son is due to undergo surgery next month. George talks like a four-year-old and cannot read or write. His motor skills are poor, though like many people with autism - another effect of his condition - he has an amazing memory, able to recite parrot fashion all the names of his vast video collection. \"George's quality of life at the moment is already very poor,\" Robert says. \"He has no friends of his own age and no interest at all in going out or meeting other people. His world revolves around his Postman Pat and Disney videos. Without the operation, there is no doubt that his condition would deteriorate further.\" The normal development of George's younger sister Lola, who at 19 months is just saying her first words, makes the pain greater still. Though George attends a special school in Essex, some distance from the family's home in Hackney, east London, looking after him is so demanding that Robert has given up his job in a respite home, and spends much time teaching George in a specially-designed playroom in the family's garden. The couple raised the \u00a316,500 needed for the operation in three months, though they must still raise \u00a33,500 to cover accommodation, travel and other expenses. It took three years before George's condition was diagnosed. He appeared slow to develop, and did not walk until he was 18 months old; his speech, when it came at age two, was largely restricted to single words. The local clinic talked of \"general global delay\", and George was investigated for hearing loss and provided with speech therapy. But it was the first major seizure - in the middle of the night, with three of them in the bed - that sounded the alarm. A scan revealed a tumour, and neurologists at Great Ormond Street hospital in London said the rest of the brain appeared normal. Only then did his parents realise that George's odd, staccato-like cries as a baby - which everyone had called \"cute\" - had actually been minor seizures. George was born with the tumour, which grows at the same rate as his brain and is now up to 2cm across. Its presence causes him to have a very rare form of \"gelastic\" epilepsy which results in 10 to 15 \"laughing seizures\" every day as a result of constant electrical activity. Great Ormond Street told them George's condition was inoperable, and energies were directed towards \"symptom management\", keeping his seizures under control by regular medication. But it was a lonely and difficult time for Jill, herself trained as a nurse, who started extensive research in search of information. \"It was a relief to find that there was something there. But I remember sitting in the British Library and reading about 'cognitive decline' in relation to gelastic epilepsy. It was all extremely depressing.\" Next, Jill turned to the internet, and after several months traced six other families whose children had the same kind of tumour. Without treatment, George's epilepsy would be likely to worsen, possibly even leading to \"drop seizures\", where a person literally drops to the ground and risks serious injury; but with the radical Australian surgery - involving a delicate five-hour operation through a 2cm incision in the top of the head - the tumour will be removed completely and, if successful, will end the seizures while also halting learning decline. By the time the surgeon involved, Professor Jeffrey Rosenfeld, sees George next month, he will have operated on 12 children, all of whom are virtually seizure-free. The most recent surgery was carried out just two weeks ago. Jill admits that her own medical background was a help in researching the operation. \"But one of the most important things for us is being able to communicate with other families via the internet, including the 12 whose children have had the surgery in Australia,\" she says. \"Instead of feeling that we were on our own, it has been great to share the experience with so many other people.

I mean, if you'd been paying any attention to what I've been telling you over the past 10 weeks - cripes, look at how impatient I've become - you would be under the impression that my whole life is an unending series of bad moments, death, disease, dishonour, dismay, and all the other junior doctor stuff. But that's not true. I've worked it all out now: it only seems shit when you're not there. </p> <p>So, on Sunday morning, after two nights of four hours' sleep, after the weekend when winter came early for the relentlessly diseased inhabitants of our catchment area - a weekend which I had inadvertently started with a hangover - my skin was blotchy, my eyes were red, my head was throbbing, and I was in seventh heaven. </p> <p>I had seen dozens of patients, two of whom were kicking-off simultaneously before my very eyes (meaning that one of them was definitely my problem) and I was loving every nanosecond. Every nurse was my friend, every vein caught first time, and the symptoms and signs were arranging themselves into neat little frameworks of recognisable pathology. </p> <p>I might not have been the best doctor in the world, but I was there in the fray, coping with my job, running through protocols and affecting an air of empathic sensitivity whilst feeling pretty damn' butch, I can tell you. </p> <p>Whereas right now, I am sitting at a kitchen table in the flat of my oldest friend, digesting some home-cooked food, listening to a record, smoking a cigarette, surrounded by home comforts, and I feel utterly dismal. The coming weekend, another on-call (by a cruel accident of our barmy rota) hangs over me like a threat. I am watching the clock and calculating exactly how little sleep I can get away with and still function tomorrow. I'd be OK if the outside world didn't exist. </p> <p>I suspect that what you really want to hear about are disasters. Unhappy as I am to oblige (to a frail mortal such as myself, this \"when doctors kill\" business on the telly is a bit demoralising) let me at least furnish you with a paradox. I discover to my astonishment that I am not entirely without worth in the hospital. </p> <p>On Saturday, casualty was knee-deep. They were crawling up the walls in the waiting room, so our consultant, demonstrating a breathtakingly egalitarian outlook, grabbed the fresh new medical student and announced that he would go and clerk in a couple of the new patients. </p> <p>There are two things that should immediately strike you about this scenario. First, the fact that there is a medical student in the hospital on a Saturday morning is something I find deeply threatening, since when I was a student, Saturday (much like Friday and Monday) was a day of rest. </p> <p>Second, consultants do not clerk patients. They write papers on diseases that no one ever gets. For the most part, they float in once a week and spend two hours being nice to you about all the easy patients you have managed in a fairly mediocre fashion. </p> <p>They sit in committee meetings (I am told) comparing their immense private-practice pay cheques under the table, chuckling over the government's new rules for incoming consultants which state that they must do NHS work exclusively for the first seven years of their contract, and roaring with laughter over the extra clientele this will bring them. </p> <p>My own consultant, almost uniquely, takes you aside for regular chats where you feel that if you really wanted, you could probably confess that you drop into the toilets for the occasional cry about once a week, and he would have some sound advice to offer on the subject. Consultants do not clerk patients in the casualty department. </p> <p>Three hours later he emerged, calmly announced that everything was in hand, rather impressively using the word \"sorted\" - which I can only assume he picked up from our streetwise teenage medical student - and no-one dared or thought to question the matter as the patients clamoured at the windows outside. </p> <p>After another three hours, it transpired that the patient in question had no blood tests done, no drug chart, no chest X-ray, no medication, and had no bed booked.

They go ahead and publish anyway. </p> <p>Dr McCrone, head and founder of the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago, knows the type. He showed the Turin Shroud was a medieval painting, not the impression of Christ's body; they ignored him. He showed that samples of Napoleon's hair proved he did not die of arsenic poisoning; they ignored him. Most recently, he found that the levels of lead in samples from the shaggy mane of Ludwig von Beethoven were the same as levels in his own hair. </p> <p>They ignored him, and told the world that Beethoven had sickened and died of lead poisoning. \"They usually have a vested interest, or at least a personal interest, in my conclusion - which means they're usually not going to believe what I tell them,\" he says. </p> <p>Where the famous dead are concerned, there is always room for scientific disagreement. And when the science runs out, it just leaves more room for speculation. Bill Walsh, of the Health Research Institute in Naperville, Illinois, one of the champions of the Beethoven-had-lead-poisoning theory, which was made public last week, carried out tests on bits of the 582 hairs in custody of a Californian university in another lab, rather than McCrone's, and got more exciting results. </p> <p>The Argonne National Laboratory showed the composer, who died in 1827 aged 56, had 100 times the normal modern levels of lead in his hair. \"It was a surprise, but it stood out like a sore thumb in the analysis,\" said McCrone. There are a lot of sore thumbs out there in the arcane world of the historians of last hours - those scientists, doctors and amateur sleuths who pore over old evidence to produce new theories about how great figures of the past met their end. Somewhere infield from those who believe Elvis Presley still stalks the aisles of Wal-Mart, for them the amount of lead in the hair of a genius will always be as important as the sound of his Fifth Symphony. </p> <p>It makes Isaac Newton's theory of gravity no more or less inspired that he may have died of lead poisoning too, as some claim, or mercury - but there are investigators who want to know, and want you to know that they know. </p> <p>Despite McCrone's analysis showing the contrary, the International Napoleonic Society of Quebec, Canada, still insists that its hero was poisoned. It's not enough that his name will live for ever as a military genius and disrupter of Europe. Nor is it any consolation that he would have died anyway - although not, the society perhaps hopes, before he had managed to liberate French Canada from the shackles of perfidious English rule. </p> <p>No, the world must know that Napoleon was slain by slow poisoning with arsenic over a period of months, followed by an orange and almond-flavoured cyanide drink. It is as if no-one great can be permitted a simple, ordinary death. Where there is clarity, there has to be mystery. Where there is mystery, there have to be multiple explanations. </p> <p>American literary investigators have entertained themselves for years with speculation about the death of Edgar Allen Poe, who came to Baltimore in 1849, was found drunk and incoherent outside a tavern, fell into a coma in hospital, had a violent fit, repeatedly screamed the name \"Reynolds\", and eventually died. He was buried, but when 26 years later they wanted to move him to a grander tomb, they couldn't identify his remains and, in the end, used a skeleton which probably belonged to someone else. </p> <p>The nearest English version is Shakespeare's contemporary Christopher Marlowe, whose death in a tavern brawl in 1593 has provoked more fascination and argument in recent years than his blank verse. Was he a spy? Was he gay? Was his murder premeditated? </p> <p>The lack of physical evidence to analyse, like hair and bones, is no obstacle to the death investigators. A German scholar concluded, without the aid of photographs, x-rays or even an authenticated life or death drawing of the playwright, that Shakespeare died of eye cancer. </p> <p>In studying the deaths of the famous, it is not necessary, or even desirable, to prove that the victim died of anything romantic or exciting. Indeed, the more romantic and exciting the subject, like Alexander the Great - whose death at 32 has been mulled over for millennia - the better it is to show that he expired of something prosaic. So it was that Dr David W Oldach, of the University of Maryland, concluded in the New England Journal of Medicine a couple of years ago that the brilliant, bisexual conqueror of south Asia had died of salmonella. </p> <p>As culture mutates, it seems likely that the famous-death investigators will turn their attention next to the fertile world of modern music. Already there have been claims that former Rolling Stones guitarist Brain Jones, found dead in a swimming pool in 1969, was murdered. Evidence recedes, memories fade, old news turns to history, and while the music lives on, the talk among a minority turns to exhumations and DNA. </p> <p>With listings in the Fuller Up website - a directory of dead musicians - for death by bombing, farming, golfing (Bing Crosby), inhalation of vomit, heroin, Russian roulette, poor maintenance and tragic accident (misc), there is plenty of scope for scientists to show that it was something other than the rock and roll which killed them.</p>",

In studying the deaths of the famous, it is not necessary, or even desirable, to prove that the victim died of anything romantic or exciting. Indeed, the more romantic and exciting the subject, like Alexander the Great - whose death at 32 has been mulled over for millennia - the better it is to show that he expired of something prosaic. So it was that Dr David W Oldach, of the University of Maryland, concluded in the New England Journal of Medicine a couple of years ago that the brilliant, bisexual conqueror of south Asia had died of salmonella. As culture mutates, it seems likely that the famous-death investigators will turn their attention next to the fertile world of modern music. Already there have been claims that former Rolling Stones guitarist Brain Jones, found dead in a swimming pool in 1969, was murdered. Evidence recedes, memories fade, old news turns to history, and while the music lives on, the talk among a minority turns to exhumations and DNA. With listings in the Fuller Up website - a directory of dead musicians - for death by bombing, farming, golfing (Bing Crosby), inhalation of vomit, heroin, Russian roulette, poor maintenance and tragic accident (misc), there is plenty of scope for scientists to show that it was something other than the rock and roll which killed them.",

So, farewell then 1995 winner Damien Hirst, with your dotty works, your exploration of mortality (sic) and your deft publicity technique. 4.

      "body": "<p><strong> Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl </strong><br> (Puffin, \u00a34.99)<br></p> <p> Frivolity, zits and boyfriend trouble are the subjects of most fictional teenage diaries, but the real things are often born out of more urgent and terrible experiences. The most famous of all is that of Anne Frank, which charts her life in hiding in an Amsterdam warehouse during the Nazi occupation. It is a remarkable document because Anne gives such a remarkably vivid account of her family's struggle to survive and her own growing up, zits and all. The diary breaks off on the day that the family were discovered in August 1944. Anne died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen in 1945 just a few months before the end of the war. This is a marvellous, compulsive read that personalises history and allows the reader to understand the fate of the Nazis' six million Jewish victims through the experience of one. </p> <p><strong> Zlata's Diary</strong><br> (Puffin, \u00a34.99) <br></p> <p>This diary charts a more modern conflict as it details a child's life in Sarajevo as war takes grip. As with Anne Frank's diary, it is notable for the way that ordinary anxieties and pleasures - learning the piano, having a bath - take precedence over the horrors of war. Zlata Filipovic has none of Frank's self-awareness, but this eyewitness account of life in a war zone somehow makes the conflict seem much more real than any TV news footage. </p> <p><strong> Catherine: The Story of a Young Girl Who Died of Anorexia Nervosa</strong><br> (Puffin, \u00a34.99) <br></p> <p>Catherine: The Story... is written by her mother, Maureen Dunbar, intercut with excerpts from Catherine's own diary. Catherine's despairing and harrowing insights into the tragedy of her own life - in which every mouthful is detailed and each of the 100 laxatives a day she consumes are counted out -tells you more about the trap of the disease than Dunbar's musings. </p> <p><strong> Witch Child</strong><br> (Bloomsbury, \u00a310.99)<br></p> <p> Fiction can be pretty harrowing too. Celia Rees's book takes the form of a 17th-century journal that 300 years later is found sewn into the lining of a quilt. Mary, a teenager whose grandmother is executed as a witch, writes the diary. Mary escapes out of the frying pan and into the fire, journeying to the New World and Salem. Rees's book is cleverly constructed and written with both grace and urgency as it convincingly charts the psychology and circumstances that engendered witch-hunts. </p> <p><strong> Everybody Else Does! Why Can't I?</strong> <br> (Piccadilly Press \u00a35.99)<br></p> <p> On a lighter note is Yvonne Coppard's entertaining double diary, purportedly written by GCSE student Jenny and her mum. Funnily enough, it is Jenny's voice that seems more authentic of the two. </p> <p><strong> Teenage Worrier's Panick Diary</strong><br> (Corgi, \u00a34.99)<br></p> <p>Ros Asquith's book towers above all else in this genre. It's partly because her heroine Letty Chubb - worrier, free thinker, bad speller - is no airhead, and partly because Asquith is brilliant on the jokes and the importance of snogging. Yet she also places Letty firmly in the real world where there are wars going on and refugees sitting at the next desk. It is done with the lightest and wittiest of touches. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Earl Spencer has signed up to write for the internet. The brother of the late Princess of Wales has written 22 articles, mainly about his aristocratic ancestry, for new digital content syndicator eSubstance. Earl Spencer, who will receive a set fee plus royalties each time his work is sold on to third-party websites, said of the move: \"As a writer and journalist I'm excited to be a part of an innovative new way to digitally distribute my work.\" The deal is the third to be struck by eSubstance, which is signing up traditional publishers to repackage and sell their content to websites. Other deals include a far-reaching syndicate agreement with Carlton Books to \"repurpose\" its lifestyle content for sites such as Mothercare, and a deal with bestselling author Frederick Forsyth. A further 15 deals with \"big publishing houses\" are in the process of being wrapped up, according to Mark Bishop, marketing director at eSubstance and former head of new media at HarperCollins UK. Mr Bishop said: \"The Earl Spencer deal is a bit different from most of the publishing deals we're doing as the business is not really about commissioning.\" He hinted that the articles were likely to be sold on to relevant US websites. ESubstance said that the Spencer articles will provide \"a fascinating insight into homes with which the Spencer family has been associated through the centuries\". One of the first pieces eSubstance will offer relates to Earl Spencer's family seat at Althorp, while others will cover houses with which the family has connections including Spencer House and Dublin Castle. Earl Spencer's move on to the internet echoes Prince Edward's attempts to make money out of his ancestry through the TV series Crown and Country. Explaining the purpose of eSubstance, Mr Bishop said it was like putting the wheels on a Ferrari. \"The traditional publishing industry has 400 years' experience, so we're taking that and making offline content fluid while answering the need in the marketplace for strong content that consumers don't have to pay for.\" The company boasts an impressive team drawn from both traditional and online publishing. It was founded by Jeffrey O'Rourke, former director of content strategy at online auctioneer Icollector.com, and Adrian Sington, who has more than 20 years' publishing experience.

For those who missed it first time: in the course of Arsenal's ill-tempered match with Lazio in Rome, Italian fans relentlessly booed the visitors' black players. Additionally, Lazio's Serbian defender Sinisa Mihajlovic allegedly subjected Patrick Vieira to racial abuse for the entire 90 minutes - sample quote: \"N*gg*r of sh*t\". \"Yes, I said that\" admits Mihajlovic, \"but Vieira started it.\" Uefa have given Mihajlovic a two-game European suspension, and his club have fined him \u00a330,000. </p> <p>Our Sinisa is no stranger to controversy, of course. He had close ties with the indicted Serb war criminal Arkan, and on his murder last season invited the Lazio supporters to indulge in their infamous homage: \"Honour to the Tiger\". This summer he was publicly attacking the excess of Argentines in his own team. And now come Vieira's accusations. You might marvel at the irony of a Serb immigrant in Italy making racist remarks, but since Lazio have now imposed a press silence on their players, that's not a point Sinisa can respond to.</p> <p>So on then to the fans, and the back page question in last week's British press: are all these eyeties racists or what? Answer: no, but please put on your sociology hat and consider the following. Racial integration in Italy is 30 - 40 years behind many other European countries, because here large-scale immigration is a relatively recent phenomenon. Despite this, racial attacks and violence of the kind found in Germany are almost unheard of. That's the good news.</p> <p>The bad news is that Italian football does have a very visible problem with racism. Neo-fascist symbols and sloganeering remain popular here, and they've become attached to football in the same way hooliganism did in Britain during the 70s and 80s. In the notoriously un-policed world of the 'Ultras', right-wing groups have bloomed. Last year on 'Gazzetta', for example, we visited the headquarters of Lazio's 'Irriducibili' supporters where a portrait of 'Il Duce' Mussolini hung happily on the wall.</p> <p>It was supporters like these that daubed \"Winter Raus\" on the walls of Rome before Dutchman Aaron Winter arrived at Lazio in 1992.

For them, the booing of black players is merely an unpleasant but unremarkable means of provoking the opposition - in much the same tradition as previous generations' taunts of visiting Neapolitans or Torinese - and despite the fines the League now imposes on clubs here, there's little sign of the practice dying out. </p> <p>Nor have fan-based initiatives met with any long-term success. Maybe it's unrealistic to imagine these mentalities disappearing without the arrival of a generation of black Italian players, and a real integration in the rest of the community.

Against South Africa - even though most of the meetings came in the final, tainted, leather-jacketed days of Hansie Cronje - England have won only one game and lost four.</p> <p>Pakistan are much closer to South Africa than to any of the other teams England have encountered lately. There would be no shame in, say, a hard-fought series ending in a 2-1 defeat.</p> <p><strong> 2 To find a role for the captain </strong><br> From June 1999 to February 2000, Nasser Hussain was a one-day opener. In England last July, he got injured, and Marcus Trescothick and Alec Stewart made so many runs that when Hussain returned, it was at No.6. On this tour so far, in both Kenya and Pakistan, he has been at No.3. Hussain has got into an uncharacteristic muddle. No.3 is where he should be in England, with its green seaming pitches. No.6 is where he should be in Africa or Asia, ready to play the sort of innings Jonty Rhodes plays for South Africa, a scampered 30 or 40. On flat pitches, Hussain (career average: 27) should not allow himself to delay the entrance of Graeme Hick (38) or Graham Thorpe (also 38).</p> <p><strong> 3 ... and for Andy Flintoff </strong><br> Too many of Flintoff's 20-odd international innings have been a quick slog. By sticking him down at No.6, England are all but ensuring that that is the height of his ambitions. If he is in the team at all, he should be in the top four, with a chance of wreaking sustained havoc, as he did for Lancashire against several of his England team-mates - and, more significantly, Saqlain Mushtaq - at The Oval last summer.</p> <p><strong> 4 To collect experience </strong><br> There are two ways to do this: play a lot of matches, and make consistent selections. Pakistan, for all their changes of captain and coach, have managed this: Abdur Razzaq, still only 20 (apparently), has already played 66 one-day internationals and has become one of the world's most effective bowlers, with 96 wickets at 23.</p> <p>England's policy over the years has been the exact opposite - few games, and many changes, so that in almost every one-day game they play, they have far less experience than their opponents. But they have begun to mend their ways now. The team that played Bangladesh in Nairobi was the same XI that beat Zimbabwe in the Triangular final at Lord's in July apart from Alan Mullally, who was ruled out by injury. When they can wobble, they still do: Mullally's place went first to Mark Alleyne, a thoroughly English player who has only ever been picked for England abroad, then to Paul Grayson (ditto) - who can only have been preferred to Robert Croft by selectors who were oblivious to the value of experience. Now that place is poised to go to Ashley Giles. But at least the core of the team is settled. And although England's experience of Pakistan is laughably slight - five of them played there in the 1996 World Cup - the Pakistanis themselves have been so busy flying to Sharjah and Toronto in the past few years, they haven't played many one-dayers at home themselves. Of Razzaq's 66 one-day caps, five have come in Pakistan.</p> <p><strong> 5 To show a little less respect </strong><br> England's summer took a clear turn for the better when they stopped being cowed by the mere sight of Curtly Ambrose or Courtney Walsh lolloping in to bowl to them. One of the moments of the season came when Michael Vaughan pulled Ambrose for four at Lord's. Then Vaughan and Hick took cheeky twos to the two old boys at Headingley, and by the end of the series, even Mike Atherton was playing the pull shot off Ambrose, and Craig White was cover-driving Walsh with some panache. In this series, the role of Walsh is being taken by Wasim Akram, another great old bowler (putting the Qayyum Report aside) who is refusing to fade away. But like any bowler, he can be expensive in one-dayers. Alec Stewart, who plays him better than almost anyone in the world and has a Test average of 66 against Pakistan, must take the lead in treating Akram with a healthy disrespect.</p> <p><strong> 6 To keep their cool </strong><br> In 1987, Mike Gatting was right: the umpiring was appalling. But he was also wrong, because his response didn't make it any better. Umpires give batsmen the benefit of the doubt; England are going to have to give the umpires it too. If they do get sawn off by a bad decision, those that played in the Headingley Test of 1998, when England beat South Africa, should remember how Mike Atherton handled it: by smiling, ruefully.</p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, England went to Pakistan for a couple of one-day warm-up games. They won both with ease, and went on to lift the Champions Trophy in Sharjah - the only one-day cup they have won abroad in the past decade. Last week, they returned to Pakistan for two one-day warm-ups, and won both with ease. So one omen is good for the three-match one-day series which begins today. Whether England can be expected to beat Pakistan on their own turf, or baked mud, is another matter. Can they do it? Yes. Will they? Probably not. Here are six targets for England that are a little more realistic. 1 To compete England have improved at one-day cricket since the miserable low point of the 1999 World Cup, winning 10 games and losing six with two no-results.

      "body": "<p>There are at points real conflict between the immediate interests of consumption and the longer term interests of the environment; and to be frank, between the politicans' need to woo the electorate a well as lead them.</p> <p>My point is simply this. We must work at resolving these conflicts or finding a way through. And we should recognise that to be environmentally conscious isn't a punishment. It is indeed in our long term interests; and it can also be of benefit, short and medium term too. What's more there is a real concern and desire amongst our people, within realistic bounds, to do the right thing. We have children and granchildren.</p> <p>We care for them. We know that despoiling the environment today will mean hardship, even death for them tomorrow. Call it idealism or even just family values: there is an energy and commitment there we can harness.</p> <p>Where 15 years ago many thought that there would always be a trade-off between progress and the environment, we can now see a way through. What becomes clear is that to preserve what we value most - our local environment, the countryside around us - we must protect the whole earth, and do so by pioneering new ways of building, working, living. New technologies to deliver a low carbon economy; to use our finite resources more efficiently, to reform national and international institutions and create positive incentives to be green.</p> <p>In short, we don't halt progress and retreat into the past, nor do we carry on regardless. Instead we take pride in our progress. Using our creativity in partnership to protect the environment.</p> <p><b>The threat</b></p> <p>We have made a lot of progress over this Parliament. Through John Prescott's leadership, and the hard work of Michael here on the platform with me, we can point to measurable achievements. We are on track to meet our Kyoto targets. Air quality is improving. London now has the cleanest river of any major city.</p> <p>But we have to face a stark fact. Neither we here in Britain, nor our partners abroad, have succeeded in reversing the overall destructive trend. The environmental challenge continues to grow and become more urgent:</p> <p>\u0095 There are alarming changes in our atmosphere, in global temperatures, in weather patterns, in sea levels and in the protective ozone layer. As a result, across the world millions face drought, flooding, disease. Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of increased levels of skin cancer, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low lying areas being swallowed by the sea.</p> <p>\u0095 Global population growth will put increased pressure on natural resources. The world pop is set to rise from 6bn to 9bn by 2050. So that economies across the world have the opportunity to develop, we must all use resources far more efficiently and switch to clean technologies.</p> <p>\u0095 Fresh water is being polluted or simply used up. Demand is doubling every 21 years while supply is broadly unchanged.</p> <p>\u0095 Soil degradation has affected two-thirds of the world's agricultural lands over the last 50 years, and the situation is getting worse.</p> <p>\u0095 Half the world's wetlands have been lost over the past century and with them their unique plants and animals; and this is accelerating</p> <p>\u0095 One in ten of the world's tree species are at risk of extinction, and increasingly whole forest systems are under threat</p> <p>\u0095 Fishing fleets are still 40 per cent larger than the oceans can sustain and yet it still benefits from subsidies, world wide</p> <p>\u0095 Here in the UK farmland birds are disappearing, the house sparrow, once more cockney than the Cockneys, is now a rarity in London, and congestion means that urban traffic moves at the same speed as in 1890.</p> <p>Of two things I am certain. We are not going to turn this round unless we re-engage the political system on the importance of the environmental challenge. We are not going to be able to engage consumers and business unless we offer them a positive agenda.</p> <p><b>A new approach to the environment</b></p> <p>We need to build a new coalition for the environment, a coalition that works with the grain of consumers, business and science, not against them. A coalition that harnesses consumer demand for a better environment, and encourages businesses to see the profit of the new green technologies. and a coalition that stretches across national frontiers.</p> <p>The central theme of our approach is a more productive use of environmental resources. It is clear that if we are to continue to grow, and share the benefits of that growth; we must reduce the impact of growth on the environment. Some commentators estimate that we'll need a tenfold increase in the efficiency with which we use resources by 2050 only to stand still. Above all, we need to be clear about our priorities, and the principles that underlie our approach:</p> <p>\u0095 First, the greatest threat to our environment today is climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has said that the UK will have to cut the CO2 we produce by 60% by 2050 if we are to slow down the pace of change. If there is one immediate issue that threatens global disaster, it is the changes in our atmosphere.</p> <p>\u0095 Second, problems need to be addressed at the right level. A problem like climate change requires international as well as national action. The reason for taking the lead in cutting national emissions, as we have in the UK, is to give us the standing and authority in international negotiations. And developed countries, as the principle producers of greenhouse gases, should set an example for developing ones.</p> <p>\u0095 Third, we should harness consumer demand, not stifle it. We should not be trying to reduce people's aspirations, but rather find innovative ways of satisfying those aspirations. As our societies become more prosperous, so people's demand for a better environment is growing. More and more people want to buy green. We should encourage that, and harness that green consumer power in our environmental policies</p> <p>\u0095 Fourth, we must stimulate science and innovation. I reject the pessimistic notion that most environmental problems can only be managed, not solved. Technological advance does offer opportunities, particularly to counter climate change and provide alternatives to finite energy resources.</p> <p>\u0095 Fifth, we need to use environmental resources more efficiently and to become a low-carbon, recycling economy. We need to become much more effective about how we use finite resources. Stephen Byers set out a radical new direction in his speech to Greenpeace's Business Conference earlier this month, focussing on resource productivity and the Government's programme to boost renewable energy.</p> <p>\u0095 Lastly, we should see protecting the environment as a business opportunity. There is a growing market for environmental goods and services - currently worth an amazing US$335 billion - as large as the world market for pharmaceuticals or aerospace. I am not saying that the interests of business and the environment have become identical. But we should exploit them and develop them when they are. Otherwise, history shows us the environment risks being the loser.</p> <p><b>New Labour's Green Agenda</b></p> <p>I make no apology for the priority we have given education, health and crime. Yet no other British Government has had a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of environment policy. And no other British Government has put the environment at the heart of its policy-making across the board - from foreign affairs to the national curriculum - in the way this Government has. Since 1997, we have:</p> <p>\u0095 Taken a lead internationally, as at Kyoto. \u0095 Introduced an air quality strategy going beyond even the tough new European standards \u0095 Cleaned up decades of pollution of our beaches and rivers, and given greater protection to important wildlife sites \u0095 Factored environmental considerations into all our legislation and policy, from the Utilities Act to innovative fiscal measures such as incentives and hypothecation \u0095 And as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, started to invest billions in transport to increase choice and cut congestion and pollution</p> <p>Yet I would be the first to say that there is still a lot more we could and will do.</p> <p>John Prescott will shortly publish the final version of our strategy on Climate Change. It will set out how Britain plans to deliver its international obligations to cut greenhouse gases by 12.5% and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. This will include a 10% target for energy from renewables by 2010.</p> <p>As part of the Climate Change Levy package, businesses will be able to claim capital allowances for investments they make in energy-saving technologies from next April. I can also announce that we will shortly be launching a new Carbon Trust in Britain that will channel up to \u00a350 million a year developing low-carbon technology, partly funded from the Climate Change Levy. We have worked closely with business and the research community since their participation is vital to the Trust's long-term success. The Trust will take the lead on low-carbon technology and innovation in this country, and put Britain in the lead internationally.</p> <p>We will also be setting up an office to export Britain's low-carbon technologies, the Kyoto Mechanisms Office. This was suggested to me at a meeting I had on climate change with business leaders earlier this year. By encouraging the private sector to invest in innovative energy projects abroad, it will help tackle climate change and allow British business to seize new opportunities. The Office will start work in April 2001.</p> <p>Next Spring, we will be launching the first national CO2 emissions trading system anywhere in the world. Emissions trading is one of the most powerful ways of harnessing the market to cut greenhouse gases. The trading system will set overall limits on emissions for CO2 producers entering the system, and allow them to trade \"emission allowances\" amongst themselves, to the profit of the cleanest factories and companies.</p> <p>If we are to reduce our dependence on oil and high-carbon energy, we will need to develop commercially viable renewable energy. I believe government has a key role to play in assisting business build up the economies of scale in these new technologies so that they can compete effectively. Today, we are announcing proposals for \u00a350 million from the New Opportunities Fund to support offshore wind and biomass. The DTI is already providing \u00a339 million for new offshore wind turbines, and the first are about to go into operation off Blyth. Helen Liddle has set up a task force to examine ways of promoting solar energy. And I have also asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a comprehensive study into the future of renewable energy, with a view to increasing substantially our long-term investment.</p> <p>Any environmental policy has to address the implications of the car. Transport produces around 25% of global CO2 and rising. Making public transport more attractive will take us only so far. The long-term solution is to make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. That is why we have used the tax system to roll out cleaner fuels. Lead in petrol is now a thing of the past, and we are now using tax incentives to promote ultra-low sulphur petrol. Through the EU, we have persuaded manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by 25%. Vehicle Excise Duty is now linked to vehicle emissions for the first time. Toyota and Honda are now selling \"hybrid\" cars which are twice as efficient as conventional models. Honda's Insight does 80 mpg. Fuel cell powered electric cars will offer even more - truly pollution-free motoring. Both Mercedes and Ford plan to have them in the showrooms by 2004.</p> <p>We will also be doing more to protect Britain's urban and rural environment. Our Countryside and Rights of Way Bill will protect wildlife and sites of special scientific interest. In our forthcoming Rural White Paper we will set out policies for a living countryside which is economically vibrant, conserves wildlife and landscapes and which everyone can enjoy. And the Urban White Paper will set out our National Strategy for Neighbourhood renewal. We are also proposing that the New Opportunities Funds should invest another \u00a350 million for quality of life in urban and rural settlements and for green spaces.</p> <p>On recycling, we want to do more to harness the power of the market. The new Waste Resource Action Programme, led by business, will develop markets for recycled materials. A proposed further 50 million pounds from The New Opportunities Fund will help provide kerbside recycling for 700,000 households. I want to see every local authority offering doorstep recycling to take advantage of these new markets. And the office co-ordinating government procurement will soon begin trialling the purchasing of recycled products, using government purchasing to expand the market.</p> <p>On regulation, our aim must be to raise environmental standards without imposing unnecessary burdens on business. Often, the most effective approach to raising standards is a cross-border one. That is why we are working with the European Commission and other member states to improve the regulatory process in Europe.</p> <p>This brings me to environmental diplomacy. The international climate change negotiations remain a key government priority, and we will be taking a leading role in The Hague next month. I also want to extend the EU's economic reform agenda to new energy saving technologies. And I can announce today that I plan to attend the next Earth Summit in 2002, and I will be encouraging other world leaders to join us there.</p> <p><b>Business, technology and the environment</b></p> <p>Fifteen years ago, if you said business will help save the environment people would have laughed at you. Today, I believe that is a serious proposition.</p> <p>As BP's John Browne has said, the enlightened company increasingly recognises that there are good commercial reasons for being ahead of the pack when it comes to issues to do with the environment.</p> <p>Environmentally-aware oil companies are finding ways to recapture the CO2 produced by plant and equipment and pump it back underground to enhance the recovery of oil. They are working with car manufacturers on new technologies, from developing fuel cell cars, to putting hydrogen-powered buses on the road in Europe.</p> <p>Shell is playing a major role in the move away from oil in power generation. Like its competitor BP, it is investing heavily in solar power. ABB recently shifted its focus from being a builder of traditional large-scale power plants to focus on small scale renewable technologies. It expects alternative energy solutions to account for US$1 billion worth of business for the company within the next five years.</p> <p>It is increasingly clear that energy generation in the future will become a spectrum: from the cleaner extraction of energy from fossil fuels; through the move from liquid to cleaner gas fuels; new technologies that convert hydrocarbon fuels into energy without combustion; to, at its greenest end, the carbon free technologies of wind and solar.</p> <p>The City and investment community is beginning to recognise the new commercial and environmental realities, and to make money out of them. The return on equity of the new Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index averaged 15%, compared to 8% for the regular index for the first half of this year. And more individual investors are choosing ethical investment portfolios which reflect their values. Legislation earlier this year on Statements of Investment Principles required pension funds for the first time to disclose whether they take ethical, environmental or social factors into account in their decisions.</p> <p>The World Business Council on Sustainable Development, of which many of you here today are members, is driving forward the agenda to increase the efficient use of resources. I would also like to see more reporting on environmental and social performance. The pioneers of environmental reporting - companies like BA, BT, British Gas, and BP - are seeing increasing benefits from both improved efficiencies and public image as a result. This is something that all companies should be doing, and I am issuing a challenge, today, to all of the top 350 companies to be publishing annual environment reports by the end of 2001.</p> <p><b>The role of civil society</b></p> <p>Increasingly, NGOs are also putting more and more energy into offering solutions in partnership with business and government.</p> <p>For example, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Unilever have set up the Marine Stewardship Council to protect our endangered fish stocks. Thames Water and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust have converted redundant reservoirs and treatment at Barn Elms into a fantastic new wildlife habitat. Fourteen companies, eight NGOs and three Government departments are working together on the Digital Futures project, to try to ensure that the e-commerce revolution happens in the most environmentally friendly way possible. And eight years ago Greenpeace began research on Greenfreeze refrigeration technology to reduce the destruction of the Ozone layer. It is now a highly successful example of green organisation and industry working together for the benefit of the Ozone layer. Coca Cola and Unilever have just announce they will move towards such alternative refrigerants such as Greenfreeze by 2005.</p> <p>Government, business, the NGOs and the public need to move forward together. That is why we have set up the new Sustainable Development Commission. I have asked Jonathan Porritt to chair it and I am very pleased to launch it today. The members, drawn from business, local government, pressure groups and academia, will build a consensus, monitor our progress, and suggest ways we can reconcile the needs of the environment, the economy and society.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>So the outlook is not all bleak. There is real progress. But it is a race against time, lethargy, and indifference. It is an urgent issue. People feel it; but they don't always know how to make a difference.</p> <p>Millions of people around the country are \"green\" in their actions, their beliefs, what they care about. They want the air they breath to be fresh. They want the countryside they live in or visit to be protected. They have respect for the world around them - hate cruelty to animals, hate the destruction of natural beauty. They want their neighbourhoods to have parks and be free from litter, grafitti, kids with nothing to do, and crime. Millions recycle, more would like to. Millions of children care passionately about the environment. That is their politics. But they need to know the \"how\" as well as the \"why\".</p> <p>The root of my political beliefs is the idea of community: of solidarity. Today such an idea can only live on, based on mutual rights and responsibilities. The essence of environmental politics is the notion of responsibility to nature and future generations to protect and enhance the environment. Its why we wrote it into the new Clause IV of our Party Constitution.</p> <p>We have to show how this strongly held belief can translate into practical action. To do that, we need a partnership between government, business and the environmental movement, to extend the frontiers of progress, to show the way through. We need more understanding, more dialogue, a healthy recognition of areas of disagreement, and then a common campaign of explanation, to put across the urgency of the problems and the viability of the solutions.</p> <p>We have one common aim: to show how by doing good to the environment, we enrich our lives, in quality and prosperity. Concern for the environment is not a yoke on our necks. It is the lifting of the yoke. The burden is lighter. The way is clearer. I believe it can be done.</p> <p>Let's sell the new insight - we can be richer by being greener; and by being greener we will enrich the quality of our lives.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are at points real conflict between the immediate interests of consumption and the longer term interests of the environment; and to be frank, between the politicans' need to woo the electorate a well as lead them. My point is simply this. We must work at resolving these conflicts or finding a way through. And we should recognise that to be environmentally conscious isn't a punishment. It is indeed in our long term interests; and it can also be of benefit, short and medium term too. What's more there is a real concern and desire amongst our people, within realistic bounds, to do the right thing. We have children and granchildren. We care for them. We know that despoiling the environment today will mean hardship, even death for them tomorrow. Call it idealism or even just family values: there is an energy and commitment there we can harness. Where 15 years ago many thought that there would always be a trade-off between progress and the environment, we can now see a way through. What becomes clear is that to preserve what we value most - our local environment, the countryside around us - we must protect the whole earth, and do so by pioneering new ways of building, working, living. New technologies to deliver a low carbon economy; to use our finite resources more efficiently, to reform national and international institutions and create positive incentives to be green. In short, we don't halt progress and retreat into the past, nor do we carry on regardless. Instead we take pride in our progress. Using our creativity in partnership to protect the environment. The threat We have made a lot of progress over this Parliament. Through John Prescott's leadership, and the hard work of Michael here on the platform with me, we can point to measurable achievements. We are on track to meet our Kyoto targets. Air quality is improving. London now has the cleanest river of any major city. But we have to face a stark fact. Neither we here in Britain, nor our partners abroad, have succeeded in reversing the overall destructive trend. The environmental challenge continues to grow and become more urgent: \u0095 There are alarming changes in our atmosphere, in global temperatures, in weather patterns, in sea levels and in the protective ozone layer. As a result, across the world millions face drought, flooding, disease. Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of increased levels of skin cancer, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low lying areas being swallowed by the sea. \u0095 Global population growth will put increased pressure on natural resources. The world pop is set to rise from 6bn to 9bn by 2050. So that economies across the world have the opportunity to develop, we must all use resources far more efficiently and switch to clean technologies. \u0095 Fresh water is being polluted or simply used up. Demand is doubling every 21 years while supply is broadly unchanged. \u0095 Soil degradation has affected two-thirds of the world's agricultural lands over the last 50 years, and the situation is getting worse. \u0095 Half the world's wetlands have been lost over the past century and with them their unique plants and animals; and this is accelerating \u0095 One in ten of the world's tree species are at risk of extinction, and increasingly whole forest systems are under threat \u0095 Fishing fleets are still 40 per cent larger than the oceans can sustain and yet it still benefits from subsidies, world wide \u0095 Here in the UK farmland birds are disappearing, the house sparrow, once more cockney than the Cockneys, is now a rarity in London, and congestion means that urban traffic moves at the same speed as in 1890. Of two things I am certain. We are not going to turn this round unless we re-engage the political system on the importance of the environmental challenge. We are not going to be able to engage consumers and business unless we offer them a positive agenda. A new approach to the environment We need to build a new coalition for the environment, a coalition that works with the grain of consumers, business and science, not against them. A coalition that harnesses consumer demand for a better environment, and encourages businesses to see the profit of the new green technologies. and a coalition that stretches across national frontiers. The central theme of our approach is a more productive use of environmental resources. It is clear that if we are to continue to grow, and share the benefits of that growth; we must reduce the impact of growth on the environment. Some commentators estimate that we'll need a tenfold increase in the efficiency with which we use resources by 2050 only to stand still. Above all, we need to be clear about our priorities, and the principles that underlie our approach: \u0095 First, the greatest threat to our environment today is climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has said that the UK will have to cut the CO2 we produce by 60% by 2050 if we are to slow down the pace of change. If there is one immediate issue that threatens global disaster, it is the changes in our atmosphere. \u0095 Second, problems need to be addressed at the right level. A problem like climate change requires international as well as national action. The reason for taking the lead in cutting national emissions, as we have in the UK, is to give us the standing and authority in international negotiations. And developed countries, as the principle producers of greenhouse gases, should set an example for developing ones. \u0095 Third, we should harness consumer demand, not stifle it. We should not be trying to reduce people's aspirations, but rather find innovative ways of satisfying those aspirations. As our societies become more prosperous, so people's demand for a better environment is growing. More and more people want to buy green. We should encourage that, and harness that green consumer power in our environmental policies \u0095 Fourth, we must stimulate science and innovation. I reject the pessimistic notion that most environmental problems can only be managed, not solved. Technological advance does offer opportunities, particularly to counter climate change and provide alternatives to finite energy resources. \u0095 Fifth, we need to use environmental resources more efficiently and to become a low-carbon, recycling economy. We need to become much more effective about how we use finite resources. Stephen Byers set out a radical new direction in his speech to Greenpeace's Business Conference earlier this month, focussing on resource productivity and the Government's programme to boost renewable energy. \u0095 Lastly, we should see protecting the environment as a business opportunity. There is a growing market for environmental goods and services - currently worth an amazing US$335 billion - as large as the world market for pharmaceuticals or aerospace. I am not saying that the interests of business and the environment have become identical. But we should exploit them and develop them when they are. Otherwise, history shows us the environment risks being the loser. New Labour's Green Agenda I make no apology for the priority we have given education, health and crime. Yet no other British Government has had a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of environment policy. And no other British Government has put the environment at the heart of its policy-making across the board - from foreign affairs to the national curriculum - in the way this Government has. Since 1997, we have: \u0095 Taken a lead internationally, as at Kyoto. \u0095 Introduced an air quality strategy going beyond even the tough new European standards \u0095 Cleaned up decades of pollution of our beaches and rivers, and given greater protection to important wildlife sites \u0095 Factored environmental considerations into all our legislation and policy, from the Utilities Act to innovative fiscal measures such as incentives and hypothecation \u0095 And as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, started to invest billions in transport to increase choice and cut congestion and pollution Yet I would be the first to say that there is still a lot more we could and will do. John Prescott will shortly publish the final version of our strategy on Climate Change. It will set out how Britain plans to deliver its international obligations to cut greenhouse gases by 12.5% and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. This will include a 10% target for energy from renewables by 2010. As part of the Climate Change Levy package, businesses will be able to claim capital allowances for investments they make in energy-saving technologies from next April. I can also announce that we will shortly be launching a new Carbon Trust in Britain that will channel up to \u00a350 million a year developing low-carbon technology, partly funded from the Climate Change Levy. We have worked closely with business and the research community since their participation is vital to the Trust's long-term success. The Trust will take the lead on low-carbon technology and innovation in this country, and put Britain in the lead internationally. We will also be setting up an office to export Britain's low-carbon technologies, the Kyoto Mechanisms Office. This was suggested to me at a meeting I had on climate change with business leaders earlier this year. By encouraging the private sector to invest in innovative energy projects abroad, it will help tackle climate change and allow British business to seize new opportunities. The Office will start work in April 2001. Next Spring, we will be launching the first national CO2 emissions trading system anywhere in the world. Emissions trading is one of the most powerful ways of harnessing the market to cut greenhouse gases. The trading system will set overall limits on emissions for CO2 producers entering the system, and allow them to trade \"emission allowances\" amongst themselves, to the profit of the cleanest factories and companies. If we are to reduce our dependence on oil and high-carbon energy, we will need to develop commercially viable renewable energy. I believe government has a key role to play in assisting business build up the economies of scale in these new technologies so that they can compete effectively. Today, we are announcing proposals for \u00a350 million from the New Opportunities Fund to support offshore wind and biomass. The DTI is already providing \u00a339 million for new offshore wind turbines, and the first are about to go into operation off Blyth. Helen Liddle has set up a task force to examine ways of promoting solar energy. And I have also asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a comprehensive study into the future of renewable energy, with a view to increasing substantially our long-term investment. Any environmental policy has to address the implications of the car. Transport produces around 25% of global CO2 and rising. Making public transport more attractive will take us only so far. The long-term solution is to make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. That is why we have used the tax system to roll out cleaner fuels. Lead in petrol is now a thing of the past, and we are now using tax incentives to promote ultra-low sulphur petrol. Through the EU, we have persuaded manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by 25%. Vehicle Excise Duty is now linked to vehicle emissions for the first time. Toyota and Honda are now selling \"hybrid\" cars which are twice as efficient as conventional models. Honda's Insight does 80 mpg. Fuel cell powered electric cars will offer even more - truly pollution-free motoring. Both Mercedes and Ford plan to have them in the showrooms by 2004. We will also be doing more to protect Britain's urban and rural environment. Our Countryside and Rights of Way Bill will protect wildlife and sites of special scientific interest. In our forthcoming Rural White Paper we will set out policies for a living countryside which is economically vibrant, conserves wildlife and landscapes and which everyone can enjoy. And the Urban White Paper will set out our National Strategy for Neighbourhood renewal. We are also proposing that the New Opportunities Funds should invest another \u00a350 million for quality of life in urban and rural settlements and for green spaces. On recycling, we want to do more to harness the power of the market. The new Waste Resource Action Programme, led by business, will develop markets for recycled materials. A proposed further 50 million pounds from The New Opportunities Fund will help provide kerbside recycling for 700,000 households. I want to see every local authority offering doorstep recycling to take advantage of these new markets. And the office co-ordinating government procurement will soon begin trialling the purchasing of recycled products, using government purchasing to expand the market. On regulation, our aim must be to raise environmental standards without imposing unnecessary burdens on business. Often, the most effective approach to raising standards is a cross-border one. That is why we are working with the European Commission and other member states to improve the regulatory process in Europe. This brings me to environmental diplomacy. The international climate change negotiations remain a key government priority, and we will be taking a leading role in The Hague next month. I also want to extend the EU's economic reform agenda to new energy saving technologies. And I can announce today that I plan to attend the next Earth Summit in 2002, and I will be encouraging other world leaders to join us there. Business, technology and the environment Fifteen years ago, if you said business will help save the environment people would have laughed at you. Today, I believe that is a serious proposition. As BP's John Browne has said, the enlightened company increasingly recognises that there are good commercial reasons for being ahead of the pack when it comes to issues to do with the environment. Environmentally-aware oil companies are finding ways to recapture the CO2 produced by plant and equipment and pump it back underground to enhance the recovery of oil. They are working with car manufacturers on new technologies, from developing fuel cell cars, to putting hydrogen-powered buses on the road in Europe. Shell is playing a major role in the move away from oil in power generation. Like its competitor BP, it is investing heavily in solar power. ABB recently shifted its focus from being a builder of traditional large-scale power plants to focus on small scale renewable technologies. It expects alternative energy solutions to account for US$1 billion worth of business for the company within the next five years. It is increasingly clear that energy generation in the future will become a spectrum: from the cleaner extraction of energy from fossil fuels; through the move from liquid to cleaner gas fuels; new technologies that convert hydrocarbon fuels into energy without combustion; to, at its greenest end, the carbon free technologies of wind and solar. The City and investment community is beginning to recognise the new commercial and environmental realities, and to make money out of them. The return on equity of the new Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index averaged 15%, compared to 8% for the regular index for the first half of this year. And more individual investors are choosing ethical investment portfolios which reflect their values. Legislation earlier this year on Statements of Investment Principles required pension funds for the first time to disclose whether they take ethical, environmental or social factors into account in their decisions. The World Business Council on Sustainable Development, of which many of you here today are members, is driving forward the agenda to increase the efficient use of resources.

This is something that all companies should be doing, and I am issuing a challenge, today, to all of the top 350 companies to be publishing annual environment reports by the end of 2001. The role of civil society Increasingly, NGOs are also putting more and more energy into offering solutions in partnership with business and government. For example, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Unilever have set up the Marine Stewardship Council to protect our endangered fish stocks. Thames Water and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust have converted redundant reservoirs and treatment at Barn Elms into a fantastic new wildlife habitat.

      "bodyText": "Yugoslavia's new president has admitted for the first time that Yugoslav army and police forces committed widespread killings in Kosovo last year. Vojislav Kostunica's remarks, in a television interview released early today, marked the first time any Yugoslav has accepted responsibility and expressed remorse for any of the conflicts in the last decade in the Balkans. Former president Slobodan Milosevic steadfastly blamed the West for fomenting violence in the region. \"I am ready to... accept the guilt for all those people who have been killed,\" Mr Kostunica said. \"For what Milosevic had done, and as a Serb, I will take responsibility for many of these, these crimes.\" Asked by the US television network CBS News whether Yugoslav forces were guilty of genocide in the southern province of Kosovo, Mr Kostunica admitted that crimes had occurred, but said that both Serbs and ethnic Albanians had been killed. \"Those are the crimes and the people that have been killed are victims,\" Mr Kostunica said, adding: \"There are a lot of crimes on the other side and the Serbs have been killed.\" The interview is to be aired tonight in the US on CBS's 60 Minutes II nightly news programme. Under Mr Milosevic, Yugoslav forces launched a massive crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo in 1998. Thousands of ethnic Albanian civilians were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes. Mr Milosevic depicted the crackdown as a heroic attempt to save Serbia's medieval heartland from independence-minded ethnic Albanian extremists. He and four of his officials were charged by the UN war crimes tribunal last year for atrocities committed in Kosovo. Since taking power after a popular revolt, Mr Kostunica has moved to bring about democratic changes and has shown willingness to cooperate with the tribunal. However, he has made no move to arrest Mr Milosevic, saying the tribunal is a political entity created by the west and that his country does not recognise it. Asked by CBS whether he thought Mr Milosevic would ever stand trial, Mr Kostunica replied: \"Somewhere, yes.\" Mr Milosevic's party still holds a significant amount of power, which has prevented the Kostunica camp from pushing through much needed democratic reforms. The pro-democracy forces have been struggling to create a transitional government in Yugoslavia's main republic that will open the way for their leadership.

      "body": "<p>This year's Turner prize show opens to the public at Tate Britain tomorrow. The shortlist for the \u00a320,000 prize, which will be awarded on November 28, has already generated a small controversy. Only one finalist, Glenn Brown, is actually British, although the other three - German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, Dutch painter Michael Raedecker and Japanese installation artist Tomoko Takahashi - all live and work in Britain. Takahashi and Tillmans also studied here. </p> <p>On the strength of the displays at Millbank, we need take only two of this year's contenders seriously. Wolfgang Tillmans is exhibiting a compendium of 57 images, with yet more in display cabinets in the centre of the room. This is a cool, elegant exhibition, filled with startling, gorgeous, sexy pictures. Some are very large, others little more than snapshots, hung in a disarming and deceptively casual manner. It is the best display of his work I have seen. Some are displayed in groups and grids, others hung very high or low on the walls. There appears to be no order. All the images are either taped directly to the walls or hung on bulldog clips. </p> <p>These are pictures from a life: friendships and loves and places travelled. I get the feeling that every time Tillmans takes a photo or arranges his images he is trying to make sense of his existence. Here's a naked friend on the sand dunes, grimacing. Here's a pair of jeans, pulled down to reveal a shaven male crotch. Here's flowers in a jam jar. </p> <p>It could be twee, but as we jump from image to image a dispassionate view of the world emerges. Twenty-one shots of the solar eclipse hang beside a woman bending over in the bath. Next comes a snap of a wisp of hair. Then a bee, and a city at evening. This is like walking in and out of someone's life, taking pleasure in unexceptional moments. </p> <p>A doorway frames a Glenn Brown painting, a distorted Salvador Dali image, painted in an all-grey palette and extruded even beyond Dali's own distortions of form. The title of Brown's painting is Oscillate Wildly, which comes from a track by the Smiths, while the painting is an attempt to fuse Dali's painting, which dates from the Spanish civil war, with the black and whites of Picasso's Guernica. It is as if the horizontal hold on Brown's painting needs retuning, and other stations are leaking in. The levels of association and mental play in Brown's work are labyrinthine. </p> <p>Brown's work gets richer and better as it goes along. The references multiply and the complexities keep compounding. Best known for his \"appropriations\" of the work of Frank Auerbach, in which the expressionist painter's thickly laden, swerving brushstrokes are ironed out by Brown's flat, trompe l'oeil technique, Brown has gone on to borrow and rework images by Dali and the visionary painter John Martin, morphing them with sci-fi book jacket art and album covers for the seriously stoned. He does similar things with his choice of colours, conflating one painter's image with another's palette and adding a title that deepens the game still further. So we have an oval painting by Brown, containing a painting copied from Auerbach, given the title The Marquess of Breadalbane. The painting's colour is derived from Landseer's Victorian potboiler The Monarch of the Glen, which was commissioned by said marquess. </p> <p>In front of Brown's painting is one of his sculptures, a gnarled, heaving lump of plaster and globby paint, which sits on a plinth under glass. The sculpture is called 1880, after the date of the unnamed French still life that inspired it. I bet this was a still life of roses by French 19th-century painter Henri Fantin-Latour, because that painting decorates an album cover by Joy Division, and Joy Division's singer, the late Ian Curtis, inspired a painting by Julian Schnabel, and Schnabel's dedication appears in the titles to a couple of Brown's paintings. I hope you are still with me. </p> <p>This is how Brown's mind works. The layers - of art history and art fashion, picture borrowing, play with titles and music - go on piling up. The overall effect, however, goes beyond the quotes and free associations. His visionary scenes, in which space stations sit on rocky outcrops in apocalyptic infernos, and Auerbach-inspired portraits are given perfect halos, leave me spinning. Brown's is a lurid, corrupted grand manner. One painting is titled after Studio 54, the coke-fuelled hangout for the smart set in New York at the height of the 1980s art boom. I almost believe Brown has a moral purpose. </p> <p>How demoralising it is to walk into Tomoko Takahashi's installation. Takahashi is best known for the vast sprawl of dud computers and photocopiers that filled part of the Saatchi Gallery last year. It was an extreme work from an artist who hates having her photo taken and is rumoured to live among her piles of detritus while she makes her works. Her agglomerations of junk and rubbish proceed, like Brown's work, by an intuitive process of ordering that, once identified, leaves one little the wiser. Learning To Drive is a very dull affair. </p> <p>Metal shelving units, a builder's wheelbarrow, chairs and much else dangle from the ceiling. The floors are piled with traffic signs, plastic bollards, broken Scalextric track, toy trucks and tractors. Road-menders' barriers keep the public at bay and the Tate security happy. Arcs and clusters of yellow plastic tubing and gas pipes give some kind of form to the shelf units, old tables and office junk that are piled about. Somewhere in here, Learning To Drive has careered into a Tate office clear-out. </p> <p>Takahashi scribbles notes to herself around the walls, while a kind of annotated map covers the free space on the floor. This turns out to be an installation plan as much as a route map. The clutter doesn't add up to much. The American artist Jason Rhoades does exactly this sort of thing with 100 times more verve and wit. He is also much more extreme, while still remaining conceptually and formally coherent. </p> <p>One can't help comparing Takahashi with better work going on elsewhere. And how can one not measure Michael Raedecker's paintings against Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo? Raedecker uses an unlikely compilation of materials in his paintings - patches of sewing among the curdled paintwork, nests of wool for the foliage of his lollipop trees, tufts of wool in place of a painted carpet. He does odd things with the paint, too, turning it into worm casts, maggoty flecks, grub-like excrescences. But it is the quality of draw ing, as much as the peculiarity of surface, that make me think of Barcelo, who is just better at this sort of thing. Raedecker's subjects - a lit window beyond a patio at night, a grey bedroom with an unmade bed, wooden houses in the backwoods - also make me think of Peter Doig (a previous Turner finalist). Glenn Brown would turn such odious comparisons into subject matter; Raedecker turns them into style. Raedecker, unaccountably, is William Hill's current favourite, at 13/8. </p> <p>Tillmans or Brown? I like Tillmans's work more and more. There's something relaxed, generous and beautiful about it. His work makes a perfect foil to Brown's insane language games. A photographer has never won the Turner prize, even though photo-graphy is the medium of the moment. Still, Brown's impeccable exercises in style are highly engaging, visually spectacular and very intelligent. I have a feeling he will win. </p> <p>\u0095 Turner Prize 2000 is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), until January 14.</p>",

I bet this was a still life of roses by French 19th-century painter Henri Fantin-Latour, because that painting decorates an album cover by Joy Division, and Joy Division's singer, the late Ian Curtis, inspired a painting by Julian Schnabel, and Schnabel's dedication appears in the titles to a couple of Brown's paintings. I hope you are still with me. This is how Brown's mind works. The layers - of art history and art fashion, picture borrowing, play with titles and music - go on piling up. The overall effect, however, goes beyond the quotes and free associations. His visionary scenes, in which space stations sit on rocky outcrops in apocalyptic infernos, and Auerbach-inspired portraits are given perfect halos, leave me spinning. Brown's is a lurid, corrupted grand manner. One painting is titled after Studio 54, the coke-fuelled hangout for the smart set in New York at the height of the 1980s art boom. I almost believe Brown has a moral purpose. How demoralising it is to walk into Tomoko Takahashi's installation. Takahashi is best known for the vast sprawl of dud computers and photocopiers that filled part of the Saatchi Gallery last year. It was an extreme work from an artist who hates having her photo taken and is rumoured to live among her piles of detritus while she makes her works. Her agglomerations of junk and rubbish proceed, like Brown's work, by an intuitive process of ordering that, once identified, leaves one little the wiser. Learning To Drive is a very dull affair. Metal shelving units, a builder's wheelbarrow, chairs and much else dangle from the ceiling. The floors are piled with traffic signs, plastic bollards, broken Scalextric track, toy trucks and tractors. Road-menders' barriers keep the public at bay and the Tate security happy. Arcs and clusters of yellow plastic tubing and gas pipes give some kind of form to the shelf units, old tables and office junk that are piled about. Somewhere in here, Learning To Drive has careered into a Tate office clear-out. Takahashi scribbles notes to herself around the walls, while a kind of annotated map covers the free space on the floor. This turns out to be an installation plan as much as a route map. The clutter doesn't add up to much. The American artist Jason Rhoades does exactly this sort of thing with 100 times more verve and wit. He is also much more extreme, while still remaining conceptually and formally coherent. One can't help comparing Takahashi with better work going on elsewhere. And how can one not measure Michael Raedecker's paintings against Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo? Raedecker uses an unlikely compilation of materials in his paintings - patches of sewing among the curdled paintwork, nests of wool for the foliage of his lollipop trees, tufts of wool in place of a painted carpet. He does odd things with the paint, too, turning it into worm casts, maggoty flecks, grub-like excrescences. But it is the quality of draw ing, as much as the peculiarity of surface, that make me think of Barcelo, who is just better at this sort of thing. Raedecker's subjects - a lit window beyond a patio at night, a grey bedroom with an unmade bed, wooden houses in the backwoods - also make me think of Peter Doig (a previous Turner finalist). Glenn Brown would turn such odious comparisons into subject matter; Raedecker turns them into style. Raedecker, unaccountably, is William Hill's current favourite, at 13/8. Tillmans or Brown? I like Tillmans's work more and more. There's something relaxed, generous and beautiful about it. His work makes a perfect foil to Brown's insane language games. A photographer has never won the Turner prize, even though photo-graphy is the medium of the moment. Still, Brown's impeccable exercises in style are highly engaging, visually spectacular and very intelligent. I have a feeling he will win. \u0095 Turner Prize 2000 is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), until January 14.",

Territoire fran\u00e7ais depuis plus de 200 ans, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 le si\u00e8ge, \u00e0 maintes reprises, de violents attentats perp\u00e9tr\u00e9s par des groupes nationalistes, partisans de l'ind\u00e9pendance. Afin de mettre un terme \u00e0 cette violence, le gouvernement fran\u00e7ais, avec \u00e0 sa t\u00eate Lionel Jospin, l'actuel Premier Ministre, propose que l'Assembl\u00e9e territoriale corse puisse voter, dans certains domaines, des adaptations locales aux lois fran\u00e7aises, susceptibles d'\u00eatre ratifi\u00e9es, ou non, par le Parlement, apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9riode d'exp\u00e9rimentation.

C'est la premi\u00e8re fois que la France prend le probl\u00e8me corse \u00e0 bras-le-corps et qu'un dialogue s'\u00e9tablit entre les diff\u00e9rents protagonistes.</p> <p><b> Que pensez-vous du plan Jospin? </b></p> <p><b>Sarah: </b> C'est quoi exactement le plan Jospin ? Plus d'autonomie pour la Corse? C'est tr\u00e8s bien.

Tout n'est pas fait, mais \u00e7a va dans le bon sens. C'est une d\u00e9marche courageuse de la part du Premier Ministre. Il serait dommage qu'on mette un frein \u00e0 ce processus d\u00e9mocratique auquel adh\u00e8rent 65 % des Corses. C'est un ouf de soulagement, et une voie de sortie aux probl\u00e8mes corses, notamment \u00e0 celui de la violence.

La Corse se verrait ainsi conc\u00e9der un pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif encadr\u00e9 et partag\u00e9 . Cette proposition fait des remous au sein de la classe politique. Certains reprochent au Premier Ministre d'avoir c\u00e9d\u00e9 au chantage des nationalistes. Voici l'opinion de trois jeunes Fran\u00e7ais. Vous sentez-vous concern\u00e9s par les d\u00e9bats qui ont lieu actuellement sur la Corse ? Sarah, 16 ans, lyc\u00e9enne: Pas vraiment. C'est une r\u00e9gion touristique magnifique, mais c'est tout. On oublie souvent qu'elle est fran\u00e7aise. Remarque, les Corses nous font bien sentir qu'ils sont l\u00e0-bas chez eux, qu'ils ont leur culture et leurs traditions et qu'ils n'aiment pas beaucoup la France. Michel, 24 ans, Corse, employ\u00e9 d'une compagnie a\u00e9rienne corse, vit en Corse: Bien s\u00fbr, en tant qu'insulaire et habitant de Corse. Ren\u00e9e-Jeanne, 21 ans, Corse, \u00e9tudiante en histoire \u00e0 Paris: \u00c9videmment, c'est l'avenir de la Corse, donc mon avenir. Ils ont g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 un formidable espoir pour les Corses. Rien ne dit que les discussions vont aboutir, mais c'est un premier pas. C'est la premi\u00e8re fois que la France prend le probl\u00e8me corse \u00e0 bras-le-corps et qu'un dialogue s'\u00e9tablit entre les diff\u00e9rents protagonistes. Que pensez-vous du plan Jospin? Sarah: C'est quoi exactement le plan Jospin ? Plus d'autonomie pour la Corse? C'est tr\u00e8s bien. De toute fa\u00e7on, les Corses ne se sont jamais sentis bien avec la France, alors... Michel: C'est risqu\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser la constitution pour accorder \u00e0 la Corse un pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif restreint. Je pense que pour les nationalistes, c'est un simple tremplin pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance. Ren\u00e9e-Jeanne: Si les \u00e9lus corses ont plus de pouvoirs et peuvent assumer plus de responsabilit\u00e9s, c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e7a. Tout n'est pas fait, mais \u00e7a va dans le bon sens. C'est une d\u00e9marche courageuse de la part du Premier Ministre. Il serait dommage qu'on mette un frein \u00e0 ce processus d\u00e9mocratique auquel adh\u00e8rent 65 % des Corses. C'est un ouf de soulagement, et une voie de sortie aux probl\u00e8mes corses, notamment \u00e0 celui de la violence. S'il est bien utilis\u00e9, le processus Matignon peut amener \u00e0 une meilleure compr\u00e9hension et \u00e0 un apaisement. Certains disent que le gouvernement a c\u00e9d\u00e9 au chantage des terroristes et de la violence. Qu'en pensez-vous? Sarah: Le chantage, \u00e7a marche. Jospin a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 c\u00e9der pour \u00e9pargner la vie d'un grand nombre de personnes et assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la population. Si les nationalistes corses ne font plus d'attentats, \u00e7a vaut le coup. Michel: Ils n'ont pas tout \u00e0 fait tort. \u00c7a part d'une bonne intention, mais il y a un risque de s'associer aux nationalistes. Ils vont continuer leurs attentats. \u00c7a peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s n\u00e9faste pour la Corse. Ren\u00e9e-Jeanne: Il faut bien, un jour, accepter de n\u00e9gocier. Cela constituerait-il un risque pour l'unit\u00e9 de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise? Sarah: D'autres r\u00e9gions pourraient demander plus d'autonomie. Si le gouvernement accepte pour la Corse, il sera oblig\u00e9 de le faire pour les autres r\u00e9gions telles que le Pays Basque, la Bretagne ou l'Alsace-Lorraine. Le territoire risque de voler en \u00e9clats. Michel: Pas dans l'imm\u00e9diat, mais dans 30 ans peut-\u00eatre. On risque d'\u00eatre pris dans un engrenage. \u00c7a peut faire boule de neige et pousser d'autres r\u00e9gions \u00e0 revendiquer leur autonomie voire leur ind\u00e9pendance. Ren\u00e9e-Jeanne: Non, au contraire. Quand on accorde un peu plus de d\u00e9mocratie, \u00e7a ne fait jamais de mal. Cela permettra de prendre des d\u00e9cisions plus coh\u00e9rentes avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 corse. Il y a trop souvent un d\u00e9calage entre ce qu'on d\u00e9cide \u00e0 Paris pour la Corse et ce qui convient vraiment \u00e0 la Corse. Avec une plus grande d\u00e9mocratie et plus de responsabilit\u00e9s aux \u00e9lus corses, la Corse s'int\u00e9grera mieux \u00e0 la France. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, renforcer les identit\u00e9s r\u00e9gionales tend \u00e0 renforcer l'identit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise. Pour ou contre l'ind\u00e9pendance totale de la Corse? Sarah: Pour, si la France sucre toutes leurs subventions. Et \u00e7a, les Corses risquent de ne pas appr\u00e9cier. Michel: Contre l'ind\u00e9pendance, pour une autonomie r\u00e9gionale encadr\u00e9e. Que l'\u00c9tat conserve ses pouvoirs r\u00e9galiens. Ren\u00e9e-Jeanne: Je suis partisane de l'ind\u00e9pendance. Je conteste la r\u00e9publique jacobine, car elle est profond\u00e9ment antid\u00e9mocratique, elle ne laisse pas la libert\u00e9 aux gens de s'exprimer suffisamment. Glossaire/Glossary c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e7a = c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas si mal: it's not bad for a start \u00e7a va dans le bon sens: that is going in the right direction le chantage: blackmail tre pris dans un engrenage: to get caught up in a spiral faire boule de neige: (fig.) to snowball \u00e7a peut \u00eatre n\u00e9faste: it can be harmful, inauspicious pousser un ouf de soulagement: to heave a sigh of relief un premier pas: a first step prendre un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 bras-le-corps: to grapple with a problem sucrer les subventions: (coll.) to take away grants un tremplin a springboard voler en \u00e9clats to burst into pieces",

      "body": "<p>Over the past month you will probably have been looking at the murder and mayhem in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza and asking yourselves what kind of people can behave like this? The killing of children, deliberately targeted - what kind of a person could commit such an act? What sort of people could, for years on end, deny the basic human rights of an oppressed nation? And the answer might come to you, for want of any other: heartless, monsters, that's who. </p> <p>I also watch the news, just as desperate and heart-sick, but I do, however, know exactly who is on the other side of those guns, and who is sitting at home in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv watching the events on Israeli television - and why they fail to rise up in rage against their government for perpetrating all this in their name. </p> <p>I went to Israel five times in less than two years, not as a journalist or a tourist or a human rights worker but as a novelist. I didn't go to Gaza or the West Bank because the object of my research - the Jewish war against the British in Tel Aviv in 1946 - wasn't going to be found in either of those places. I didn't set out to discuss the then peace process, but you can't go to Israel without getting an earful, in cafes, buses, taxis. I listened with the ear of a novelist. The psychology of the Israelis was what I wanted to understand. When you ask, why, in Israel, you are asking for a political explanation but the why goes far deeper - the politics is a symptom. I was left with three strong impressions. </p> <p>The first, and easiest to explain, is the mentality of the religious right. In the past month I have read time and again the statement, \"The Jews stole the Palestinians' country, it's as simple as that.\" To the Orthodox however, the facts are the exact opposite. They have the deeds to the country. You probably have a copy, as it happens, in your own home. Take it down from the shelf. It's the first part you want, the Old Testament, and the first chapter, Genesis, which contains the world's first recorded real-estate deal: \"And I will give to thee and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession.\" And if you want to know where that is, here are the ground plans, the map: \"Unto this seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.\" </p> <p>As far as the Orthodox are concerned, they are bunkered down in a tiny portion of what is rightfully theirs. As for how they defend what they have and get their rightful due, the God of the Old Testament who visited 12 plagues on the Egyptians including the slaying of the first-born, is beyond the jurisdiction of Amnesty International. How do you argue with this? You can't. To tell the Orthodox that God's covenant with the Jews, ritually re-enacted at the ceremonies of circumcision and Bar Mitzvah is a fairy story, a myth, is to deprive people who have spent their entire lives locked up in yeshivas, studying the Torah and the Talmud, not just of their beliefs but of their very selves. Without God they are naked and shivering in the world. All you can do is marginalise them out of harm's way, as Barak did when he put together his first coalition. </p> <p>On the first three of my visits to Israel, which were before the 1999 elections, the Orthodox were what everyone wanted to talk about. The religious right had assumed too much power and were interfering in the everyday lives of secular and moderately religious Israelis, preventing them from shopping or taking public transport on Shabbat. The Orthodox were driving people nuts. They were Netanyahu's coalition allies in blocking the peace process and in opinion poll after opinion poll around 70% of the population repeatedly said that they believed there would be a Palestinian state. They didn't necessarily say they supported it, but they agreed on its inevitability. </p> <p>The majority of Israelis have arrived at an uneasy acceptance of the proximity of yet another country full of people they regard as their enemies. This has happened partly because they have been worn down by the intifada, partly because of the success of the long campaign by the Israeli Left in convincing them that they can \"trust the Arabs\" as they put it. And here, I came to think, was the heart of the Israeli mentality. Ordinary Israelis are sick of wars, they are sick of sending their teenage sons to the army, but they are deeply insecure about whether they can risk peace. It isn't the memory of the Holocaust that drives them; it is the memory of over 50 years of Arab nations telling them that they will \"drive the Jews into the sea\". The Israeli terror is that in delivering the justice to the Palestinians that the world demands, they may be signing their own death warrants. \"They call us colonialists,\" a man said to me, \"but if we lose, where do I go? Back to Yemen where my grandfather came from in the 1930s?\" Like fairground distorting mirrors, the world looks at the Israelis and sees a giant, a monster, but the Israeli looks and sees a tiny, cowering figure, the puny kid walking to school, tormented by bullies. He needs a Charles Atlas course. He needs to make himself stronger, not weaker. </p> <p>When the cameras report from Gaza and we see a boy, not unlike a boy we have ourselves at home perhaps, but with a stone in his hands, we are looking at an angry child. That's not what the Israelis see. The boy is a hazy presence, ill-defined. They are peering past him to glimpse the shadowy figures in the windows of the apartment building, the Tanzim, the armed civilian militias and beyond them Hamas, who are the Islamic version of the Orthodox, locked into their rejection of Israel's right to exist. And beyond Hamas is the figure of Sadaam Hussein surrounded by the four million Iraqis who have, in the past few weeks, volunteered to sign up to destroy Israel. </p> <p>When I listened to Israelis on my visits what struck me was how very little they thought about or even mentioned the Palestinians, and this seems to have been true from the earliest days of Zionism. Asking old people, both left and right, what they thought the resident Arab population would make of the longing for a Jewish homeland, they answered, on the whole, \"We didn't think about them at all.\" They were too intent on their war with the British. In his book The Yellow Wind, the Israeli novelist David Grossman, an opponent of Occupation, describes a journey in the occupied territories in the 1980s in which he talked to Palestinians and settlers. Grossman summed up in the mindset of a settler what I think remains today the Israeli refusal to engage with the Palestinians' anguish: \"He does not want to think even for a minute about the situation of the Arabs around him, because he is caught up in a struggle with them, at war, he said, and were he to allow himself to pity, to identify, he would weaken and endanger himself.\" </p> <p>The \"tough Jew\" is not a new phenomenon, it only has a new setting. In another book Tough Jews: Fathers, Sons and Gangster Dreams, the author, Rich Cohen, writes of the world of the American Jewish gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s and what they meant to his father and to his father's best friend, Larry King, growing up as Jewish kids in Brooklyn, listening every day on the radio to bad news from Europe. He asked why his father's generation began to even deny that the gangsters - Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, Dutch Schultz - had ever existed. The answer, Cohen thought, was that the Jews have always needed iconic tough guys and have always had them, but after 1948 they had the Israeli army, fighters who were legit, who didn't have to break the law. Andrea Dworkin, in her recently published book Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation, describes how the ideal of the Jewish man - bookish, gentle, family-loving - was banished in shame after the Holocaust. They turned themselves into cartoon alpha males. A Jewish boy in a soup kitchen in Jaffa, when I asked him what a Jew was, raised a pimple-sized bicep and said: \"Strong\". </p> <p>So if the Israelis have turned themselves into tough guys, how do they see the Palestinians? If the Arabs - in particular Hezbollah and Syria - are a military threat then the Palestinians are merely an irritant. The ugly truth, I think, is that what they feel for the Palestinians is contempt, that they are losers, and this instinct is built into the founding ideals of the first Zionists. In a refugee camp, David Grossman asks a woman who has lived for 40 years in the same United Nation refugee house if she would be happy if she was given \"a dunam . . . of land in a nice place, with light in the open air. 'Yes, yes - she laughs - of course, but only on my own land'\". Then Grossman remembers, \"how many times Palestinian leaders missed opportunities to gain themselves a homeland: there was the partition proposal of 1936 and the second proposal of 1947, and maybe there were other chances. They - in their blindness - rejected them all\". </p> <p>Deep in the Jewish psyche is the legacy of cutting your losses, moving on, reinventing yourself in order to survive. Deep in the Arab psyche is the attachment to the land, to patience and endurance. A boy tells Grossman of \"his\" house in Jaffa. He has never seen it but his grandfather did. What is Jaffa like, Grossman asks? A place of orchards, the boy replies. Actually it is part of the conurbation Tel Aviv-Yaffo, near the business district, circled with motorways. Why, the Israelis ask, perplexed, can't the Palestinians get over the loss of their homeland, why can't they live for the future instead of the past, like the Jews did? If the Jews have been such a roaring success in 20th-century America it has been, in part, because they left Eastern Europe, which had, after all been their home for centuries and never once looked back. </p> <p>And when they ask themselves this question - why can't the Palestinians be like us? - the only answer they can think of is that the Palestinians are losers. Whatever their strategy it always fails. Invited by the UN in 1947 to form a country, the Jews seized the chance, and declared independence. The Palestinians rejected the opportunity to form theirs and sat back waiting for the Arab armies to defeat the new state. They attacked and lost and the result was that the Palestinians were driven out or fled, washing up in camps where they remain today. When the two sides in the cold war picked their teams, Israel got the US and the Palestinians and the Arabs got the Soviet Union. The latter no longer exists to back them. In the Gulf War the Palestinians supported Sadaam Hussein, currently the world's pariah leader. Some Palestinians have enthusiastically embraced Holocaust denial, their hero the \"distinguished historian\" David Irving. And all this time the Israelis, backed by the only remaining superpower, forged into the new hi-tech age, positioned themselves for globalisation. </p> <p>In their own minds the Jews are better than the Arabs, and this goes further back than the consequences of the grim conditions imposed on the Palestinians by the occupation or the restriction on the civil liberties of the Arab Israelis. The earliest Zionists, coming from Russia after the failure of the 1905 revolution, saw themselves as bringing ideas of soviet socialism to the benighted peoples of the Middle East. Later, when the Yekkes, the Jews from Germany reluctantly arrived, torn away kicking and screaming from the cafes of Berlin, they saw themselves as the Weimar Republic in exile, bringing socialism, feminism, psychoanalysis and cubism to a land slumbering in the Middle Ages. It was another form of colonialism, of course, but a cultural one. </p> <p> How do the mentalities of nations change? Not quickly. Here in Britain we are still dealing with the vestiges of the anger that many feel because we are no longer an empire. It took the Germans until the 1960s, 25 years after total military defeat, before a new generation even began to throw a searchlight on the activities of their own parents. In Austria, it is argued, this process hasn't even begun. What will it take to make the Israelis see the Palestinians as a wronged people in pursuit of justice, the victims of Jewish racism?

      "bodyText": "Over the past month you will probably have been looking at the murder and mayhem in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza and asking yourselves what kind of people can behave like this? The killing of children, deliberately targeted - what kind of a person could commit such an act? What sort of people could, for years on end, deny the basic human rights of an oppressed nation? And the answer might come to you, for want of any other: heartless, monsters, that's who. I also watch the news, just as desperate and heart-sick, but I do, however, know exactly who is on the other side of those guns, and who is sitting at home in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv watching the events on Israeli television - and why they fail to rise up in rage against their government for perpetrating all this in their name. I went to Israel five times in less than two years, not as a journalist or a tourist or a human rights worker but as a novelist. I didn't go to Gaza or the West Bank because the object of my research - the Jewish war against the British in Tel Aviv in 1946 - wasn't going to be found in either of those places. I didn't set out to discuss the then peace process, but you can't go to Israel without getting an earful, in cafes, buses, taxis. I listened with the ear of a novelist. The psychology of the Israelis was what I wanted to understand. When you ask, why, in Israel, you are asking for a political explanation but the why goes far deeper - the politics is a symptom. I was left with three strong impressions. The first, and easiest to explain, is the mentality of the religious right. In the past month I have read time and again the statement, \"The Jews stole the Palestinians' country, it's as simple as that.\" To the Orthodox however, the facts are the exact opposite. They have the deeds to the country. You probably have a copy, as it happens, in your own home. Take it down from the shelf. It's the first part you want, the Old Testament, and the first chapter, Genesis, which contains the world's first recorded real-estate deal: \"And I will give to thee and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession.\" And if you want to know where that is, here are the ground plans, the map: \"Unto this seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.\" As far as the Orthodox are concerned, they are bunkered down in a tiny portion of what is rightfully theirs. As for how they defend what they have and get their rightful due, the God of the Old Testament who visited 12 plagues on the Egyptians including the slaying of the first-born, is beyond the jurisdiction of Amnesty International. How do you argue with this? You can't. To tell the Orthodox that God's covenant with the Jews, ritually re-enacted at the ceremonies of circumcision and Bar Mitzvah is a fairy story, a myth, is to deprive people who have spent their entire lives locked up in yeshivas, studying the Torah and the Talmud, not just of their beliefs but of their very selves. Without God they are naked and shivering in the world. All you can do is marginalise them out of harm's way, as Barak did when he put together his first coalition. On the first three of my visits to Israel, which were before the 1999 elections, the Orthodox were what everyone wanted to talk about. The religious right had assumed too much power and were interfering in the everyday lives of secular and moderately religious Israelis, preventing them from shopping or taking public transport on Shabbat. The Orthodox were driving people nuts. They were Netanyahu's coalition allies in blocking the peace process and in opinion poll after opinion poll around 70% of the population repeatedly said that they believed there would be a Palestinian state. They didn't necessarily say they supported it, but they agreed on its inevitability. The majority of Israelis have arrived at an uneasy acceptance of the proximity of yet another country full of people they regard as their enemies. This has happened partly because they have been worn down by the intifada, partly because of the success of the long campaign by the Israeli Left in convincing them that they can \"trust the Arabs\" as they put it. And here, I came to think, was the heart of the Israeli mentality. Ordinary Israelis are sick of wars, they are sick of sending their teenage sons to the army, but they are deeply insecure about whether they can risk peace. It isn't the memory of the Holocaust that drives them; it is the memory of over 50 years of Arab nations telling them that they will \"drive the Jews into the sea\". The Israeli terror is that in delivering the justice to the Palestinians that the world demands, they may be signing their own death warrants. \"They call us colonialists,\" a man said to me, \"but if we lose, where do I go? Back to Yemen where my grandfather came from in the 1930s?\" Like fairground distorting mirrors, the world looks at the Israelis and sees a giant, a monster, but the Israeli looks and sees a tiny, cowering figure, the puny kid walking to school, tormented by bullies. He needs a Charles Atlas course. He needs to make himself stronger, not weaker. When the cameras report from Gaza and we see a boy, not unlike a boy we have ourselves at home perhaps, but with a stone in his hands, we are looking at an angry child. That's not what the Israelis see. The boy is a hazy presence, ill-defined. They are peering past him to glimpse the shadowy figures in the windows of the apartment building, the Tanzim, the armed civilian militias and beyond them Hamas, who are the Islamic version of the Orthodox, locked into their rejection of Israel's right to exist. And beyond Hamas is the figure of Sadaam Hussein surrounded by the four million Iraqis who have, in the past few weeks, volunteered to sign up to destroy Israel. When I listened to Israelis on my visits what struck me was how very little they thought about or even mentioned the Palestinians, and this seems to have been true from the earliest days of Zionism. Asking old people, both left and right, what they thought the resident Arab population would make of the longing for a Jewish homeland, they answered, on the whole, \"We didn't think about them at all.\" They were too intent on their war with the British. In his book The Yellow Wind, the Israeli novelist David Grossman, an opponent of Occupation, describes a journey in the occupied territories in the 1980s in which he talked to Palestinians and settlers. Grossman summed up in the mindset of a settler what I think remains today the Israeli refusal to engage with the Palestinians' anguish: \"He does not want to think even for a minute about the situation of the Arabs around him, because he is caught up in a struggle with them, at war, he said, and were he to allow himself to pity, to identify, he would weaken and endanger himself.\" The \"tough Jew\" is not a new phenomenon, it only has a new setting. In another book Tough Jews: Fathers, Sons and Gangster Dreams, the author, Rich Cohen, writes of the world of the American Jewish gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s and what they meant to his father and to his father's best friend, Larry King, growing up as Jewish kids in Brooklyn, listening every day on the radio to bad news from Europe. He asked why his father's generation began to even deny that the gangsters - Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, Dutch Schultz - had ever existed. The answer, Cohen thought, was that the Jews have always needed iconic tough guys and have always had them, but after 1948 they had the Israeli army, fighters who were legit, who didn't have to break the law. Andrea Dworkin, in her recently published book Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation, describes how the ideal of the Jewish man - bookish, gentle, family-loving - was banished in shame after the Holocaust. They turned themselves into cartoon alpha males. A Jewish boy in a soup kitchen in Jaffa, when I asked him what a Jew was, raised a pimple-sized bicep and said: \"Strong\". So if the Israelis have turned themselves into tough guys, how do they see the Palestinians? If the Arabs - in particular Hezbollah and Syria - are a military threat then the Palestinians are merely an irritant. The ugly truth, I think, is that what they feel for the Palestinians is contempt, that they are losers, and this instinct is built into the founding ideals of the first Zionists. In a refugee camp, David Grossman asks a woman who has lived for 40 years in the same United Nation refugee house if she would be happy if she was given \"a dunam . . . of land in a nice place, with light in the open air. 'Yes, yes - she laughs - of course, but only on my own land'\". Then Grossman remembers, \"how many times Palestinian leaders missed opportunities to gain themselves a homeland: there was the partition proposal of 1936 and the second proposal of 1947, and maybe there were other chances. They - in their blindness - rejected them all\". Deep in the Jewish psyche is the legacy of cutting your losses, moving on, reinventing yourself in order to survive. Deep in the Arab psyche is the attachment to the land, to patience and endurance. A boy tells Grossman of \"his\" house in Jaffa. He has never seen it but his grandfather did. What is Jaffa like, Grossman asks? A place of orchards, the boy replies. Actually it is part of the conurbation Tel Aviv-Yaffo, near the business district, circled with motorways. Why, the Israelis ask, perplexed, can't the Palestinians get over the loss of their homeland, why can't they live for the future instead of the past, like the Jews did? If the Jews have been such a roaring success in 20th-century America it has been, in part, because they left Eastern Europe, which had, after all been their home for centuries and never once looked back. And when they ask themselves this question - why can't the Palestinians be like us? - the only answer they can think of is that the Palestinians are losers. Whatever their strategy it always fails. Invited by the UN in 1947 to form a country, the Jews seized the chance, and declared independence. The Palestinians rejected the opportunity to form theirs and sat back waiting for the Arab armies to defeat the new state. They attacked and lost and the result was that the Palestinians were driven out or fled, washing up in camps where they remain today. When the two sides in the cold war picked their teams, Israel got the US and the Palestinians and the Arabs got the Soviet Union. The latter no longer exists to back them. In the Gulf War the Palestinians supported Sadaam Hussein, currently the world's pariah leader. Some Palestinians have enthusiastically embraced Holocaust denial, their hero the \"distinguished historian\" David Irving. And all this time the Israelis, backed by the only remaining superpower, forged into the new hi-tech age, positioned themselves for globalisation. In their own minds the Jews are better than the Arabs, and this goes further back than the consequences of the grim conditions imposed on the Palestinians by the occupation or the restriction on the civil liberties of the Arab Israelis. The earliest Zionists, coming from Russia after the failure of the 1905 revolution, saw themselves as bringing ideas of soviet socialism to the benighted peoples of the Middle East. Later, when the Yekkes, the Jews from Germany reluctantly arrived, torn away kicking and screaming from the cafes of Berlin, they saw themselves as the Weimar Republic in exile, bringing socialism, feminism, psychoanalysis and cubism to a land slumbering in the Middle Ages. It was another form of colonialism, of course, but a cultural one. How do the mentalities of nations change? Not quickly. Here in Britain we are still dealing with the vestiges of the anger that many feel because we are no longer an empire. It took the Germans until the 1960s, 25 years after total military defeat, before a new generation even began to throw a searchlight on the activities of their own parents. In Austria, it is argued, this process hasn't even begun. What will it take to make the Israelis see the Palestinians as a wronged people in pursuit of justice, the victims of Jewish racism? Not yet another photo of a murdered child, nor even a whole album, but only peace itself will do it, which is why the Israeli left felt so badly let down by the new intifada. Instinctively, they knew that the mass of Israelis can only begin to respect the Palestinians when the threat from them is not to their borders but to their computer industry. \u0095 When I Lived in Modern Times, is published by Granta.

He does accept however that there will be some redundancies. \"I think it is inevitable there will be a reduction in the number of staff. \"Hackney's budgets and financial systems have, for far too long, not been up to scratch, disguising the true problems we are now facing and senior managers have failed to deal with the growing budget problems,\" said Mr Caller, who joined from Barnet council in June, and does not see a swift resolution to Hackney's problems. \"It took some time to get into this mess and it will take some time to get out. I suspect it will not be in this financial year. I don't blame councillors for this: they tried to balance the budget, but they couldn't do it on their own. \"We have got to reduce the cost base of this council. We have been talking to central government about the situation but they would like to see this council better managed first,\" he said. The council was the only authority from a list of 524 town halls to have its performance plan rejected by the auditor, and earlier this year a review by the Improvement and Development Agency (Idea), a self-policing organisation run by councils, blamed local politicians for incompetence and said a mediator should be appointed to end in-fighting. Meanwhile parents at Fernbank, which was visited yesterday by local MP Diane Abbott, are left wondering when their children can return to normal: \"We think this nursery is crucial to our children for their social and educational development. It is a crucial resource that should not be bulldozed or privatised just because the council can't balance a budget,\" said one.",

Govia, which is part owned by French firm Via-GTI, also runs the Thameslink services throughout southern England and London. The company is promising \u00a31.5bn investment in services throughout London and the south east which are currently run by Connex South Central, including more trains, refurbished stations and improved performance. The south central franchise covers Surrey and Sussex, and services are due to continue to be run by Connex for at least the next year. Connex will retain its neighbouring south east franchise, which is not yet due for renewal. Travellers have criticised Connex, which is owned by French conglomerate Vivendi, for late running and overcrowded trains. The company has also suffered industrial relations problems in recent years. Govia will rename the franchise New Southern Railways, a name which was last used more than a decade ago. An upgrade of the busy London-Brighton line will be one of the top priorities, as well as new services throughout south London. As part of the deal, announced today by the shadow strategic rail authority, all the present \"slam door\" trains will be replaced within the next few years. Govia has also pledged that all new trains in service after 2003 will be fitted with the Train Protection warning system.

Priorities would include improving the Brighton to London service and upgrading scores of stations to provide extra parking, bus/rail connections and better ticketing arrangements. He also hinted that peak fares on some routes could actually fall. Mr Ludeman said he was keen to hold early talks with unions but said he \"could not imagine\" that any staff would lose their jobs. \"Our belief is that Connex has a number of staff shortages,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p>There is a way for Tony Blair to defuse the threat of further fuel protests and trump the Tories' proposal to reduce fuel duty by 3p a litre: cut Vehicle Excise Duty for small- and medium-size cars. Low-income rural motorists would be the biggest winners but some two thirds of all drivers would benefit.</p> <p>A road tax rebate targeted only at rural residents - which has been suggested - is too problematic. It would result in a postcode lottery where one person gets the discount but people on a neighbouring street do not and tax evasion where city dwellers register their cars with country relatives or at their second homes. The main objection, though, is that it does not help the majority of middle Britain.</p> <p>Tax on petrol and diesel is part of the government's long-term strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions to help prevent global warming. Increases in fuel duty between 1996 and 1999 are estimated to save between one and 2.5m tonnes of carbon emissions by 2010, a significant contribution to the UK's climate change strategy. A recent report by Stephen Glaister and Dan Graham for the Automobile Association concluded that a 10% increase in fuel prices would lead to a reduction in fuel consumption of about 7%, mainly through improved fuel economy.</p> <p>There is a fundamental inconsistency between the government claiming to lead the international community in combating climate change and their calling on Opec to increase oil production. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, based on the overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion, argues that the UK needs to cut carbon dioxide emissions by at least 60% by the middle of this century to avert the worst effects of global warming. We need to kick the fossil fuel habit, not to exacerbate it.</p> <p>Road tax as currently structured contributes virtually nothing to the climate change strategy. It is Treasury policy to rebalance taxes on motoring from tax on ownership, such as road tax, to tax on car use, such as road tolls. The government has made a start with a new lower \u00a3100 rate for cars with engines up to 1,100cc, extended to cars up to 1,200cc from next March. From next year there will be a graduated system for new cars, with four bands based on carbon dioxide emissions. Those with higher emissions will pay more. But for the vast majority of existing cars there is a flat rate of \u00a3155 independent of engine size or fuel economy.</p> <p>It would be entirely consistent to introduce a more graduated system of road tax for existing cars. For example a \u00a350 cut for all cars up to 1,800cc would create three bands, a \u00a350 rate for cars up to 1,200cc, \u00a3105 for cars up to 1,800cc and \u00a3155 for those more than 1,800cc. This would include more than two thirds of the cars on the road and nine out of the 10 most popular models on sale this year, while encouraging the purchase of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and discouraging the gas-guzzlers.</p> <p>For most motorists this would be worth more than a 3p cut in fuel duty, which would save a typical motorist about \u00a335 a year. For example, the saving on fuel costs for a 1.8 litre Ford Fo cus doing 10,000 miles at 38 miles per gallon would be about \u00a336.50.</p> <p>In particular, low-income rural motorists who need their cars but drive fewer miles than average would have more to gain from a \u00a350 cut in road tax. Average annual car mileage for low-income rural motorists, those in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, is about 8,000 miles.

      "bodyText": "There is a way for Tony Blair to defuse the threat of further fuel protests and trump the Tories' proposal to reduce fuel duty by 3p a litre: cut Vehicle Excise Duty for small- and medium-size cars. Low-income rural motorists would be the biggest winners but some two thirds of all drivers would benefit. A road tax rebate targeted only at rural residents - which has been suggested - is too problematic. It would result in a postcode lottery where one person gets the discount but people on a neighbouring street do not and tax evasion where city dwellers register their cars with country relatives or at their second homes. The main objection, though, is that it does not help the majority of middle Britain. Tax on petrol and diesel is part of the government's long-term strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions to help prevent global warming. Increases in fuel duty between 1996 and 1999 are estimated to save between one and 2.5m tonnes of carbon emissions by 2010, a significant contribution to the UK's climate change strategy. A recent report by Stephen Glaister and Dan Graham for the Automobile Association concluded that a 10% increase in fuel prices would lead to a reduction in fuel consumption of about 7%, mainly through improved fuel economy. There is a fundamental inconsistency between the government claiming to lead the international community in combating climate change and their calling on Opec to increase oil production. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, based on the overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion, argues that the UK needs to cut carbon dioxide emissions by at least 60% by the middle of this century to avert the worst effects of global warming. We need to kick the fossil fuel habit, not to exacerbate it. Road tax as currently structured contributes virtually nothing to the climate change strategy. It is Treasury policy to rebalance taxes on motoring from tax on ownership, such as road tax, to tax on car use, such as road tolls. The government has made a start with a new lower \u00a3100 rate for cars with engines up to 1,100cc, extended to cars up to 1,200cc from next March. From next year there will be a graduated system for new cars, with four bands based on carbon dioxide emissions. Those with higher emissions will pay more. But for the vast majority of existing cars there is a flat rate of \u00a3155 independent of engine size or fuel economy. It would be entirely consistent to introduce a more graduated system of road tax for existing cars. For example a \u00a350 cut for all cars up to 1,800cc would create three bands, a \u00a350 rate for cars up to 1,200cc, \u00a3105 for cars up to 1,800cc and \u00a3155 for those more than 1,800cc. This would include more than two thirds of the cars on the road and nine out of the 10 most popular models on sale this year, while encouraging the purchase of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and discouraging the gas-guzzlers. For most motorists this would be worth more than a 3p cut in fuel duty, which would save a typical motorist about \u00a335 a year. For example, the saving on fuel costs for a 1.8 litre Ford Fo cus doing 10,000 miles at 38 miles per gallon would be about \u00a336.50. In particular, low-income rural motorists who need their cars but drive fewer miles than average would have more to gain from a \u00a350 cut in road tax. Average annual car mileage for low-income rural motorists, those in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, is about 8,000 miles. As the chart shows, a typical low-income rural motorist would save less than \u00a330 from a 3p cut in fuel duty. Relative to a 3p cut in fuel duty, the winners from a \u00a350 cut in road tax would be the owners of small- and medium-sized cars who drive less than about 15,000 miles a year (depending on fuel efficiency). The losers would be those who drive gas-guzzlers or do more than about 15,000 miles a year (about 16% of cars). None of this addresses the problems of hauliers, which stem more from over-capacity in the industry than from taxation. Official statistics show that more than 99.9% of deliveries within Britain are by UK-registered hauliers, so there is little evidence of competition from overseas. Current levels of taxation are justified to cover the costs of road haulage in pollution, congestion, accidents and damage to the roads. But there is a case for recognising the short-term pain of the haulage industry and levelling the playing field with foreign lorries on international journeys. A cut in road tax for lorries, which ranges from \u00a3280 a year to about \u00a33,500 for different sizes, could be appropriate if at the same time the government signalled the introduction of the \"Eurovignette\" or \"Brit-disc\" at a later date.

This lot couldn't organise an orgy in a massage parlour, or a sit-in at the Parker-Knoll factory. With no fewer than a dozen candidates, most MPs clearly felt they ought to have a full ballot, just like we used to elect them. They put the point to Ted Heath who, as father of the house, had replaced Betty Boothroyd in the chair - not so much Madam Speaker as Mister Grumpy. His voice creaked like the lowering of an ancient drawbridge. MPs such as Tony Benn pleaded with him to have a proper ballot. \"This house must have the Speaker it wants, and he must have authority,\" Mr Benn pointed out to an unfamiliar sound -loud and raucous Tory cheers. \"I believe we would become very confused if we changed the rules,\" creaked Mr Grumpy, to shouts of \"No!

      "body": "<p>You probably think you know everything there is to know about the television presenter Anthea Turner. The eight-year relationship with former Radio 1 DJ Bruno Brookes. The dream marriage to her manager, Peter Powell. The passionate, adulterous affair with their mutual friend, Grant Bovey. How Bovey left his wife, Della, and their three girls for Anthea. How he went back to Della. Then back to Anthea. Finally wedding bells for Grant and Anthea, paid for by OK! magazine, with the unwitting happy couple used to promote a chocolate bar. Then the torrent of abuse in the press. (How could they sink so low?) And then, in case you missed a word of it in the papers, along came 40-year-old Anthea's newly-published (ghosted) autobiography.</p> <p>Given all this - given this life reduced to soap opera - it may come as something of a surprise that Anthea Turner has never said a word about what is probably the most shocking part of her life story: years of alleged physical and mental abuse at the hands of her long-term partner, Bruno Brookes. Though he admits the couple had a tempestuous and sometimes violent relationship, the former Radio 1 DJ dismisses Turner's claims insisting she is \"dramatising\" a handful of minor incidents to bolster her flagging popularity. \"She's at an all-time low and she's trying to find someone to use to get back public sympathy.\"</p> <p>What's not in dispute is that Turner and Brookes spent eight years together in the late 70s and early 80s. Brookes says it's unlikely they would have stayed together so long if Turner's allegations were true; she says she stayed with him just as countless other abused women stay with their tormentors. And just like all the other women out there - the ones who aren't on TV - who get hit, she says she never had the guts to say anything about it. So why this deathly quiet, from someone who has said so much? And why has Turner decided to talk about it now, for the first time, and to the Guardian?</p> <p>The answer to the first question, she says, is that she was ashamed. She says she kept the violence out of her autobiography \"not to protect him, but [because] it was a key area of my life that I had no pride over. I was protecting myself. I had boxed it away and I wanted it to stay there.\"</p> <p>As with any long relationship that has long ago dissolved into acrimony, each side proffers a different version of every incident. But what emerges clearly from the accounts of both Turner and Brookes is a volatile relationship that often teetered on the brink of violence - and, according to Turner, often tipped over it.</p> <p>Brookes concedes that, particularly in the last year of their relationship, the couple argued frequently. \"Ninety-nine per cent of the time it was purely loud voices and we would cool off but at other times she would push me and I would push her.\"</p> <p>Turner has a somewhat less benign recollection of events. During the first of their violent rows, she says: \"He just suddenly started floundering around. He hit my chin and I fell to the floor. I curled up and then he was kicking me. Afterwards I remember going to the bathroom and looking in the mirror. I looked terrible and I had a problem moving my jaw.\" She claims she chipped a tooth and told her dentist she had caught her mouth opening a window.</p> <p>\"I don't remember there being a huge amount of remorse from him afterwards,\" she adds. \"In fact, I had the feeling I was the one who should be apologising. I suppose I felt it was my fault. Bruno had a temper that doesn't take much to flare up and I always believed it was me. He always blamed me.\"</p> <p>Brookes insists he didn't kick Turner - \"She wouldn't have got up to remember it if I had done that\" - but accepts that he may have struck her with his elbow in an attempt to protect himself. \"Self-defence might be a bit strong but she was shouting at me and I was shouting at her and you're in a situation where you're clearly on at each other ... when she hurt her jaw as a result of it I remember thinking 'Oh my God, they'll think I've hit Anthea.' \"</p> <p>Turner is sitting, sipping peppermint tea, in the large kitchen of the Surrey home she shares with Bovey. His three daughters wander in and out. She says the decision to talk about the physical violence now has been forced upon her - that she has learned it has been Radio 1 gossip for years and had recently been questioned about it by a tabloid reporter. If it is to come out, she says, then at least let it be her who tells it.</p> <p>Now that she is talking about it, she says, there is an element of relief. \"I felt I had dealt with it by wrapping it up and putting it away, by just not thinking about it. I would tell myself that if I hadn't been in that relationship, however destructive, I wouldn't have met Peter Powell. I wouldn't be where I am today. But perhaps now that it is out, I can come to terms with it, because it won't be just wrapped up and put away. I can forgive myself. I can stop hating myself.\"</p> <p>Turner says there were a number of incidents of violence in her relationship with Brookes. She says that on one occasion in early 1986, he was driving her to a gig he was doing in Birmingham when she told him she was going to do a broadcast for her local commercial radio station, Signal Radio. \"He got my head and cracked it on the dashboard, then pulled some of my hair out,\" she says. \"He was driving at the time. I was in complete shock. He made me feel I'd done something awful: bringing it up while he was driving.\" Brookes doesn't remember it that way. He insists her head hit the dashboard accidentally when he braked sharply to leave the motorway and emphatically denies pulling her hair. \"We were so angry, I needed to get off the motorway on to the hard shoulder. If it had got any worse, we might have killed ourselves.\"</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas the previous year, when the couple were living together in London, she says he threw a portable TV at her, after she had allowed her sister to use the telephone, without asking his permission first. One of her elbows was dislocated as she tried to shield herself. Once again, Brookes disputes Turner's account, though not her claim that they had a violent altercation. Though he concedes he's thrown a few objects in his time, he insists he's never thrown anything at Turner. He admits, though, that she did suffer an injury, possibly a dislocation of the shoulder, during a violent row: \"She twisted her body is if to walk away quickly and that's how she did it.\"</p> <p>Turner maintains that she wasn't a \"victim\". \"I wasn't a woman married to a man coming home on a Friday night and knocking seven bells out of me,\" she says. \"There were just lots of arguments. He would be pushing and shoving me and going for my throat. And saying: 'You're worth nothing without me. You're nothing. I need you, you need me.' \"</p> <p>She pauses. \"It's a textbook case,\" she says, smiling weakly, meaning that the continual verbal abuse caused her to lose confidence and become emotionally dependent.</p> <p>Like many women in her position, Turner blamed herself. \"I still, to this day, believe it was my fault - even though I know I shouldn't. Whether it was an argument or a physical assault, at the end of the day I had made it happen. I had made him angry. I started the argument or I stood up for myself. He always said: 'You know how to wind me up and make me angry.' I always believed it was me, that I was a bad person to bring it out. I could have left, but I thought I could change this person.\"</p> <p>The psychotherapist Susie Orbach says women often stay in violent relationships for that very reason. Not because they are victims, but because they believe they hold the key to stopping the abuse and changing the man. \"It's understandable that [Anthea] doesn't want to see herself as a victim; passive victims feel like idiots. She thought she could transform him. Consciously or unconsciously, the woman thinks she is doing something to provoke the violence. She feels that even if she's not responsible, she has the key to figure it out.\"</p> <p>The relationship itself still haunts Turner: \"I have the occasional nightmare that he's there and I'm being put down.\" But she has never forgiven herself for staying. \"I kicked myself for years about it. I wasn't a woman living in a council house with children. Why didn't I pack my bags and go back home? No woman should allow that to happen and I consider myself a fairly strong person.\"</p> <p>It is justifying the staying - not remembering the violence - that brings on the tears. She feels that she let herself down. \"I firmly believed, because he told me so many times, that I was nothing without him. I was emotionally dependent. I can't believe that the Anthea in the 80s can be the same person I am now. I can't believe I let it happen and went through it. I just thank my lucky stars I'm not there any more.\"</p> <p>In the end, Turner did leave, of course. Since then she has given her support to the Elizabeth Trust - a small Stoke-on-Trent charity that provides a safe house, counselling and a helpline for women who have been battered.</p> <p>The fact is that hundreds of thousands of women in this country have suffered domestic violence in silence. The Home Office estimates that every year, one in 10 women in Britain experience domestic violence, while a quarter suffer at some point in their lives. Senior officers in London's Metropolitan police force say that only 20% of incidents are reported and believe there could be as many as 35,000 cases per month. Turner hopes her decision to talk publicly about her own experience will do all those women some good.</p> <p>Brookes insists her allegations have less to do with a desire to help other women than a need to court public sympathy. \"She's trying to turn me into some sort of wife-beater ... She's trying to drag us into her world and I don't want to be dragged into her world.\" But looking at her now, one can't help feeling sorry for her. While her green eyes still sparkle, recent events have clearly taken their toll. \"I suppose I'm just having to grow up,\" she says, smiling apologetically.</p>",

I could have left, but I thought I could change this person.\" The psychotherapist Susie Orbach says women often stay in violent relationships for that very reason. Not because they are victims, but because they believe they hold the key to stopping the abuse and changing the man. \"It's understandable that [Anthea] doesn't want to see herself as a victim; passive victims feel like idiots. She thought she could transform him. Consciously or unconsciously, the woman thinks she is doing something to provoke the violence. She feels that even if she's not responsible, she has the key to figure it out.\" The relationship itself still haunts Turner: \"I have the occasional nightmare that he's there and I'm being put down.\" But she has never forgiven herself for staying. \"I kicked myself for years about it. I wasn't a woman living in a council house with children. Why didn't I pack my bags and go back home? No woman should allow that to happen and I consider myself a fairly strong person.\" It is justifying the staying - not remembering the violence - that brings on the tears. She feels that she let herself down. \"I firmly believed, because he told me so many times, that I was nothing without him. I was emotionally dependent. I can't believe that the Anthea in the 80s can be the same person I am now. I can't believe I let it happen and went through it. I just thank my lucky stars I'm not there any more.\" In the end, Turner did leave, of course. Since then she has given her support to the Elizabeth Trust - a small Stoke-on-Trent charity that provides a safe house, counselling and a helpline for women who have been battered. The fact is that hundreds of thousands of women in this country have suffered domestic violence in silence. The Home Office estimates that every year, one in 10 women in Britain experience domestic violence, while a quarter suffer at some point in their lives. Senior officers in London's Metropolitan police force say that only 20% of incidents are reported and believe there could be as many as 35,000 cases per month. Turner hopes her decision to talk publicly about her own experience will do all those women some good. Brookes insists her allegations have less to do with a desire to help other women than a need to court public sympathy. \"She's trying to turn me into some sort of wife-beater ... She's trying to drag us into her world and I don't want to be dragged into her world.\" But looking at her now, one can't help feeling sorry for her. While her green eyes still sparkle, recent events have clearly taken their toll. \"I suppose I'm just having to grow up,\" she says, smiling apologetically.",

Though she has thousands of pounds in savings, she has refused to pay her council tax. Yesterday she told magistrates: \"I am not liable to pay tax on stolen property. If I did pay, I'd be condoning crime in Sandwell.\" Miss Rooney was given a 21-day suspended sentence in January after being found \"culpably negligent\" of not paying her council tax and in the course of three subsequent hearings was ordered to pay \u00a35 a week. Ian Buckingham, representing Sandwell council, said: \"This is the fifth hearing in relation to this particular debt. She has said she will not pay - the reasons are irrelevant.\" Magistrates pleaded with Miss Rooney to take free legal advice from the duty solicitor but she refused. She insisted that her refusal to pay the council tax was \"part and parcel\" of the dispute over her land. In 1994 she had asked for her house to be placed in a lower band because of the loss of part of her garden. The valuer had refused. Consequently, she paid only part of her council tax bill. Yesterday, the chairman of the bench said: \"In a democratic society, we have a duty to ensure payment of council tax so that appropriate services can be provided.\" The court was told Miss Rooney was liable for \u00a3516.70 in council tax and court costs. She was believed to be spending last night at Brockhill prison, near Redditch in Worcestershire. A senior Sandwell councillor, Darren Cooper, branded the jail sentence an \"absolute disgrace\" and called for the Warley MP, John Spellar, to intervene . But the Sandwell cabinet member for finance and resources, cllr Richard Young, said: \"Obviously, nobody here wants to see an elderly woman in this situation and I would rather see her pay than make applications to send her to prison, but she was given every opportunity. \"We are not the villains - if everyone did this then nobody, including elderly people, would get their bins emptied or meals on wheels.\" Mike Allen, the chief executive of Sandwell Age Concern, said:\"This is not helpful to the problems old people may be facing.\"",

      "byline": "Hugo Young",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Tony Blair has never met George W Bush. The newest episode in the Anglo-American relationship, which may begin in a fortnight's time, will get off to a jarring start. Governor Bush was due to tour Europe and Asia last spring, to make himself known to foreign leaders and enrich his image back home. That's what presidential candidates do. But the visits were called off, because Bush's campaign handlers thought they wouldn't help. They feared he would make a fool of himself. Since then, the evidence has accumulated that they were right.</p> <p>For Mr Blair, and therefore for Britain, a Bush presidency offers alarming possibilities. It is true that, when he woke up to the fact that he was president, Mr Bush would probably survey the world and recognise Anglo-London as a first foreign haven. Though knowledgeable about Latin-America, he is ignorant of Europeans, and would be inclined to fall back on the British bonds familiar to George Bush I.</p> <p>But the culture-shock to Mr Blair will be great. He has grown close to Bill Clinton. They talk more often and more equally than any prime minister and president for 50 years, Thatcher-Reagan included. Their brains as well as ideology are a match. The third way, so-called, is a common project, their version of a globalised idea. As well as enjoying exchanges of wonkishness about healthcare or education reform, the two helped each other out of tight corners, and if Al Gore wins, the continuities will be pretty seamless.</p> <p>Mr Bush comes from somewhere else. Though wallowing in a sea of unspecifics, he knows what he doesn't like, and most of it is represented by Clinton-Gore and, by extension, Blair. His biggest pitch is anti-Washington, which means anti-government. He has entered into little policy talk with the American people, so it's a fair bet there would be none with his friends across the ocean. Bush is aggressively uninterested in that way of being a political leader, let alone in the kind of social democratic world that has given several European leaders more useful relationships with Washington than have existed for decades.</p> <p>But that's only the beginning. It is now clear that Bush and his people regard 21st century Europe very differently from the view that prevailed in Washington in the second half of the 20th. They positively desire a greater distancing, especially of the American army. When Bush began to hint at this a few months ago, most of the foreign policy establishment here put it down to campaign talk. The protection of our boys from crazy foreign adventures made useful headlines. Actually we now know Bush has every intention of withdrawing American troops from the Balkans, as part of a philosophy which is working towards an end to interventionism anywhere on any grounds other than US strategic interest.</p> <p>His chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told the New York Times that \"peace-keeping\" missions would be out, because they were a distraction from America's prime duties in the Gulf and the Taiwan straits. In Europe, there had to be a \"new division of labour\": a statement made, by the way, in apparent ignorance of the fact that Europeans currently supply more than 80% of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Kosovo. When Bush's spokesman was challenged with the implications of the new doctrine, he said that the governor was \"100%\" behind what Ms Rice had said.</p> <p>So an unbrave new world beckons, which is likely to destabilise Nato as well as re-positioning Washington's global relationships. American economic dominance will grow and grow, but American responsibilities as the only super-power are set for the kind of drastic re-think that the European left once dreamed of, but which is now more likely to upset our modernised social democratic governments.</p> <p>If the Bush doctrine takes hold for four years, it will pre-empt most of the British argument against Blair's efforts to build Europe's own security.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has never met George W Bush. The newest episode in the Anglo-American relationship, which may begin in a fortnight's time, will get off to a jarring start. Governor Bush was due to tour Europe and Asia last spring, to make himself known to foreign leaders and enrich his image back home. That's what presidential candidates do. But the visits were called off, because Bush's campaign handlers thought they wouldn't help. They feared he would make a fool of himself. Since then, the evidence has accumulated that they were right. For Mr Blair, and therefore for Britain, a Bush presidency offers alarming possibilities. It is true that, when he woke up to the fact that he was president, Mr Bush would probably survey the world and recognise Anglo-London as a first foreign haven. Though knowledgeable about Latin-America, he is ignorant of Europeans, and would be inclined to fall back on the British bonds familiar to George Bush I. But the culture-shock to Mr Blair will be great. He has grown close to Bill Clinton. They talk more often and more equally than any prime minister and president for 50 years, Thatcher-Reagan included. Their brains as well as ideology are a match. The third way, so-called, is a common project, their version of a globalised idea. As well as enjoying exchanges of wonkishness about healthcare or education reform, the two helped each other out of tight corners, and if Al Gore wins, the continuities will be pretty seamless. Mr Bush comes from somewhere else. Though wallowing in a sea of unspecifics, he knows what he doesn't like, and most of it is represented by Clinton-Gore and, by extension, Blair. His biggest pitch is anti-Washington, which means anti-government. He has entered into little policy talk with the American people, so it's a fair bet there would be none with his friends across the ocean. Bush is aggressively uninterested in that way of being a political leader, let alone in the kind of social democratic world that has given several European leaders more useful relationships with Washington than have existed for decades. But that's only the beginning. It is now clear that Bush and his people regard 21st century Europe very differently from the view that prevailed in Washington in the second half of the 20th. They positively desire a greater distancing, especially of the American army. When Bush began to hint at this a few months ago, most of the foreign policy establishment here put it down to campaign talk. The protection of our boys from crazy foreign adventures made useful headlines. Actually we now know Bush has every intention of withdrawing American troops from the Balkans, as part of a philosophy which is working towards an end to interventionism anywhere on any grounds other than US strategic interest. His chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told the New York Times that \"peace-keeping\" missions would be out, because they were a distraction from America's prime duties in the Gulf and the Taiwan straits. In Europe, there had to be a \"new division of labour\": a statement made, by the way, in apparent ignorance of the fact that Europeans currently supply more than 80% of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Kosovo. When Bush's spokesman was challenged with the implications of the new doctrine, he said that the governor was \"100%\" behind what Ms Rice had said. So an unbrave new world beckons, which is likely to destabilise Nato as well as re-positioning Washington's global relationships. American economic dominance will grow and grow, but American responsibilities as the only super-power are set for the kind of drastic re-think that the European left once dreamed of, but which is now more likely to upset our modernised social democratic governments. If the Bush doctrine takes hold for four years, it will pre-empt most of the British argument against Blair's efforts to build Europe's own security. Tory objections to the embryonic Euro-defence force will be emptier than ever - the St Malo agreement that got it under way will look like a singular piece of Anglo-French prescience. But, shorn of major bits of US capability, Nato could look radically different. Forget about more enlargement. Forget about much more peacekeeping. Meanwhile, a unilateral American national missile defence (NMD), pushed through without regard for what allies have to say, grows naturally out of the coming mind-set. One Washington expert, who monitors security issues with an intimate insider's eye, told me he regarded NMD as now certain to be deployed if Bush wins. He will surround himself, of course, with advisers. General Colin Powell is regarded as the prime candidate for secretary of state, and might even be announced as such before November 7, to reel in those voters who look at Governor Bush and see only a dim-witted Reagan without the excuse of being an actor, or the defence of having a simple vision he will cling to.

But Mr Hain yesterday repeatedly insisted that there was \"no prospect\" of ending the sanctions without President Saddam first accepting UN security council resolution 1284, under which sanctions would be lifted only if Baghdad cooperates for 120 days with the UN weapons monitoring teams. Baghdad has said it will consider admitting UN inspectors only after sanctions are lifted and Britain and the US withdraw their aircraft from the no-fly zones. Asked about UN security council resolution 242 , which calls on Israel to leave the occupied territories, Mr Hain replied: \"The UK position is that all security council resolutions should be implemented.\" However, he said, the Israeli use of force was \"excessive\".",

The science and technology select committee, which is due to report on the medical environment of aircraft cabins in three weeks, is expected to criticise the way air quality has deteriorated dramatically, as well as recommending that airlines give passengers more explicit preventive advice about deep vein thrombosis (DVT) before long-haul flights. The condition, often referred to as \"economy class syndrome\" because it can be brought on by sitting for long periods in cramped conditions, caused the death of Emma Christofferson, a sales assistant with Marks and Spencer, who developed a blood clot after sitting in an economy seat for the 20-hour return journey from a holiday in Australia. Her death has prompted an outcry from travel safety experts, who claim that not enough has been done to alert passengers to the risks and what precautions they should take. According to Farrol Khan, director of the Aviation Health Institute, which researches air deaths, the amount of leg room makes many economy class airline cabins a health hazard. \"Airlines should be like other industries and label their products correctly and be upfront about how their product can cause blood clots on long-haul flights,\" he said yesterday. \"The danger in economy class is far greater because when the passenger is sitting still the usual pumping action of the calf and thigh muscles no longer pushes the blood up to the heart while at the same time the pressure on the edge of the seat blocks the return of the venous blood,\" he said. Although no detailed research has been carried out, Mr Khan estimates that as many as 6,000 passengers a year may die as a result of DVT, with as little as three hours of cramped conditions putting some people at potential risk of blood clots in the deep veins of the legs which can move to the lungs, causing a potentially fatal embolism.

Applications to Oxford from British-based youngsters are marginally up on last year, while those to Cambridge are down by around 10%.

      "bodyText": "Cambridge University yesterday reported a significant slump in applications for places on its undergraduate courses next year, after Oxford revealed a setback in its drive to attract more applicants from state schools. Provisional figures released by the two universities for courses starting next autumn show a mixed picture. Applications to Oxford from British-based youngsters are marginally up on last year, while those to Cambridge are down by around 10%. At the same time, Oxford reported a downturn in the proportion of applicants from state schools - 54%, down from 56% last year, although it stressed that it was still receiving forms which had been delayed. Cambridge, like Oxford, expects to see a similar pattern when it publishes its own breakdown of state and independent school applicants in December. Cambridge University said it was the first time for many years that applications had fallen significantly. Over the past 12 years the overall number of applications had risen by over 40%. Susan Stobbs, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said: \"It is too early to tell whether this reflects a national pattern of applications to all universities, since applications to other universities do not have to reach Ucas (the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) until December 15.\" Cambridge said that one reason for the slump might be the introduction of rules which require applicants for veterinary medicine to apply to four institutions, rather than six. But the final figures, when they are released, will be scrutinised by those interested in the Laura Spence affair - the case of the talented comprehensive schoolgirl who is now studying at Harvard after being rejected by Oxford. Oxford's vice-chancellor, Dr Colin Lucas, said: \"We're disappointed that there is no increase in the number of applications to Oxford from state schools. Indeed, the number has fallen slightly, against an overall rise in applications. \"We felt that we had begun to make real progress in encouraging more students from the maintained sector to apply to Oxford.\" A survey compiled for Cambridge Student and published by the Guardian last week showed that one in five students at Cambridge had a parent who studied at Oxbridge.",

Mr Barak appears to have little choice but to seek new parliamentary allies. Without them, his minority coalition is unlikely to survive for long once the Knesset reconvenes next week.

It is clear that Mr Arafat had no intention of honouring last week's Sharm el-Sheikh ceasefire, preferring to play the liberation hero to the fickle Arab gallery. His renewed talk of declaring an independent state seems like a cruel fantasy, given that it would lack land, funds, a viable economy and recognition - another of his vainglorious duplicities, except this time the dupes are his own people. Nor, during the present crisis, has Mr Barak been well served by a clumsily brutal, badly trained Israeli army that far too often has answered stones with live rounds. Mr Barak has not just lost his majority; he has lost the propaganda war, too. But the answer is not to give up on peace. There is an alternative.</p> <p>The terms under which Mr Sharon may agree to join forces with Mr Barak are unacceptably destructive. As deputy prime minister (and possibly finance minister, too), he would want a veto on all diplomatic and security-related decisions. He would insist that negotiating positions adopted at Camp David, especially on Jerusalem and land transfers, be withdrawn. He would oppose any evacuation of Jewish settlements. And he would accept only an interim future accord confining the Palestinians to the 42% of the West Bank over which they currently exercise full or partial control.</p> <p>Such a regression would convince Arabs that Israel did not want peace at all. It would undermine Egypt's and Jordan's leaders, invigorate extremists, and further alienate Israel's Arab community. And it would encourage the escapist talk within Israel of permanent separation - that is to say, the fencing off, literally, of the Palestinian and Jewish nations from each other; the setting in stone of historic injustice and the institutionalisation of fear and hate.

Rather than cut shabby deals, he should tell Mr Sharon and the likes of Binyamin Netanyahu to get lost. If Knesset support cannot be found elsewhere, he should himself call a general election. And then he should force the public to confront the central question it has dodged since 1967: is Israel at last prepared to pay the high price of peace? If not, does it fully comprehend the awful consequences? Given the current mood, it is a gamble Mr Barak might easily lose.

The alder carr and willow ground in the southern woods were battered by a raging torrent from a river four to five times its normal width. </p> <p>Above the valley, miniature lakes appeared on many of the fields around the village as depressions in the land filled up with the excess water, and it was not too long before the local mallards appeared on several of them, to be joined eventually by moorhens, Canada geese, and small flocks of wandering black-headed gulls. </p> <p>Over the last few days the river has calmed down and returned to its usual width, but leaving behind layers of silt on the waterside paths, including some very bedraggled and sand encrusted Himalayan balsam, which had been covered in flowers before the rains came down. </p> <p>Now it is left to the bright yellow of the gorse bushes higher up the bank to provide a splash of brightness over this drab setting. It is a relief to see that the little grebes on the mill pond have stayed this year, despite all the recent turmoil - in similar conditions last year they moved out very quickly - so over the past week I have watched them on several occasions repeatedly diving down into the murky water and seldom reappearing without a small silver fish in their beaks. </p> <p>Despite the persistent rain, we have had a very mild autumn, so far, and a combination of damp and warmth has produced ground conditions which have been ideal for the woodland fungi.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cheshire The torrential rains of the past two weeks have left their mark in the valley, especially down by the river where, at the height of the downpour, the water rose quickly to over six feet above its normal level. The alder carr and willow ground in the southern woods were battered by a raging torrent from a river four to five times its normal width. Above the valley, miniature lakes appeared on many of the fields around the village as depressions in the land filled up with the excess water, and it was not too long before the local mallards appeared on several of them, to be joined eventually by moorhens, Canada geese, and small flocks of wandering black-headed gulls. Over the last few days the river has calmed down and returned to its usual width, but leaving behind layers of silt on the waterside paths, including some very bedraggled and sand encrusted Himalayan balsam, which had been covered in flowers before the rains came down. Now it is left to the bright yellow of the gorse bushes higher up the bank to provide a splash of brightness over this drab setting. It is a relief to see that the little grebes on the mill pond have stayed this year, despite all the recent turmoil - in similar conditions last year they moved out very quickly - so over the past week I have watched them on several occasions repeatedly diving down into the murky water and seldom reappearing without a small silver fish in their beaks. Despite the persistent rain, we have had a very mild autumn, so far, and a combination of damp and warmth has produced ground conditions which have been ideal for the woodland fungi.",

Most likely, our obsession is due to the awesome, slightly fantastical nature of both dinosaurs and volcanoes, their actual existence an affront to our fanatical ordering and taming of the world. They appeal to a deep-rooted, subliminal masochism, a desire for disorder and mayhem: the defiance of science. </p> <p>Hence these days, humanity's fascination with giant lizards and flaming mountains mainly manifests itself in small boys of a certain age, who enjoy the notion of chaos. Such boys - I am speaking from experience here - draw tableau upon tableau of dinosaurs and volcanoes whenever the opportunity of being alone with a set of Berol felt tip pens arises. (Crayola crayons, I have always been convinced, are for girls, since the colours have names just like lipsticks.) In these drawings, the dinosaurs are sometimes fighting on the slopes of volcanoes. Sometimes they are running from the flowing lava and the falling ash and very occasionally - perhaps after too much orange juice - the dinosaurs are eating the volcanoes whole. (They were big dinosaurs and orange juice contained excessive tartrazine in those days.) </p> <p>In a strange parallel universe then, I might have turned out like John Seach, a volcanologist who braves noxious clouds of gas, showers of volcanic rocks and smothering rivers of ash to study his chosen subject up close. <strong> Volcano</strong> (Channel 4) followed John and his colleagues up the slopes of active volcanoes (\"If the volcano blew now, John and Geoff [the cameraman] would be incinerated\"), down the deserted streets of a town in the shadow of a brewing, spewing volcano (\"We need to get out of here now\"), to acid lakes (\"More corrosive than battery acid\") and underwater to examine lava flows (\"Blub, blub, ooh, hot\"). </p> <p>Volcano didn't cover any ground that a hundred previous documentaries on the subject haven't, but such is the allure of volcanoes themselves, that hardly mattered. It is for the spectacle as well as the science that we watch programmes about super-natural phenomena. John and his ilk may seem like graduates from the Homer Simpson School of Doing Sensible Activities, but their bravery/stupidity is something we all envy slightly. Were it not for the likelihood of a horrible burning death, who wouldn't want to adventure like a volcanologist, if only to see lava up close. (I have always thought lava looks edible. If they ever invent raspberry treacle, it will look like lava.) </p> <p><strong>Ruby</strong> (BBC1) was up close and personal with Roseanne in the first of a 12-part series of conversations over drinks and dinner. (This is a great and underused format which would be really good if, each week, Ruby - or whoever - had a different telly chef make her and her guests a meal before they sat down to a jolly discussion. Parkinson meets Ready Steady Cook, if you will.) An encounter between Ruby and Roseanne could so easily have descended into a competition - of the who-can-strip-paint-with-their-voice-quicker variety - but both women were surprisingly restrained, with the result that a revealing, funny and tender chat developed. Thanks to sparky chemistry, Ruby turned out to be an invigorating watch and could be accorded the highest compliment for a chat show. At 40 minutes, it seemed too short. </p> <p>Only one thing niggled and that was the identity and purpose of the mysterious couple who were sitting at the other table in Ruby's restaurant? Friends? Lovers? Business partners? Researchers put there to fill an empty space? Whatever, if they thought they were having an illicit meeting, boy are they mistaken. </p> <p>The Teapot Incident (when Handy Andy and the lovely but shrieky Linda Barker managed to destroy a participant's prized collection of - admittedly hideous - teapots by putting them on shoddy shelves which promptly collapsed) marked an all-time low in designer-participant relations on <strong> Changing Rooms</strong> (BBC1).

      "body": "<p>Borges once described the Falklands war as two bald men fighting over a comb. If the dispute that has broken out between John Barton and Peter Hall - over Hall's adaptation of Barton's epic Tantalus - is not quite that comically futile, it is still deeply dispiriting. These two men are titans of post-war theatre. And, having seen the marathon version of Tantalus, directed by Peter Hall and his son Edward, at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday, I can only say that it doesn't feel like a betrayal of Barton's intentions. </p> <p>What is the source of the dispute? Over a 20-year period, Barton has created in Tantalus a massive theatrical work that deals with the beginnings, climax and aftermath of the Trojan war, based on fragments of a lost epic cycle. These are the bits you won't find in Homer or the Greek dramatists but that complete the myth. Hall became Tantalus's ardent champion and a joint production was set up between the Denver Center and the Royal Shakespeare Company. </p> <p>At the start of rehearsals, however, Hall and his co-directors (then including the Gate's Mick Gordon) decided Barton's 10-play cycle needed a tougher framework and narrative tightening. Barton refused to budge and left Denver. Rewriting took place in his absence. Hall claims that since then he has had an \"abusive\" letter from Barton but no further contact. Barton was conspicuously absent from the Denver premiere of the marathon version - rapturously received by the audience - but is due to see it next weekend and, according to Hall, will \"almost certainly loathe it\". I can't see why he should. </p> <p>No great travesty has been perpetrated. A quick glance at the printed text from Oberon Books suggests the changes are largely structural, including the removal of one play, Erigone. The evening now begins and ends on a modern Greek beach, where a group of bikini-clad sunbathers are beguiled by a straw-hatted souvenir-seller who offers to tell them \"an old story of the golden age and how you all destroyed it\". Three questions are raised concerning the Trojan War: Who is to blame? What is the truth of it? How could it have been otherwise? </p> <p>Over the next 12 hours these questions reverberate in a series of punchy 50-minute plays that are quirky, lively, ironic and sometimes deeply moving - and always looking at old myths from unfamiliar angles. For me Barton is at his best in the three central plays that deal with the actual conduct of the Trojan war. In Neoptolemus, the young son of Achilles is persuaded, despite his passion for truth, to penetrate the Trojan walls disguised as a woman. Persuasion also overcomes reason when Priam, who turns out to be a testy paedophile, is encouraged by the Trojan women to allow the wooden horse to enter the city. And in Odysseus, the morning after the fall of Troy, we see the full horror of war: the women are enslaved and branded, their children are put to the sword and the women are rescued from despair only by Hecuba, who kids Odysseus that Priam's gold is buried in Thrace. </p> <p>The centre of the triptych is highly impressive. If I find Tantalus, as a whole, less stirring than The Greeks, another 10-play cycle that Barton created for the RSC in 1980, it is for several reasons. There, seven of the 10 plays came from Euripides; Tantalus is entirely Barton's own work and, with all due respect, he is not a genius on the Euripidean scale. The Greeks also dealt with familiar material: not just the fall of Troy but the murder of Agamemnon and the vengefulness of Orestes and Electra. By dealing with the \"lost bits\" of the myth, Barton here inevitably tackles material that is more marginal, curious and contradictory. Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss once wrote that \"the object of myth is to provide a logical model capable of overcoming a contradiction.\" But here it is the contradictions themselves - such as the doubt over whether Trojan Helen was raped or was a voluntary fugitive - that are part of the work's appeal. </p> <p>But what will surprise people, since we expect everything Attic to be dusty, is the work's lightness of texture and variety of tone. Everything is played in a circular sandpit strangely reminiscent of a Troilus and Cressida that Peter Hall directed - with Barton doing the fights - at Stratford in 1960; while the costume and lighting designers do a brilliant job of giving every play a different feel. But their visual masterstroke comes in Priam, which starts with Cassandra sitting atop a gigantic, fallen marble head and ends with the upstage reflecting walls parting to reveal the tumbrel-like progress of the vast wheels of the wooden horse. </p> <p>Hall p\u00e8re et fils , without distorting Barton's intentions, also bring out the work's comedy. The horror of Troy's fall is counterpointed by the absurdity that accompanies it - never more clearly than in the second play, where Agamemnon, having set sail for Troy, returns home prematurely because the fleet forget to take a pilot and land in the wrong place. The arbitrariness of gender is constantly invoked, with the cross-dressed Neoptolemus being reminded: \"If you want to be a man, you must first be a girl.\" </p> <p>The production's most contentious feature is its attachment to full masks. I can only say that they are less irritating than they were in Hall's 1981 National Theatre production of the Oresteia. They have the practical value of enabling actors to switch character quickly, and that they yield one unforgettable moment when Cassandra and Agamemnon unmask to reveal their longing for each other. </p> <p>All the acting from the mixed Anglo-American cast is first rate. David Ryall lends his caustic wit to sundry chauvinist gods, Ann Mitchell is a towering Hecuba, Robert Petkoff is the raging Achilles and his son, and Annalee Jefferies switches easily from Clytemnestra to Helen. The overall impression is of a grand production that captures the variety and vigour of these lost myths. </p> <p>John Barton may feel aggrieved that the purity of his texts has been defiled. But the theatre is a pragmatic place, and the truth is that the two Halls have, out of Barton's vision, created an intriguing, thought- provoking and exhilarating spectacle. </p> <p>\u0095 Tantalus is in Denver until November, then tours to Manchester, Nottingham, Milton Keynes, Newcastle, Norwich and London between January and May next year.</p>",

Like it or not, Richards has to accept the fact that we haven't been immersed in his \"body of work\". Frankly, we know him for Seinfeld or nothing, unless you were one of the few people who saw 1997's Trial And Error. No?

They'll expect it to be the 130th episode of Seinfeld.\" </p> <p>It hasn't been a smooth gestation, either. The sitcom has Richards playing Vic Nardozza, an aspiring but far from competent private eye. Inspector Clouseau has been mentioned as the easy reference point, and when early scenes from the show were shown to an advertising conference, they consisted entirely of slapstick. The programme was originally pencilled in as what is known as a mid-season replacement, with a short run, to start in early 2000 rather than the higher pressure, 22-episode autumn debut. From the start, though, the NBC network hedged their bets and said if development was slow, the show could wait till autumn. They opted for the later date early on. By the spring, Richards was having to make statements like \"There's no trouble here. I know it seems that way because you haven't seen a pilot. We've got months to prepare.\" </p> <p>The show was rejigged, new cast members (including indestructible smoothie - and Knots Landing veteran - William Devane) added.

The first and second episodes were swapped at the last moment; an NBC spokesperson claimed that \"We wanted to put our best foot forward.\" </p> <p>Richards is entitled to point out that Seinfeld was not launched in a blaze of glory. In the early days, the network was very tentative about this odd, low-key sitcom, and it took the public a while to discover it. Even Richards says he didn't have it right from the start. \"The real key came about eight or nine shows in. I had been playing Kramer as if he were slow-witted - always one step behind. Then I learned to play Kramer as if he were blocks ahead of what everyone's saying, and I had him.\" </p> <p>But The Michael Richards Show will have a very different dynamic from Seinfeld. After all, Seinfeld was about three averagely obsessive, neurotic and discreetly unhinged New Yorkers - and Kramer. Kramer's manic enthusiasms and bursts of rage played off the constant grouching and sniping of the others. Seinfeld was modifying a classic template for the modern sitcom laid down by Taxi. In Taxi, you had the central characters you could empathise with - mournful Judd Hirsch and long-suffering Marilu Henner - and then Christopher Lloyd and Andy Kaufman were free to wreak surreal havoc round the edges (Richards cites Kaufman as a major influence). But the core roles were what pass for normal on TV. Think of how Friends uses Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe. The only major US sitcom of recent times to buck the trend is Third Rock From The Sun, where the main characters are all really eccentric. </p> <p>So The Michael Richards Show, built around the oddball private eye, will be attempting something difficult. Richards once said that his favourite Seinfeld moments were \"Anything that I do where I'm not speaking. I like doing funny rather than saying funny.\" After a generation of script-reliant sitcoms, having Richards as your star requires trying something a little different. Which could explain why the show has undergone so much tweaking. </p> <p>But Richards is wrong when he says that critics are gearing up to attack the show. The gap that Seinfeld left is so vast that any small part being filled again will be welcomed. Whatever happens, Richards says he is ready. \"I think I'm doing a decent show here.

In a speech to the National Family and Parenting Institute, Mr Byers said a raft of practical measures was needed to overcome the difficulties facing businesses and parents in encouraging parents to return to work. \"In this changing world, it is vital to recognise the pressures on working parents and business,\" he added. In June the government launched a discussion document on how parents can be given more choices in balancing their responsibilities at home and work. A forthcoming green paper would be the most compre hensive review of work and parents ever undertaken, Mr Byers said. Businesses, especially smaller firms, find existing provisions complex and bureaucratic, particularly on maternity leave and pay while research had also shown that many parents are not aware of their existing rights, Mr Byers added.

Dunwoody, one of racing's most engaging and popular figures and champion jockey three times, admitted that the desire to make it as a jockey led him to suffer from the eating disorder at the age of 16. He revealed in his autobiography, Obsessed, which was published yesterday, that while still at school he was admitted to hospital after collapsing and subsequently became obsessed with his weight. \"Concern with my weight became an obsession.

The former champion jockey Lester Piggott was known for his daily diet of a cup of tea and a cigar. Dunwoody joins a notable list of jockeys who have revealed that they suffered from eating disorders in an attempt to maintain their weight at a low level. The former champion jump jockey Steve Cauthen, who was known as the Kentucky Kid, confessed after retiring from horse racing that he suffered from bulimia, while another jump jockey, Walter Swinburn, who retired earlier this year, said he suffered from a similar disease. There are no figures available on how many jockeys suffer from eating disorders and few who are currently racing are willing to confess to any problems, fearing that it might lead to an end to their careers. In the macho world of horse racing the issue of male eating disorders has also proved difficult to raise. Dunwoody, who retired last December, wrote: \"There was not much understanding of these things and it was unheard of for boys to be anorexic.\" According to horse racing rules, jump jockeys must weigh between 10 stone and 12 stone, while flat racing jockeys have to weigh between 7 stone 7 lb and 9 stone.

I would love to have breakfast and dinner every day but its not something I can do when I'm racing.\" McCoy, who is 26, weighs 10st 8lb, and is 5ft 10in tall, added: \"When I have to ride at 10 stone then it can be a real struggle to get my weight down. All I will have is a cup of tea during the day. Under normal circumstances a man of my size should weigh about 11 and a half stone.\" In an attempt to make jockeys aware of eating disorders, the Jockey Club has been running an awareness campaign informing them about healthy diets and the best way to restrict weight increase. Seminars about diet are regularly held and leaflets are available to jockeys on healthy eating. Ultimately, however, all those within horse racing concede that because the weight of a jockey is so crucial in the sport it will always remain a problematic area. A spokesman for the Jockeys' Association, which represents the country's jockeys, said: \"The problems associated with a jockey's weight have been with us since horse racing was invented. \"Jockeys have to diet very hard, they can't lead a normal eating existence. Very few are able to eat like you or I, it just can't be done. It's always been like that for jockeys.\" Anred - charity on anorexia in males:www.anred.com/males.html The British Racing School: www.brs.org.uk British Horse Racing Board: www.bhb.co.uk/bhb The Jockey Club: www.thejockeyclub.co.uk",

Lauda rescues his airline Former Formula One triple world champion Niki Lauda yesterday pressed through a rescue package for his beleaguered airline Lauda Air. Lauda and his biggest shareholder, Austrian Airlines, had been at odds over how to keep the airline in the air after mounting losses risked bankrupting the country's number two carrier. But after another marathon meeting yesterday, the supervisory board of Lauda Air tacitly accepted Lauda's plan to free up hidden reserves of 1.1bn schillings ($67m) through a sale-and-leaseback deal on five aircraft. OFT to judge Go-Ahead bid The office of fair trading is to try to extract concessions from French consortium C3D and Rhne Capital, which are bidding to take over road and rail operator Go-Ahead Group, it emerged yesterday. The OFT has four months to reach a decision after the European commission referred the case back to British authorities. If the OFT fails to resolve the matter amicably it can pass it on to the competition commission. Brussels said yesterday that the takeover might create a dominant position on bus routes in London and acknowledged that British authorities were best placed to judge this. Consumer affairs minister Kim Howells welcomed the decision. Kingfisher frees Holmes Marks &amp; Spencer's new retail director, Roger Holmes, will start work at the beginning of January, following agreement from his current employer, Kingfisher, that he can leave without serving his full notice period. Kingfisher had threatened legal action to hold Mr Holmes to his 12-month contract as boss of its electrical division. However, the two companies have reached a compromise without any money changing hands. Industry sources said Kingfisher had realised it was not practical to force a senior director to continue working.

I don't think the head should resign. I have every confidence in her.\" Helen Rimington, director of the education unit at the Children's Legal Centre, said the case was the first successful legal action since 1969. But the number of cases coming to court for compensation against bullying was increasing. Another teenager who claimed she had been left pyschologically scarred by three years of \"persistent and prolonged bullying\" at a school in West Sussex yesterday began a battle for \u00a375,000 damages at the high court in London. Leah Bradford-Smart, now 19, alleged that West Sussex county council failed to protect her from persistent bullying at Ifield middle school, Crawley. She told the court that she had been taunted, chased around the playground, thrown against fences and was once pushed into the road in front of a car as she waited for the school bus. The county council denies liability, claiming that the school's then headteacher had a stringent anti-bullying policy in place. The case continues.",

The government came under heavy criticism for the flop. There were calls for the auction to be annulled and demands for top level resignations, including those of prime minister Giuliano Amato and communications minister Salvatore Cardinale. The sale had been expected to raise between 20bn euros and 30bn euros but Blu's withdrawal - which left the same number of bidders as licences - brought the auction to an end with just 12bn euros on the table. Ministers were called to a hastily assembled meeting as the search got underway for legal grounds to annul the result and rerun the bidding process. BT tried hard over the weekend to keep Blu in the bidding - offering to increase its 20% stake in the consortium and to make a one-off payment of 500bn lire. But it managed to muster just over 50% support to continue the bid, instead of the necessary 80% and, crucially, it failed to persaude the Benetton family which, directly and indirectly, speaks for 41% of Blu. \"BT was prepared to raise its stake and take more of the risk in Blu but could not take the amount that other shareholders demanded as the price of continuing the bidding,\" the company said in a statement.

      "bodyText": "Marjorie Evans, the headteacher cleared of slapping a boy across the face last month, will not be charged over separate claims of mistreating pupils, police said yesterday. The fresh allegations of inappropriate emotional and physical handling of pupils at St Mary's junior school in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, were made last month after Mrs Evans, 56, successfully appealed against conviction and a three-month suspended prison sentence for common assault against the 10-year-old special needs pupil. Chief Inspector Nigel Russell of Gwent police said all information from the investigation would be forwarded to Monmouthshire county council for any action it, and the governors, considered appropriate. Mrs Evans has been suspended from her position since the first allegations were made in September 1999. School governors are to meet tomorrow to discuss whether disciplinary action will be taken against her or whether she will be reinstated. Mrs Evans said yesterday that she was relieved that the CPS had decided not to prosecute her but angry that proceedings had taken so long. \"I have lost a year of my life despite having done nothing wrong,\" she said. \"I was an ordinary headteacher, carrying out the same duties as thousands of other head teachers across the country. \"It distresses me to think that any one of the teaching profession could have false or malicious allegations made against them and have to suffer the same ordeal.\" Mrs Evans said she was waiting for the National Union of Teachers to discuss her return to work with the school and the local education authority. The crown prosecution service examined 33 witness statements, video evidence and records of interviews concerning the 10 allegations of assault and cruelty against 11 children at St Mary's. Police were told that there was no realistic prospect of conviction. Mrs Evans's supporters have claimed there has been a witch-hunt, but a CPS spokesman said that police had investigated her case \"without any preconceptions\". At last month's appeal hearing at Cardiff crown court, Mr Justice McKinnon, quashing her conviction following a trial before Abergavenny magistrates in July, said evidence against Mrs Evans was \"conflicting\" and \"unsatisfactory\". The special needs pupil had accused her of slapping him when he became difficult after being told that he could not go swimming with his classmates because of previous bad behaviour. Phil Cooke, director of life-long learning at Monmouthshire county council, said that the school governors had given \"no conditions and no time-frame\" for Mrs Evans's reinstatement when they suspended her last year. Dyfan Jones, a spokesman for the National Union of Teachers Cymru, said that Mrs Evans wanted to return to the school. \"I don't think she'd be able to return at the moment on health grounds. The stress has made her ill,\" he said. Two other teachers at the school who were investigated in connection with the allegations of mistreatment have also been cleared. Janet Bowen, one of the teachers, has been unable to return to work due to illness caused by the stress of the investigation. Gethin Lewis, secretary of NUT Cymru said: \"We had no doubts about Marj's innocence. We don't think the proper procedures for dealing with allegations against teachers were followed in this case. \"It's important to listen to the children but also to recognise that people who work in schools are vulnerable.\" Graham Powell, who lost his post as chairman of governors at St Mary's last month and has been a strong supporter of Mrs Evans throughout her suspension, called for the governors to reinstate her at the earliest opportunity. \"On what grounds can they not reinstate her?

So here it is, Vice President Gore and Governor Bush: are you at all concerned about the mounting consumer debt spreading across every demographic sector of the United States population?</p> <p>Gore and Bush seem to agree that the economy is humming, and have chosen to debate merely how best to allocate all of the surplus revenues. In the meantime, they both ignore a darker reality, one that could quickly change all of the up-beat economic forecasts coming out of Wall Street and Washington.</p> <p>Although economists and politicians don't want to talk about it, the fact is that the \"American miracle\" has, to a great extent, been bought on credit. It is impossible to understand the dramatic growth of the American economy and reduction in US unemployment in recent years without examining the close relationship that has developed between economic expansion, job creation and the amassing of record consumer debt. Consumer credit has been growing for nearly a decade. Credit card companies are extending credit at unprecedented levels. Millions of American consumers are buying \"on credit\", and because they are, millions of other Americans have gone back to work to make the goods and perform the services being purchased. As a result, the economy seems healthier than ever.</p> <p>Today, according to the Federal Reserve, Americans are spending more than they are taking in, marking the first time since the Great Depression that the country has experienced a negative savings rate. Just eight years ago the average savings rate in the US was 8% of after-tax income. Savings are now at their lowest level - 0.2 % - since monthly records began in 1959.</p> <p>Britain is fast following the American lead. In just the past year, the UK household savings rate plunged from 6.7% to 3%. If it continues to decline at this pace, the savings rate will likely be negative by this time next year, with potentially ominous consequences for the economy and society.</p> <p>An analogous situation occurred in the 1920s. Like today, that was a period of great economic change. Electricity replaced steam power across every major industry, greatly increasing the productive capacity of the country. Productivity gains, however, were not matched by a significant increase in worker compensation. Wages remained relatively flat, while many marginal workers lost their jobs in the wake of cheaper, more efficient technology substitutions. By the late 1920s, American industry was running at only 75% of capacity in most key sectors. The fruits of the new productivity gains were not being distributed broadly enough among workers to sustain increased consumption. Concerned over ineffective consumer demand, banks and retailers extended cheap credit in the form of instalment buying to encourage workers to spend more and keep the economy growing. By late 1929, consumer debt was so high it could no longer be sustained. Even the bull market was being stoked by record purchases of stocks on brokers' credit. Finally, the entire house of cards collapsed.</p> <p>The short-term substitution of consumer credit in lieu of a broad redistribution of new productivity gains is a subject that has received little, if any, attention among economists. Still, the fact remains that great technology revolutions generally spread quickly, once all of the critical elements are in place. The problem is that it generally takes at least a generation or more after a defining new technology finally comes on line, for social movements to build enough coherence and momentum to demand a fair share of the vast productivity gains that have been made possible.

      "bodyText": "While the US presidential debates were in full swing, I was pondering what I would ask the candidates if I had the opportunity to pose just one question. So here it is, Vice President Gore and Governor Bush: are you at all concerned about the mounting consumer debt spreading across every demographic sector of the United States population? Gore and Bush seem to agree that the economy is humming, and have chosen to debate merely how best to allocate all of the surplus revenues. In the meantime, they both ignore a darker reality, one that could quickly change all of the up-beat economic forecasts coming out of Wall Street and Washington. Although economists and politicians don't want to talk about it, the fact is that the \"American miracle\" has, to a great extent, been bought on credit. It is impossible to understand the dramatic growth of the American economy and reduction in US unemployment in recent years without examining the close relationship that has developed between economic expansion, job creation and the amassing of record consumer debt. Consumer credit has been growing for nearly a decade. Credit card companies are extending credit at unprecedented levels. Millions of American consumers are buying \"on credit\", and because they are, millions of other Americans have gone back to work to make the goods and perform the services being purchased. As a result, the economy seems healthier than ever. Today, according to the Federal Reserve, Americans are spending more than they are taking in, marking the first time since the Great Depression that the country has experienced a negative savings rate. Just eight years ago the average savings rate in the US was 8% of after-tax income. Savings are now at their lowest level - 0.2 % - since monthly records began in 1959. Britain is fast following the American lead. In just the past year, the UK household savings rate plunged from 6.7% to 3%. If it continues to decline at this pace, the savings rate will likely be negative by this time next year, with potentially ominous consequences for the economy and society. An analogous situation occurred in the 1920s. Like today, that was a period of great economic change. Electricity replaced steam power across every major industry, greatly increasing the productive capacity of the country. Productivity gains, however, were not matched by a significant increase in worker compensation. Wages remained relatively flat, while many marginal workers lost their jobs in the wake of cheaper, more efficient technology substitutions. By the late 1920s, American industry was running at only 75% of capacity in most key sectors. The fruits of the new productivity gains were not being distributed broadly enough among workers to sustain increased consumption. Concerned over ineffective consumer demand, banks and retailers extended cheap credit in the form of instalment buying to encourage workers to spend more and keep the economy growing. By late 1929, consumer debt was so high it could no longer be sustained. Even the bull market was being stoked by record purchases of stocks on brokers' credit. Finally, the entire house of cards collapsed. The short-term substitution of consumer credit in lieu of a broad redistribution of new productivity gains is a subject that has received little, if any, attention among economists. Still, the fact remains that great technology revolutions generally spread quickly, once all of the critical elements are in place. The problem is that it generally takes at least a generation or more after a defining new technology finally comes on line, for social movements to build enough coherence and momentum to demand a fair share of the vast productivity gains that have been made possible. In the 1920s, the crisis of increased productive capacity and ineffective consumer purchasing power was met by the extension of consumer credit to unprecedented levels. The same phenomenon is occurring today. The productivity gains brought on by the information and telecommunication revolutions are finally being felt and, in the process, virtually every major industry is facing global underutilisation of capacity and insufficient consumer demand. Once again, in the US, consumer credit has become the palliative, a way to keep the economic engines throttled up, at least for a time. Consumer credit is growing by a staggering 9% annual rate and personal bankruptcies are increasing. In 1994, 780,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy. By 1999, the number of bankruptcies had soared to 1,281,000. If countries of the European Union were to lower their current family savings rate to zero, as the US has, they could probably accelerate economic growth and reduce unemployment to under 4%. Millions of people spending money \"on credit\" would assuredly grow the economy and bring millions of European workers back to work to make the goods and perform the services being purchased on credit. But following the US lead would only result in a short-term fix and create the conditions for an even more profound long-term period of economic instability when the extension of credit reached its limits, pushing consumers into default and the economy into a downward spiral, as occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>An impressive spat developed yesterday between Charter, the British engineering group, and Lincoln, the US welding specialist which has been threatening to complete a takeover for six months. </p> <p>Lincoln lapsed its \u00a3386m bid after the market had closed on Friday, provoking a furious statement over the weekend from Charter saying, in effect, that Lincoln had no right to pull out so soon. It added that negotiations over the sale had proved so tortuous that the underlying business had been affected. As a result, second-half operating profits from Charter would now be significantly below expectations. </p> <p>A new statement from Lincoln followed, insisting that the American company was fully entitled to lapse its offer, adding that Charter was made fully aware of its reasons for doing so - in advance. The market's response was swift and brutal. Faced with both a failed bid and a profits warning, the share price was chopped from 330p on Friday evening to 155p at the close of play yesterday. </p> <p>After a couple more statements from each party, the information flow came to a screaming halt, with both sides deep in discussion with their lawyers. The outcome of any legal action may be of interest because the row would seem to turn on whether Charter can somehow claim breach of contract over an as-yet non-statutory rule book - the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. </p> <p>Working on this basis the Code, as it is known, has served the City well for many years. The European commission wants to put it on a legal footing and standardise rules across Europe. A move in this direction looks inevitable and so the Charter-Lincoln scrap gives us a little taste of the future - thick with lawyers. </p> <p>But there are other immediate aspects of this non-bid which might require certain participants in the London market to consult their defence attorneys. Lincoln's advisers seem to have told their counterparts at Charter that the whole thing was off around Friday lunchtime. Thereafter, Charter's shares began to fall sharply, with a series of trades knocking the price from 380p to 330p. </p> <p>There can be no suggestion that either company or their advisers acted improperly. Yet three hours before a formal announcement on the matter, clairvoyant types at some of the City's most prestigious investment banks were telling all callers with some confidence that the deal was off. </p> <p>Insider dealing is rife in the City; it is more common still in the financial centres of continental Europe. Yet trying to eradicate it completely risks undermining the very thing that lubricates markets - namely, a flow of information. </p> <p>The onus is on companies and their advisers to release information quickly and widely when it becomes clear that something price-sensitive has leaked. The sort of nonsense seen in London on Friday simply hurries the day when draconian measures are introduced like the one which hit Wall Street yesterday. </p> <p>Called Regulation FD (for fair disclosure), this securities &amp; exchanges commission initiative slaps a ban on any selective disclosure of market moving information. </p> <p>It sours the cosy relationship between companies and investment bank analysts, killing off \"guidance\" on trading performance and leaks to friendly news outlets. The idea is to protect retail investors who, for too long, have been dealing at a disadvantage to the big professional players. The price will be increased volatility as news, good and bad, surprises rather than confirms. The market, sadly, will also be a bit less fun. </p> <p> <strong> Feeling Blu </strong><br> Italy's auction of its third generation mobile phone licences has turned into a tale of red, white and blue. The Italian government, generally, is red with embarrassment, while budget ministers there are blanching at the size of the hole that has appeared in their fiscal arithmetic. </p> <p>British Telecom is the one left feeling blue. It tried hard within the limits of its balance sheet and shareholders patience (both fairly stretched) to keep its Blu consortium in the bidding. To no avail. Some of its partners proved to have less of an appetite for risk. </p> <p>As a result its strategy now has a gap instead of a 3G licence. It does still have a foothold in Europe's biggest mobile market via earlier Blu licences but this will slip once its rivals are able to launch UMTS -based services. </p> <p>Yet, for BT the setback could be a blessing in disguise. In Britain it has control of its 3G fate and will be in the same position in Germany when it doubles its stake in Viag to 90%. </p> <p>In Spain, however, it is a minority player - as it would have been in Italy and will be in France if Cegetel gets a licence. BT would do well to consider whether its resources are concentrated in ventures where it calls the shots or scattered more widely into deals where its ambitions are at the mercy of partners which may not share its priorities.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An impressive spat developed yesterday between Charter, the British engineering group, and Lincoln, the US welding specialist which has been threatening to complete a takeover for six months. Lincoln lapsed its \u00a3386m bid after the market had closed on Friday, provoking a furious statement over the weekend from Charter saying, in effect, that Lincoln had no right to pull out so soon. It added that negotiations over the sale had proved so tortuous that the underlying business had been affected. As a result, second-half operating profits from Charter would now be significantly below expectations. A new statement from Lincoln followed, insisting that the American company was fully entitled to lapse its offer, adding that Charter was made fully aware of its reasons for doing so - in advance. The market's response was swift and brutal. Faced with both a failed bid and a profits warning, the share price was chopped from 330p on Friday evening to 155p at the close of play yesterday. After a couple more statements from each party, the information flow came to a screaming halt, with both sides deep in discussion with their lawyers. The outcome of any legal action may be of interest because the row would seem to turn on whether Charter can somehow claim breach of contract over an as-yet non-statutory rule book - the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. Working on this basis the Code, as it is known, has served the City well for many years. The European commission wants to put it on a legal footing and standardise rules across Europe. A move in this direction looks inevitable and so the Charter-Lincoln scrap gives us a little taste of the future - thick with lawyers. But there are other immediate aspects of this non-bid which might require certain participants in the London market to consult their defence attorneys. Lincoln's advisers seem to have told their counterparts at Charter that the whole thing was off around Friday lunchtime. Thereafter, Charter's shares began to fall sharply, with a series of trades knocking the price from 380p to 330p. There can be no suggestion that either company or their advisers acted improperly. Yet three hours before a formal announcement on the matter, clairvoyant types at some of the City's most prestigious investment banks were telling all callers with some confidence that the deal was off. Insider dealing is rife in the City; it is more common still in the financial centres of continental Europe. Yet trying to eradicate it completely risks undermining the very thing that lubricates markets - namely, a flow of information. The onus is on companies and their advisers to release information quickly and widely when it becomes clear that something price-sensitive has leaked. The sort of nonsense seen in London on Friday simply hurries the day when draconian measures are introduced like the one which hit Wall Street yesterday. Called Regulation FD (for fair disclosure), this securities &amp; exchanges commission initiative slaps a ban on any selective disclosure of market moving information. It sours the cosy relationship between companies and investment bank analysts, killing off \"guidance\" on trading performance and leaks to friendly news outlets. The idea is to protect retail investors who, for too long, have been dealing at a disadvantage to the big professional players. The price will be increased volatility as news, good and bad, surprises rather than confirms. The market, sadly, will also be a bit less fun. Feeling Blu Italy's auction of its third generation mobile phone licences has turned into a tale of red, white and blue. The Italian government, generally, is red with embarrassment, while budget ministers there are blanching at the size of the hole that has appeared in their fiscal arithmetic. British Telecom is the one left feeling blue. It tried hard within the limits of its balance sheet and shareholders patience (both fairly stretched) to keep its Blu consortium in the bidding. To no avail. Some of its partners proved to have less of an appetite for risk. As a result its strategy now has a gap instead of a 3G licence. It does still have a foothold in Europe's biggest mobile market via earlier Blu licences but this will slip once its rivals are able to launch UMTS -based services. Yet, for BT the setback could be a blessing in disguise. In Britain it has control of its 3G fate and will be in the same position in Germany when it doubles its stake in Viag to 90%. In Spain, however, it is a minority player - as it would have been in Italy and will be in France if Cegetel gets a licence. BT would do well to consider whether its resources are concentrated in ventures where it calls the shots or scattered more widely into deals where its ambitions are at the mercy of partners which may not share its priorities.",

Jim Endersby Cambridge jje21@cam.ac.uk \u0095 Why struggle on with an outdated piece of industrial cast-iron heritage; \u00a314.9bn, \u00a3677 per household, is enough to tarmac 12,000 miles of tracks and give cars and buses, the choice of transport for 85% of voters, unprecedented access to town and city centres. Or perhaps the new road-tracks-network could be devoted to commercial traffic and clear our roads of monster trucks. Railways, steel wheels slipping on steel tracks, have always been very inefficient in energy engineering terms, and per passenger carried are more polluting than any other surface transport. Even busy railways are grossly underused compared to trunk roads. Add back the sabotaged Beeching lines and the UK's transport congestion problems will be solved for a generation at least. Noel Hodson Oxford noelhodson@msn.com \u0095 So Railtrack has imposed speed restrictions on 1,000 miles of track at 81 country-wide sites. Did the Health and Safety Executive know of these? If we asked them for their locations, they would be exempt under clause 28 of the Freedom of Information Bill. Peers are likely to press amendments making this information more accessible, but the government will then whip Labour MPs into making safety information more secret again. How can this be tolerable after Southall, Paddington and Hatfield? Barry White Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom freepress@cpbf.demon.co.uk \u0095 Low speed limits on all corners and junctions in the UK road system where there have been accidents in the last few years would bring about a huge reduction in casualties and lives lost.

Decades of conflict with the north are starting to ease, their president has just won the Nobel peace prize and the economy has bounced back from the Asian financial crisis with double-digit growth. </p> <p>But on the streets of Seoul few people are in the mood to party. President Kim Dae-jung has slumped in the opinion polls, the stock market is plunging and the conversation of everyone from taxi-drivers to corporate executives is peppered with pessimism. The concern centres on Daewoo Motor, once one of the driving engines of the South Korean economy but now in the limbo of bankruptcy. </p> <p>Daewoo Motor has been on a financial life support system since last year, when its parent, the sprawling Daewoo conglomerate, collapsed with debts of $709bn. </p> <p>Parts of the group were packaged up and offered for sale. In a much heralded sign of South Korea's willingness to embrace globalisation, Ford was chosen as the preferred buyer for Daewoo Motor. </p> <p>But Ford suddenly pulled out of negotiations last month, amid rumours that it had found Daewoo's liabilities to be far worse than it had been led to believe. Creditors are now looking to General Motors, which is reportedly offering less than a third of the $7bn bid tabled by Ford. </p> <p>The government wants a deal by the end of the year, but analysts say the process of due diligence is likely to take months. Whether Daewoo can survive that long is far from certain. This week Daewoo will once again take a begging bowl to its creditors for funds to stay afloat. </p> <p>One or two banks would rather pull the plug on the firm, which is losing $90m per month. But, given the crisis that would follow such a move, the main creditor - the government-run Korea Development Bank - is expected to approve new funds, though only on a short-term basis. In recognition of this latest humiliation, Daewoo is expected to announce a new management reshuffle next week and begin work on a fresh restructuring package.

      "bodyText": "South Koreans should be celebrating the best of times right now. Decades of conflict with the north are starting to ease, their president has just won the Nobel peace prize and the economy has bounced back from the Asian financial crisis with double-digit growth. But on the streets of Seoul few people are in the mood to party. President Kim Dae-jung has slumped in the opinion polls, the stock market is plunging and the conversation of everyone from taxi-drivers to corporate executives is peppered with pessimism. The concern centres on Daewoo Motor, once one of the driving engines of the South Korean economy but now in the limbo of bankruptcy. Daewoo Motor has been on a financial life support system since last year, when its parent, the sprawling Daewoo conglomerate, collapsed with debts of $709bn. Parts of the group were packaged up and offered for sale. In a much heralded sign of South Korea's willingness to embrace globalisation, Ford was chosen as the preferred buyer for Daewoo Motor. But Ford suddenly pulled out of negotiations last month, amid rumours that it had found Daewoo's liabilities to be far worse than it had been led to believe. Creditors are now looking to General Motors, which is reportedly offering less than a third of the $7bn bid tabled by Ford. The government wants a deal by the end of the year, but analysts say the process of due diligence is likely to take months. Whether Daewoo can survive that long is far from certain. This week Daewoo will once again take a begging bowl to its creditors for funds to stay afloat. One or two banks would rather pull the plug on the firm, which is losing $90m per month. But, given the crisis that would follow such a move, the main creditor - the government-run Korea Development Bank - is expected to approve new funds, though only on a short-term basis. In recognition of this latest humiliation, Daewoo is expected to announce a new management reshuffle next week and begin work on a fresh restructuring package. According to the Korean media, 30% of the company's 20,000 jobs in South Korea will be cut. A sense of crisis pervades the company. Last month, workers at Daewoo Motor's design research facility in Worthing, Surrey, were alarmed to be told that they would have to wait for their salaries while the company negotiated new funds.

There was little pomp and ceremony and her motorcade drove through almost deserted streets - few people in the North can afford petrol, let alone cars.</p> <p>The reception was a sharp contrast to the flag-waving crowds that greeted the leaders of South Korea and Russia in the summer when they made their first visits to the North, which is slowly emerging from decades of isolation.</p> <p>But the handshake between Ms Albright and Mr Kim, which came just six years after the two sides almost went to war over the North's suspected nuclear weapons programme, was more significant.</p> <p>\"This is new from a historical point of view,\" said the North's leader. \"I feel absolutely delighted.\"</p> <p>\"I'm very glad to be here in your beautiful city,\" she responded.</p> <p>The two talked longer than expected and in the evening, Mr Kim - who has a knack of impressing his guests with unexpected warmth - suddenly announced a change in the schedule so that he could host a dinner for Ms Albright.</p> <p>US officials played down expectations of any new initiatives during the secretary of state's two-day trip, which is primarily designed to test the water for Mr Clinton. The US president has pushed for a rapid improvement in bilateral relations, despite concerns about Pyongyang's record on human rights.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, during a visit to Washington by Jo Myong Rok - Mr Kim's right-hand man - the two states pledged \"to take steps to improve their bilateral relations in the interests of enhancing peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region\". Ms Albright is in Pyongyang to assess the sincerity of Mr Kim's intentions, particularly over the North's missile programme, the main issue of concern for Washington and one reason why the US has pushed ahead with research into a \"son of star wars\" anti-missile system.</p> <p>If Mr Clinton visits the North, he will expect an assurance that Pyongyang will halt sales of ballistic missiles to states such as Syria and Iraq. Currently, this trade is one of the main sources of foreign currency for the impoverished communist country.</p> <p>In return for any such concession, Mr Kim would want the US to remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism - the main obstacle to foreign trade and investment that Pyongyang desperately needs after a decade of drought, famine and economic decline.</p> <p>Last week, Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium announced that they were ready to establish full diplomatic relations, but Mr Kim knows that he needs American support to gain access to the World Bank, and to receive development assistance from Japan.</p> <p>Analysts believe that the growing likelihood of a victory by George W Bush - who has been far more hawkish towards Pyongyang - in the US presidential election next month could push the North to give ground.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world's last cold war confrontation moved a step closer to a thaw yesterday when the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in the highest level contact ever between the two states. In talks lasting more than three hours, Ms Albright is believed to have discussed the possibility of a visit by President Bill Clinton, the North's missile programme and improved diplomatic relations. The visit, which was arranged in just 48 hours, is seen as a high-stakes gamble by Mr Clinton to leave a positive diplomatic legacy before he leaves the White House in January. Ms Albright arrived in Pyongyang to a low-key welcome that belied the importance of the visit to both sides. There was little pomp and ceremony and her motorcade drove through almost deserted streets - few people in the North can afford petrol, let alone cars. The reception was a sharp contrast to the flag-waving crowds that greeted the leaders of South Korea and Russia in the summer when they made their first visits to the North, which is slowly emerging from decades of isolation. But the handshake between Ms Albright and Mr Kim, which came just six years after the two sides almost went to war over the North's suspected nuclear weapons programme, was more significant. \"This is new from a historical point of view,\" said the North's leader. \"I feel absolutely delighted.\" \"I'm very glad to be here in your beautiful city,\" she responded. The two talked longer than expected and in the evening, Mr Kim - who has a knack of impressing his guests with unexpected warmth - suddenly announced a change in the schedule so that he could host a dinner for Ms Albright. US officials played down expectations of any new initiatives during the secretary of state's two-day trip, which is primarily designed to test the water for Mr Clinton. The US president has pushed for a rapid improvement in bilateral relations, despite concerns about Pyongyang's record on human rights. Two weeks ago, during a visit to Washington by Jo Myong Rok - Mr Kim's right-hand man - the two states pledged \"to take steps to improve their bilateral relations in the interests of enhancing peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region\". Ms Albright is in Pyongyang to assess the sincerity of Mr Kim's intentions, particularly over the North's missile programme, the main issue of concern for Washington and one reason why the US has pushed ahead with research into a \"son of star wars\" anti-missile system. If Mr Clinton visits the North, he will expect an assurance that Pyongyang will halt sales of ballistic missiles to states such as Syria and Iraq. Currently, this trade is one of the main sources of foreign currency for the impoverished communist country. In return for any such concession, Mr Kim would want the US to remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism - the main obstacle to foreign trade and investment that Pyongyang desperately needs after a decade of drought, famine and economic decline. Last week, Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium announced that they were ready to establish full diplomatic relations, but Mr Kim knows that he needs American support to gain access to the World Bank, and to receive development assistance from Japan. Analysts believe that the growing likelihood of a victory by George W Bush - who has been far more hawkish towards Pyongyang - in the US presidential election next month could push the North to give ground.",

He will be eligible for parole next June. Boesak, a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner during the 1980s, was convicted of stealing 1.3m rand (\u00a3118,000) of donor funds.

Now a Labour seat, around half the properties are shared houses owned by private landlords, many absentee. There are roughly 40 letting shops in a one mile radius. In the past three years, more than 8,500 families have left. Last year 1,600 houses were converted to house students. House prices have risen by 50%, knocking first-time buyers out of the market.

Many residents studied in Leeds and have stayed on in the area. Bronwen Holden, secretary of Heal, has student children and her husband is professor of physiology at the University of Leeds - the third largest employer in the city, providing more than 10,000 jobs and contributing \u00a3500m annually to the local economy.

      "body": "<p>Judy Fryd, who has died aged 90, would not take no for answer. This was a vital trait for the woman who altered the public's perception of learning disability. Judy Fryd sowed the seeds of Mencap, now the largest disability organisation in the country.</p> <p>Although modest in private, in public Fryd was a dynamic campaigner for children and adults with learning disabilities - people considered 50 years ago as \"backward\". Today, a person with a learning disability serves on the recently formed Disability Rights Commission and many of those previously in long-stay \"sub-normality\" hospitals now live independently. The Disability Discrimination Act has further strengthened the rights of disabled people, though the fight is far from over.</p> <p>Much of this change is largely due to Fryd, who along with a group of fellow parents, banded together more than 50 years ago to form the Association of Parents of Backward Children. This organisation evolved to become the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults in the 1980s, better known as Mencap.</p> <p>Born in Hornsey, London, the daughter of a post-office sorter, Fryd was educated at Minchenden School, Southgate and Ruskin College, Oxford, where she met her husband John Fryd: they both read economics and political science. They married in London in 1936 and moved to Leeds, where Fryd gave birth to their first child, Felicity, in 1938. When Felicity showed signs of slow development, Judy and John sought help. It was a frustrating search. After only half a day at a mainstream primary school she was rejected as being too disruptive.</p> <p>Later, although found a suitable placement, she was deemed \"not suitable\" and her immediate removal was requested. She was summarily returned to her family who were left to cope alone with her autism and challenging behaviour (then described as juvenile schizophrenia). The lack of understanding from society and the professionals who were supposed to support her angered Fryd.</p> <p>Her initial step, in 1946, was to respond to a letter in Nursery World magazine which asked if there were other parents struggling to cope with a learning-disabled child at home. Fryd suggested that she and other parents of such children should band together in an effort to receive some kind of recognition - and amelioration - of their desperate plight. Within a month more than 1,000 parents, largely mothers, had joined forces.</p> <p>Throughout the 50s and 60s, Fryd promoted and researched the needs and potential of people with learning disabilities. She was editor of Parents' Voice for over 25 years. This monthly magazine enabled parents to keep in touch, spread information and rally for positive action. It also helped parents overcome the supposed shame of having a learning-disabled child.</p> <p>At home, the Fryds were a musical family. Felicity, known by her family as Filly, participated fully within this musical environment, where she would twirl around in circles dancing to Fryd's accomplished piano playing. Along with the rest of the family, Filly had perfect pitch, and her outbursts were often affectionately referred to as her \"arias\".</p> <p>Fryd led a campaign which resulted in the 1971 Education (Handicapped Children) Act, overturning the previous thinking that children with a learning disability were ineducable. Until then, parents had to find (and pay for) private education; even so, the children were denied post-war support such as free school milk and vitamin supplements. If private schooling was unavailable or too costly, parents had to look after their son or daughter at home. Or they were certified as mentally defective and dispatched to an NHS long-stay sub-normality hospital.</p> <p>Although most of what Fryd fought for came too late for her own daughter to benefit, she saw her tiny association grow into Mencap, with a turnover of \u00a3100m, 5,500 staff and more than 20,000 volunteers. Today people with learning disabilities serve on the board of trustees, which was unthinkable even 10 years ago. Fryd was positive about Mencap's most recent changes, and felt it made sense to have one-third of its national assembly being people with learning disabilities.</p> <p>A lifelong member of the Labour Party, Fryd was honoured at the 1991 annual conference in Brighton for outstanding voluntary service to the party. She was a vice-president of Mencap for the last 20 years.</p> <p>Fryd's husband died in 1981. She is survived by two daughters and a son, and her only grandchild, Elly, born in 1969, who lived with her for the last 10 years. Fryd's daughter Felicity died in 1993.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Judy Fryd, who has died aged 90, would not take no for answer. This was a vital trait for the woman who altered the public's perception of learning disability. Judy Fryd sowed the seeds of Mencap, now the largest disability organisation in the country. Although modest in private, in public Fryd was a dynamic campaigner for children and adults with learning disabilities - people considered 50 years ago as \"backward\". Today, a person with a learning disability serves on the recently formed Disability Rights Commission and many of those previously in long-stay \"sub-normality\" hospitals now live independently. The Disability Discrimination Act has further strengthened the rights of disabled people, though the fight is far from over. Much of this change is largely due to Fryd, who along with a group of fellow parents, banded together more than 50 years ago to form the Association of Parents of Backward Children. This organisation evolved to become the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults in the 1980s, better known as Mencap. Born in Hornsey, London, the daughter of a post-office sorter, Fryd was educated at Minchenden School, Southgate and Ruskin College, Oxford, where she met her husband John Fryd: they both read economics and political science. They married in London in 1936 and moved to Leeds, where Fryd gave birth to their first child, Felicity, in 1938. When Felicity showed signs of slow development, Judy and John sought help. It was a frustrating search. After only half a day at a mainstream primary school she was rejected as being too disruptive. Later, although found a suitable placement, she was deemed \"not suitable\" and her immediate removal was requested. She was summarily returned to her family who were left to cope alone with her autism and challenging behaviour (then described as juvenile schizophrenia). The lack of understanding from society and the professionals who were supposed to support her angered Fryd. Her initial step, in 1946, was to respond to a letter in Nursery World magazine which asked if there were other parents struggling to cope with a learning-disabled child at home. Fryd suggested that she and other parents of such children should band together in an effort to receive some kind of recognition - and amelioration - of their desperate plight. Within a month more than 1,000 parents, largely mothers, had joined forces. Throughout the 50s and 60s, Fryd promoted and researched the needs and potential of people with learning disabilities. She was editor of Parents' Voice for over 25 years. This monthly magazine enabled parents to keep in touch, spread information and rally for positive action. It also helped parents overcome the supposed shame of having a learning-disabled child. At home, the Fryds were a musical family. Felicity, known by her family as Filly, participated fully within this musical environment, where she would twirl around in circles dancing to Fryd's accomplished piano playing. Along with the rest of the family, Filly had perfect pitch, and her outbursts were often affectionately referred to as her \"arias\". Fryd led a campaign which resulted in the 1971 Education (Handicapped Children) Act, overturning the previous thinking that children with a learning disability were ineducable. Until then, parents had to find (and pay for) private education; even so, the children were denied post-war support such as free school milk and vitamin supplements. If private schooling was unavailable or too costly, parents had to look after their son or daughter at home. Or they were certified as mentally defective and dispatched to an NHS long-stay sub-normality hospital. Although most of what Fryd fought for came too late for her own daughter to benefit, she saw her tiny association grow into Mencap, with a turnover of \u00a3100m, 5,500 staff and more than 20,000 volunteers. Today people with learning disabilities serve on the board of trustees, which was unthinkable even 10 years ago. Fryd was positive about Mencap's most recent changes, and felt it made sense to have one-third of its national assembly being people with learning disabilities. A lifelong member of the Labour Party, Fryd was honoured at the 1991 annual conference in Brighton for outstanding voluntary service to the party. She was a vice-president of Mencap for the last 20 years. Fryd's husband died in 1981. She is survived by two daughters and a son, and her only grandchild, Elly, born in 1969, who lived with her for the last 10 years. Fryd's daughter Felicity died in 1993.",

That, I was told by a PhD during freshers' week, was all I needed to do to get a 2:2. For a 2:1, I'd require a better attendance record and have to work harder, but not at the expense of being cut off from civilisation. And for a First I would have to become some sort of social outcast, go to every lecture and tutorial (scribbling notes madly), spend every waking moment immersed in academic books, and be among the last to be thrown out of the university library at 10pm closing time. Otherwise I could kiss goodbye to getting the 70% plus marks required. </p> <p> Well, I am no genius and I would not, and did not, give up my life for study. I didn't attend every lecture and tutorial. I didn't write down every word spoken in lectures. I didn't get 70% or more in every essay, project, test or exam. I was usually behind with my reading and occasionally mystified by the syllabus. Sometimes I couldn't be bothered to go to university and stayed at home instead. But I always knew where I was, what I had to do, and what not to bother with. And I always worked hard on the things that counted: assessments. </p> <p> I can tell you how I got my first-class degree but I don't necessarily recommend it as good practice. Students have to discover their own methods. This is not a guide to getting a First - it's how I got my First. Getting a degree is about learning, but it isn't just about learning biology, history, English or whatever. It's about understanding what you need to succeed - what, in fact, the university wants from you and what you will get in return. You have to get a feel for the education market and really sell your inspirations. What does the lecturer want? What is the essay marker searching for? What is the examiner expecting? </p> <p> Some students try to offer something not wanted. Others want to give very little - they steal the thoughts of others and submit them as their own. But they all want to be rewarded. Exchange, but don't steal, and you'll get a degree. Think of the university as a customer and give it what it wants. Delight it and that degree will be a First. Along the way you may learn something. I could guarantee every book on my reading list was out on long loan from the university library within five seconds of the list being issued. This was worrying at first, but I quickly learned that it was impossible to read all of the books on an average reading list, anyway. I sought shortcuts. Collections of selected readings or journal articles were excellent sources that often saved me the bother of reading the original texts. And academic books can be difficult to read and understand. If I found myself re-reading sentences or nodding off, I'd stop. Once I started burrowing into books, it was easy to become engulfed in fine detail.</p> <p> References in books dragged me all over the place but, with all the courses I had to do, there wasn't enough time to be led too far. I would flick through the book, read the introduction, note any summaries, look at diagrams, skim the index, and read any conclusions. In all my time at university, I did not read one book from start to finish - I plucked out what was needed and made my escape. I knew students who tried to scribble down their lecturer's every word. I did too, at first, but I then quickly realised when it came to revision that most of my lecture notes were useless. I preferred to write selected notes. Most of all, though, I would listen. If you are constantly writing, you are not really listening and the essential feel of the subject is lost. Lecturers are imparting their wisdom in exchange for your attention. The least you can do is listen. </p> <p> Academics were my customers and I identified two types. There were those for whom lecturing was an unwelcome interruption to their research work. Tutorials served to compound established wisdom, not to confront it. After all, we were students and what did we know? I would deliberately pitch my essays to this kind of academic so that my opinions appeared more as evidence that I had read and understood the key contributions to the debate, rather than as an attempt to pull down monuments. I did not want to be marked down for being an upstart. The other types were those who enjoyed teaching and discussing new ideas. They wanted more. They wanted something different, inspirational, iconoclastic. I would present my arguments to show that I had done my reading and understood the key concepts, but I would also try to add something more to the issue rather than rake over familiar ground. More importantly, I felt safe doing it. Essentially, it was a case of working out what was wanted and then delivering it.</p> <p> I can't state exactly how successful this tactic was, except to say that I sold more essays than I had returned as faulty. I revised by discarding subject areas I could not face revising; reading; compiling notes; and then condensing them onto one or two sheets of A4 for each subject area. Leading up to the exam, I would concentrate on just the condensed notes and rely on my memory to drag out the detail behind them when the time came. I didn't practice writing exam questions, although it was recommended. I knew the subject areas to be examined but didn't know what kind of interpretation or analysis was required until I turned over the exam paper. It really is a question of understanding this on the day and I prefer to be spontaneous and open-minded. I don't want pre-formed conclusions filling my mind before I've even read the questions.</p> <p> \u0095 Mark McArdle is a contributor to How I Got My First Class Degree edited by Peter Tolmie, Independent Studies, Lancaster University, supported by the Guardian \u00a39.95 (inc p&amp;p), tel: 01524 593430, email: <a href=\"mailto:IndStud@lancaster.ac.uk\"> IndStud@lancaster.ac.uk</a> <br></p> <p> <strong>Kerry Boorman </strong><br></p> <p> She failed her 11-plus exam but got a first-class honours degree in theatre studies at Lancaster University<br></p> <p>I have no secret to tell. I was just willing to try. Actually, I was trying for a 2:1 but, with a First suddenly coming into sight, my degree gave me 3D perception. That is, my life began to relate to the three dimensions of discipline, dedication and determination. Discipline is not about having your head stuck in a book every second but about being organised - developing a programme and sticking to it. Unfortunately, for me this was not the essay overnight, but a slow and painfully paced effort over three to four weeks. I knew if I did not give an essay this time I would either panic or fall behind. I also knew that structure was my weak point. To compensate, I needed a worthier content, which meant more time, more reading, more effort. </p> <p> So I often set my own deadlines for about a week earlier than the official ones. This way, even when I did miss my goal, I still hit the important one. But this didn't mean I had no life. Good time management includes study time, personal time and social time, with all three being equally important. Times when I became obsessed with study and sacrificed my social life were unhealthy and ineffective. So discipline and a balanced diet. Most games rely on teamwork, particularly so when it comes to theatre and performance. While pushing others to the limits, I pushed myself and in turn was pushed by them. Tiring, frustrating but rewarding. </p> <p> Secondly: dedication to the game - that is, to the subject and the result. I was never a swot but I cared about my work. I wanted to win! Not because I had to but because I wanted to and because I deserved to. By setting such high expectations I placed myself under tremendous pressure at times. Yet I went on assigning myself targets I was determined to hit. My practical work struck firsts, but the mark of a first in an essay was an objective I aimed for for two and a half years. Each time I managed near misses - until my last two papers. So, if at first you don't succeed, try again until you do. It's all about determination. <br></p> <p> <strong> Donna Taylor </strong><br></p> <p> She gained a first-class honours degree in English at Edge Hill College</p> <p>We entered the results hall at about midday. There weren't as many people there as I'd anticipated. There I was, alone. Or so it felt. My friend, Peter, had gone to find my results but I think it was Claire who first saw my name under the title of First Class Hons. Seeing my name there in black capital letters made me feel faint. An entire collection of emotions ran through me: surprise, euphoria, excitement. I couldn't believe I'd got a first. In my book firsts were always for the really bright people and not for the likes of me. Before the surprise could set in and render me still and helpless, a barrage of former tutors and professors came up to offer me their congratulations. However, to be honest, I wasn't really listening to them. My mind was still rigidly fixed upon those letters ... </p> <p> Actually, it's surprising how getting a first ignites the jealousy in others. You will undoubtedly hear cries of 'Oh well, she had to work really hard' or 'she must have worked hard, she didn't get that mark with natural talent'. Maybe I did, maybe not. I prefer to think my degree mark reflects a combination of hard work and talent. To me they are inextricably linked: you can work as hard as you like but, if you don't understand the work, you'll get nowhere! </p> <p> There's no secret to getting a first. But if you are following my advice, here is the primary rule: Do not think you are aiming for a first. Set your sights high by all means, but don't start to write every assignment worrying that you have got to get above 70% otherwise your grade will slip. I once started worrying about the 'potential' of one of my essays. As it happens, this assignment got one of my lower marks. Which all goes to prove you can't hope to wave a magic wand and come out of your graduation day dressed like Batman clutching a first-class honours degree. You have to work. But there's a big but. Don't work because you have to, do it because you want to. In brief, then: work, plan, research and don't write anything while drunk. Enjoy yourself - and your work. A happy student is one who gets the balance right between work and play. Then again, what would I know? I'm obviously an egghead!</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> PSHE/citizenship: key stages 3 &amp; 4</strong><br></p> <p>Queen Victoria is known to have taken cannabis to help relieve her period pains. Today, someone doing that risks arrest, imprisonment and a criminal record. Things have changed, but now the pressure is on the government to re-examine the laws forbidding the possession and use of the drug. </p> <p> <strong> Why is cannabis in the news?</strong> </p> <p> Recently, a senior member of the Conservative party, Anne Widdecombe, called for tougher penalties for people caught with cannabis. Immediately, the police condemned her ideas saying they were \"unworkable\". Then 10 of Widdecombe's political colleagues admitted to smoking cannabis in their youth. It was embarrassing for the Conservatives but the muddle prompted a public debate about cannabis and the law. </p> <p> <strong> What is cannabis?</strong> </p> <p> It is a plant related to nettles. People have grown cannabis for thousands of years both as a medicine and a source of a tough fibre called hemp. It originates in Central Asia and probably arrived in Europe in the Middle Ages. One of its most common forms is marijuana. </p> <p> <strong> What is the effect of using it?</strong> </p> <p> Chemicals in cannabis called cannabinoids stimulate certain brain receptors and seem to affect the body's pain relief mechanisms. What people experience depends on the drug's strength and how it is taken. The drug's effects range from making people happy and talkative to feeling insecure (paranoid). The physical impact of the drug is just as varied. Some people who suffer certain serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis claim cannabis is helpful because it relaxes muscles. </p> <p> <strong> Why is cannabis illegal?</strong> </p> <p> Some people fear cannabis is dangerous. It increases the heart rate and so can harm people with heart conditions. The National Drugs Helpline says cannabis is not physically addictive, but can make people think they want it. Also, people who smoke the drug often mix it with tobacco, which is highly addictive and causes cancer. However, unlike most other drugs, it is impossible to overdose on cannabis. By contrast over 4,000 people die every year in the UK because of drinking alcohol. The other great worry is that cannabis is a \"gateway\" drug which encourages people to try more dangerous substances such as heroin and cocaine. This argument is weakened if you look at Holland, where decriminalisation of cannabis has not had this effect. </p> <p> <strong> What is \"decriminalisation\"?</strong> </p> <p> In Holland cannabis remains officially illegal, but people are allowed to possess it for personal use and it can be sold in specific, carefully monitored \"coffee shops\". This differs from complete \"legalisation\" which would allow cannabis to be sold anywhere. </p> <p> <strong> What is the law in this country?</strong> </p> <p> Under The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, cannabis is classed Grade B. People caught with it can face anything up to five years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. The penalties are worse if someone is convicted of \"dealing\" - supplying the drug, even to a few friends.

      "bodyText": "PSHE/citizenship: key stages 3 &amp; 4 Queen Victoria is known to have taken cannabis to help relieve her period pains. Today, someone doing that risks arrest, imprisonment and a criminal record. Things have changed, but now the pressure is on the government to re-examine the laws forbidding the possession and use of the drug. Why is cannabis in the news? Recently, a senior member of the Conservative party, Anne Widdecombe, called for tougher penalties for people caught with cannabis. Immediately, the police condemned her ideas saying they were \"unworkable\". Then 10 of Widdecombe's political colleagues admitted to smoking cannabis in their youth. It was embarrassing for the Conservatives but the muddle prompted a public debate about cannabis and the law. What is cannabis? It is a plant related to nettles. People have grown cannabis for thousands of years both as a medicine and a source of a tough fibre called hemp. It originates in Central Asia and probably arrived in Europe in the Middle Ages. One of its most common forms is marijuana. What is the effect of using it? Chemicals in cannabis called cannabinoids stimulate certain brain receptors and seem to affect the body's pain relief mechanisms. What people experience depends on the drug's strength and how it is taken. The drug's effects range from making people happy and talkative to feeling insecure (paranoid). The physical impact of the drug is just as varied. Some people who suffer certain serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis claim cannabis is helpful because it relaxes muscles. Why is cannabis illegal? Some people fear cannabis is dangerous. It increases the heart rate and so can harm people with heart conditions. The National Drugs Helpline says cannabis is not physically addictive, but can make people think they want it. Also, people who smoke the drug often mix it with tobacco, which is highly addictive and causes cancer. However, unlike most other drugs, it is impossible to overdose on cannabis. By contrast over 4,000 people die every year in the UK because of drinking alcohol. The other great worry is that cannabis is a \"gateway\" drug which encourages people to try more dangerous substances such as heroin and cocaine. This argument is weakened if you look at Holland, where decriminalisation of cannabis has not had this effect. What is \"decriminalisation\"? In Holland cannabis remains officially illegal, but people are allowed to possess it for personal use and it can be sold in specific, carefully monitored \"coffee shops\". This differs from complete \"legalisation\" which would allow cannabis to be sold anywhere. What is the law in this country? Under The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, cannabis is classed Grade B. People caught with it can face anything up to five years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. The penalties are worse if someone is convicted of \"dealing\" - supplying the drug, even to a few friends. Often the police decide to caution people they arrest but this still results in an official police record. Over a million people in the UK are in this position. And having a police record makes certain kinds of jobs (teaching) and countries (America) out of bounds. Isn't this all rather tough? Some people think so. They argue it's absurd for otherwise law-abiding people to suffer such consequences, saying penalties are not applied equally across the UK and that tough laws do not seem to be stopping anyone from using the drug anyway. Who are these critics? The list includes influential people and organisations such as the British Medical Association which has declared that cannabis is \"very safe\"; senior policemen fed up with asking their staff to do an impossible job and wanting to concentrate on the fight against really dangerous drugs; a House of Lords committee that suggested two years ago that cannabis should be made legal for medical use; and recently the Police Foundation, which recommended those cautioned or fined for cannabis offences should not be penalised with a police record. Are they being listened to? Tony Blair is resisting the calls for a Royal Commission investigation into the issue, which could lead to a change in the law.

Has he done something to upset the teacher? For example, no homework, constant chatter, a casual attitude to work or poor behaviour? This may provoke a discussion on school in general. Does he find the work difficult? Has he sought help and, if so, has he had any? </p> <p>Is there anything specific that the teacher has done to upset your child, wittingly or unwittingly, and is he aware of it? Were you able to speak to the teacher without your son present? Was there a frank and fair exchange of views? Could you agree some strategies to help repair the relationship? </p> <p>You could speak to the head of department, provided he or she is not the same teacher. A more senior or perhaps more experienced member of staff may help to resolve the situation. It might be possible to move to a different geography class being taught at the same time, although don't rely on this. Often school timetables have only one group for a subject being taught at any one time, especially if they're mixed ability classes, as it depends on the availability of a teacher. </p> <p>If it's still unresolved, consider involving the head of year as well. It may be possible to change tutor groups, which could lead to a different geography teacher. However, consider the implications of a move to another class. Your son may no longer be with friends or, indeed, with teachers he likes and with whom he is making good progress. </p> <p>There's often not a simple solution. Sometimes pupils will have to learn to deal with difficulties like the one you've described. This, too, can be a valuable learning process. We all have to work with people we don't always get on with; that's just part of life! </p> <p> <strong> Susan Rees, from the Advisory Centre for Education</strong> </p> <p> It's not unusual for children to make subjective judgments about teachers, but it's rarer - and unprofessional - for a teacher to respond in the same way. Your son's geography teacher should be making the first move to overcome the impasse between them. After all, he is the adult! </p> <p>I'd suggest that you go back into the school, see the teacher about the situation and ask how he or she will address it. You could try holding out an olive branch by asking what exactly your son does to irritate him, and offer to speak to your son. Sometimes it can be due to nothing more than a breakdown in effective communication between teacher and pupil: perhaps quietness is misinterpreted as sullenness or a particular stance wrongly perceived as aggressive. </p> <p>If this doesn't resolve things, try approaching either the head of department or the head of year. In this case, be as specific as possible about what has been happening, ie actual incidents and forms of words used which will illustrate your concerns. It's also a good idea to gather evidence of where your son is behaving well and making good progress, to show that the problem in geography is an isolated one (if it is, of course). It may also be that other parents have raised similar concerns about this teacher, and that the head of department will need to deal with the situation personally. Or it could simply be that your son is moved into another geography class. </p> <p>If a teacher is actually using their position to bully and humiliate a child systematically, this is an obvious occasion where parents should act quickly. Such matters need to be taken to a senior member of staff and nipped in the bud before they escalate, and they represent a serious abuse of the power relationship in a classroom. A teacher who rips up a child's work, or is rude and sarcastic on a very personal level, can set the tone for the rest of the class, who often follow this lead. </p> <p>However, a word of caution. Making a complaint against a teacher is tantamount to questioning their whole professional competence, and can spiral very quickly out of your control. If you feel you can deal with things by having a quiet word yourself, this is often the best way to proceed, at least at the start. </p> <p> <strong> Next week's problem:</strong> My daughter has been caught smoking at breaktime in the school toilets. We have clearly told her at home that we will not tolerate her smoking, and it comes as a bit of a blow to find that she can so easily do so at school. What should the school be doing about this?</p>",

Often school timetables have only one group for a subject being taught at any one time, especially if they're mixed ability classes, as it depends on the availability of a teacher. If it's still unresolved, consider involving the head of year as well. It may be possible to change tutor groups, which could lead to a different geography teacher. However, consider the implications of a move to another class. Your son may no longer be with friends or, indeed, with teachers he likes and with whom he is making good progress. There's often not a simple solution. Sometimes pupils will have to learn to deal with difficulties like the one you've described. This, too, can be a valuable learning process. We all have to work with people we don't always get on with; that's just part of life! Susan Rees, from the Advisory Centre for Education It's not unusual for children to make subjective judgments about teachers, but it's rarer - and unprofessional - for a teacher to respond in the same way. Your son's geography teacher should be making the first move to overcome the impasse between them. After all, he is the adult! I'd suggest that you go back into the school, see the teacher about the situation and ask how he or she will address it. You could try holding out an olive branch by asking what exactly your son does to irritate him, and offer to speak to your son. Sometimes it can be due to nothing more than a breakdown in effective communication between teacher and pupil: perhaps quietness is misinterpreted as sullenness or a particular stance wrongly perceived as aggressive. If this doesn't resolve things, try approaching either the head of department or the head of year. In this case, be as specific as possible about what has been happening, ie actual incidents and forms of words used which will illustrate your concerns. It's also a good idea to gather evidence of where your son is behaving well and making good progress, to show that the problem in geography is an isolated one (if it is, of course). It may also be that other parents have raised similar concerns about this teacher, and that the head of department will need to deal with the situation personally. Or it could simply be that your son is moved into another geography class. If a teacher is actually using their position to bully and humiliate a child systematically, this is an obvious occasion where parents should act quickly. Such matters need to be taken to a senior member of staff and nipped in the bud before they escalate, and they represent a serious abuse of the power relationship in a classroom. A teacher who rips up a child's work, or is rude and sarcastic on a very personal level, can set the tone for the rest of the class, who often follow this lead. However, a word of caution. Making a complaint against a teacher is tantamount to questioning their whole professional competence, and can spiral very quickly out of your control. If you feel you can deal with things by having a quiet word yourself, this is often the best way to proceed, at least at the start. Next week's problem: My daughter has been caught smoking at breaktime in the school toilets. We have clearly told her at home that we will not tolerate her smoking, and it comes as a bit of a blow to find that she can so easily do so at school. What should the school be doing about this?",

      "bodyText": "Labour's big idea for tackling the nation's growing shortage of essential economic skills will finally be launched tomorrow. Ufi, formerly known as the University for Industry, will officially be opened by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, although it has been operational for months now. At events around the country a string of celebrities will sign up for courses via learndirect, billed as Britain's first \"e-learning network\", which is at the heart of the Ufi concept. According to its former chairman Lord Dearing, the lifelong learning flagship promises to be as great an achievement for New Labour as the Open University turned out for the Wilson government, after initial scepticism. The concept has moved on since Gordon Brown, then shadow chancellor, unveiled his vision of a university for industry in the Guardian. A big idea is certainly needed if the latest survey on the national workforce is to be believed. Nearly three quarters of British firms are suffering skills shortages, a jump of 26% compared to the previous six months, according to research published by Reed, the recruitment specialist. This is a record increase in reported shortages since the company began its Skills Index over three years ago. The shortfalls are particularly acute in accountancy and information technology. Ufi's mission is to \"make it easy for everyone to get into learning whenever and wherever they want to,\" says Anne Wright, Ufi's chief executive. \"We're concentrating on what they need for work. The kind of skills we're offering are IT, basic literacy and numeracy, and the skills for small businesses.\" Accessibility is seen as crucial for making inroads on the critical mass of adults who left school with few or no skills and have so far been disinclined to return to education, often because their first experience of it was unhappy. These are the group targeted by the government's \"widening participation\" programme but who have not responded to colleges' considerable efforts to entice them in. So far Ufi and its learndirect network, with an \u00a384m budget this year, have opened more than 600 learning centres across England where the public can come in and start a course straight away or find out where they can go for what they need, says Wright. The centres are situated in venues where people often go anyway, such as shopping malls, pubs, community centres and football clubs. Perhaps the oddest venue is Big Top learndirect, which moves around Birmingham with the Robert Wilkinson's travelling funfair. \"It's sandwiched between the dodgems and the shooting arcade,\" says Wright. So far 36,000 people have registered and 77,000 courses have been completed. These have ranged from a one-hour session on time management to programmes of more than 300 hours. Ufi's other important arms are its website - www.learndirect.co.uk - and the learndirect helpline which has taken more than two million calls in two years.",

So allow plenty of reading time. \u0095 Organise your time efficiently. Prepare a weekly timetable (including reading and written assignments as well as lectures and seminars). This way you will at least feel that you know what you are doing. \u0095 Remember: you are doing this because you want to, not because you have to. So enjoy it. \u0095 David Marsh is news production editor of the Guardian.",

      "body": "<p>Peer into the playground at Rowlatts Hill Primary in Leicester this week, and you'll see lots of new play equipment. If it's break-time, you may also notice the children munching apples in place of biscuits. The changes are just two of the school's latest improvements: but they haven't come from the staff, or even the parents. At the 300-pupil school, it's the kids who are in the hotseat when it comes to making the place better. </p> <p>They haven't got carte blanche on everything, of course (although I have it on the highest authority - one of them - that curriculum worries are next in line for consideration). What it's all about, says the head, Jonathan Evans, is taking children's views seriously via an elected school council. </p> <p>Pupil democracy isn't exactly new - look at Summerhill School, the Suffolk independent school that trail-blazed it decades ago - but it is edging up the agenda, and there's some evidence that the Department for Education and Employment may be about to take it more seriously. Peter Facey, chief executive at the British Youth Council, is in discussion with the department about funding for a body to bring together pupil councils nationwide. \"What we're talking to the government about is the fact that, with voting figures on the decline, introducing pupil councils into schools may be one important way of giving young people enthusiasm for participating in the political process,\" he says. </p> <p>The recent, and much-publicised, report into multi-ethnic Britain provided more evidence of a renewed interest in \"pupil power\". The report, which expressed grave concerns about the treatment of ethnic minorities in schools, praised as most successful those schools it dubbed \"listening schools\" - such schools, it said, \"took time to talk with students ... and took seriously the views students and parents offered ...\" Schools that took pupils' views seriously, it concluded, were less likely to need to use exclusion as a sanction, and were more likely to have staff and strategies in place to deal with tensions. </p> <p>Around 50% of secondary schools and 25% of primaries already have a council - although not all are as effective as Rowlatts Hill in giving youngsters a real say. Facey says: \"I've known schools that let the children debate litter control in the playground, and that's about it. But that sort of thing will only increase their cynicism - they've got to feel they are being listened to, and that their views are making a difference.\" </p> <p>Somehow the idea of school councils seems oddly out of step with the flavour of education in Britain today. We're all aware of the current of authoritarianism at the heart of the government's reforms: sitting in rows and getting back to basics on the three Rs doesn't seem to fit with giving youngsters the right to speak out about things they don't like, still less to actually change them. </p> <p>So what's going on? Why is it that pupil councils are a feature of life in an increasing number of schools, and are increasingly effective? Partly, perhaps, it's a backlash against the authoritarianism of the reforms themselves: partly, it's about a general extension of children's rights, particularly in the western world. But partly, too, it's a response to what might seem like a minor reform planned for our schools in 2002, when citizenship becomes a mandatory subject for secondary school pupils and an optional extra for primaries. After all, say the proponents of school councils, if we're teaching our children about rights, participation and democracy, surely there could be no better way than by putting the whole notion into practice in their most immediate community? </p> <p>Derry Hannam, a teacher for more than 20 years and now an educational consultant and adviser to the DfEE, is convinced that pupil power is vitally important. \"Children have a right to be heard, although that's never been a particularly prominent or acceptable position to take in this country,\" he says. Indeed, one only has to look at the treatment meted out to Summerhill to see quite how unpopular this trend has been in Britain: the tabloid press seems obsessed with the idea of kids ruling the roost and making a hash of things. </p> <p>In fact, says Hannam, the very reverse would seem to be the case. \"School councils are actually a very effective way to improve things,\" he says. \"Children know a lot about what's working in a school, as well as what's going on generally.\" When it comes to change, kids are often a lot wiser than a lot of grown-ups might think - take that decision to ban biscuits in favour of apples, for example. </p> <p>What's more, says Hannam, \"Giving children a voice raises their self-esteem and self-image as learners, which in turn enhances attainment.\" </p> <p>Then there's that curriculum change to include citizenship. \"There are some things that can only be learned through participation, and that includes democracy,\" says Hannam. \"One of the main ideas behind the addition of citizenship to the curriculum is that children should develop participation skills and learn how to act as citizens, and you can only develop these by participating and taking action. There's a mountain of research that shows you can't just lecture about democracy: it's simply in one ear and out the other.\" </p> <p>Not so at Cotham School in Bristol, where the student council has been in place for three years since the appointment of the head, James Wetz, another firm believer in pupil democracy. Cotham is an 11-18 co-educational school with 1,240 pupils on its roll: the council is made up of 100 councillors representing each tutor group in the school. </p> <p>The council is chaired by two sixth-formers, and two of its members are observers on the governing body, where they have a voice if not a vote. They can listen to most business though they have to withdraw before confidential issues are raised. Council meetings are held every five weeks, and aren't seen at Cotham as an optional extra: they're held in lesson-time, important enough for the pupil-councillors to miss a class. </p> <p>Council members also sit on five action teams, which cover the school's catering, facilities, environment, equal rights and charity work. Each team has the support of a teacher, and secretarial and organisational back-up is provided by a parent volunteer. Wetz attends council meetings and hears all the debate and decisions: at a recent meeting, he says, he was struck by a child's remark that \"in the hands of the few, power corrupts\". </p> <p>Like Rowlatts Hill, Cotham has been changed by its student council: it had a role, for example, in awarding the school's catering contract, and Wetz was impressed at how seriously the children took the task of visiting another school to see the would-be caterer in action, and how closely they vetted the contract. Fears that power devolved to children is power unappreciated seem groundless: if anything, kids seem to take decisions more seriously. </p> <p>On the whole, says Wetz, the council has been widely admired and welcomed, and there have been few criticisms - just one or two from parents concerned at children missing lessons for council meetings. He makes no apologies for this: to be given its proper importance, attendance at a democratic gathering must take priority over other work for its members. </p> <p>The years of the council's existence have coincided with a steady and significant climb in the school's academic results, and Wetz describes its latest GCSE and key stage 3 results as excellent. There are a few things he's not entirely happy about - wider participation in the council by other pupils, and children's frustration at not being able to change things overnight - but in general pupil democracy at Cotham works well. </p> <p>Indeed, if it doesn't work well, schools could be doing their pupils more harm than good. According to Hannam, there's nothing quite so guaranteed to lead to cynicism about democracy than a pupil council that's not taken seriously, or which doesn't genuinely allow students' views to make a difference. And with citizenship about to appear on the curriculum, that would seem to be an indefensible mistake for any school to be making. </p> <p> <strong>What the pupils think: </strong><br></p> <p><strong> Rowlatts Hill Primary </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Elise Blockley, 8</strong> </p> <p>It's been fun looking at the brochures to see what we'd like to have in the playground. We thought the playground could be better, and now it is. </p> <p><strong> Hogan Smith, nearly 9</strong> </p> <p>After a meeting everyone asks you what you talked about, and what's going to happen next. </p> <p><strong> Zara Ervice, 9</strong> </p> <p>I think it's important for children to have a say because they have good ideas. We used to get bored in the playground. We don't now. </p> <p><strong> Roshni Odedra, 10</strong> </p> <p>When the school raises money for charity, we decide who to give it to. More schools should ask children what they think.<br></p> <p> <strong> Cotham School </strong> </p> <p><strong>Alex Parsons, 16</strong> </p> <p>I've seen our council develop from a disorganised rabble to a body that can debate issues affecting us in an organised and serious way - I'm proud to have been involved in that. </p> <p><strong> Terry Shiimi, 15</strong> </p> <p>I think it makes a difference to all pupils, not just the outgoing ones, because even quieter people can have a word with the representatives, and get the issues they care about discussed. </p> <p><strong> Jess McCormack, 15</strong> </p> <p>I'm part of the equal rights action team and we're organising a big display about where we all come from to make everyone more aware of our diversity and different backgrounds. </p> <p> \u0095 Schools council information website: <a href=\"http://www.schoolcouncils.org\">www.schoolcouncils.org</a></p>",

We're all aware of the current of authoritarianism at the heart of the government's reforms: sitting in rows and getting back to basics on the three Rs doesn't seem to fit with giving youngsters the right to speak out about things they don't like, still less to actually change them. So what's going on? Why is it that pupil councils are a feature of life in an increasing number of schools, and are increasingly effective? Partly, perhaps, it's a backlash against the authoritarianism of the reforms themselves: partly, it's about a general extension of children's rights, particularly in the western world. But partly, too, it's a response to what might seem like a minor reform planned for our schools in 2002, when citizenship becomes a mandatory subject for secondary school pupils and an optional extra for primaries. After all, say the proponents of school councils, if we're teaching our children about rights, participation and democracy, surely there could be no better way than by putting the whole notion into practice in their most immediate community? Derry Hannam, a teacher for more than 20 years and now an educational consultant and adviser to the DfEE, is convinced that pupil power is vitally important. \"Children have a right to be heard, although that's never been a particularly prominent or acceptable position to take in this country,\" he says. Indeed, one only has to look at the treatment meted out to Summerhill to see quite how unpopular this trend has been in Britain: the tabloid press seems obsessed with the idea of kids ruling the roost and making a hash of things. In fact, says Hannam, the very reverse would seem to be the case. \"School councils are actually a very effective way to improve things,\" he says. \"Children know a lot about what's working in a school, as well as what's going on generally.\" When it comes to change, kids are often a lot wiser than a lot of grown-ups might think - take that decision to ban biscuits in favour of apples, for example. What's more, says Hannam, \"Giving children a voice raises their self-esteem and self-image as learners, which in turn enhances attainment.\" Then there's that curriculum change to include citizenship. \"There are some things that can only be learned through participation, and that includes democracy,\" says Hannam. \"One of the main ideas behind the addition of citizenship to the curriculum is that children should develop participation skills and learn how to act as citizens, and you can only develop these by participating and taking action. There's a mountain of research that shows you can't just lecture about democracy: it's simply in one ear and out the other.\" Not so at Cotham School in Bristol, where the student council has been in place for three years since the appointment of the head, James Wetz, another firm believer in pupil democracy. Cotham is an 11-18 co-educational school with 1,240 pupils on its roll: the council is made up of 100 councillors representing each tutor group in the school. The council is chaired by two sixth-formers, and two of its members are observers on the governing body, where they have a voice if not a vote. They can listen to most business though they have to withdraw before confidential issues are raised. Council meetings are held every five weeks, and aren't seen at Cotham as an optional extra: they're held in lesson-time, important enough for the pupil-councillors to miss a class. Council members also sit on five action teams, which cover the school's catering, facilities, environment, equal rights and charity work. Each team has the support of a teacher, and secretarial and organisational back-up is provided by a parent volunteer. Wetz attends council meetings and hears all the debate and decisions: at a recent meeting, he says, he was struck by a child's remark that \"in the hands of the few, power corrupts\". Like Rowlatts Hill, Cotham has been changed by its student council: it had a role, for example, in awarding the school's catering contract, and Wetz was impressed at how seriously the children took the task of visiting another school to see the would-be caterer in action, and how closely they vetted the contract. Fears that power devolved to children is power unappreciated seem groundless: if anything, kids seem to take decisions more seriously. On the whole, says Wetz, the council has been widely admired and welcomed, and there have been few criticisms - just one or two from parents concerned at children missing lessons for council meetings. He makes no apologies for this: to be given its proper importance, attendance at a democratic gathering must take priority over other work for its members. The years of the council's existence have coincided with a steady and significant climb in the school's academic results, and Wetz describes its latest GCSE and key stage 3 results as excellent. There are a few things he's not entirely happy about - wider participation in the council by other pupils, and children's frustration at not being able to change things overnight - but in general pupil democracy at Cotham works well. Indeed, if it doesn't work well, schools could be doing their pupils more harm than good. According to Hannam, there's nothing quite so guaranteed to lead to cynicism about democracy than a pupil council that's not taken seriously, or which doesn't genuinely allow students' views to make a difference. And with citizenship about to appear on the curriculum, that would seem to be an indefensible mistake for any school to be making. What the pupils think: Rowlatts Hill Primary Elise Blockley, 8 It's been fun looking at the brochures to see what we'd like to have in the playground. We thought the playground could be better, and now it is. Hogan Smith, nearly 9 After a meeting everyone asks you what you talked about, and what's going to happen next. Zara Ervice, 9 I think it's important for children to have a say because they have good ideas. We used to get bored in the playground. We don't now. Roshni Odedra, 10 When the school raises money for charity, we decide who to give it to. More schools should ask children what they think. Cotham School Alex Parsons, 16 I've seen our council develop from a disorganised rabble to a body that can debate issues affecting us in an organised and serious way - I'm proud to have been involved in that. Terry Shiimi, 15 I think it makes a difference to all pupils, not just the outgoing ones, because even quieter people can have a word with the representatives, and get the issues they care about discussed. Jess McCormack, 15 I'm part of the equal rights action team and we're organising a big display about where we all come from to make everyone more aware of our diversity and different backgrounds. \u0095 Schools council information website: www.schoolcouncils.org",

      "body": "<p>Last week's announcement that, from 2002, all five-year-olds would be set a compulsory test sparked a furore. Tabloid newspapers immediately offered parents (conflicting) advice on how to get their five-year-olds through the test, while parents' groups expressed concern about this additional pressure on children and dismissed it as \"yet another move towards selection\". </p> <p>So, should parents be worried - is this testing gone mad? The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), which made the announcement, was keen to reassure parents. They studiously avoided using the word \"test\", preferring the more neutral \"baseline assessment\", and emphasised that nothing was set in stone - a consultation process was under way that would include parents. </p> <p>The assessment of young children is, they added, nothing new. Children as young as four have been tested for 10 years. What is happening now is simply a rationalisation of the existing system. Under the new proposals, all schools will use the same assessment method (at present over 90 different schemes are in use) and all children will be tested at the same point in their school career - at the end of the recently introduced \"foundation stage\" of the national curriculum, when they are five (at present, children can be assessed at any time during their first year at school). </p> <p>On the ground, however, the worry feels real enough. Angus Pryor has a four-year-old who has just started school in Kent. His son, Hal, is to be assessed this term, and the school's description of the tests awaiting him provided little reassurance. </p> <p>\"It's only just dawned on me what the assessment is,\" said Angus. \"My concern is they are going to test in a very academic way. At the parents' evening where we were told about the assessment, I asked how Hal was doing creatively and socially. They had nothing to say on that. But we were told about the need to prepare even the youngest children for the 11-plus. It felt like our four-year-old was being set up for selection already. I don't really care if he can form a 'C' just yet; I simply want him to be happy.\" </p> <p>Other parents contacted by the Guardian shared Angus's concerns. \"I don't want him to be in an overly academic environment,\" says Iona Gibson, whose five-year-old son John started school in south London this term and is currently being assessed. </p> <p>\"There doesn't seem to be any singing or playing any more. It's all heads down now that John's left the nursery.\" Gibson admits that part of her concern is a lack of information . </p> <p>\"I don't know what he's doing, I don't know how much to worry.\" John doesn't appear to have been bothered by the assessments, she says, but, like a lot of parents of very young children, she feels left out of the information loop. \"Does this mean that they are going to stream my child?\" she asks. </p> <p>The answer is almost certainly no. Desk setting, where children work together in ability groups, does happen in primary schools, but not with the youngest children and not for all of the time. But it is hardly surprising that she is worried. </p> <p>\"'Test' is a very emotive term,\" says Pat Wills, who chairs Early Education, an organisation of educators who specialise in children of this age. Wills is also headteacher of Claremont Primary School in Blackpool. \"These aren't sit-down examinations, they're based on observation of what a child can do carried out over several days.\" </p> <p>And tots will not face a test in their first week in school as some of the tabloids alleged. \"The assessment will come at the end of the foundation stage,\" said Pat Wills, which for some children could be up to two years into school. Pat Wills is supportive of the proposed national system. It is good for the child, she insists, because now all children will have had at least one year's schooling before they are assessed. And the information will help teachers target their teaching. </p> <p>\"You can't work without some understanding of a child's stage of development,\" she says. \"High-flyers may be able to read at four, but some others will never have handled a book. Teachers need this knowledge.\" </p> <p>And it is also good news for schools, especially those in poorer areas. Baseline assessments are an essential part of the value-added measures that ministers hope will eventually replace league tables based on raw examination results. It is believed that many schools in leafy areas are \"coasting\", achieving good results - and good reputations - simply as a result of the background of their children, rather than from teaching excellence. For value-added information to be complete, some assessment needs to be made at the start of a child's school career. </p> <p>Claremont primary is unusual in having a leading early years specialist like Wills as a headteacher. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the school has gone to greater lengths than many to ensure the foundation stage curriculum and baseline assessments work well. It restructured the early years setting ready for the new foundation curriculum this September, with three classrooms for the youngest children and new staff to support the teaching. </p> <p>\"We've had the national curriculum for 10 years,\" says Wills. \"But there's always been a grey area about when it started. The foundation stage clarifies that they don't start until year 1, giving over a year of school time without things like the literacy hour to pressure the children's day.\" </p> <p>Claremont's three classrooms are full of toys, books and games, but each focuses on different aspects of learning. Some parents are concerned that children aren't moving onto \"proper learning\", but the school firmly believes that structured play is the best learning environment for the four- and five-year-old. </p> <p>A key factor in its success are the two nursery nurses attached to each classroom. \"Here we have a staff:pupil ratio of 1:12,\" says Wills. The extra staff make the observation and monitoring involved in the new baseline tests easier to manage, but Claremont's nursery nurses have not been funded from additional government money. Wills claims that there has been no central government support. </p> <p>\"Absolutely no money whatsoever,\" she says. \"We've had good training from the local education authority, but we've had the find the money for our nursery nurses from our own resources.\" </p> <p>Yet early years is the one area where research has shown clear benefits from smaller classes. A study by London's Institute of Education published this year revealed impressive learning gains for five-year-olds taught in smaller classes. </p> <p>Wills would like to see more money pumped into provision for the youngest children along with a drive to inform parents about the changes. \"Some parents are desperate for their child to begin reading from day one,\" she said. Others are concerned about an early academic diet. </p> <p>But an equal concern is the question of how many schools will follow Claremont's example. The Blackpool primary is a very large school where economies of scale allow the kind of staffing that many rural schools would find too costly. Few heads are early years specialists and there may well be pressure on reception class teachers to implement the kind of academic regime that worries many parents. Will schools be able to run the new tests in the unobtrusive, diagnostic way that Wills argues should be the norm? </p> <p>Iona Gibson has just one priority: \"I just think that play is so important,\" she says. \"That and the opportunity for him to settle into the school environment and enjoy himself.\" </p> <p> <strong>What a five-year-old should be able to do</strong><br></p> <p> This is not a 'test' with right and wrong answers, but a way of assessing each child's development in a number of areas - from basic to more advanced understanding. <br> </p> <p><strong> Reading</strong> Basic level: do they hold a book correctly and understand about turning pages?

They can offer no help to students wrestling with subject-specific difficulties. For this reason, they are paid considerably less than teachers. The article makes clear that when on hand, teachers are restricted to \"short explanations\". Why? What happens if this provision is inadequate? It is no accident that the South East Essex managers take every opportunity to denigrate and caricature teachers and activity in the classroom. They invite us to collude with them in welcoming the extinction of such dinosaurs. They ask us to collude with them in undermining provision for students. So - using the shopping centre model, my advice is \"caveat emptor\" - let the buyer beware. The larger the amount of time spent in independent learning centres, especially in the early days of a student's course, the more suspicious the users of the institution should be. Parents and employers should expect clear answers to the following questions; \u0095 How many hours contact per week will a student have with subject specialists and are they part- or full-time employees? \u0095 What is the ratio of taught hours to independent learning hours ? \u0095 How is the independent learning monitored, supported and evaluated? \u0095 What are the qualifications and responsibilities of learning advisers? \u0095 How easy is it for students to obtain subject-specific help while in the centre? Ask -and you may be able to see what, if anything, is under the fur coat. \u0095 Jean Simmonds retired from teaching in further education three years ago.",

      "bodyText": "English football lurched further into crisis yesterday with the revelation that the Football Association's chief executive, Adam Crozier, may be head-hunted by Celtic. As Crozier was preparing to set in motion the process he hopes will produce a suitable replacement for Kevin Keegan as England coach, the Glasgow club was placing him on a short list of contenders for the role of chief executive at Celtic Park. At least two influential figures on the Celtic board regard Crozier as the man best qualified to succeed the club's current chief executive Allan MacDonald, who recently tendered his resignation. Significantly, and worryingly for the FA, the 35-year-old Crozier is a life-long Celtic supporter and has never tried to conceal his affection for a club he describes as \"the love of my life\". If Crozier was to swap adopted country for boyhood obsession he would certainly benefit financially. It is believed he currently earns around \u00a3300,000 a year, a figure that would rise at least 25% were he to return to Scotland. The prospect of losing Crozier 10 months after he succeeded Graham Kelly will horrify those members of the FA hierarchy who see him as suitably equipped to stream-line and modernise an organisation that has been widely criticised for its bureaucratic inertia and poor public relations. Ironically, in his haste to dispel the notion that the FA is awash with elderly administrators reluctant to give up the reins of power, Crozier may have placed himself at odds with those he serves. In the aftermath of England's drawn World Cup qualifier in Finland earlier this month Crozier announced that he was responsible for appointing Keegan's successor. However, within 24 hours he was forced to concede that the selection process would be undertaken by a committee made up of Lancaster Gate veterans and club chairmen. It is, however, extremely unlikely that Crozier would end his tenure at the FA without first completing the search for a new England coach. There was more confusion surrounding England yesterday when it emerged that Roy Hodgson may not be the third man on the FA's short list. Informed sources distanced themselves from speculation that Hodgson is one of the three, while Fleming Ostergaard, a director of FC Copenhagen, whom Hodgson now manages, revealed they had heard nothing from the FA about an approach. It is understood that the FA has already contacted Lazio to sound out the availability of their coach Sven Goran Eriksson, who is thought to be on the short list. Arsenal have already said they would not object to an approach for their manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, confident in the knowledge that he would say no. The possible emergence of a mystery third candidate only adds to the growing sense of uncertainty surrounding the appointment. When asked about the England job on Friday, Eriksson was quoted as saying: \"I certainly wouldn't put money on myself.\" He added: \"Working as a national manager is out of the question.\" With Wenger insisting he will see out his contract at Arsenal until 2002, the FA could be forced to turn to its third candidate if it is to meet its self-imposed deadline of announcing an appointment by Christmas. With Terry Venables seemingly ruled out, and G\u00e9rard Houllier and Martin O'Neill unwilling to leave their jobs at Liverpool and Celtic respectively, possible names include John Gregory, Marcello Lippi and Fabio Capello - unless the FA has someone else up its sleeve. England's caretaker manager Peter Taylor has named Hodgson or Venables as his preferred choices.",

Since then, government funding of student tuition has declined annually from around 85% to around 72% of full costs.
