      "body": "<p>\"Field of Dreams\" all right - and this week will be full of old men vying to relive its most precious moments. But when the football teams of England and Germany finish their business at Wembley around Saturday teatime the most heartfelt and realistic applause will surely be for the first bulldozer moving in to put out of its misery a location which has long become, quite frankly, a nightmare. </p> <p>England's long-presumed (in fact, commercially owned) \"national stadium\" has dreamily retained its garlanded and romantic resonance around the country and the whole world despite, in practical terms, the most glaring, even humbling, evidence to the contrary. It has long been a crumbling, depressing dump, an unkempt ancient monument gone to seed. Its dingy corridors and dreadful, cul-de-sac staircases are as soul-destroying as its primitive and overflowing urinals; the interrupted sightlines from many of its exorbitantly priced seats are as wonkily infuriating as the traffic infrastructure all around and to and from it. </p> <p>In fairness, especially in most recent times, its owners have tried their darnedest with heavy spending to invest some life and logic into the decaying corpse, but as the author-architect Simon Inglis says in his classic Football Grounds of Great Britain, \"like a patched-up old jalopy which struggles to pass its annual MoT, Wembley has reached the point at which any further expenditure would be money poured down its drains\". </p> <p>And so, mercifully, it has come to pass. The demolition men move in, and the trademark twin towers are due to be dismantled and transported (at \u00a33m cost) to the proposed new Museum of Rugby League alongside the Runcorn Bridge at Widnes. </p> <p>And quite right, too. Because the indisputable truth is that Wembley is, and always shall remain, a venerable shrine, the backpages' veritable Colosseum, its Parthenon, one of all sports' wonders of the world. </p> <p>So it is, with next week's explosive demolition fuse already well on fire and fizzing, that all this final week are veterans of the public prints - like this one - and croaking, greybeard broadcasters being wheeled out and asked for their favourite recollections of best matches and moments, of goals and tries joyously scored, or agilely saved, of breathless races run and won and lost ... and indelibly cemented in the lore and legend. And shall be so for ever and ever, amen ... </p> <p>So rich and long has been the litany of men and moments since some 200,000 and a single white horse attended Wembley's first football Cup final 77 years ago, that such lists have to be broken up into at least three sections - those witnessed in real life, those seen or heard secondhand through live broadcasting, and those immoveably glued into the lore by fathers, uncles, grandfathers or the permanent legend of history. </p> <p>For instance, off the top of my head, I would say the top 10 best goals I actually witnessed were those scored by, Bobby Charlton for England v Portugal (1966), Geoff Hurst for England, his World Cup final third against Germany (1966), Rodney Marsh, for QPR against West Bromwich (1967), George Best, for Manchester United v Benfica (1968), Charlie George (Arsenal v Liverpool, 1971), Ricky Villa for Tottenham (1981), Norman Whiteside for Manchester United (1985), Keith Houchen for Coventry (1987), Paul Gascoigne for England (1996), and Stuart Pearce's atoning penalty for England, also in 1996. </p> <p>But not one of those actually witnessed, I am well aware can remotely match a handful I did not see. For instance, vividly I can remember still my puny spine being riddled with the sheer and utter palpitating excitement of it, my ear bent to our bakelite wireless set far away in the west, when Raymond Glendenning, he of the soupstrainer moustache and the brown-windsor tones, shrieked \"Stamps has scored! Stamps has scored!\" in the first post-second world war Cup final and the first one ever to enter my consciousness. That was for Derby County - and the following springtime it was for Charlton Athletic and, if anything even more dramatically, \"Duffy has scored! Duffy has scored!\" (True-great old Raymond always trusted his script's original folio). </p> <p>Six years later, and by now fuzzy grey blobs on a monochrome 12-inch screen, and it was Glendenning again - and I can still recite his crescendo of a 1953 curtain-call - \"Taylor to Matthews on the right ... Matthews beats one man, beats two ... moves in ... he centres ... it's Perry ... Perry has scored! Perry has scored!\" And only this year in Blackpool, I asked old Bill Perry about it: \"I remember like it was yesterday. Stan slipped slightly as he centred it, so Morty overran it, and it was left to me, loitering, to bang it through the scrum of Bolton players.\" Just like that. </p> <p>That remains, for me anyway, Wembley's most resonant domestic goal. Best foreign one - and again not actually witnessed but just seeped in the aspic of legend - was probably the third of Hungary's six that same 1953, scored by Ferenc Puskas, bamboozling England's captain Billy Wright by dragging the ball back with the sole of his left boot before, with a pirouette and the same famous left foot, smashing it into the roof of the net. It made Wright's frenziedly charging thin-air tackle, wrote Geoffrey Green in the Times, \"resemble a fire engine rushing to the wrong fire\". </p> <p>But Wembley is not only football, not by any means. It staged the Olympic Games in 1948 when the flying Dutchwoman Fanny Blankers-Koen, 30 years old, housewife and mother of two, ran away with four golds on the track. Belle Vue, Manchester, may have brought greyhound racing to Britain for the first time in 1926. But Wembley made it famous at once when it let loose at the hare the legendary Mick the Miller. Some nights in the 1920s and early '30s, up to 60,000 would turn up to see the brindle Mick and Co run. Speedway as well will be reliving its legendary moments when the walls of Wembley begin crashing down next week. Be careful, for the chunks of old concrete will be falling on dreams. </p> <p>Rugby league, too. Don Fox's muffed sitter - \"Ee, poor lad\": Eddie Waring - will never get buried in the rubble. Nor will the grandeur of Jonathan Davies's long curving score; nor the \"Watersplash\" final, nor the 1985 Wigan v Hull challenge final, choreographed magically by Brett Kenny and Peter Sterling, which remains the finest game of rugby, of either code, I have ever been privileged to see. </p> <p>So much more ... at rugby union, Scott Gibbs of Wales making last-minute monkeys of the haughty English a couple of years back ... tales of Scotland's \"Wembley Wizards\" of 1928, or Jimmy Cowan's goalkeeping in 1949 ... I saw Jim Baxter standing on the ball and taunting England in 1967 ... and Norman Hunter's missed tackle, plus Jan Tomaszewski's saves ... not to mention Alex Stepney's against Eusebio . . . and Jim Montgomery's save . . . </p> <p>Dammit, Britain first met Muhammad Ali at Wembley - when the then young Cassius got dumped on his butt by our Henry before recovering to rip Cooper's eyebrow to shreds. That was two years before my first actual working visit. I had a new job as a tyro producer with ITV. It was October 1965 and, pre-World Cup, England disastrously lost 2-3 to Hungary. </p> <p>To sign off, I cued good Gerry Loftus our commentator, in vision, to wrap up the home tale of woe for England's new manager with something pithy and scathing about the hapless team. So Gerry looked the nation in the eye and plonkingly pronounced - \"Alf Ramsey must certainly get out his chopper tonight.\" Fade to black and titles - and, with the country on a roar of mirth, I reckon both Gerry and I were lucky ever to work again at Wembley.

      "body": "<p>Howard Barker is the great anatomist of the British theatre. He does not dissect the state of the nation but the state of our heart and souls. Often it hurts. The company dedicated to staging his work is not called The Wrestling School for nothing. His latest play, his first full-length new play to be staged in Britain for three years, is as knotty as anything he has written. </p> <p>The guts of it are this: Doja, an anatomist whose reputation for embalming dead monarchs is second to none, is summoned by an obscure kingdom where the king is on his death bed. But no sooner has Doja put the first incision into the body than he is besieged by the queen, the young prince and others in the kingdom who all want to seduce him. He senses that he is in extreme danger but is powerless to escape and avoid his doom. He is forced to collude in his own assassination. </p> <p>The play takes the form of an intricate intellectual thriller that only unravels for the audience as the net tightens around Doja.

      "bodyText": "Howard Barker is the great anatomist of the British theatre. He does not dissect the state of the nation but the state of our heart and souls. Often it hurts. The company dedicated to staging his work is not called The Wrestling School for nothing. His latest play, his first full-length new play to be staged in Britain for three years, is as knotty as anything he has written. The guts of it are this: Doja, an anatomist whose reputation for embalming dead monarchs is second to none, is summoned by an obscure kingdom where the king is on his death bed. But no sooner has Doja put the first incision into the body than he is besieged by the queen, the young prince and others in the kingdom who all want to seduce him. He senses that he is in extreme danger but is powerless to escape and avoid his doom. He is forced to collude in his own assassination. The play takes the form of an intricate intellectual thriller that only unravels for the audience as the net tightens around Doja. Like many of Barker's plays, He Stumbled is about the slippery relationship between truth and lies and our taste for deception. Even the thriller-like form of the play plays on and panders to the audience' s love of a secret, the thought that we might be discovering something unknown, even unknowable. With its corrugated iron set in which shutters snap open and close, we are like voyeurs at a pornographic peepshow.

This is classic Barker territory and he approaches it here with customary wit and poetic intensity. The acting is crystal, almost frighteningly so.

      "body": "<p>England's only warm-up match before they begin their assault on the ICC Knockout Trophy ended in a tie against Australia here yesterday, but the sense of drama and excitement was lost on Ashley Giles. He felt only pain in his leg and a terrible sinking feeling in his stomach. </p> <p>Giles, the Warwickshire left-arm spinner, managed just five deliveries before leaving the field with a strained left calf. He experienced a couple of twinges at the start of his over and then, as he walked towards his team-mates to celebrate holding a return catch to dismiss Michael Bevan, the pain became extreme. </p> <p>The England physiotherapist Dean Conway immediately applied ice and Giles was dispatched to the team hotel with his leg heavily strapped. He can count himself a seriously unlucky man and must wonder whether he will ever play more than the occasional match for his country. </p> <p>Giles has been selected for 34 England one-day international squads, but has made the starting line-up only five times. He is unlikely to play in England's first game against Bangladesh tomorrow and is considered doubtful for the entire two-week tournament. </p> <p>If the injury turns out to be serious, Giles would be replaced by Robert Croft, the official spin-bowling cover who publicly and angrily contemplated never playing for England again after missing selection for this winter's tours. </p> <p>Despite their problems, the coach Duncan Fletcher says he cannot remember a squad more prepared to work hard - England have been undertaking regular 5-hour sessions. But they needed a competitive outing and that, even in a practice game, was exactly what they got against the world one-day champions.

      "bodyText": "England's only warm-up match before they begin their assault on the ICC Knockout Trophy ended in a tie against Australia here yesterday, but the sense of drama and excitement was lost on Ashley Giles. He felt only pain in his leg and a terrible sinking feeling in his stomach. Giles, the Warwickshire left-arm spinner, managed just five deliveries before leaving the field with a strained left calf. He experienced a couple of twinges at the start of his over and then, as he walked towards his team-mates to celebrate holding a return catch to dismiss Michael Bevan, the pain became extreme. The England physiotherapist Dean Conway immediately applied ice and Giles was dispatched to the team hotel with his leg heavily strapped. He can count himself a seriously unlucky man and must wonder whether he will ever play more than the occasional match for his country. Giles has been selected for 34 England one-day international squads, but has made the starting line-up only five times. He is unlikely to play in England's first game against Bangladesh tomorrow and is considered doubtful for the entire two-week tournament. If the injury turns out to be serious, Giles would be replaced by Robert Croft, the official spin-bowling cover who publicly and angrily contemplated never playing for England again after missing selection for this winter's tours. Despite their problems, the coach Duncan Fletcher says he cannot remember a squad more prepared to work hard - England have been undertaking regular 5-hour sessions. But they needed a competitive outing and that, even in a practice game, was exactly what they got against the world one-day champions. England bowled well and, until a late stutter, batted consistently, although Glenn McGrath was rested and Shane Warne was missing with injury. Damien Martyn made 70 and Mark Waugh a half-century from 39 balls before he retired. Andrew Caddick and Craig White each collected a couple of wickets and England's out-cricket was generally impressive on a rough outfield. Each of the 14 squad members was allowed to play some part and the main batsmen all made starts. Alec Stewart's 38 was the highest but Nasser Hussain's 21, which hinted at a return to form, was the most gratifying. England needed five from the final over but Mark Alleyne was adjudged leg-before and Caddick, attempting the winning hit, was spectacularly caught at square-leg by Brett Lee. \"I think most of the players benefited from missing the last couple of championship matches,\" Fletcher said afterwards. \"It means they are fresh.\" Australia 236-9 (DR Martyn 70, SR Waugh 50; Caddick 2-19). England 236 (AJ Stewart 38; Symonds 3-16, Lee 3-51). Match tied.",

He lived in an average semi-detached house in the small town of Thorne on the outskirts of Doncaster and, to his neighbours and his workmates, was a pretty normal bloke living a pretty unremarkable life. </p> <p>Then he was sacked for taking time off work without permission, something he vehemently denied. His world collapsed around him. He had spent 10 very content years driving his van round the leafy South Yorkshire lanes of Thorne, catching rats and destroying wasps' nests, passing the time of day with the locals and loving every minute of it. Suddenly, it was all taken from him. Over the next few years, Doncaster council was to rue the day it sent Williams packing. </p> <p>Last month, a high court judge was asked to stop Doncaster council going ahead with the closure of two residential homes for elderly people. While it is not uncommon these days for local authorities to face such legal action, what was unusual about this legal move was that it was instigated - and paid for - by a councillor from the local authority itself. That councillor was Williams. </p> <p>In the six years since he lost his job, the one-time local rat man has become a thorn in the side of Doncaster council. When he heard that residents' relatives were opposed to the homes' closure, he immediately instructed his barristers to ask the high court for permission for the case to go to judicial review. In the end, the application was refused. It cost Williams a few thousand pounds, but he was quite prepared to spend the \u00a340,000 he estimates it would have cost if the case had gone ahead and he had lost. </p> <p>He can easily afford it. When he appeared before an industrial tribunal in 1995 in an unsuccessful bid to claim unfair dismissal, it was revealed that this humble rat man was a rich rat man indeed. He was part-heir to a family fortune worth more than \u00a311m and had been brought up in historic Brodsworth Hall, now a jewel in the crown of English Heritage. He was dubbed the millionaire rat catcher. </p> <p>It ought to have been obvious to his bosses and his workmates that something was different about Williams. He refused to wear the standard boiler suit the council had provided for him. Instead, he had a pair of overalls made-to-measure with his name sewn in gold thread on the breast pocket. On his head, he wore a top-quality deerstalker. </p> <p>Unluckily for certain Doncaster councillors, at the same time that the authority sacked Williams they also gave notice to an environmental health officer, Peter Gumsley, and the two men became friends with a common bond - to get their own back. Gumsley claimed he had been dismissed on trumped-up allegations of time off without permission because he had refused to go along with what he felt were corrupt practices in his department. </p> <p>Williams seized on this and soon the district auditor had a pile of papers on his desk, containing serious allegations against councillors and officers by the former environmental health officer. Williams and Gumsley firmly believe that this was the birth of \"Donnygate\", the ongoing scandal of corruption at Doncaster council that has seen 13 councillors found guilty of fraud - five of whom have been jailed - with, perhaps, more to come. </p> <p>Still seething, Williams then set up his own pest control business and began to take customers off the local authority. Two years ago, not satisfied that the council was by then under the national spotlight and becoming a byword for corruption, he decided he would help fill the void left in the council chamber as a succession of Labour councillors resigned in disgrace. Standing for election in Thorne, he won. Last year, his wife, Carol, joined him. And the two of them have been causing havoc since. </p> <p>As well as the residential homes issue, a row is raging over the council's attempts to close sixth forms in some schools - one of which is in Thorne. Residents are mobilising for a long fight and, predictably, the Williamses are in the forefront of the battle. </p> <p>Locals cannot remember when there has been so much dissatisfaction with their local authority and are demanding change. Some have turned their anger on Thorne-Moorends town council, which they claim simply pays lip service to big brother Doncaster. They are demanding what is known as a \"parish poll\" - a referendum on whether the town council should be abolished. Williams has declared his readiness to dip into his pocket again if legal action is required to force such a vote. </p> <p>It need never have been like this. \"I was very happy to be a rat man,\" says Williams, 49. \"I did it for 10 years and loved it. Then I got sacked for something I didn't do and my world collapsed. I have a debt of gratitude to pay to the people of my area who have given me back my self-respect.

Slowly, I read aloud the brief sentence at the top of one page: \"To within isomorphisms, there are two groups of order: the cyclic group C4 and Klein's 4-group.\" Nothing. No bell rang, however distant. The strings of words and characters might have been lifted straight from the Dead Sea scrolls for all they meant to me. </p> <p>I knew without having to check the cover that the dog-eared exercise book that emerged from the bottom of a packing crate during a recent house move was filled with my A-level maths notes. I remember how I had decided at the time that compressing my handwriting to the verge of requiring a magnifying glass would somehow help to impose clarity on my disordered mind, make it more mathematical. But nothing else seemed familiar. I flicked through pages devoted to Lagrange's Theorem and inverse hyperbolic functions and Argand diagrams but nothing came. Years of high-quality education seemed to have passed through my cortex as smoothly as a pint of lager slips through the digestive tract on a hot summer's day. </p> <p>I was reminded of this mildly depressing episode when a new study yesterday called for an end to compulsory maths education in secondary schools. Steve Bramall, a London University lecturer in the philosphy of education, argued that the subject is \"a restricted and limited means of describing and communicating about the world\". He suggested that studying sociolology - \"a subject expressly committed to developing in pupils an awareness and appreciation of the contexts of moral and political action\" - might be more useful. \"Higher mathematical knowledge and competence is not needed by the majority of the populace to ensure the economic success of modern industrialised society,\" chimed his co-author, Paul Ernest, himself a professor of mathematical education, no less. </p> <p>My first reaction, like that of anyone else who has spent precious teenage hours poring over the Newton Raphson Iteration, was mild outrage. What about all those studies showing Britain to be embarrassingly innumerate? What about the demands of a world increasingly dominated by science? What about Carol Vorderman? </p> <p>The trouble, of course, is that without being able to summon a single meaningful scrap from two years of maths education (strangely the O-level syllabus seems to have stuck) it is quite hard to marshal a defence for Gauss's Queen of Sciences. I wracked my brains for examples of how my maths had come in useful in later life. There had been a vague glimmer of recognition when Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein published their ugly pseudo-scientific tract, The Bell Curve - I had once spent hours producing similar graphs, though usually plotting the thickness of washers produced by a screw factory rather than the IQs of ethnic groups. Then there was the night a heated argument with my wife about a principle of sailing (we were both beginners) ended with me furiously scribbling vector diagrams on a paper napkin to prove my point. I will save her writing in by admitting now that I ended my demonstration with the declaration: \"I've got two maths A-levels and a physics S-level so I can't believe you're still arguing with me about this.\" On our next sortie I insisted on proving my point and was promptly catapulted into the water. </p> <p>On the face of it this seems a pretty poor return on years of hard work. I still know enough maths to calculate that I must have spent more than 1,000 hours studying the subject at A-level alone, at least half as much again if you include my whole time at secondary school. It's hard not to wonder whether that time might have been more usefully employed reading Shakespeare, or learning Farsi or just doing unpleasant teenage things that I might conceivably have been able to remember 20 years later. </p> <p>But the truth is that my memories of grappling with the Wilcoxin test and Kendall's co-efficient - though I could not now tell you a single thing about them - are by far the fondest of my school career. I can still feel the thrilling sensation of stumbling into some secret and distant country as our gnomic teacher Dr Solomon (I don't think he had a first name) introduced us to numbers that did not exist or multi-dimensional space. The inaccessibility of much of the subject matter only added to its appeal; I could always read a novel or learn a language in later life, I reasoned, but friends studying English and French would never know the delights of an inverse hyperbolic function. </p> <p>Until sex came along there wasn't much to rival the satisfaction to be got from producing a crisp proof. I couldn't have made head or tale of a line of it but when Princeton mathematician Andrew Wiles later told me about the \"feeling of naturalness and elegance\" of his historic proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, I understood exactly what he was talking about. Wiles compared the process of edging towards a proof to making your way through a large house in darkness. \"You work your way around the room and you begin to feel objects here and there and suddenly the light goes on and you can see everything clearly.\" For a moment I wished I had pressed a little further into his house of numbers. </p> <p>As it was, I never got past Dr Solomon's introductory tour and it wasn't long before I found myself wondering whether all those hours of labouring over equations were well spent. At 3am on the day I was supposed to deliver my first university essay I found myself staring at a blank sheet of paper in a state of blind panic: I didn't have the faintest idea how to write an essay; in two years of studying maths and physics I hadn't been required to produce one. </p> <p>The stock defence of maths, like Latin, is that it teaches structured and disciplined ways of thinking, but I'm not convinced. At least at school level, maths is all about hard, clean answers, the certainty that a solution is out there to be found. By and large, though, the world isn't like that; it is about arguments and choices and complex, messy decisions. Even the most exciting areas of science in the past 20 years have been in the relatively \"messy\" fields of biology and quantum physics. These areas may rely as heavily on high-level maths as any other but a high school grasp on the subject won't help much to get your head around them - philosophy might be more useful. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I'm glad to report that my efforts to recall a single useful fact from my mathematical education did throw up one tantalising nugget: if you take a deep breath while reading this there is a better than 99 per cent chance that you will inhale a molecule of air which was exhaled by Julius Caesar in his dying breath. Don't ask me to prove it - I wouldn't know where to start - but I'm sure you'll agree it shows all those years weren't completely wasted.</p>",

He suggested that studying sociolology - \"a subject expressly committed to developing in pupils an awareness and appreciation of the contexts of moral and political action\" - might be more useful. \"Higher mathematical knowledge and competence is not needed by the majority of the populace to ensure the economic success of modern industrialised society,\" chimed his co-author, Paul Ernest, himself a professor of mathematical education, no less. My first reaction, like that of anyone else who has spent precious teenage hours poring over the Newton Raphson Iteration, was mild outrage. What about all those studies showing Britain to be embarrassingly innumerate? What about the demands of a world increasingly dominated by science? What about Carol Vorderman? The trouble, of course, is that without being able to summon a single meaningful scrap from two years of maths education (strangely the O-level syllabus seems to have stuck) it is quite hard to marshal a defence for Gauss's Queen of Sciences. I wracked my brains for examples of how my maths had come in useful in later life. There had been a vague glimmer of recognition when Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein published their ugly pseudo-scientific tract, The Bell Curve - I had once spent hours producing similar graphs, though usually plotting the thickness of washers produced by a screw factory rather than the IQs of ethnic groups. Then there was the night a heated argument with my wife about a principle of sailing (we were both beginners) ended with me furiously scribbling vector diagrams on a paper napkin to prove my point. I will save her writing in by admitting now that I ended my demonstration with the declaration: \"I've got two maths A-levels and a physics S-level so I can't believe you're still arguing with me about this.\" On our next sortie I insisted on proving my point and was promptly catapulted into the water. On the face of it this seems a pretty poor return on years of hard work. I still know enough maths to calculate that I must have spent more than 1,000 hours studying the subject at A-level alone, at least half as much again if you include my whole time at secondary school. It's hard not to wonder whether that time might have been more usefully employed reading Shakespeare, or learning Farsi or just doing unpleasant teenage things that I might conceivably have been able to remember 20 years later. But the truth is that my memories of grappling with the Wilcoxin test and Kendall's co-efficient - though I could not now tell you a single thing about them - are by far the fondest of my school career. I can still feel the thrilling sensation of stumbling into some secret and distant country as our gnomic teacher Dr Solomon (I don't think he had a first name) introduced us to numbers that did not exist or multi-dimensional space. The inaccessibility of much of the subject matter only added to its appeal; I could always read a novel or learn a language in later life, I reasoned, but friends studying English and French would never know the delights of an inverse hyperbolic function. Until sex came along there wasn't much to rival the satisfaction to be got from producing a crisp proof. I couldn't have made head or tale of a line of it but when Princeton mathematician Andrew Wiles later told me about the \"feeling of naturalness and elegance\" of his historic proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, I understood exactly what he was talking about. Wiles compared the process of edging towards a proof to making your way through a large house in darkness. \"You work your way around the room and you begin to feel objects here and there and suddenly the light goes on and you can see everything clearly.\" For a moment I wished I had pressed a little further into his house of numbers. As it was, I never got past Dr Solomon's introductory tour and it wasn't long before I found myself wondering whether all those hours of labouring over equations were well spent. At 3am on the day I was supposed to deliver my first university essay I found myself staring at a blank sheet of paper in a state of blind panic: I didn't have the faintest idea how to write an essay; in two years of studying maths and physics I hadn't been required to produce one. The stock defence of maths, like Latin, is that it teaches structured and disciplined ways of thinking, but I'm not convinced. At least at school level, maths is all about hard, clean answers, the certainty that a solution is out there to be found. By and large, though, the world isn't like that; it is about arguments and choices and complex, messy decisions. Even the most exciting areas of science in the past 20 years have been in the relatively \"messy\" fields of biology and quantum physics. These areas may rely as heavily on high-level maths as any other but a high school grasp on the subject won't help much to get your head around them - philosophy might be more useful. Meanwhile, I'm glad to report that my efforts to recall a single useful fact from my mathematical education did throw up one tantalising nugget: if you take a deep breath while reading this there is a better than 99 per cent chance that you will inhale a molecule of air which was exhaled by Julius Caesar in his dying breath. Don't ask me to prove it - I wouldn't know where to start - but I'm sure you'll agree it shows all those years weren't completely wasted.",

The confrontation came one day after the Milosevic government threatened \"special measures against leaders of strikes and road blockades\", which were launched this week to force the Yugoslav president to concede defeat to challenger Vojislav Kostunica in last month's elections. Police loyal to the embattled Serbian president also arrested several truck drivers today as they attempted to clear blockades by protesters on key roads. Near Pozarevac, Mr Milosevic's home town, 30 miles south of Belgrade, tensions grew after the arrest of the truckers whose vehicles were blocking the road. Dozens of people subsequently sat down on the pavement, strengthening the blockade. In Belgrade, where the civil disobedience campaign has been less noticeable than in smaller cities, there were signs that more people were joining the opposition campaign. Hundreds of stores were closed and city bus drivers and rubbish collectors stayed away from work, leaving overflowing bins scattered in the streets. The postal service announced a warning strike for later in the day, and by noon, the city centre was effectively put off limits to cars and other vehicles by thousands of pedestrians roaming the streets and blocking traffic. Fears are mounting that Mr Milosevic may resort to force to hold on to power, despite rising calls at home and abroad for him to step down in favour of Mr Kostunica. In an interview published in Moscow's Komersant daily, Mr Kostunica said he believed Mr Milosevic was preparing to resort to force. \"He experiences no moral dilemma or torments of the soul about that,\" Mr Kostunica said. \"However it is clear that he does not have enough force at present.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>TOWER POWER</strong></p> <p>You may or may not be aware that this Saturday sees the final ever ever event to be held at the grand old twin towers of the national stadium of the home of football before it's knocked down to give birth to a spanking new Wembley stadium. The event is, of course, the titanic clash between the Teutonic titans of Germany and some bumblers with more money than hair. But today, the Fiver wants to put the spotlight on the stadium, not the football, because she deserves it. And also because her Chief Executive has gone around shouting his mouth off as if the Millennium Dome never happened.</p> <p>\"We will create a Wembley experience which will start from the moment someone buys a ticket and will last until they get home after the event,\" said Bob Stubbs of the new stadium that is yet to receive enough financial backing to guarantee that it will be built. \"I have been involved in this project for four years and firmly believe it will surpass anything which has been done before,\" he said of the projected 90,000 capacity stadium which will have more toilets than any ground in the world.</p> <p>Not content with praising something that may never get built, Bob also took the opportunity to have a pop at the world's major stadiums while he was at it. \"I have been to them all,\" he said. \"You can't buy anything to eat and drink at the Stade de France and Cardiff is not particularly impressive either.\" So there you have it. All the more reason to cheer the death of the old Wembers this weekend. As the Koogmeister himself put it: \"Because it's Germany, because it's the last game at Wembley, this one's just got a bit more cream on it.\"</p> <p><strong>MUSCLING IN</strong></p> <p>If, in three years time, Barnet are Premiership champions and their players are walking around with Schwarzenegger-sized biceps and an undersized throbbing python of love to match, the club's new \u00a3250,000 sponsorship deal with dietary supplement company Maximuscle might well be to blame. \"But aren't they the chaps who were blamed when Mark Richardson, Doug Walker and Gary Cadogan all tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone?\" you ask. Well, yes they are. But our lawyers are watching so we won't be entertaining any wild accusations - especially when Maximuscle can point to a University of Aberdeen study that proves that all their products are clean. And, even if we had fears that the whole Barnet squad could be risking a ban if something goes strangely wrong - a la Richardson and co - they were thankfully assuaged at the press conference today. \"I look forward to meeting them to take their advice on all matters relating to fitness,\" said Barnet's general manager John Still about the deal. And then he continued, in a manner that was just a bit too laissez faire for the Fiver's liking: \"Anything that improves players' performance will suit me fine.\" </p> <p>\"Anything?\" thought the Fiver. But before we could get Still to elaborate, up stepped Maximuscle's managing director Zef Eisenberg to announce that there really was nothing to worry about. \"All the controversies in the past were linked to just a few elite athletes and there may be reasons for that,\" he said confusingly. \"But the rest of the people who use our products have not complained. It makes sense for us to help advise Barnet.\" And, realising that Barnet are in no way elite athletes, the Fiver went away reassured.</p> <p><strong>QUOTES OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I am travelling to London to meet with Sir Alex Ferguson and we will discuss a potential bid for Clarence [Acuna, Chilean international midfielder]. Sir Alex and I are friends and in professional terms, I scout players for him, especially in Argentina, Brazil and Chile\" - Agent Ronen Katzav, as quoted yesterday on the Planet Football website.</p> <p>\"I am not currently in London. If I wanted to arrange a meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson, I would not do it through the media. I never said anything about Manchester United being interested in Acuna. I'm not sure how this got out\" - Agent Ronen Katzav, as quoted today on the Planet Football website. The Fiver pledges to wholeheartedly join Ronen in his wondering.</p> <p><strong>COOKING WITH CARLTON</strong></p> <p>The Fiver is always on the lookout for ways of making an extra few bob. One idea we had was to set up a company called Fiver Building Services and offer construction solutions to Premiership footballers - if David Beckham wanted some crazy paving laying down, for example, we'd be round with trowel at the ready before he could say \"water feature\". But after finding out what happened when Carlton Palmer wanted a new kitchen, we've decided not to bother.</p> <p>You see, poor Carlton gave builder Wayne Haslam \u00a312,000 to construct the cooking area of his dreams. Sadly, work on the new kitchen never began, forcing the former England international to demand his money back. But when the cheque refunding Carlton's cash bounced higher than one of his clearances, things started getting out of hand. \"I was furious,\" Palmer seethed, as he gave evidence in Sheffield Crown Court against Haslam, who was on trial for six charges of deception. \"I said I would burn his premises down and I wouldn't care if he was in there.\"</p> <p>Luckily for everybody concerned, Carlton - who was playing for Southampton at the time - didn't actually mean it. Instead, Haslam told the court Palmer arranged to meet him in a golf club car park, bringing Chris Eubank's former minder along for the ride. As all the chums sat chatting in Palmer's Merc, the \"nervous\" builder agreed to a repayment plan. Predictably, the terms of this particular scheme were never met, which may go some way to explaining Carlton's successful appearance in the box (surely a first).</p> <p>As a result of all this, Haslam was sent down for a six-month stretch on Friday. The presiding judge also explained how \"disturbed\" he was by Palmer's workshop-torching threat, and called for an investigation. However, it is understood that the South Yorkshire Police will not be making any enquiries. We're still getting rid of our tool box though, it's not worth the bother.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Christian Panucci wants a move back to Internazionale now that Marcello Lippi has been sacked.

The BBC's plan has thrown ITV into a scheduling crisis. The network has taken the unusual step of delaying publishing its final schedule for that week until 6pm tonight. The deadline for submitting final schedules to listings editors was 4pm today. The transfer of Have I Got News For You? to BBC1 - at its usual time of 9pm from Friday October 20 - was revealed in a revised version of the initial schedule published this morning. The long-running BBC2 show and a Vicar of Dibley repeat will replace Parkinson, which had originally been pencilled in for 9pm that night. BBC and ITV schedulers often try to wrong-foot each other with last-minute changes and further revisions could yet be made to the BBC1 line-up before the final listings deadline at 4pm today. Earlier today BBC1 revealed it was putting its faith in pensioner Victor Meldrew and Men in Black to push viewers to the new Ten O'Clock News in its first week. The last ever series of sitcom One Foot in the Grave will occupy the first vacated 9pm BBC1 slot when the channel's hastily rejigged late-evening schedule relaunches on October 16. Victor Meldrew's last hurrah will be followed at 9.30pm on BBC1 by another comedy, the returning Royle Family, which will lead in to the first Ten O'Clock News. The following night the channel will give Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones' blockbuster, Men in Black, its UK terrestrial premiere at 8.30pm. On Wednesday October 18, the Scarlet Pimpernel will return for a 90-minute romp from 8.30pm; while on Thursday, BBC1 has juggled its line-up to bring forward Lenny Henry drama Hope &amp; Glory to 9.05pm. BBC1 will end the week with a new sitcom premiering after the news at 10.35pm. Too Much Sun stars the Fully Monty's Mark Addy as a Brit-in-Hollywood. Panorama moves the week before the news. Its first Sunday night airing will be on the October 15 at 10.15pm, following a 15-minute news bulletin.",

      "body": "<p>If the cost cutting and job losses had not already made it plain to employees of the BBC that its new director general hailed from a commercial background, then the move of its main nightly news bulletin to 10pm certainly did. </p> <p>The manner of the announcement to steal ITV's thunder and reschedule the news within two weeks smacked of someone whose tactics had been battle hardened in the trenches of commercial television. The trouble is that if the director general, Greg Dyke, wants to play by commercial rules, he may find commercial rules foisted back upon him. </p> <p>Little more than a week ago the culture secretary, Chris Smith, had urged the BBC to think again about moving its main nightly news to 10pm. Going head-to-head with ITV made no sense, he argued, and threatened to create a \"democratic deficit\" of viewers. </p> <p>Yesterday's announcement that the BBC planned to do just that provoked a furious reaction from Mr Smith who again expressed severe misgivings. While admitting he has no power over the schedule, he in effect put the BBC governors on notice to watch for any slip in quality or viewer numbers. The nightly Nine O'Clock News attracts around 5.2m viewers. </p> <p>The immediate reaction from insiders yesterday was that the governors who rule what the BBC can and cannot do may have just signed their professional death warrants. The BBC's freedom to shift its news output without consultation could not be more different to the situation at ITV, which has battled with regulators for the past two years before being forced to reinstate News at Ten. </p> <p>With the communications white paper being put together at present, some may have counselled the governors to resist raising the hackles of the culture secretary. </p> <p>One of the options for the paper is to abolish the board of governors or at least to limit their powers and bring the BBC under the same regulatory regime as everyone else. If that is the case, the corporation's new found nimbleness may not last. </p> <p>To prove it is fulfilling its public service remit by shifting the news, the BBC has to engage in a difficult balancing act. </p> <p>The corporation argues that a 10pm slot for the main nightly news makes powerful sense editorially. \"It allows the BBC to provide better coverage of parliamentary votes and the business markets as well as breaking stories in America which, with a US general election coming, will be vital to our international coverage,\" said BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland. </p> <p>He maintained that the viewing figures for the main news programme would rise by moving it to 10pm. </p> <p>At the same time, Mr Dyke presented the move as being in line with the BBC's ambition of creating a portfolio of channels for the digital age, including the introduction of the new BBC's 3 and 4. </p> <p>The aim is to make BBC1 a broad based entertainment channel and shunting the main bulletin to a later time slot will clear space. </p> <p>The BBC hopes to fill the 9pm slot with new drama, comedy and factual programming which will be funded by an extra \u00a395m investment to improve the quality of the corporation's main two channels. </p> <p>That too will not be easy. The BBC's inability to release its first schedule yesterday was taken as a clue that programme makers are not ready for the shift in the news - down to the practical problem of most dramas being 50 minutes long. </p> <p>ITV found it difficult to produce a strong slate of programming for the post 10pm slot left vacant by its own news programme. </p> <p>Critics seized on yesterday's move as evidence that the BBC is dumbing down by marginalising its news coverage. Panorama, the corporation's flagship current affairs programme, is at least staying put on BBC1, although the move to Sunday night will attract adverse comment. </p> <p>Last month's fudged agreement between ITV and its regulator, the Independent Television Commission, played into the BBC's hands however and its insistence that it remains committed to serious news coverage. </p> <p>Sir Christopher was quick to make capital of the compromise which means the ITV nightly news will appear at 10pm for only three nights a week. </p> <p>The BBC's main evening news will run six nights a week at 10pm including a new truncated Sunday programme. \"Serious news must have scheduling certainty,\" Sir Christopher said. </p> <p>His dismissal of Mr Smith's comments yesterday, though, may come back to haunt him. He said: \"Chris Smith is a licence fee payer and therefore entitled to his view. </p> <p>\"But it is not in the jurisdiction of the secretary of state to schedule the BBC's news service.\" It could be soon. </p> <p> <strong>Head to Head</strong></p> <p><strong> BBC </strong></p> <p><strong>Presenters </strong> Michael Buerk, Peter Sissons </p> <p><strong> Length of programme</strong> 26 minutes </p> <p><strong> Mix</strong> One-third international coverage </p> <p><strong> Frequency</strong> Six nights a week </p> <p>&lt;str</p> <p><strong>&gt; ITV </strong></p> <p><strong>Presenter</strong> Trevor McDonald. </p> <p><strong> Length of programme </strong> 20 minutes. </p> <p><strong> Mix </strong> Roughly one-third international coverage.

Going head-to-head with ITV made no sense, he argued, and threatened to create a \"democratic deficit\" of viewers. Yesterday's announcement that the BBC planned to do just that provoked a furious reaction from Mr Smith who again expressed severe misgivings. While admitting he has no power over the schedule, he in effect put the BBC governors on notice to watch for any slip in quality or viewer numbers. The nightly Nine O'Clock News attracts around 5.2m viewers. The immediate reaction from insiders yesterday was that the governors who rule what the BBC can and cannot do may have just signed their professional death warrants. The BBC's freedom to shift its news output without consultation could not be more different to the situation at ITV, which has battled with regulators for the past two years before being forced to reinstate News at Ten. With the communications white paper being put together at present, some may have counselled the governors to resist raising the hackles of the culture secretary. One of the options for the paper is to abolish the board of governors or at least to limit their powers and bring the BBC under the same regulatory regime as everyone else. If that is the case, the corporation's new found nimbleness may not last. To prove it is fulfilling its public service remit by shifting the news, the BBC has to engage in a difficult balancing act. The corporation argues that a 10pm slot for the main nightly news makes powerful sense editorially. \"It allows the BBC to provide better coverage of parliamentary votes and the business markets as well as breaking stories in America which, with a US general election coming, will be vital to our international coverage,\" said BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland. He maintained that the viewing figures for the main news programme would rise by moving it to 10pm. At the same time, Mr Dyke presented the move as being in line with the BBC's ambition of creating a portfolio of channels for the digital age, including the introduction of the new BBC's 3 and 4. The aim is to make BBC1 a broad based entertainment channel and shunting the main bulletin to a later time slot will clear space. The BBC hopes to fill the 9pm slot with new drama, comedy and factual programming which will be funded by an extra \u00a395m investment to improve the quality of the corporation's main two channels. That too will not be easy. The BBC's inability to release its first schedule yesterday was taken as a clue that programme makers are not ready for the shift in the news - down to the practical problem of most dramas being 50 minutes long. ITV found it difficult to produce a strong slate of programming for the post 10pm slot left vacant by its own news programme. Critics seized on yesterday's move as evidence that the BBC is dumbing down by marginalising its news coverage. Panorama, the corporation's flagship current affairs programme, is at least staying put on BBC1, although the move to Sunday night will attract adverse comment. Last month's fudged agreement between ITV and its regulator, the Independent Television Commission, played into the BBC's hands however and its insistence that it remains committed to serious news coverage. Sir Christopher was quick to make capital of the compromise which means the ITV nightly news will appear at 10pm for only three nights a week. The BBC's main evening news will run six nights a week at 10pm including a new truncated Sunday programme. \"Serious news must have scheduling certainty,\" Sir Christopher said. His dismissal of Mr Smith's comments yesterday, though, may come back to haunt him. He said: \"Chris Smith is a licence fee payer and therefore entitled to his view. \"But it is not in the jurisdiction of the secretary of state to schedule the BBC's news service.\" It could be soon.

This, surely, was this the first time a politician was planning to \"spend more time with my family\" without using the phrase as a euphemism for scandal or sacking. </p> <p>\"It's an increasing problem,\" moaned Darling, in a surprisingly candid interview for the New Statesman. \"The only solution is for me to stop what I'm doing.\" </p> <p>This week it is the turn of Sir Trevor McDonald to stake a claim to new dad-hood. Apparently, the ITN anchorman is now so enjoying spending time with his 11-year-old son Jamie that he is reluctant to give up the \"precious\" evenings freed up since he started hosting the 6.30 evening news slot. It will take some wooing by TV executives, apparently, to lure Sir Trevor back to the News at Ten when the bulletin is relaunched next year. </p> <p>But the cabinet minister's announcement raised interest for another reason: the advanced ages of the Darling bairns. At 12 and nine respectively, Calum and Anna are hardly babes in arms, and by his own admission there is doubt as to whether they would actually welcome their 46-year-old dad's sudden desire to be a man about the house. Darling wants to spend more time with his kids - but do they want to spend more time with him? At a time when a child's image of its father can switch from superhero to source of embarrassment, his increased presence might simply drive them deeper into their bedrooms. </p> <p>Besides, according to many child development experts, it would seem that Darling has missed the boat. Parental contact, we're told, is at its most vital during a child's early years. The need diminishes with the growing acquisition of confidence and independence. In the latest book on the topic, Love, Laughter and Parenting, Steve Biddulph has teamed up with wife Shaaron to harmonise on the traditional theme that the most important time in a child's life is from birth to six. \"We call these the 'precious years' because the foundations of trust and confidence are being laid down that will affect all the years to come,\" the couple writes. \"Your child will never need you as much as during these tender and dependent times.\" </p> <p>But is this necessarily the case? Steve Carr, a screenwriter who sold his casting agency business to work from home and raise his two daughters, believes not. \"It wasn't until my eldest had started school that I decided to change my working patterns,\" he says. \"Selfishly, I felt I was missing out - her character was really taking shape - but I also realised the pre-teenage years would be critical for Nancy.\" </p> <p>When Nancy, now eight, was recently upset by changing schools, her father was there to offer sympathy and support. \"Instead of hearing about her worries second-hand from my wife, I was around at home to help her settle in,\" says Carr. \"Kids need fathers at this age as much as at any other. My own father was never around. I want my daughters to know their father, for good or ill.\" </p> <p>His instincts have been borne out by a forthcoming research paper collated at Lancaster University. Detailing the academic evidence for why fathers matter, the paper discovers real benefits for older children who have close contact with their dads. According to this research, the greater a father's involvement between the ages of seven and 11, the better the child's educational qualifications at 16 and the smaller the chance of a criminal record at 21. </p> <p>\"Adolescence is when any problems of early child-rearing come home to roost,\" says Jack O'Sullivan, co-founder of Fathers Direct, the national information service for fathers, which commissioned the paper. \"It is vital before children reach that age that the father is really involved, otherwise, come adolescence, he can expect to have little positive impact.\" </p> <p>For fathers themselves, these pre-teen years are often the most rewarding. Many men of Darling's generation share his view that their early absence from child-rearing doesn't matter because \"when they are babies they don't actually notice\". For others, feelings of uselessness or jealousy - common during the first few years - can disappear with the onset of conversation and shared activities. Full-time father Paul Doherty, who gave up his job as a magazine designer after the birth of his daughter Jasmine, now nine, admits that he gains more enjoyment from her company as she grows older. </p> <p>\"I disagree that dads can afford to skip the baby years, but at this age, there's a lot of pleasure to be had just by talking to Jasmine and helping out with her projects,\" he says. \"She's currently trying for her cookery badge with the Brownies so we spent yesterday buying ingredients to make fruit salad. This week, she's getting her meningitis jab, so I'll be there to reassure her. </p> <p>\"Obviously, these days she has plenty of friends and can be left to her own devices but, in a different way, she needs me as much now as when she was a baby.\" </p> <p>Why, then, are these years so disregarded by child psychologists? Blame Freud, says Mary MacLeod, chief executive of the National Family and Parenting Institute. </p> <p>\"The years from nine to 11 are are actually a period of great curiosity and independence - especially with the move to secondary school and the fact that adolescence is starting earlier,\" she explains. \"But less attention is paid to this age group, partly because in psychoanalytic terms these are the 'latency' years, when nothing very interesting is supposed to happen. Certainly in terms of policy provision, these in-between years are more neglected than the early and teenage years.\" </p> <p>A case in point is last year's adoption of the European directive which grants 13 weeks of unpaid leave per parent during the first five years of a child's life, a policy measure which ignores the significance of ensuing years altogether. Similarly, the Government's recent paternity-leave proposals appear to imply that a father is only really needed in the first two weeks following birth. </p> <p>\"Ideally, we'd like to see reasonable leave provision throughout the pre-teen years in case parents need to deal with emergency issues such as bullying or truancy,\" says MacLeod, who hopes parental leave will one day be extended until a child's 16th birthday. \"The work-life balance must be flexible enough to allow fathers to be with their children at times of most need.\" </p> <p>With our culture of working long hours and a value system that places a premium on career above family life, there is little chance of that yet. Nor, with just 15% of men enjoying flexible working patterns, is it likely that Alistair Darling's mooted downshifting will set a compelling precedent. Worst of all, according to Professor Charlie Lewis, even if more men were to \"do a Darling\", there would be still no guarantee that society would notice the benefit. </p> <p>\"Sure, there'll be positive effects from someone like Alistair Darling spending more time with his kids,\" says Lewis, one of the UK's leading experts on fatherhood. \"But, in fact, most children brought up in a single-mother or lesbian family are indistinguishable from those from two-parent households - a child's development may actually be more influenced by its peers. Fathers are not indispensable and if Darling thinks his new influence will be a magic ingredient, there may be trouble ahead.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p> I am a lapsed food purist, an ex-paragon, and last week's article by Joanna Blythman on parents and sugar induced in me such a rage that only a new dark chocolate Mars bar could assuage it. </p> <p>Blythman exhorted parents to banish biscuits, honey and even fruit juices from their children's diets. There's nothing she can urge that I haven't done. Neither of my two children ever tasted a molecule of non-homemade baby food. Visitors marvelled at the way my first child downed a plate of spinach. For her second birthday, I baked a sugar-free cake (carob, naturally) so weighted with healthy nutrients that it could have caused serious injury, if hurled. A friend said it wasn't a cake but a statement. </p> <p>Nine years later and I chuckle at the Waitrose checkout, that place where shoppers furtively scrutinise each other's trollies for signs of wealth, greed and loneliness. Mine overflows with as much organic greenery as I can afford - and equal quantities of chocolate. (Why do they call large packs \"family\" size, as if no single individual could ever consume so much? And why do they carry such laughably distant use-by dates, as though anyone could actually keep those mini-sized packets of Maltesers for a year?) </p> <p> My metamorphosis was clinched by two events: my first child starting school, and the birth of my second. School marked the end of the grated-carrot stage of our lives. Never mind that she mainly had packed lunches, food is a social experience: surrounded by children who would only eat fish fingers and pasta without sauce, her own tastes began to migrate towards theirs. Kids want to be like their peers. </p> <p>When her sibling arrived, I also found myself short of that most essential commodity: time. At first, I tried to make interesting meals while also pur\u00e9eing baby food, but as my creations were increasingly rejected with an apologetic \"Sorry, but I don't like it\", we soon found ourselves going the pasta route. </p> <p>As a sociologist as well as a mother, I began to admit personally that which I had always known theoretically - food choice in the real world is a complex issue. What people eat is influenced by more than just nutrition, and is integrally connected with class, history and culture. </p> <p>Money is also critical, since fresh fruit and vegetables are expensive, and not always easily available to car-less parents reliant on local shops. Blythman has been a pioneer in helping us understand how food production has been industrialised, with health being a low priority, so it was curious that this article placed the onus of children eating healthily almost entirely on individual parents. You need to be a well-informed, demon label-reader with infinite energy to live up to that responsibility. </p> <p>We ignore at our peril the psychological dimensions of food. Those parents who placate their complaining children with cakes are often feeding their deprived-child selves. Tolerating their children's fillings is easier for some than tolerating their children's unhappiness or frustration. </p> <p>Dividing foods into good or bad, and struggling to ensure that the latter doesn't contaminate the former, is symptomatic of what psychoanalysts call \"splitting\". Like 50s cold-warriors, we see the risk of invasion from aliens all around. Only now we fear Mars bars instead of martians. Sugar is the new communism. </p> <p>Of course, I'm not a total revisionist. No turkey dinosaur has ever waddled into my home. I'm aspartame-wise, anti-GM and thrilled that my children hate fizzy drinks. This summer - spontaneously (well, almost) - they discovered green salad, and my 11-year-old now makes a mean vinaigrette. </p> <p>But I've also recognised that children want some control over their own food, and my interventions near-as-damn-it made mealtimes into a battleground. So now I give them chocolate-chip cookies when they come home from school. </p> <p>When we first have children, most of us are terrified that every single experience will have a major impact on their life. As they grow older, we realise that this isn't the case. So it is with food. If most of their eating is reasonably healthy, a few Jammy Dodgers aren't going to pollute them. Besides, I don't want to have to hide my own chocolate wrappers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am a lapsed food purist, an ex-paragon, and last week's article by Joanna Blythman on parents and sugar induced in me such a rage that only a new dark chocolate Mars bar could assuage it. Blythman exhorted parents to banish biscuits, honey and even fruit juices from their children's diets. There's nothing she can urge that I haven't done. Neither of my two children ever tasted a molecule of non-homemade baby food. Visitors marvelled at the way my first child downed a plate of spinach. For her second birthday, I baked a sugar-free cake (carob, naturally) so weighted with healthy nutrients that it could have caused serious injury, if hurled. A friend said it wasn't a cake but a statement. Nine years later and I chuckle at the Waitrose checkout, that place where shoppers furtively scrutinise each other's trollies for signs of wealth, greed and loneliness. Mine overflows with as much organic greenery as I can afford - and equal quantities of chocolate. (Why do they call large packs \"family\" size, as if no single individual could ever consume so much? And why do they carry such laughably distant use-by dates, as though anyone could actually keep those mini-sized packets of Maltesers for a year?) My metamorphosis was clinched by two events: my first child starting school, and the birth of my second. School marked the end of the grated-carrot stage of our lives. Never mind that she mainly had packed lunches, food is a social experience: surrounded by children who would only eat fish fingers and pasta without sauce, her own tastes began to migrate towards theirs. Kids want to be like their peers. When her sibling arrived, I also found myself short of that most essential commodity: time. At first, I tried to make interesting meals while also pur\u00e9eing baby food, but as my creations were increasingly rejected with an apologetic \"Sorry, but I don't like it\", we soon found ourselves going the pasta route. As a sociologist as well as a mother, I began to admit personally that which I had always known theoretically - food choice in the real world is a complex issue. What people eat is influenced by more than just nutrition, and is integrally connected with class, history and culture. Money is also critical, since fresh fruit and vegetables are expensive, and not always easily available to car-less parents reliant on local shops. Blythman has been a pioneer in helping us understand how food production has been industrialised, with health being a low priority, so it was curious that this article placed the onus of children eating healthily almost entirely on individual parents. You need to be a well-informed, demon label-reader with infinite energy to live up to that responsibility. We ignore at our peril the psychological dimensions of food. Those parents who placate their complaining children with cakes are often feeding their deprived-child selves. Tolerating their children's fillings is easier for some than tolerating their children's unhappiness or frustration. Dividing foods into good or bad, and struggling to ensure that the latter doesn't contaminate the former, is symptomatic of what psychoanalysts call \"splitting\". Like 50s cold-warriors, we see the risk of invasion from aliens all around. Only now we fear Mars bars instead of martians. Sugar is the new communism. Of course, I'm not a total revisionist. No turkey dinosaur has ever waddled into my home. I'm aspartame-wise, anti-GM and thrilled that my children hate fizzy drinks. This summer - spontaneously (well, almost) - they discovered green salad, and my 11-year-old now makes a mean vinaigrette. But I've also recognised that children want some control over their own food, and my interventions near-as-damn-it made mealtimes into a battleground. So now I give them chocolate-chip cookies when they come home from school. When we first have children, most of us are terrified that every single experience will have a major impact on their life. As they grow older, we realise that this isn't the case. So it is with food. If most of their eating is reasonably healthy, a few Jammy Dodgers aren't going to pollute them. Besides, I don't want to have to hide my own chocolate wrappers.",

Outside in the real world of uncertain marriages, unforgiving bank managers and inflexible employers, most people would say money, a stable relationship or emotional maturity. But when it comes to the comedians leading the debate about the \"proper\" way to become a parent, the single most important factor seems to be timing. Don't be too early or too late is the popular refrain. It may seem terribly old-fashioned and simplistic, but thanks to the world of science there is a growing mountain of studies that would seem to support it. </p> <p>No one gets too upset about new research pointing to the dangers of teenage pregnancy, but it is a different story when it comes to studies casting doubts on late motherhood. Although the conception rate for women between 35 and 39 has gone up by 82% since 1976, it remains a controversial choice. This may explain why the tiniest cloud wafting out of the remotest of research labs gets tabloid headlines. </p> <p>Early last summer, for example, there was great interest expressed in a study published in the British Medical Journal by Professor Melbye of the Danish Epidemiology Science Centre in Copenhagen. His research showed that the chances of a woman carrying a wanted child to term decreases radically as she gets older. While the risk of a miscarriage is only 8% for women aged 22, it rises to 20% for women aged 35, 50% for women aged 42, and 84% for women aged 48. </p> <p>In August, the same journal brought news of a study conducted in Oxford revealing that women who delayed starting their families were more likely to have children who develop diabetes. The authors suggested that older motherhood might explain the dramatic rise in childhood diabetes across the developed world. The newspapers were quick to give this hypothesis saturation coverage. </p> <p>And so it was last week, when Nature magazine published a study by two doctors at the University of Missouri showing that mice who had their first litters as young adults had the healthiest offspring. Male pups born to early adolescent and middle-aged mothers were smaller at birth, entered puberty later, and had smaller reproductive organs. Although their female pups did better, they were more likely to produce low-birthweight babies than were females born of young adult mothers. According to Dr Frederick vom Saal and Dr Ming-Hseng Wang, this was because of differences in hormone levels in females in their early and late reproductive years. </p> <p>\"The Nature paper simply puts this on the radar screen as a factor to be considered,\" comments vom Saal. \"Obviously, women late in their fertile lives who desire a child should not panic based on our data.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Daily Mail seized upon the research. \"How Older Mothers Put Baby at Risk\" proclaimed its headline. The article itself was so quick to link celebrity older mums such as Cherie Blair, Madonna, actress Patricia Hodge and former Bond girl Jane Seymour, with the dangerous new baby-harming trend that I had to read it twice before it dawned on me that we were dealing with an animal study. </p> <p>As an older mother who has been reading veiled warnings about deferred motherhood for nearly two decades, I can't say this worried me. It's like static: annoying, but easy to block out. The study itself I find more alarming. </p> <p>For one thing, it gives credence to one of the favourite notions of early 20th-century eugenics. This was that the weak, the puny and the degenerate affected the health and mental hygiene of not just their children, but also the generations that followed. It was this perceived link that led Hitler to the view that \"undesirables\" should be weeded out of the gene pool. If eugenics research went into decline after the war, it was because no one wanted to be branded a neo-Nazi. But eugenics is what the new reproductive technologies are all about. Scientists are quick to point out the difference between \"positive eugenics\" (helping to ensure that the babies we bring into the world are as healthy as possible) and \"negative eugenics\" (killing or sterilising the defective). However - as ethically-responsible scientists are only too aware - even the most people-friendly positive eugenics is still politically slippery. It all depends on who defines the meaning of the word \"healthy\". </p> <p>The definition of health that emerges from this new study is narrow. Based on a population of mice living in laboratory conditions, it has limited relevance to humans who do not. Had it compared several groups of mice, living in a variety of conditions and following difference diets, the final picture would have been much harder to read. </p> <p>It would probably have confirmed what other, less headline-grabbing research has shown time and again, that the main causes of low birth- weight are poor maternal health, malnutrition and poverty. To present research on maternal age outside this context might be fine for a community of scientists who are already aware of this established body of knowledge, but to do so when writing for a larger audience is misleading. </p> <p>What bothers me the most about the new maternal age debate is its time frame. It focuses on gestation and the moment of birth, as though anything which happens after that is immaterial. Everyone knows that there is more to being a parent than that. But the media have not gone out of their way to highlight research showing that older motherhood may have benefits as well as risks. </p> <p>According to Dr Julia Berryman, of the Leicester University Parenthood Research Group, older mothers tend to tire more easily, but there is no evidence that they are poorer parents. In fact, there is research that suggests their children have higher IQs than those of younger women. This may be explained by the fact that they invest more in their children: because they are older, they are likely to be wiser, more affluent and more settled than they might have been as young adults. </p> <p>That said, she is keen to point out that for middle-aged women it is harder to conceive, there is a greater chance of miscarriage, and they're more likely to have complications during pregnancy. \"But it's very much a swings and roundabouts situation,\" concludes Berryman.

      "body": "<p>Last year was the most shocking and traumatic of my life. Out of the blue, my husband, Nick, father to my five-year-old daughter, Bethany, failed to come home one evening. He was eventually found collapsed in his van, and was later diagnosed with a secondary brain tumour. </p> <p>Nick endured brain surgery and radiotherapy, but never had a moment's let-up before the next crisis hit. They found the primary cancer in his colon and operated again, but a few short weeks later they confirmed the tumours were back in his brain. By the end of the year, we were utterly exhausted and knew he had only a short time left to live. But the worst was yet to come - and some of the shocks were not just of natural causes, but concerned the care services available to us at home. </p> <p>In December, it became clear that Nick needed somebody to be with him all night. He was very weak, and getting increasingly confused. He needed somebody to empty his colostomy bag (or he, the bed and the bedroom became the most indescribable mess) and give him his painkillers. </p> <p>The first weekend we struggled through with the help of some really kind friends. Come Monday morning, in my naivety I was expecting the various statutory and voluntary agencies to come up with a package of help to provide regular night cover - an expectation which turned out to be unrealistic. </p> <p>I was keeping a daily journal at this time, which was a lifeline. Here is an extract for that day: \"Got a phone call at 2.30pm to say there's no night cover tonight, and very little available all week. Felt very abandoned and had a major cry. I had to tell poor Bethany to go away and leave me alone while I tried to sort some things out, and she wandered off to bed with her whole body drooping and sagging and her head hanging down ... I just do not know what on earth I'm supposed to do, and I can't believe that I'm just left.\" </p> <p>We had been very impressed with the amount of support available to us up to this point, with people visiting to talk things over and a wonderfully helpful GP. But this was the crunch. All the services together could only provide cover for three - possibly four - nights a week, and nobody had any solution as to what was supposed to happen the other nights. I was even asked if I could not stay up with Nick at night, but I was already absolutely on my knees by the end of each day and nobody was available to sit with him during the next day to let me snatch some sleep. Neither could friends and relatives come and stay up all night if they had work the next day, or young children to look after. </p> <p>Eventually, we survived because one of Nick's nieces happened to be made redundant and came down from her home town to stay with us for several nights at a time. It totally disrupted her young life (and not many young women of her age would have dealt with all the mess), and she had to tread very carefully to avoid losing her benefits. </p> <p>In the new year, though, things got worse again. Nick's niece got a new job and had to leave us. Nick was much weaker, and constantly in danger of falling, while being very confused at times (he would regularly get up in the night looking for his bowl of breakfast cornflakes). And then he had a major epileptic fit. It was no longer safe to leave him alone at any time during the day or night. How was I supposed to manage now, with my young daughter to get to school (the car being the only means of getting her there, and no other pupils living anywhere near us)? </p> <p>Again, it was a major shock. There was no scheduled daytime care available, even to cover my absence for half an hour at a time. So every day turned into a nightmare of tenuous, last-minute arrangements, relying on nervous elderly people, anybody I could possibly find to hand, who could come and sit with Nick and call an ambulance if needed. They certainly would not have been able to help him physically if he fell or got stuck anywhere - he was still a big and heavy man. </p> <p>Social services insisted it was a matter for the NHS, while the health authority said it could not provide the regular input of help we needed. Here is another extract from my journal: \"I just cried and cried with exhaustion and despair. Absolutely feeling that I am at the end of me, and wanting to crawl into a hole and stay there. And worried too that forcing myself to carry on all the time may in itself give me a breakdown. Wishing I could have a physical illness to just let me lie down and give up, so somebody else would have to take over. I simply can't carry on ... terrible struggle to make lunch ... just about managed to get through the evening. Bethany getting up and complaining of horrible pictures in her head and the walls of the room closing in on her.\" </p> <p>Three weeks later, the day after social services finally got a package of help organised for us, Nick went to the hospice. I simply couldn't carry on. He died there a few days later. He had said he wanted to stay at home with me and his beloved Bethany as long as we could possibly manage, but he did say he didn't actually mind where he \"passed through the door\". At least I finally had the time to be able to sit with him and love him as he lay unconscious. </p> <p> Now, months later, I still feel upset about the absence of real hands-on care that we needed. So much money goes towards cancer charities, and hospice care (which is very wonderful) must be very expensive. So why was more care not possible at home? As it is, I look back at our last two months and remember only a blur of exhaustion, pain and struggle, with Bethany living in confusion and fright in the midst of this, aware that her daddy was dying. And these were our last few, so precious, loving weeks together. </p> <p>I believe the local agencies have taken some note of our plight. But I don't know whether or not it has led to any real changes. I was so shocked that we could be left at such risk and under such terrible stress, even with a young child involved. How many other, untold, similar stories are there of \"caring\" at home? </p> <p>\u0095 Catherine Venn, Bethany and Nick are pseudonyms </p>",

We were going to have to work in a new way. We were going to have to stop looking to the courts to impose solutions. Parents, relatives and professionals were going to have to work together. Creative alternatives were going to have to be found. </p> <p>And if cases did have to go to court, the court process was going to be quicker. Delay is harmful to children (it says so in the act) and the legal process was going to be speeded up to take account of children's developmental timescale (six months for a five-year-old is 10% of their life). \"After the welfare principle, the need to avoid delay is one of the most important policies underlying the bill,\" as Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the then lord chancellor, put it. </p> <p>Children should no longer be subjected to long, emotionally damaging waits in the uncertain limbo of temporary care, while courts ponderously deliberated their fate. A time scale of 12 weeks was generally agreed to be the target. </p> <p>Sadly court delays have turned out to be one of the biggest problems of the post-Children Act era. Figures show that, by the end of 1996, children in England and Wales were on average waiting more than seven months for court decisions in care proceedings - more than twice the average wait immediately prior to the act. The problem was considerably worse in some areas of the country, just as it was in the higher courts which hear a significant minority of care cases (50 weeks on average in the county courts; 64 in the high court). </p> <p>There seem to be several reasons for this. These include inadequate court time, poor case management by judges and a heavy use of \"expert witnesses\", with resulting long delays while reports are written and additional hearings fitted into packed diaries. </p> <p>Another cause of delay is that more parties can be joined to proceedings, and many more issues can be argued about, under the act than under previous legislation. These issues include the precise details of the care plan. </p> <p>This is fertile ground for participants who want to use delay as a tactical weapon - and perhaps also for those who would like to put off the agonising decision to separate a child from their parents. But it is not necessarily good news for children who have to wait months in temporary care without knowing where their future home will be. </p> <p>Nor is it good news for social work agencies, who have to sink more money into the considerable costs of lengthy litigation, and consequently have less left over for the supportive and preventative services that the act was supposed to promote. A local authority's legal costs for a single case can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds. </p> <p>Another likely cause of delay is the sheer volume of proceedings. It was hoped that the act would reduce them, but the number of care applications has risen. The annual total of care proceedings brought to court in England and Wales more than doubled between 1992 and 1998, while there has been a corresponding decline in the use of other orders that were supposed to provide alternatives to care. Care applications were about 40% of all public law applications under the act in 1998, as against less than 20% in 1992. </p> <p>Whatever the intentions of the act, it has ushered in an era in which care proceedings have become more frequent, longer and more likely than before to result in an order that compulsorily removes children from parents. What one makes of that depends, of course, on what one thought of the original objective of deflecting practice away from compulsion and use of the courts. It has been argued that more care proceedings are a good thing because more children are being protected from mistreatment as a result - and even that long proceedings do not matter because cases get a thorough hearing. But while these are legitimate points of view, it cannot be denied that the current situation is not at all what the act intended. </p> <p>Perhaps it is time for a re-think. Was it ever realistic to believe that we could have - and adequately resource - both a far more costly and elaborate court framework and a more community-based and preventative approach? </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Beckett is a lecturer in social work at Anglia Polytechnic University, Cambridge, and a former social work team manager</p>",

But it is not necessarily good news for children who have to wait months in temporary care without knowing where their future home will be. Nor is it good news for social work agencies, who have to sink more money into the considerable costs of lengthy litigation, and consequently have less left over for the supportive and preventative services that the act was supposed to promote. A local authority's legal costs for a single case can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds. Another likely cause of delay is the sheer volume of proceedings. It was hoped that the act would reduce them, but the number of care applications has risen. The annual total of care proceedings brought to court in England and Wales more than doubled between 1992 and 1998, while there has been a corresponding decline in the use of other orders that were supposed to provide alternatives to care. Care applications were about 40% of all public law applications under the act in 1998, as against less than 20% in 1992. Whatever the intentions of the act, it has ushered in an era in which care proceedings have become more frequent, longer and more likely than before to result in an order that compulsorily removes children from parents. What one makes of that depends, of course, on what one thought of the original objective of deflecting practice away from compulsion and use of the courts. It has been argued that more care proceedings are a good thing because more children are being protected from mistreatment as a result - and even that long proceedings do not matter because cases get a thorough hearing. But while these are legitimate points of view, it cannot be denied that the current situation is not at all what the act intended. Perhaps it is time for a re-think. Was it ever realistic to believe that we could have - and adequately resource - both a far more costly and elaborate court framework and a more community-based and preventative approach? \u0095 Chris Beckett is a lecturer in social work at Anglia Polytechnic University, Cambridge, and a former social work team manager",

      "body": "<p>Britain's largest companies are channelling more funds to voluntary and community organisations than ever before. Last year, some \u00a3310m was handed out by the 100 or so highest corporate donors, as against \u00a3275m the year before. However, the nature of their giving has changed strikingly, with a big shift from cash gifts to investment in cash and kind. </p> <p>Take BT. Its \u00a315m a year programme makes it one of the most consistent big givers. Yet charitable donations now account for less than 10% of its community budget, despite little change in the way the company distributes its money among education and employment projects, arts, environment and voluntary sector partnerships. Although the latter receives some \u00a34m a year, the majority of that cash is not a donation. </p> <p>Peter Thompson, BT's community operations manager, says: \"The company has changed the way it accounts for its community spend and only money that supports staff giving, or time, through matched give-as-you-earn and staff awards is now classified as charitable donations.\" In other words the company expects a return on its \"investment\" in charity. </p> <p>Scottish Power, the utility group which includes Manweb and Southern Water, contributed \u00a36.1m to the community last year, of which just \u00a3600,000 was awarded to charities. Even its PowerPartners initiative, designed to raise \u00a32m for six charities, including the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and Disability Scotland and Wales, is part community investment because it also engages the charities in helping improve the utility's services for special needs customers. </p> <p>According to Paul Pagliari, Scottish Power human resources director, nobody is suggesting that the company should award these funds purely for altruistic reasons. \"It is also a win-win situation for us as a business and reflects the strong links which we seek to establish with the communities in which we operate,\" he says. </p> <p>The figures for company giving come from the annual survey by Corporate Citizen magazine. The totals include donations to charity, gifts of old equipment or furniture and a value attributed to the work time which employees spend volunteering or fundraising. Money or goods donated to non-charitable local causes, such as schools or economic development bodies, are also included. </p> <p>Two of last year's top corporate donors, Lloyds TSB and Northern Rock, give for neither altruistic nor business reasons, however. Under terms dating back to when the Trustee Savings Bank became a plc, and updated when it merged with Lloyds, the four Lloyds TSB foundations are shareholders in the company and receive 1% of the group's pre-tax profits, averaged over three years, instead of a dividend on their shareholding. Last year, this amounted to a \"donation\" of \u00a326.5m. </p> <p>Similarly, when Northern Rock converted from a mutual to a bank in 1997, a foundation was established to receive 5% of the company's pre-tax profits - close on \u00a310m in 1999. It is arguable whether both privatisations could have gone ahead without such arrangements. </p> <p>The upward trend in corporate giving is in many ways a reflection of better calculation, rather than a sudden attack of generosity. Scottish Power is one of a number of companies using more sophisticated methods to measure community investment. Five years ago, the only way corporate citizen could gauge the sector's community support was to add together the charitable donations in companies' annual reports. Now, more than 50 top givers put a figure on their much larger community contributions. </p> <p> The headline increase also masks a decrease by some of the leaders in the field. British Airways has cut its community budget following a nose-dive in profits. Yet despite the reduction, its \u00a35.7m worldwide community budget outstripped the airline's pre-tax profits for 1999-2000. The reason for this anomaly is that the community budget was set the previous year when profits were far healthier. </p> <p>Luc Vandevelde, chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, told a packed shareholders' meeting in July that the flagging company was reducing the \u00a314.1m it contributes to good causes. Last year its donations fell by a quarter. For 2000, the company has a \u00a37.3m budget - a 48% drop. \"We can't maintain current spend if profits are much less, but what is important is that we are committed to investing more than 1% of pre-tax profits in the community,\" says Leris Harefield, M&amp;S community involvement spokeswoman. </p> <p>It is not just falling profits that jeopardise fragile community budgets. NatWest's \u00a315.4m community spend is up in the air following its takeover by the Royal Bank of Scotland. And United Biscuits (UB), now owned by Final Realm, has halved its contributions to \u00a3750,000 and slashed charitable donations by more than 80% to just \u00a3125,000. </p> <p>For the record, UB denies that the buyout or the departure of its chief executive, Eric Nicoli, have any thing to do with its decision to ditch a commitment to contribute 1% of pre-tax profits to the community. But the fact that Nicoli, now at EMI, continues to chair the PerCent Club - a 200 strong group of companies promoting this 1% benchmark - would suggest otherwise. </p> <p>According to Alan Coutes, UB's director of community affairs, the company has pared down those areas where it sees no direct business benefit from its spend. Its new focus, like a number of companies, puts the onus on employees to donate to charity. In business speak, this approach \"empowers\" staff to raise money, or volunteer, for the cause they support and in turn feel motivated about the company they work for. </p> <p>Given such volatility of company giving, charities should not lose a proper perspective on its relative importance. In 1999, according to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the corporate sector provided just 4.5% of voluntary sector income. </p> <p>\u0095 Alison Benjamin is editor of Corporate Citizen magazine, published by the Directory of Social Change.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Day after day, manuscripts reporting medical research pour into the offices of medical journals. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) alone processes more than 6,000 a year. Most submissions are eventually published in one journal or another, and their findings join the body of medical evidence that doctors and patients use to make critical decisions about health. </p> <p>It is an editor's job to pick the best and reject the rest, but what happens when one of \"the rest\" outlines a dangerous experiment that should never have been done, or a case that looks like medical negligence, or a piece of research so unsound that the results will be no use to anyone? </p> <p>The decision not to publish is straightforward enough, but there is a growing consensus that an editor's responsibility does not end there. Patients have wasted their time or, worse, may been harmed. Public funds may have been squandered and an opportunity to do more worthwhile research has been lost. </p> <p>Exactly what editors should do when they suspect wrongdoing, poor judgment, bad medicine or bad science is still an open question. To help them answer it, my colleagues and I at the BMJ have decided to appoint an ethics committee - the first of its kind. This independent group will include people who conduct research, treat patients and interpret the law. In addition, there should be some professional ethicists, with openings for lay members. </p> <p>The committee will be looking critically at everything the journal does, reviewing our existing policies and developing new ones. We still have no formal policy for dealing with whistleblowers, for example, despite being an obvious point of contact for doctors and others with grievances. Perhaps we should. </p> <p>Editors of medical journals live in a morally complex world where vested interests can subvert almost every stage of a study's journey from a researcher's brain to a printed, visible paper. Politicians, researchers, the drugs industry and the journals themselves have competing agendas, and it can be difficult to hear the patient's voice above the noise. </p> <p>A culture of \"publish or perish\" is one well-known example. Publication is a numbers game that doctors in training, as well as established academics, must play. It is one of the most powerful forces shaping medical literature. There are few things more impressive to an appointments committee than a lengthy list of publications, regardless of quality or content. </p> <p>Misdemeanours that result from this pressure include splitting a research paper into its \"least publishable units\" and sending each one to a different journal; publishing the same paper twice by manipulating the data to look different; and including in a paper's list of authors people whose only contribution was to buy the real authors a pint and promise to return the favour next time they write something up. </p> <p>Suspect manuscripts are only half the problem. Peer review, a legacy system of unpaid experts passing judgment on each other's work, is also vulnerable to human weaknesses such as arrogance, envy and naked ambition. For many journals, it is the reviewers who decide what is published - and not all journals insist on full disclosure of competing interests. The BMJ requires reviewers to be open about their financial affairs and affiliations, but how should the editors deal with reviewers who insist that their portfolio of shares in leading drug companies does not affect their judgment on related research? It would be easy to use other reviewers instead, but should the shareholder and his subconscious biases be left at large for other journals to worry about? </p> <p>Mike Farthing, editor of Gut, the leading gastroenterology journal, and chairman of the committee on publication ethics, thinks all this matters very much indeed. He has declared that distortions in medical literature are as damaging to public health as unclean water or a badly regulated food industry. </p> <p>Duplicate and redundant publications gum up the works, making an already chaotic literature even harder to navigate and therefore less useful. </p> <p>Imagine trying to find out which drug works best in psychoses, such as schizophrenia, when the data from a handful of clinical trials testing a new drug appear in various disguises, in several journals, none of which is cross-referenced. </p> <p>Reviewers or editors who fail to own up to competing interests, or think they are above all that, add yet more bias to a research effort already knocked out of shape. </p> <p>An ethics committee will help us think harder about the public health impact of what we do - and you may be able to help. If you think you could serve as a lay member of the BMJ's ethics committee, please get in touch before next Monday. <br></p> <p>\u0095 Alison Tonks is an assistant editor of the BMJ.

      "bodyText": "Day after day, manuscripts reporting medical research pour into the offices of medical journals. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) alone processes more than 6,000 a year. Most submissions are eventually published in one journal or another, and their findings join the body of medical evidence that doctors and patients use to make critical decisions about health. It is an editor's job to pick the best and reject the rest, but what happens when one of \"the rest\" outlines a dangerous experiment that should never have been done, or a case that looks like medical negligence, or a piece of research so unsound that the results will be no use to anyone? The decision not to publish is straightforward enough, but there is a growing consensus that an editor's responsibility does not end there. Patients have wasted their time or, worse, may been harmed. Public funds may have been squandered and an opportunity to do more worthwhile research has been lost. Exactly what editors should do when they suspect wrongdoing, poor judgment, bad medicine or bad science is still an open question. To help them answer it, my colleagues and I at the BMJ have decided to appoint an ethics committee - the first of its kind. This independent group will include people who conduct research, treat patients and interpret the law. In addition, there should be some professional ethicists, with openings for lay members. The committee will be looking critically at everything the journal does, reviewing our existing policies and developing new ones. We still have no formal policy for dealing with whistleblowers, for example, despite being an obvious point of contact for doctors and others with grievances. Perhaps we should. Editors of medical journals live in a morally complex world where vested interests can subvert almost every stage of a study's journey from a researcher's brain to a printed, visible paper. Politicians, researchers, the drugs industry and the journals themselves have competing agendas, and it can be difficult to hear the patient's voice above the noise. A culture of \"publish or perish\" is one well-known example. Publication is a numbers game that doctors in training, as well as established academics, must play. It is one of the most powerful forces shaping medical literature. There are few things more impressive to an appointments committee than a lengthy list of publications, regardless of quality or content. Misdemeanours that result from this pressure include splitting a research paper into its \"least publishable units\" and sending each one to a different journal; publishing the same paper twice by manipulating the data to look different; and including in a paper's list of authors people whose only contribution was to buy the real authors a pint and promise to return the favour next time they write something up. Suspect manuscripts are only half the problem. Peer review, a legacy system of unpaid experts passing judgment on each other's work, is also vulnerable to human weaknesses such as arrogance, envy and naked ambition. For many journals, it is the reviewers who decide what is published - and not all journals insist on full disclosure of competing interests. The BMJ requires reviewers to be open about their financial affairs and affiliations, but how should the editors deal with reviewers who insist that their portfolio of shares in leading drug companies does not affect their judgment on related research? It would be easy to use other reviewers instead, but should the shareholder and his subconscious biases be left at large for other journals to worry about? Mike Farthing, editor of Gut, the leading gastroenterology journal, and chairman of the committee on publication ethics, thinks all this matters very much indeed. He has declared that distortions in medical literature are as damaging to public health as unclean water or a badly regulated food industry. Duplicate and redundant publications gum up the works, making an already chaotic literature even harder to navigate and therefore less useful. Imagine trying to find out which drug works best in psychoses, such as schizophrenia, when the data from a handful of clinical trials testing a new drug appear in various disguises, in several journals, none of which is cross-referenced. Reviewers or editors who fail to own up to competing interests, or think they are above all that, add yet more bias to a research effort already knocked out of shape. An ethics committee will help us think harder about the public health impact of what we do - and you may be able to help. If you think you could serve as a lay member of the BMJ's ethics committee, please get in touch before next Monday. \u0095 Alison Tonks is an assistant editor of the BMJ. She can be contacted at atonks@bmj.com or on 020-7387 4499",

He was trying to tune his new-fangled transistor radio to Radio Luxembourg which was transmitting exciting sounds from a more distant, infinitely bigger land across the Atlantic. On a clear night, between hisses and crackles, young Billig might be rewarded with a minute or so of pure, unadulterated Elvis. </p> <p>By the time Radio One hit the airwaves seven years later, British rock bands dominated the charts. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones acknowledged their debt to early influences from black America. Indeed, the whole history of rock'n'roll has been portrayed as white artists \"ripping off\" black music. Only now has the major Jewish contribution been acknowledged. </p> <p> For that we can thank Billig, who grew up to become professor of social sciences at Loughborough University. He would write books on Freud and fascism. He would become an expert on far-right ideology. Then he would write Rock 'n' Roll Jews, a labour of love which came about by chance. </p> <p> He was compiling a tape of rock music for his daughter's bat mitzvah and, in keeping with the occasion, he concentrated on songs with Jewish composers. \"To my surprise, song after well-known pop song, revealed itself to be 'Jewish music',\" he writes, \"from Presley to the softer sounds of the Drifters and Phil Spector. So much of the rebellious music which I had loved in my youth and which seemed to be a window into a foreign, dangerous world, turned out to be a product of familiar surroundings. Surprise was mingled with delight.\" </p> <p>When those emotions had cooled, his analytical instincts took over. He began to investigate. Inevitably, his book concentrates on American society and the complex relationship between black and Jewish people which shaped popular entertainment in the 20th century. But there are resonances for society in Britain. After all, our two cultures were intertwined by the output of Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley even before Irving Berlin's White Christmas hit the shops. </p> <p>It would become the biggest selling record of all time - a secular celebration of a Christian festival written by a man whose real name was Israel Baline. With the exception of Cole Porter, almost every writer of musicals in the pre-rock era was Jewish, even if their names sometimes suggested otherwise. Three decades later, Robert Zimmerman would change his name to Bob Dylan before fleeing to New York from a small town where Jews were still barred from the local country club. </p> <p>\"Anti-Semitism led to a fear of appearing too Jewish in public,\" says Billig. Only in the last two or three decades, it would seem, have those fears subsided. Back in 1964 Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel had to be persuaded by a black producer at Columbia Records not to change their names to something more gentile. </p> <p>Jewish and black people were unwelcome on Wall Street for many years. So they looked to areas where there were fewer barriers. The so-called \"race\" labels, which played black rhythm and blues, proved profitable. \"Unlike mainstream white businessmen, whose lack of imagination or fastidious prejudices kept them from doing business with black producers and customers, these Jews dealt successfully in this corner of the market,\" Billig says. </p> <p>Jewish and black people had much in common. They were victims of prejudice and they lived close to one another. The young Jerry Leiber, one half of the successful Jewish songwriting team Leiber and Stoller, used to deliver coal to black families in his poor neighbourhood of Baltimore. It was the music emanating from their radios that inspired him. He and Mike Stoller were still in their teens when they wrote Hound Dog for a black blues singer called Willie Mae Thornton. It became rather better known when it was taken up by Elvis Presley. </p> <p>The British public remained, for the most part, unaware of the complex racial divisions which made the US market so unpredictable. In 1966, for instance, Ike and Tina Turner's River Deep, Mountain High became a big hit in Britain. Yet in America it flopped, much to the astonishment of its Jewish producer, Phil Spector. Ike offered an intriguing explanation. The rhythm and blues stations in the US wouldn't play it, he claimed, because it sounded too white. To the white stations, though, Tina's voice sounded \"too R and B\". Too black, in other words. </p> <p>Racial divisions were hardening again in the US, after a brief period when Spector's productions for groups including the Ronnettes, and Leiber and Stoller's songs for the Drifters and Coasters, found airtime on white as well as black stations. \"There was a missed opportunity in the mid-60s,\" Billig says, \"when Leiber and Stoller and Jerry Wexler [the Jewish producer who played a big part in creating soul music] set up their own record labels without taking any black people into economic partnership. As the 60s moved on, it became a matter of pride for black American youngsters to buy music by black artists.\" Motown fitted the bill by providing black artists, black writers and a black owner. </p> <p>Today, the music market in Britain is fragmenting into niche markets as never before. But at least the stations are divided by taste - not race. </p> <p> <strong>Early influences</strong><br></p> <p>British Jews in the early days of rock'n'roll tended to confine themselves to management. An exception was the singer Frankie Vaughan, (real name Abelson) who made hit records but belonged to the glitzier end of showbusiness - \"uncool and delightfully dated in the age of rock\", as Billig puts it in his book. </p> <p>Certainly, Vaughan appealed more to the mature female fan than Billy Fury and Marty Wilde and other stars from the stable run by the Jewish Larry Parnes. All would become terminally uncool when the Beatles arrived, guided by their Jewish manager, Brian Epstein, and changed everything. </p> <p>Some people of a certain age can trace their conversion to Beatlemania back to John Lennon's version of Twist and Shout, rasped out on a long-forgotten programme called Thank Your Lucky Stars during the bleak winter of 1963. </p> <p>Few knew, or cared, that the song had previously been recorded by the black Isley Brothers.

The pheasant shooting season began on October 1 and a hail of lead awaits these birds. But another storm surrounds them: pheasants have friends and resistance to the annual slaughter is under way. </p> <p>Cwm mountain is a beautiful and enigmatic cluster of the Y Wenallt, Maes y castell and Gallt y Goedhwch hilltops rising 200 metres above the valley of Cwm Nant-y-meichiaid in mid-Wales. The young pheasants here have been intensively reared in a game farm, held in cages like free-range chickens then released on to the hill. </p> <p>With its wooden lower slopes and open sheep-grazed tops, Cwm mountain is like many other hills nearby, but it has strange fenced patches of brassicas - kale, rape and turnip - some covering a couple of acres; feeding hoppers are dotted around; the woods conceal huge fenced enclosures and a new road for 4x4s is blazed across its face. The pheasant business has a profound impact on this ancient landscape, creating an eerie paranoia, broken only by barrages of gunfire when the shoot is on. </p> <p>Although the odd bit of shooting has been practised here for years and there was a pre-war estate shoot on Cwm mountain, these pheasants are part of a new phenomenon. The social make-up of the countryside has changed dramatically over the last few decades and the acceptance of traditional field sports is being challenged. </p> <p>The farmers who own the mountain and have sold or leased the shooting rights see it as a way of supplementing their income during troubled times. The majority of people who live around the mountain are against it. They, apart from a dry-stone waller, do not work on the land. They are teachers, artists, engineers and business people; quite a few are retired. </p> <p>\"It took 36 years in the Royal Navy to get this,\" says Kit Davidson, secretary of the Cwm Mountain Residents, standing outside his restored farmhouse where he and his wife have lived for the past two years. \"When I started my objection to the pheasant shoot I was a Nimby,\" he admits, \"but after a lot of research and exposure to the protest here I now object to sport shooting on welfare and environmental grounds everywhere. Now I'm an environmentalist\". </p> <p>The position of the protesters is tenuous. Some have lived here all their lives, some are recent incomers; they all want good relations with their neighbours but they all share a passion for this place, threatened by what they see as a cruel sport which they fear also puts them, their families and wildlife at risk. \"Townie. Get back to the city where you came from. You English are all the same,\" yell a van load of beaters at an impromptu protest against a recent shoot. </p> <p>This irony is not lost on the Cwm Mountain Residents who are protesting against the shooters coming out from English cities. A protester, Kath Morell, was warned off land she has walked on for many years by a gamekeeper. \"He effed and blinded at me and said I should go back where I came from,\" Morell said, \"but I've been a teacher in a local school for 30 years\". </p> <p>\"We are saturated with pheasants and partridge, there are three times as many of them this year and the shooting goes on around the houses,\" says Tom Hughes, a Welsh-speaking retired headmaster and local historian. \"I can't see the point, killing birds that have been artificially reared like this, it's disgusting.\" </p> <p>So what is the point? The man behind the Cwm mountain shoot, and 30 others in the vicinity, is Christopher Williams. I ask Williams if I can accompany him on a shoot to find out what it is like but he refuses; because of adverse publicity the shooting syndicate he represents does not want a journalist around. He will not say who the members of the syndicate are, how many birds have been bred and released, or what kind of financial investments have been made. </p> <p>Williams is not about to give away any commercial information and is worried that any information he gives will be seized on by the Cwm Mountain Residents. \"They just want to stick the knife in,\" he complains. His shoots, which involve three syndicates, are not, Williams insists, about making money but about providing legitimate sport for friends. </p> <p>Although protesters claim to have discovered carbon dioxide fire extinguishers at badger setts, Williams says nothing untoward is going on and claims the shoots provide employment and put money into the local economy. \"Controlling vermin like crows, magpies, stoats and weasels maintains the balance in the countryside,\" he says. \"All the major conservation organisations agree that shooting benefits wildlife, so there can be no environmental objection. We abide by the law and sportsman's rules and behave in the proper way.\" So what is the sport in killing these birds? \"A sportsman shoots to kill cleanly,\" Williams explains, \"but if killing is absolutely certain then the sportsman doesn't shoot, there has to be the element of doubt for it to be sporting\". </p> <p>The protest from the Cwm Mountain Residents is a new experience for Williams and, says a spokesman from the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, it is rare to have organised opposition like this anywhere in the country. There is a reluctance, even from environmental organisations, to take on the shooting lobby. Unlike fox hunting, pheasant shooting has not yet raised much public passion. This may be about to change. </p> <p>The animal rights and anti-cruelty organisation Animal Aid has just launched a report (The Killing Fields: the pheasant shooting industry) and its devastating impact on \"game\" birds and British wildlife. This report claims that pheasant shooting is really a multi-million pound agribusiness which subjects millions of birds to the mutilations, disease and stress of intensive rearing. About 36 million pheasants are shot each year but a further 12 million suffer injuries and are never recovered. This also involves the killing of five million wild birds and mammals in so-called \"vermin\" control and often results in the death of protected species. About 75,000 metric tonnes of lead shot falls on the countryside each year. </p> <p>Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, says: \"I don't believe the public has any idea of the scale and squalid nature of the modern pheasant industry and its devastating impact on the countryside. I commend the efforts of the Cwm Mountain Residents in their valiant battle to protect the ecology and tranquillity of their beautiful part of Britain.\" <br></p> <p>\u0095 Cwm Mountain Residents can be contact ed by email at: <a href=\"mailto:cwmmountain@madasafish.com\"> cwmmountain@madasafish.com</a> and the Animal Aid website is at <a href=\"http://www.animalaid.org.uk\">www.animalaid.org.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>In the wake of the fuel crisis, there is increasing evidence that the oil industry colluded with protesters to cut the country's fuel supply. But why? </p> <p>The answer lies in a story of machiavellian political manoeuvring. It is the story of how a group of multinationals can bring the government to its knees, and extract ever greater profits from the public finances. It's a story about tax, but not at the pump - it's about tax in the North Sea. </p> <p>What happened during the last two days of the fuel crisis was a threat, a flexing of oil industry muscle in a strong warning to the government to leave the North Sea alone. The companies came close to showing they could bring down the government. And if Gordon Brown makes the wrong tax moves, they could try to go the whole way. </p> <p>Much of today's tax on petrol originated in Norman Lamont's 1993 budget, when he increased petrol duty by 10%, and set up the \"fuel duty escalator\" which would increase duty by a further 3% above inflation each year. He also introduced the hugely unpopular VAT on domestic fuel. </p> <p>The oil industry was quiet about these changes - perhaps because the same budget cut North Sea oil taxes. Lamont slashed petroleum revenue tax (PRT) from 75% to 50% on existing fields, and abolished it altogether for fields developed after the 1993 budget. This means new fields pay no royalties at all for oil extracted. </p> <p>So it was two taxes for the consumer, and a cut for the corporates. This suited the big oil companies. The biggest winner was BP, whose share price immediately rose by 6.4%. Analysts said profits would be boosted annually by \u00a3130m to \u00a3140m. Shell would gain \u00a340m. </p> <p>But not all the oil companies were celebrating. Along with PRT Lamont also abolished the tax reliefs and allowances that had been keeping some smaller companies going. </p> <p>The big oil companies made a killing on the North Sea changes. Profits are much higher in the \"upstream\" activities of oil exploration and production than in the \"downstream\" area of forecourt retailing. A rise in fuel duties therefore did not impact on company profitability, as it is mostly passed on to consumers. </p> <p>In the past 10 years, North Sea oil industry operating profits have almost doubled from \u00a37.5bn in 1988 to \u00a313bn in 1999. But in the same period, government revenues dropped from \u00a33bn to \u00a32.5bn. The UK's North Sea has become the world's second cheapest oil-producing region after Ireland. </p> <p>Yet things changed in 1997 as Brown, the new Labour chancellor, began exploring options for raising taxation in the North Sea. The subsequent lobbying campaign he faced was one of the biggest the country has ever seen. The might of the oil industry argued vigorously that given the technical unfavourability of the North Sea, and without fiscal advantages, the companies would have no choice but to pull out of the UK. They knew the government would not risk that outcome. </p> <p>The real clinching argument was that oil prices were also at rock bottom, down to $8 a barrel. Then oil companies successfully argued that their low margins could not sustain an increase in tax. In September 1998, Brown announced that he would not change the tax regime, stating that oil prices were too low. </p> <p>The industry campaign was, however, based on a lie. While all this was going on, a survey found that in two consecutive years, 1997 and 1998, Britain was the oil industry's favourite investment region, in no small part because of the tax regime. </p> <p>It's not hard to see why. Oil reserves are legally the property of the crown. In most countries, companies which extract reserves pay the country for what they take away, through royalties and taxation. Yet in Britain, the only charge oil companies pay to the government is corporation tax, which they have to pay anyway. In other words, they take away the oil for free, and go on to sell it at a healthy profit. </p> <p>But by 1999, two years later, oil prices had nearly quadrupled to more than $30 a barrel, presenting industry with a worry - their main anti-tax argument had fallen away. Brown, faced with growing public support for a cut in fuel duty, was looking for alternatives. The exchequer might try to recoup the revenue upstream from the oil companies to make up for a consumer tax cut. </p> <p>When blockades began at Shell's Stanlow refinery in Cheshire, Shell could have had the protesters cleared in hours if it wanted to. Panic buying meant that fuel reserves were quickly depleted, catching oil companies, government and police on the hop. But the oil companies fast recognised how they could use the situation. All the key UK players - Esso, BP, Shell, TotalFinaElf and Texaco - have refineries in France which were blockaded. Their first-hand experience left them far more informed in dealing with the situation than protesters, police or the government. </p> <p>At Britain's nine refineries some had significant protests. Others had fewer than than 20 protesters, not even blocking the road. One might have thought this would present an opportunity for some of the companies to take advantage of their competitors being out of action. </p> <p>But in fact, all of the companies - whatever the size of the protests outside their gates, however aggressive or meek, however much pressure to supply, or sales to be made - came out with a remarkably uniform response: \"We are concerned for the safety of our drivers.\" </p> <p>It wasn't until Tuesday afternoon that the government began to realise that the companies were deliberately holding back their drivers. On Tuesday, Tony Blair personally contacted oil company chief executives, ordering them to restart supplies, which they didn't. The following day, the prime minister called company executives in, this time pleading. </p> <p>At the Wednesday meeting, the companies' made a public statement and action was far weaker than Blair had demanded. The final restarting of supplies under police escort on Thursday morning was both reluctant and late. The damage to the government had been done. </p> <p>With oil prices at a 10-year high, the North Sea is still ripe for the chancellor's picking. But clearly the oil companies are prepared for a fight. </p> <p>\u0095 Greg Muttitt of Corporate Watch and James Marriott are researchers who have been studying the activities of the oil industry for the last five years</p>",

      "bodyText": "The best television and radio treatment of mental illness will be celebrated later this month in the annual mental health media awards. But a ruling this week by the Broadcasting Standards Commission shows some programme makers have a long way to go. The ruling, against cult Channel 4 programme The 11 O'Clock Show, also offers further evidence that some of those behind \"challenging\" content of both broadcast and written media appear to regard offensiveness as beyond criticism if it is presented in a supposedly ironic way. The edition of The 11 O'Clock Show in question referred to \"mentals sitting in their own shit and wanking\". Complainants to the commission, including Greater London Action on Disability (Glad), said that the language used was going too far - even in the context of a spoof report broadcast late at night.

In that light, can I congratulate you for your thought-provoking and sensitive account of Rufus May's experiences in and around the mental health services (Spying on the psychiatrists, September 20). </p> <p>The world seems obsessed with headlines such as \"Free to kill - lunatics left to roam streets butcher 90 people a year\" (News of the World). It is therefore life-affirming to read a story that essentially boils down to \"man has psychotic experiences, yet survives the mental health services and goes on to contribute positively to the world\". </p> <p>Thank you for reaffirming at least a minimal faith in the power of journalism.</p> <p><strong>Peter Kinderman</strong></p> <p> Reader in clinical psychology, University of Liverpool </p> <p><strong> Conflict of interest</strong><br></p> <p> Joyce Struthers (Letters, September 27) rightly condemns the compromising of independent assessment inherent in government proposals that local authorities should act as scrutineers of health services in whose provision they are themselves involved. A similar conflict of interest arises when, as is increasingly the case, watchdog bodies such as Age Concern are commissioned to provide services like day care centres and emergency call facilities for the elderly. Scrutiny and service delivery functions should surely never be the responsibility of the same organisation. </p> <p> <strong> Bob Heys</strong></p> <p> Halifax <br></p> <p> <strong> Charity fat cats</strong><br></p> <p> While preparing to write in support of Diana Grimes (Letters, September 6), I was astonished to see in the same issue an advert offering a salary of \u00a375,000 for a director of Oxfam. </p> <p>I have strongly supported this organisation since its inception because of its high principles, but now wonder whether applicants for this post will apply because they truly wish to work for the cause or just for the high salary. Is \u00a375,000 nowadays really considered the \"fair living wage\" which I always understood that Oxfam offered its workers? No wonder it is difficult to recruit volunteers. </p> <p>It seems necessary to scrutinise the annual reports of all charitable organisations much more carefully before giving time or money. I feel cheated of the pleasure of \"doing my bit\" in good faith. <br></p> <p><strong> Beryl Gibson</strong> </p> <p> Nottingham <br> </p> <p><strong> Risk benefit</strong><br></p> <p> Ray and Jean Greek's article advocating a ban on xeno-transplantation (Xenophobia, September 20) did a disservice to your readers as it gave an unbalanced view of the topic. </p> <p>Those carrying out research in this field are fully aware of the potential risks of transplanting organs or cells from animals to humans, but are also aware of the immense benefits to the community if xenotransplantation could be performed successfully and safely. Many millions suffering from such diverse conditions as diabetes and degenerative brain disease may have the quality of their lives vastly improved. </p> <p>In those with advanced organ failure, xenotransplantation will be life-saving. In the US, almost 70,000 currently await a human donor organ, but only 20,000 organs will become available this year. At least 10 people die every day while waiting. </p> <p>The article listed the so-called \"alternatives\" to xenotransplants. These include efforts to increase human organ donation, which unfortunately will never supply the number of organs and cells required, and approaches such as the use of stem cells, which is a branch of science in its absolute infancy and which may never develop into a medical therapy where it will provide whole human organs for transplantation. Much as we should encourage potential alternatives, on present evidence it seems they will not provide a solution. </p> <p>Well over 150 patients have been exposed to pig cells in recent years. Cells taken from carefully screened pigs have been used in the treatment of patients with diabetes, certain neurological diseases, or liver failure. There has, as yet, been no definite evidence of the transfer of a porcine infection. </p> <p>Nevertheless, as with almost every medical or scientific advance, we agree that it will be impossible to exclude all risk, even if this is related only to hitherto unknown pig bacteria or viruses. The ultimate decision whether to employ any new therapeutic agent or medical procedure rests on an assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. As the potential benefits to individuals or society increase, it becomes warranted to accept slightly increased potential risk. Without in any way reducing our obligation to take all possible steps to minimise any perceived risk to society, we surely have a moral obligation to those less fortunate than ourselves to accept a small risk to the community if the new therapy leads to great benefit to many individuals within that community. <br></p> <p> <strong> David Cooper</strong></p> <p> President, International Xenotransplantation Association</p> <p> Montreal, Canada<br></p> <p><strong> Us and them</strong> <br></p> <p>To my concern, I discovered that Michael Simmons's article (Golden oldies, September 27) was one I was not intended to read. </p> <p>Addressed to your readers with an all inclusive \"we\", the article asked readers how charitable \"we\" are towards older people, how much thought \"we\" give them as they retire or when \"we\" give them an extra 75p. </p> <p>I was not aware that the Guardian editorial policy was to exclude older people from its readership. Can \"we\" Guardian readers be told what the age limit is? Being over 65, I am rather concerned as to when I should stop buying. <br></p> <p><strong> Joyce Williams</strong></p> <p> Rotherham</p> <p>\u0095 Write to Guardian Society, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\"> society@theguardian.com</a> Please supply your full address.

In that light, can I congratulate you for your thought-provoking and sensitive account of Rufus May's experiences in and around the mental health services (Spying on the psychiatrists, September 20). The world seems obsessed with headlines such as \"Free to kill - lunatics left to roam streets butcher 90 people a year\" (News of the World). It is therefore life-affirming to read a story that essentially boils down to \"man has psychotic experiences, yet survives the mental health services and goes on to contribute positively to the world\". Thank you for reaffirming at least a minimal faith in the power of journalism. Peter Kinderman Reader in clinical psychology, University of Liverpool Conflict of interest Joyce Struthers (Letters, September 27) rightly condemns the compromising of independent assessment inherent in government proposals that local authorities should act as scrutineers of health services in whose provision they are themselves involved. A similar conflict of interest arises when, as is increasingly the case, watchdog bodies such as Age Concern are commissioned to provide services like day care centres and emergency call facilities for the elderly. Scrutiny and service delivery functions should surely never be the responsibility of the same organisation. Bob Heys Halifax Charity fat cats While preparing to write in support of Diana Grimes (Letters, September 6), I was astonished to see in the same issue an advert offering a salary of \u00a375,000 for a director of Oxfam. I have strongly supported this organisation since its inception because of its high principles, but now wonder whether applicants for this post will apply because they truly wish to work for the cause or just for the high salary. Is \u00a375,000 nowadays really considered the \"fair living wage\" which I always understood that Oxfam offered its workers? No wonder it is difficult to recruit volunteers. It seems necessary to scrutinise the annual reports of all charitable organisations much more carefully before giving time or money. I feel cheated of the pleasure of \"doing my bit\" in good faith. Beryl Gibson Nottingham Risk benefit Ray and Jean Greek's article advocating a ban on xeno-transplantation (Xenophobia, September 20) did a disservice to your readers as it gave an unbalanced view of the topic. Those carrying out research in this field are fully aware of the potential risks of transplanting organs or cells from animals to humans, but are also aware of the immense benefits to the community if xenotransplantation could be performed successfully and safely. Many millions suffering from such diverse conditions as diabetes and degenerative brain disease may have the quality of their lives vastly improved. In those with advanced organ failure, xenotransplantation will be life-saving. In the US, almost 70,000 currently await a human donor organ, but only 20,000 organs will become available this year. At least 10 people die every day while waiting. The article listed the so-called \"alternatives\" to xenotransplants. These include efforts to increase human organ donation, which unfortunately will never supply the number of organs and cells required, and approaches such as the use of stem cells, which is a branch of science in its absolute infancy and which may never develop into a medical therapy where it will provide whole human organs for transplantation. Much as we should encourage potential alternatives, on present evidence it seems they will not provide a solution. Well over 150 patients have been exposed to pig cells in recent years. Cells taken from carefully screened pigs have been used in the treatment of patients with diabetes, certain neurological diseases, or liver failure. There has, as yet, been no definite evidence of the transfer of a porcine infection. Nevertheless, as with almost every medical or scientific advance, we agree that it will be impossible to exclude all risk, even if this is related only to hitherto unknown pig bacteria or viruses. The ultimate decision whether to employ any new therapeutic agent or medical procedure rests on an assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. As the potential benefits to individuals or society increase, it becomes warranted to accept slightly increased potential risk. Without in any way reducing our obligation to take all possible steps to minimise any perceived risk to society, we surely have a moral obligation to those less fortunate than ourselves to accept a small risk to the community if the new therapy leads to great benefit to many individuals within that community. David Cooper President, International Xenotransplantation Association Montreal, Canada Us and them To my concern, I discovered that Michael Simmons's article (Golden oldies, September 27) was one I was not intended to read. Addressed to your readers with an all inclusive \"we\", the article asked readers how charitable \"we\" are towards older people, how much thought \"we\" give them as they retire or when \"we\" give them an extra 75p. I was not aware that the Guardian editorial policy was to exclude older people from its readership. Can \"we\" Guardian readers be told what the age limit is? Being over 65, I am rather concerned as to when I should stop buying.

Michael Heseltine's Life In The Jungle (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320) promised to be different: the millionaire politician who had toppled Thatcher only to have his cherished ambition of becoming PM thwarted. A story of Shakespearian power and drama. The big reviewing beasts were rounded up to pass judgment and did not disappoint. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Marr</strong>, in the <strong>Observer</strong>, amusingly painted the typical politician's memoir: \"The early life, with its interesting revelations of family eccentricity and tough, ambition-forging times, is followed by the Oxbridge years, when lifelong political friendships and contacts are formed. Then comes the breathless account of the first constituency campaign, the charmingly self-mocking account of that terrifying maiden speech, the gruff advice from Sir Old Salt MP - what a character! - then the tramp, tramp, tramp of departmental achievements.

And - hey presto! - it's time to call the chap at the Daily Mail who apparently pays such a lot to extract the microwaved grudges. Strangely, Our Hero has no examples of his own of petty spite, failure of vision or genuine remorse to record.\" </p> <p>So much for the Normans. What about Hezza's book? \"This autobiography follows the pattern but it is vastly better than most,\" said Marr. \"Heseltine says he does not find writing (or reading) easy and he is not an exciting prose writer. But, presumably thanks to veteran journalist Anthony Howard, who has been a close friend since student days and helped with it, this is one of the most elegant, politically informative and, in the widest sense, literate reviews of a political life in many years. It is not up there with the great autobiographies of Healey or Jenkins, but it stands easy comparison with Thatcher, Major or Lawson.\" </p> <p>Elegant was not the word that sprang to the mind of <strong>John Campbell</strong>, biographer of Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath, who reviewed the book in the <strong>Independent</strong>. \"The whole book is a let-down. Where is the flamboyance, the showmanship, the relish that made Heseltine such an exciting politician? It is well known - and duly acknowledged - that he was helped in the writing by his old friend Anthony Howard. Yet whereas grey John Major turned out in his autobiography to be a deft and disarming writer, Heseltine the conference orator and combative interviewee is reduced to anonymity on the page.\" Campbell drew a large conclusion from Heseltine's uninspiring prose style: \"Perhaps that really is the man: a much more decent, cautious and conventional character than his swashbuckling image suggests. He loves birds and his trees, but has no interest in any of the arts. He has been happily married for nearly 40 years, and has no time for the Archers, Aitkens and others who messed up their careers and the Tory government by sexual and financial misdemeanours. The legend of Tarzan swinging through the political jungle is curiously diminished. Perhaps deputy prime minister was his level after all.\" </p> <p><strong>Hugo Young</strong>, in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, reached a similar conclusion, on both the memoirist and the politician: \"Although it is a long book, it's a disappointingly small one. The horizons remain unaddressed: many large events he saw and took part in do not feature here. A man who seemed to be a quintessential exponent of high politics has written a memoir that, to a large extent, eschews them. \"It offers mini-glimpses that startle and reveal. Heseltine wanted Chris Patten, instead of going to Hong Kong, to be the first recipient of a constitutional innovation, and take a one-term life peerage prior to fighting the next election. He says that when he failed to beat Major for the leadership, he was \u00efin tears'. He reveals that the Dome could have been an even worse catastrophe: there was a time when Hyde Park was thought to be the place for it. But ultimately the book exposes a narrower man than the big politician who wrote it. Or perhaps not. Maybe, in the end, the minister as manager, as armchair quarter-master, as urban renewer, as competitiveness addict at the DTI, as tunnel-vision European, is what Michael Heseltine was. Not the supreme leader deprived of his just deserts, but perhaps a man without the spaciousness for the highest of high politics.\" </p> <p>The Times and Telegraph opted to have the book reviewed by former colleagues rather than political commentators. <strong>John Major</strong>, in the <strong>Times</strong>, was dull. No evidence here of writerly deftness. \"Michael Heseltine is one of the most exotic of postwar politicians and his autobiography does not disappoint,\" said the former PM. \"Surprisingly revealing, dotted with characteristic bon mots, it contains the political substance that lay beneath his flamboyant presentation. In the parts of his narrative of which I have personal knowledge, his account is balanced and fair without embroidering to his own advantage.\" He went on, at tiresome length, to discuss those parts of the narrative: the Westland affair has never seemed more soporific. </p> <p><strong>Norman Tebbit</strong>, in the <strong>Telegraph</strong> (now there's a surprise), was far livelier and much more revealing, though mainly about his own capacity to hate. \"As the Millennium Dome approaches total meltdown its creator publishes his autobiography,\" Tebbit began. \"Pre-sold as the book that would do the dirt on Margaret Thatcher, it only repeats - with added hysteria - Heseltine's oft-repeated refrain: 'I was right; she was wrong.' Long passages of the book are turgid, not to say self-serving. How I rebuilt London Docklands; how I saved Liverpool; how I saved Concorde; almost built Maplin airport; cleared the dossers off the streets of London; and many other triumphs. Above all, How I Saved My Party and The Nation from the poisonous cheat Margaret Thatcher. It is not exactly a bag of laughs, although few of us who know Heseltine will not be moved to laughter by the revelation of his school nickname - 'Great Tit'.\" Tebbit plunged the knife in in his intro and spent the rest of the review twisting it. \"There is really nothing new in this book. No smoking gun in Margaret Thatcher's hand. Extraordinarily, Heseltine says that once she was brought down her 'poison' was drained and all was well. At the time of her fall in 1990 the Tory majority was 101. By 1997, 210 Tories had lost their seats and Labour had gained 189, giving Blair a 179-seat majority. Heseltine's political epitaph must be: 'He brought down Margaret Thatcher and raised up Tony Blair.' Yet he remains happy with his work. It is a tragic story of obsession and vanity.\" </p> <p>In terms of telling you whether the book is any good, Tebbit's knife-wielding is completely useless. But as a bilious rant it's a riot, and certainly cheered up my morning train journey into work. Blind prejudice in reviewers, while despicable, can be jolly good fun. </p>",

But, presumably thanks to veteran journalist Anthony Howard, who has been a close friend since student days and helped with it, this is one of the most elegant, politically informative and, in the widest sense, literate reviews of a political life in many years. It is not up there with the great autobiographies of Healey or Jenkins, but it stands easy comparison with Thatcher, Major or Lawson.\" Elegant was not the word that sprang to the mind of John Campbell, biographer of Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath, who reviewed the book in the Independent. \"The whole book is a let-down. Where is the flamboyance, the showmanship, the relish that made Heseltine such an exciting politician? It is well known - and duly acknowledged - that he was helped in the writing by his old friend Anthony Howard. Yet whereas grey John Major turned out in his autobiography to be a deft and disarming writer, Heseltine the conference orator and combative interviewee is reduced to anonymity on the page.\" Campbell drew a large conclusion from Heseltine's uninspiring prose style: \"Perhaps that really is the man: a much more decent, cautious and conventional character than his swashbuckling image suggests. He loves birds and his trees, but has no interest in any of the arts. He has been happily married for nearly 40 years, and has no time for the Archers, Aitkens and others who messed up their careers and the Tory government by sexual and financial misdemeanours. The legend of Tarzan swinging through the political jungle is curiously diminished. Perhaps deputy prime minister was his level after all.\" Hugo Young, in the Guardian, reached a similar conclusion, on both the memoirist and the politician: \"Although it is a long book, it's a disappointingly small one. The horizons remain unaddressed: many large events he saw and took part in do not feature here. A man who seemed to be a quintessential exponent of high politics has written a memoir that, to a large extent, eschews them. \"It offers mini-glimpses that startle and reveal. Heseltine wanted Chris Patten, instead of going to Hong Kong, to be the first recipient of a constitutional innovation, and take a one-term life peerage prior to fighting the next election. He says that when he failed to beat Major for the leadership, he was \u00efin tears'. He reveals that the Dome could have been an even worse catastrophe: there was a time when Hyde Park was thought to be the place for it. But ultimately the book exposes a narrower man than the big politician who wrote it. Or perhaps not. Maybe, in the end, the minister as manager, as armchair quarter-master, as urban renewer, as competitiveness addict at the DTI, as tunnel-vision European, is what Michael Heseltine was. Not the supreme leader deprived of his just deserts, but perhaps a man without the spaciousness for the highest of high politics.\" The Times and Telegraph opted to have the book reviewed by former colleagues rather than political commentators. John Major, in the Times, was dull. No evidence here of writerly deftness. \"Michael Heseltine is one of the most exotic of postwar politicians and his autobiography does not disappoint,\" said the former PM. \"Surprisingly revealing, dotted with characteristic bon mots, it contains the political substance that lay beneath his flamboyant presentation. In the parts of his narrative of which I have personal knowledge, his account is balanced and fair without embroidering to his own advantage.\" He went on, at tiresome length, to discuss those parts of the narrative: the Westland affair has never seemed more soporific. Norman Tebbit, in the Telegraph (now there's a surprise), was far livelier and much more revealing, though mainly about his own capacity to hate. \"As the Millennium Dome approaches total meltdown its creator publishes his autobiography,\" Tebbit began. \"Pre-sold as the book that would do the dirt on Margaret Thatcher, it only repeats - with added hysteria - Heseltine's oft-repeated refrain: 'I was right; she was wrong.' Long passages of the book are turgid, not to say self-serving. How I rebuilt London Docklands; how I saved Liverpool; how I saved Concorde; almost built Maplin airport; cleared the dossers off the streets of London; and many other triumphs. Above all, How I Saved My Party and The Nation from the poisonous cheat Margaret Thatcher. It is not exactly a bag of laughs, although few of us who know Heseltine will not be moved to laughter by the revelation of his school nickname - 'Great Tit'.\" Tebbit plunged the knife in in his intro and spent the rest of the review twisting it. \"There is really nothing new in this book. No smoking gun in Margaret Thatcher's hand. Extraordinarily, Heseltine says that once she was brought down her 'poison' was drained and all was well. At the time of her fall in 1990 the Tory majority was 101. By 1997, 210 Tories had lost their seats and Labour had gained 189, giving Blair a 179-seat majority. Heseltine's political epitaph must be: 'He brought down Margaret Thatcher and raised up Tony Blair.' Yet he remains happy with his work. It is a tragic story of obsession and vanity.\" In terms of telling you whether the book is any good, Tebbit's knife-wielding is completely useless. But as a bilious rant it's a riot, and certainly cheered up my morning train journey into work. Blind prejudice in reviewers, while despicable, can be jolly good fun.",

      "body": "<p>At the launch of the Social Democratic party at the Connaught Rooms in 1981, the four top people sat on a raised dais, the remaining 20-odd on a lower one. John Grant, who has died of cancer aged 67, though a frontbench spokesman on industry and employment, sat lower down. He had switched to the new party after 13 years as a Labour MP, in a move that effectively destroyed his political career. But he remains of real interest to anyone refining the history of British politics in that period.</p> <p>A genial, pepperish Londoner, Grant was, firstly, a journalist, working for the Daily Express from 1955 to 1970 (from 1967 as its chief industrial correspondent), before becoming MP for Islington East (later Central). Having contested Beckenham for Labour in 1966, he had been selected ahead of the 1970 election. He won the seat comfortably, but was defeated as a Social Democrat in 1983, after that party missed its chance of take-off when, before the Falklands war, it enjoyed over 50% in the polls.</p> <p>It is difficult, at a time when Labour is New Labour, to recall that, in the late 1970s, it was turning into a party of rabid leftwing excess. Grant was one of many right-of-centre regulars threatened by the intrusion of virulent youngish men and women calling for socialism and blood, prolonging routine meetings until late into the night as they sought compliance or deselection. All the Islington MPs - including Grant's friend, the notable George Cunningham, and the less esteemed Michael O'Halloran - were under such assault.</p> <p>I recall a lunch in rural Sussex, taken in flight from Labour's menace-flecked Brighton conference of 1981, when Grant, Cunningham and Bruce Douglas-Mann, representative and able moderates, grimly agreed that they had had enough, and discussed the prospects for a new party.</p> <p>In due course, Grant left Labour, and twice fought elections under the SDP flag. He was honourably defeated at Islington North in 1983; then, after the boundary commission scrambling of that borough, he fought Carshalton, where he lost again. He was also the author of two books, Member Of Parliament (1974) and Blood Brothers (1992), about his two occupations, MP and trade unionist.</p> <p>After defeat, Grant made a reasonable career for himself. A particular friend had long been the illusionless ex-communist, Frank (now Lord) Chapple, who had been almost alone in an open and defiant rightwing stand at a time when Scargills were bought on that market at a premium. Grant worked as public relations chief for Chapple's union, the EEPTU, from 1984 to 1989. After 1990, he was also a member of the Radio Authority, and became chairman of Radio South-East.</p> <p>His political career before the split, though it never reached high ministerial rank, had been steady and quick to start. Harold Wilson gave him junior frontbench status, shadowing on press and broadcasting, in 1971, only a year after he entered parliament. On the formation of the third Wilson administration in February 1974, he became junior minister for the civil service department. He was soon shifted sideways to be junior at the new Department of Overseas Development, from 1974-76, before a final shift, under James Callaghan, to the job at employment for which his previous experience best qualified him.</p> <p>Grant's candid failure to make even perfunctory leftwing noises, at a time when cringeing was the norm, did him no good. And his style - perky, combative and with a distinctive London intonation - was a little below the salt for a Labour government even then; one of his recreations was the barber's shop quartet. But if he didn't rise, he was good enough to stay in ministerial office throughout the five years of the Wilson-Callaghan governments.</p> <p>An image of the SDP as wine-wise, middle-class and exclusively made up of ardent friends of Europe, has always been overstated. Far leftism, in its destructive heyday, harried and offended rough-handed, working Labour members quite as much as it irked men from Balliol.</p> <p>Grant was always cool about Europe, and was not a graduate - he was educated at the Stationers' Company's school, Hornsey, before working on provincial newspapers. He was, in fact, a representative - almost normative - Labour MP, with strong union roots and a good feel for the street. He differed from the norm, and went the extra mile to join those francophile Wykehamists because the brutalist assaults of the left enraged him, and because he had a large bump of courage.</p> <p>His wife Patricia, whom he married in 1955, survives him, as do two sons and a daughter.</p> <p><b> John Douglas Grant, politician and writer, born October 16 1932; died September 29 2000 </b></p>",

Grant was one of many right-of-centre regulars threatened by the intrusion of virulent youngish men and women calling for socialism and blood, prolonging routine meetings until late into the night as they sought compliance or deselection. All the Islington MPs - including Grant's friend, the notable George Cunningham, and the less esteemed Michael O'Halloran - were under such assault. I recall a lunch in rural Sussex, taken in flight from Labour's menace-flecked Brighton conference of 1981, when Grant, Cunningham and Bruce Douglas-Mann, representative and able moderates, grimly agreed that they had had enough, and discussed the prospects for a new party. In due course, Grant left Labour, and twice fought elections under the SDP flag. He was honourably defeated at Islington North in 1983; then, after the boundary commission scrambling of that borough, he fought Carshalton, where he lost again. He was also the author of two books, Member Of Parliament (1974) and Blood Brothers (1992), about his two occupations, MP and trade unionist. After defeat, Grant made a reasonable career for himself. A particular friend had long been the illusionless ex-communist, Frank (now Lord) Chapple, who had been almost alone in an open and defiant rightwing stand at a time when Scargills were bought on that market at a premium. Grant worked as public relations chief for Chapple's union, the EEPTU, from 1984 to 1989. After 1990, he was also a member of the Radio Authority, and became chairman of Radio South-East. His political career before the split, though it never reached high ministerial rank, had been steady and quick to start. Harold Wilson gave him junior frontbench status, shadowing on press and broadcasting, in 1971, only a year after he entered parliament. On the formation of the third Wilson administration in February 1974, he became junior minister for the civil service department. He was soon shifted sideways to be junior at the new Department of Overseas Development, from 1974-76, before a final shift, under James Callaghan, to the job at employment for which his previous experience best qualified him. Grant's candid failure to make even perfunctory leftwing noises, at a time when cringeing was the norm, did him no good. And his style - perky, combative and with a distinctive London intonation - was a little below the salt for a Labour government even then; one of his recreations was the barber's shop quartet. But if he didn't rise, he was good enough to stay in ministerial office throughout the five years of the Wilson-Callaghan governments. An image of the SDP as wine-wise, middle-class and exclusively made up of ardent friends of Europe, has always been overstated. Far leftism, in its destructive heyday, harried and offended rough-handed, working Labour members quite as much as it irked men from Balliol. Grant was always cool about Europe, and was not a graduate - he was educated at the Stationers' Company's school, Hornsey, before working on provincial newspapers. He was, in fact, a representative - almost normative - Labour MP, with strong union roots and a good feel for the street. He differed from the norm, and went the extra mile to join those francophile Wykehamists because the brutalist assaults of the left enraged him, and because he had a large bump of courage. His wife Patricia, whom he married in 1955, survives him, as do two sons and a daughter. John Douglas Grant, politician and writer, born October 16 1932; died September 29 2000",

      "body": "<p> My birthday only comes once a year. And what a great party! </p> <p> But Jack Straw gives the criminals a party every day while victims wait outside in the cold. </p> <p> His greetings telegram to the criminal is: 'don't worry, there are nearly 3,000 fewer police to catch you, and even if you are unlucky enough to be caught, I'll let you out of jail in record time.' </p> <p> In The Wizard of Oz, the Man of Straw had no brain. I can show you one with no heart and no courage as well. </p> <p> He and his friend Tony promised to be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'. All they've been tough on is the dwindling number of people trying to fight crime. Last year, I warned that the thin blue line was getting thinner. Now it's becoming a row of dots, which nobody wants to join. </p> <p> High on promises, low on action. Long on spin, short on truth. Drunk on power, incapable of delivery. </p> <p> It's not that they're short on rhetoric when it comes to victims. Remember what Tony Blair said in his speech last week? </p> <p> Tony Blair said that one of the big projects for the second term of a Labour government - and I quote - would be 'standing up for victims'. </p> <p> Why is he waiting for a second term? It's not as if he's going to get one. </p> <p> What a sense of priorities. They've spent the first term getting prisoners out of jail early, cutting the police force, multiplying red tape, and dreaming of drunks at cashpoints. The victim has to wait for the second term. </p> <p> By contrast, my first pledge as shadow home secretary, the very first policy I announced, was new rights for victims enshrined in law. </p> <p> That shows where this party's priorities lie. What about the rest of Jack Straw's record at the Home Office? </p> <p> Police numbers down, crime up, violent crime soaring, the asylum system in chaos, spies laughing at the country they betrayed\u0085 </p> <p> When we were debating rising crime under this Government, I asked Jack Straw whether crime would fall again. He said: 'That depends on the criminals.' </p> <p> I thought it was traditional for the British people to rely on their government to cut crime, not on the criminals. It cannot be common sense to fight crime with fewer crimefighters. It cannot be common sense, when the police have spent time and effort arresting people, to see the criminal back on the street before the police officer. It cannot be common sense to let prisoners sit around in idleness. It cannot be common sense to allow persistent young menaces to grow up with the belief that they are untouchable at law. It cannot be common sense to arrest the householder instead of the burglar. </p> <p> We need common sense. </p> <p> This country needs a well-motivated, strong police force that can protect everyone, regardless of race, colour or creed. But when the police have done their job, the public must be protected by proper, effective sentencing. </p> <p> When those sentences include custody, protecting the public doesn't end at the prison gate. It means work and education inside prisons to give inmates the skills to lead a law-abiding life outside. </p> <p> You are already aware that we have promised to restore police numbers. But numbers alone are not the only answer. We must make sure that every single policeman makes the most effective use of every minute of his time. Yet officers regularly tell me that they can spend an entire shift processing a single criminal through custody, and that they have to fill in the same information on form after form. Indeed, from what they tell me I can only conclude that the police have got more form than the criminals they arrest. For too long, politicians have observed this and done nothing. It is time to relieve the police of this crippling burden. </p> <p> It is plain common sense that a policeman should come into the station, deliver his prisoner with a short statement and go straight back onto the beat to arrest more criminals. And that's what's going to happen on my watch. And if that means taking a large part of the custody function away from the police, that's what I'll do. </p> <p> So we're going to restore the numbers. And we're going to make sure they spend their time more effectively. And we're going to make sure that they spend their time in the rural areas as well as the urban. </p> <p> Many rural people feel isolated from the forces of law and order. They rarely see their local bobby. Where there is an emergency, they wait far too long for a response. </p> <p> For those who live in sparsely populated areas, this is a real, live problem. So I've been looking for real, live solutions. I believe that there are lots of ways that we can get visible policing in our countryside. Through retained police officers, part-time police officers, specials, greater use of retired officers, and through 'cops in shops'. </p> <p> Cops in shops is a very simple initiative, which I saw in Washington. The officer doesn't go back to the station to write up his reports, he writes them up in shops and other public places. This has a threefold advantage. First of all, he's visible. Secondly, he can interact with the community. And thirdly, he is a deterrent. </p> <p> One of the reasons why we have such problems in recruiting is that very often, young people lose interest between the time they leave school and the time they are old enough to join the police. So I want to re-introduce a police cadet force which will not only provide a recruiting and training ground for both the regular police and the specials, but will fundamentally change young people's attitude towards the police at a time in their lives when it is most important. </p> <p> Instead of being tough on criminals, Tony Blair and Jack Straw operate a revolving door prisons policy. </p> <p> On Jack Straw's own tagging scheme, criminals sentenced to six months get out of jail in six weeks - even John Prescott gets through more of his sentences. </p> <p> And so 23,000 convicts have been let out early. </p> <p> Including 200 convicted killers </p> <p> Thousands of other violent criminals. </p> <p> Nearly 150 convicted of assaulting police. </p> <p> More than 900 robbers </p> <p> Over 2,100 burglars </p> <p> 3,000 drug dealers </p> <p> And when, but for Jack Straw's measure, they should have been in jail, these criminals have committed even more crimes - over 700 more. </p> <p> Dozens of burglaries and thefts </p> <p> Threats to kill </p> <p> Drug dealing </p> <p> Even two rapes </p> <p> The next Conservative government will scrap this tagging scheme, this mammoth insult to victims. </p> <p> I'm against early release in all but one case. There is only one early release that I will be prepared to see in the public interest. That's Jack Straw's early release from the chains of office - and Tony Blair and the rest of the Labour party with him. </p> <p> And instead, we will introduce honesty in sentencing. With the complete abolition of automatic early release. </p> <p> Sentences will say what they mean and mean what they say. </p> <p> Discounts will have to be earned and will not be substantial - unlike now. </p> <p> Where a custodial sentence is passed, we will ensure that there is a programme of rehabilitation in place. Too many offenders who are sent to prison go on to re-offend. </p> <p> By ensuring that they have an alternative to a continuation of their life of crime, we can better protect the public. </p> <p> Idle prisons are breeding grounds for the disease of crime. We will move towards a full working day in all prisons, based on self-financing workshops that take on real work which real employers want in the real world. Prisoners' wages will go towards the cost of their upkeep, the support of their families, savings to give them a start when they leave prison, and reparations to the victims of crime. </p> <p> It is all about protecting the public. </p> <p> And we've got to start with the young criminals. We will take the young menaces off the streets, away from the environment that has failed them, and give them a real chance to change. Last year I set out proposals to do this, placing them in secure training and giving them a stable regime and a real chance to change. This year, I want to look beyond young criminals, at the single biggest cause of crime, particularly but not exclusively amongst the young. </p> <p> The single biggest cause of crime in this country today is drugs. </p> <p> Children are 20% of our population but they are 100% of our future. Drugs are the cancer that is eating away at our country and threatening those children and that future. </p> <p> It's not our children who are the only victims. Crime costs this country \u00a350bn a year - and at least a third of all crimes are drug related. Eighty per cent of burglaries are motivated by drugs. </p> <p> One third of acquisitive crime is drug-related, costing victims over \u00a32bn a year. </p> <p> More than 100,000 people are convicted or cautioned for drug offences every year. </p> <p> Even if they end up in court, many get a conditional discharge or a small fine. </p> <p> Not exactly tough. </p> <p> What do the other parties offer? </p> <p> The Liberal Democrats toy with legalisation. And they want to end the tough mandatory sentences for drug dealers. </p> <p> In other words, give in. What they want to do is against all common sense. </p> <p> Labour promised a war against drugs. </p> <p> What have they done with the drug dealers? Given them the get out of jail free card. </p> <p> 23,000 criminals let out on special early release scheme, and more than 3,000 have been drug dealers or traffickers. </p> <p> Drug dealers who on average got 22 months' jail. </p> <p> Under Labour they served nine months. </p> <p> So what will we do? </p> <p> We have already pledged tougher sentences for drug dealers who sell to our children and a crackdown on drugs in and around our schools. And, needless to say, we will scrap the get out of jail free card for 3,000 drug dealers. </p> <p> Today I am able to announce a new policy. Earlier this year, I visited New York, where under Mayor Giuliani crime has plummeted. Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw there, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those whose trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death. </p> <p> And so, from the possession of the most minimal amount of soft drugs right up the chain to the large importer, there will be no hiding place. There will be zero tolerance. </p> <p> Parents want it. Schools need it. Our future demands it. The next Conservative government will do it. </p> <p> What does it mean? It means zero tolerance of possession. No more getting away with just a caution, no more hoping that a blind eye will be turned. If someone possesses drugs, the minimum for a first offence will be a fixed penalty of \u00a3100. But not for a second offence. Then it's into court. </p> <p> And no more claiming that no matter what amount you've got on you, it's for personal use. Over and above the smallest amount, the charge will be substantial possession, and the penalties applicable will be of a range comparable to those for dealing. </p> <p> And as for the suppliers, we will put them out of business. </p> <p> We will dedicate police resources and police officers to identifying and cleaning up forever those houses and other places where regular supply takes place. And the replacement suppliers, and their replacements, and their replacements, until there are no more replacements. </p> <p> Yes, this will require extra money, yes this will require extra police officers, and yes they will be forthcoming. That will be money well spent. </p> <p> And there are other aspects of our drugs laws which we need to change. Why do you lose your licence for drink-driving, but not for drugs driving? In future, anybody caught driving with illegal substances in their bloodstream will be subject to a mandatory ban. Why should it be that you have illegal drugs in your pocket, you're guilty of possession, but when they're in your bloodstream, you're guilty of nothing? </p> <p> Why do we have laws against opium dens which don't apply to crack houses? </p> <p> Zero tolerance of the biggest scourge in our society today. That's what's going to happen on my watch. </p> <p> Other things will change also. Our asylum system will be completely overhauled and we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres. It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in their system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited. If the message goes out to those who simply seek to play our system that in future they will be detained, dealt with speedily and removed, they will cease to come and we will be able to process the genuine applicant more quickly. However, for the real refugee, reception centres will provide a one-stop point of expertise in education for the children, language support, and social services support. </p> <p> At the moment such people, with all their vulnerability and needs are turned out to take their chance in areas where the local authorities have no experience in coping and where the provision of such services is a hit and miss affair. </p> <p> Let me make clear to Tony Blair what I believe - what is my 'irreducible core'. </p> <p> If you're asking me to stand by and see the genuine refugee stuck in a queue with tens of thousands of other applications; </p> <p> If you're asking me to tolerate a situation where that man waits months or years for a decision on his case while Ministers dither and officials shuffle paper; </p> <p> If you're asking me to put up with a shambolic system of support which is letting down both the refugees and the local councils and the local people who have to pick up the pieces, then vote for the other man, because I won't do it. </p> <p> Letting down genuine refugees. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Releasing 23,000 prisoners extra-early. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Cut police numbers when crime is rising. I don't think I could that. Could you? </p> <p> Surrender to the drugs menace. We couldn't do that. We shouldn't do that. </p> <p> We won't do that.</p>",

I believe that there are lots of ways that we can get visible policing in our countryside. Through retained police officers, part-time police officers, specials, greater use of retired officers, and through 'cops in shops'. Cops in shops is a very simple initiative, which I saw in Washington. The officer doesn't go back to the station to write up his reports, he writes them up in shops and other public places. This has a threefold advantage. First of all, he's visible. Secondly, he can interact with the community. And thirdly, he is a deterrent. One of the reasons why we have such problems in recruiting is that very often, young people lose interest between the time they leave school and the time they are old enough to join the police. So I want to re-introduce a police cadet force which will not only provide a recruiting and training ground for both the regular police and the specials, but will fundamentally change young people's attitude towards the police at a time in their lives when it is most important. Instead of being tough on criminals, Tony Blair and Jack Straw operate a revolving door prisons policy. On Jack Straw's own tagging scheme, criminals sentenced to six months get out of jail in six weeks - even John Prescott gets through more of his sentences. And so 23,000 convicts have been let out early. Including 200 convicted killers Thousands of other violent criminals. Nearly 150 convicted of assaulting police. More than 900 robbers Over 2,100 burglars 3,000 drug dealers And when, but for Jack Straw's measure, they should have been in jail, these criminals have committed even more crimes - over 700 more. Dozens of burglaries and thefts Threats to kill Drug dealing Even two rapes The next Conservative government will scrap this tagging scheme, this mammoth insult to victims. I'm against early release in all but one case. There is only one early release that I will be prepared to see in the public interest. That's Jack Straw's early release from the chains of office - and Tony Blair and the rest of the Labour party with him. And instead, we will introduce honesty in sentencing. With the complete abolition of automatic early release. Sentences will say what they mean and mean what they say. Discounts will have to be earned and will not be substantial - unlike now. Where a custodial sentence is passed, we will ensure that there is a programme of rehabilitation in place. Too many offenders who are sent to prison go on to re-offend. By ensuring that they have an alternative to a continuation of their life of crime, we can better protect the public. Idle prisons are breeding grounds for the disease of crime. We will move towards a full working day in all prisons, based on self-financing workshops that take on real work which real employers want in the real world. Prisoners' wages will go towards the cost of their upkeep, the support of their families, savings to give them a start when they leave prison, and reparations to the victims of crime. It is all about protecting the public. And we've got to start with the young criminals. We will take the young menaces off the streets, away from the environment that has failed them, and give them a real chance to change. Last year I set out proposals to do this, placing them in secure training and giving them a stable regime and a real chance to change. This year, I want to look beyond young criminals, at the single biggest cause of crime, particularly but not exclusively amongst the young. The single biggest cause of crime in this country today is drugs. Children are 20% of our population but they are 100% of our future. Drugs are the cancer that is eating away at our country and threatening those children and that future. It's not our children who are the only victims. Crime costs this country \u00a350bn a year - and at least a third of all crimes are drug related. Eighty per cent of burglaries are motivated by drugs. One third of acquisitive crime is drug-related, costing victims over \u00a32bn a year. More than 100,000 people are convicted or cautioned for drug offences every year. Even if they end up in court, many get a conditional discharge or a small fine. Not exactly tough. What do the other parties offer? The Liberal Democrats toy with legalisation. And they want to end the tough mandatory sentences for drug dealers. In other words, give in. What they want to do is against all common sense. Labour promised a war against drugs. What have they done with the drug dealers? Given them the get out of jail free card. 23,000 criminals let out on special early release scheme, and more than 3,000 have been drug dealers or traffickers. Drug dealers who on average got 22 months' jail. Under Labour they served nine months. So what will we do? We have already pledged tougher sentences for drug dealers who sell to our children and a crackdown on drugs in and around our schools. And, needless to say, we will scrap the get out of jail free card for 3,000 drug dealers. Today I am able to announce a new policy. Earlier this year, I visited New York, where under Mayor Giuliani crime has plummeted. Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw there, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those whose trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death. And so, from the possession of the most minimal amount of soft drugs right up the chain to the large importer, there will be no hiding place. There will be zero tolerance. Parents want it. Schools need it. Our future demands it. The next Conservative government will do it. What does it mean? It means zero tolerance of possession. No more getting away with just a caution, no more hoping that a blind eye will be turned. If someone possesses drugs, the minimum for a first offence will be a fixed penalty of \u00a3100. But not for a second offence. Then it's into court. And no more claiming that no matter what amount you've got on you, it's for personal use. Over and above the smallest amount, the charge will be substantial possession, and the penalties applicable will be of a range comparable to those for dealing. And as for the suppliers, we will put them out of business. We will dedicate police resources and police officers to identifying and cleaning up forever those houses and other places where regular supply takes place. And the replacement suppliers, and their replacements, and their replacements, until there are no more replacements. Yes, this will require extra money, yes this will require extra police officers, and yes they will be forthcoming. That will be money well spent. And there are other aspects of our drugs laws which we need to change. Why do you lose your licence for drink-driving, but not for drugs driving? In future, anybody caught driving with illegal substances in their bloodstream will be subject to a mandatory ban. Why should it be that you have illegal drugs in your pocket, you're guilty of possession, but when they're in your bloodstream, you're guilty of nothing? Why do we have laws against opium dens which don't apply to crack houses? Zero tolerance of the biggest scourge in our society today. That's what's going to happen on my watch. Other things will change also. Our asylum system will be completely overhauled and we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres. It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in their system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited. If the message goes out to those who simply seek to play our system that in future they will be detained, dealt with speedily and removed, they will cease to come and we will be able to process the genuine applicant more quickly. However, for the real refugee, reception centres will provide a one-stop point of expertise in education for the children, language support, and social services support. At the moment such people, with all their vulnerability and needs are turned out to take their chance in areas where the local authorities have no experience in coping and where the provision of such services is a hit and miss affair. Let me make clear to Tony Blair what I believe - what is my 'irreducible core'. If you're asking me to stand by and see the genuine refugee stuck in a queue with tens of thousands of other applications; If you're asking me to tolerate a situation where that man waits months or years for a decision on his case while Ministers dither and officials shuffle paper; If you're asking me to put up with a shambolic system of support which is letting down both the refugees and the local councils and the local people who have to pick up the pieces, then vote for the other man, because I won't do it. Letting down genuine refugees. I don't think I could do that. Could you? Releasing 23,000 prisoners extra-early. I don't think I could do that. Could you? Cut police numbers when crime is rising. I don't think I could that. Could you? Surrender to the drugs menace. We couldn't do that. We shouldn't do that. We won't do that.",

      "body": "<p>Big is powerful, big is astonishing, but does bigness make for good art? The opening of Tate Modern has coincided with a sudden fever for the colossal. Or perhaps it's no coincidence. Damien Hirst unveiled his 30-foot-high polychrome statue modelled on a child's anatomical toy, Hymn, at the Saatchi Gallery just before Tate Modern opened. Mona Hatoum, with her giant kitchen-grinder, and Ron Mueck, with his crouching boy in the Dome, have also made bids for the monumental. </p> <p>Now Spanish sculptor Juan Mu\u00f1oz has been chosen to follow Hatoum as the second artist in the Unilever series of commissions to make an installation for Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. Mu\u00f1oz is \"still thinking\" about what to do, but his installation Towards the Corner, featuring an audience sitting on benches laughing at something that we can't see, has been one of Tate Modern's hits. </p> <p>Contemporary artists seem compelled to inflate their art to match their reputations. Or is there more to the drive to the monumental at the beginning of the 21st century than the logic of careers and art history? </p> <p>The most chilling things in the Royal Academy's Apocalypse show are Jeff Koons's massive metal casts of children's balloons. Shiny and vacuous, these are images of innocent pleasure; but by making them so huge, Koons insists on their jollity in a hysterical way. It's not size that matters, it's scale, and it's the distortion of scale that makes Koons's art so disturbing. Taking a balloon or a child's toy and inflating it so that we look up in helpless wonder is a way of shattering adult self-perception. </p> <p>Koons and Hirst both locate their colossal art in the world of the nursery. We were all small once, and gigantic art can make us feel that way again. \"I feel like such a nobody!\" enthuses Marge Simpson when The Simpsons visit New York.

      "bodyText": "Big is powerful, big is astonishing, but does bigness make for good art? The opening of Tate Modern has coincided with a sudden fever for the colossal. Or perhaps it's no coincidence. Damien Hirst unveiled his 30-foot-high polychrome statue modelled on a child's anatomical toy, Hymn, at the Saatchi Gallery just before Tate Modern opened. Mona Hatoum, with her giant kitchen-grinder, and Ron Mueck, with his crouching boy in the Dome, have also made bids for the monumental. Now Spanish sculptor Juan Mu\u00f1oz has been chosen to follow Hatoum as the second artist in the Unilever series of commissions to make an installation for Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. Mu\u00f1oz is \"still thinking\" about what to do, but his installation Towards the Corner, featuring an audience sitting on benches laughing at something that we can't see, has been one of Tate Modern's hits. Contemporary artists seem compelled to inflate their art to match their reputations. Or is there more to the drive to the monumental at the beginning of the 21st century than the logic of careers and art history? The most chilling things in the Royal Academy's Apocalypse show are Jeff Koons's massive metal casts of children's balloons. Shiny and vacuous, these are images of innocent pleasure; but by making them so huge, Koons insists on their jollity in a hysterical way. It's not size that matters, it's scale, and it's the distortion of scale that makes Koons's art so disturbing. Taking a balloon or a child's toy and inflating it so that we look up in helpless wonder is a way of shattering adult self-perception. Koons and Hirst both locate their colossal art in the world of the nursery. We were all small once, and gigantic art can make us feel that way again. \"I feel like such a nobody!\" enthuses Marge Simpson when The Simpsons visit New York. It was among the skyscrapers of Manhattan that modern artists most comprehensively explored the pleasures of feeling dwarfed. Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and the other abstract expressionist painters did this in the 40s and 50s with wide canvases.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore and George W Bush finally came face to face in the first of this year's US presidential debates last night, with opinion polls showing that up to a third of American voters would decide which man to support on the basis of what they saw and heard in these encounters. The tension and seriousness with which both camps were viewing the debate was palpable yesterday, as the closest US presidential election contest in 20 years reached what was almost certainly its pivotal moment. An old-fashioned coin-toss gave Mr Gore, the Democratic candidate, the first question in the 90-minute debate, which took place at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. The debate was broadcast live on most of the US television networks, and was expected to attract a viewing audience of at least 60m. \"Tonight's not the night for gimmicks,\" Mr Bush, the Republican candidate, said as he left West Virginia for Boston, preceded by a group of advisers so large that it required a separate jet. Mr Bush's spin doctors said before the debate began that their man was intending to bring his 10-year programme of tax cuts totalling $1,300bn (\u00a3886bn) back to the centre of the political argument. Mr Gore was said to be planning to use the debate to help soften his image as a stiff policy obsessive. The Bush camp has spent weeks trying to lower expectations about its man's chances in the debate, in the hope that even a modestly competent performance could be seen as something of a triumph. Mr Gore, by contrast, faced higher expectations because of his extensive government experience and his formidable reputation in political one-on-ones. As well as being expected to attract the largest audience of any of the candidates' debates before the US goes to the polls in November, yesterday's TV contest was also the most intensively polled event of the election by both the Bush and Gore campaigns. The voters' responses to the debate will affect the tone and targeting of millions of dollars of campaign advertising about to be unleashed in key states. The importance that the politicians attached to the confrontation was not universally shared by television executives, however. Though the proceedings were carried live on the ABC and CBS networks, as well as on the PBS and CNN cable channels, NBC allowed affiliates to choose between the debate and a baseball game, while the Fox network chose to disregard it altogether. Opinion polls showed Mr Gore holding a narrow lead coming into the debate, but both camps were in no doubt that this and two further debates in the next fortnight are likely to hold the key to the outcome of the November 7 presidential contest. Mr Gore led Mr Bush by 46% to 40% in an eve-of-debate tracking poll for Reuters and MSNBC, and by 45% to 39% in a New York Times/CBS poll. A Washington Post/ABC survey showed Mr Gore with a nar rower lead, 48% to 46%, while the latest Gallup/CNN tracking poll had the two men all square on 45% each.

OK, so it's a knockout, and anything can happen. But in order to win it, England will have to beat South Africa, and almost certainly Australia, <em>and</em> someone from the other half of the draw - either Pakistan, Sri Lanka or New Zealand.</p> <p>Even Fleming, normally a shrewd analyst of the game, is looking at England's prospects through rose-tinted shades. Australia, South Africa and Pakistan may well be three of the semi-finalists, but if so, England cannot join them. The fourth semi-finalist will, for sure, be either New Zealand or Zimbabwe, who are both seeded because they reached the last six of the 1999 World Cup.</p> <p>England have certainly improved since those dark days. They are better than Zimbabwe now, as they have shown, home and away, in the past nine months. They are also better than West Indies, but then so are at least seven other teams.</p> <p>You don't need a rankings table to work out the world one-day pecking order. Australia are far and away the best team. South Africa (who managed to draw with them in a three-match series in Melbourne six weeks ago) are a clear second, flawed only by their tendency to choke on the big occasion. Pakistan, with their brilliance and brittleness, are third.</p> <p>On the other side of a wide gulf lies the second division - India, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and England. In Africa or Asia, England are probably fourth of these four. With the one exception of Sharjah 1997 - once a shining exception, now a tarnished one - England have been a poor one-day team away from home for as long as any of their players can remember. (Even Alec Stewart, the only one of cricket's current golden oldies playing in Nairobi.)</p> <p>That could be beginning to change. In South Africa last winter England were at least competitive, and in Zimbabwe after that, when exhaustion could have been setting in, they were ruthlessly efficient. In the summer, against two weak teams, they settled on a strong recipe: Marcus Trescothick and Stewart to give a solid-yet-fluent start, Graham Thorpe to hold together the middle order, and five seamers of varying shapes and sizes - Andy Caddick and Alan Mullally to bowl classical line and length from an awkward height, Darren Gough and Craig White to do the one-day thing with the yorkers and slower balls, and Mark Ealham to do the dibbly-dobbly wibbly-wobbly stuff.</p> <p>Whether that will work in Kenya, we will soon discover, although the recipe will change at least a little as Mullally is injured. But now that Ashley Giles is out with an injury too, Mullally looks like being replaced by a medium-pacer, Mark Alleyne, rather than by the spare fast bowler, Matthew Hoggard.</p> <p>It might work for a bit and then not work, as all 11 matches in Nairobi are being played on the same surface, which is bound to turn more as the tournament goes on. The one lucky thing about England's half of the draw is that there is only one outstanding spinner in it: Anil Kumble of India. He hit form straight away against Kenya on Tuesday, but that could backfire in India's next match, when Australia will surely opt to see Kumble off and milk the rest of a fairly tame attack.</p> <p>England don't need to win this tournament: they just have to do all right, which means beating Bangladesh, their banana-skin first-round opponents, tomorrow, and then giving South Africa a run for their money on October 10. A semi-final place would be a triumph when you consider how England did last time they met South Africa in a big tournament, at The Oval 17 months ago. They let Kirsten and Gibbs get away to a hundred-run flyer, and were then bowled out for 103 in reply to 225 for 7.</p> <p>This time, they need to command respect, to take some beating. That will mean someone coming through in the middle order. During the summer's one-dayers, either Trescothick or Stewart made runs every time. But then they weren't facing Donald and Pollock, or McGrath and Brett Lee. One of these days, both openers will fail, and then it will matter whether Nasser Hussain is in form, or whether Andy Flintoff has taken his brain out to the middle with him, or whether Graeme Hick has got his Superman outfit on.</p> <p>All these things are quite possible. Hussain, though never yet a convincing one-day player, is exuding authority as captain, and the odds must be on his bad trot ending soon.

Alongside the mainly commendatory applause, the occasional criticism (\"Competing with our children, are we?\") and sarcastic witticism (\"Better not let the family side down with your A-level grades!\") that she has received suggests that some of her peers also believe that your own life ends with your children's. Accordingly, any external interests become irrelevant or indulgent, if they are not directly connected to your children, even if they no longer live at home.

The 31-year-old striker is a free agent at the end of the season and can sign a pre-contract agreement with another club at the turn of the year. Roy Hodgson could be the shock choice for the vacant managerial position at Internazionale, according to the Daily Mail. The former Blackburn boss, who has had two spells in charge of the nerazzurri, faces competition from Daniel Passarella, Marco Tardelli, Rangers boss Dick Advocaat and - surprise, surprise - Gianluca Vialli. Meanwhile, Marcello Lippi, the man Inter sacked yesterday, could be on his way to Barcelona, according to reports in Spain. Current Nou Camp boss Llorenc Serra Ferrer is under severe pressure after losing four of his last five games, and the Catalans are alleged to have already contacted Lippi - who is not allowed to manage another Italian club this season under Serie A rules - about the job. Bradford have joined Wimbledon in the \u00a31.5m chase for Everton defender Richard Dunne. Teamtalk also claim that Sheffield Wednesday are interested in the Republic of Ireland defender, but the Hillsborough club are unlikely to be able to raise the funds. B93 Copenhagen defender Per Kroldrup is being watched by Arsenal.",

The board felt he was still unusually interested in fame.</p> <p>Chapman, who has apologised to Lennon's family and says that he is well again and should be released to tour the world playing his own music, has almost completed his minimum sentence at Attica prison in upstate New York.</p> <p>Chapman, 45, was interviewed yesterday morning at the prison by three parole board members, said Tom Grant, a spokesman for the New York state division of parole. He was told of the rejection four hours later.</p> <p>In its ruling, the board called Chapman's killing of Lennon \"calculated and unprovoked\". In addition to being one of the most famous musicians in the world, Lennon was also a \"husband and a father of two young children\", it said.</p> <p>\"Your most vicious and violent act was apparently fuelled by your need to be acknowledged,\" the board added. \"During your parole hearing, this panel noted your continued interest in maintaining your notoriety.\"</p> <p>The rejection came as no surprise to Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, which monitors prisons.</p> <p>He said: \"If Jesus Christ returned to Earth for the sole purpose of decreeing that it would be appropriate to release Mark Chapman, the parole board wouldn't be willing to take the political heat they would get by doing it.\"</p> <p>But even if Chapman were not a notorious murderer, his chances of release in December would still have been remote. Parole has been granted in the past three years to only 17 of the 303 people serving time in the state for murder or attempted murder and making their first application.</p> <p>A poll conducted by the cable channel Court TV, which showed a documentary including an interview with Chapman the night before the closed-door hearing, showed that only 6% of respondents believed he should be set free.</p> <p>The board received written submissions, one of them from Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow. It is known that she said she and the couple's son Sean would not feel safe if Chapman were let out of prison.</p> <p>It will now be two years before Chapman can reapply.</p> <p>On the Court TV documentary, Chapman talked of the murder - outside Lennon's Manhattan home in 1980 - as though he were describing the actions of someone else. He said of the day of the shooting: \"When you look at it, here was a man who was a blowing cauldron, very lucid and very clear. Yet my stomach and heart were disintegrating.\"</p> <p>Jack Jones, who conducted the interview, said: \"Mark is a creature of fiction to a large extent. He had this fantasy world where he was the fifth Beatle in his mind.</p> <p>\"From an early age he had an elaborate world of little people living in his bedroom. When he was happy and things were going his way he would reward the little people by playing Beatles music. Only Beatles music. He was also eliminating and punishing millions of little people.\"</p>",

He was told of the rejection four hours later. In its ruling, the board called Chapman's killing of Lennon \"calculated and unprovoked\". In addition to being one of the most famous musicians in the world, Lennon was also a \"husband and a father of two young children\", it said. \"Your most vicious and violent act was apparently fuelled by your need to be acknowledged,\" the board added. \"During your parole hearing, this panel noted your continued interest in maintaining your notoriety.\" The rejection came as no surprise to Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, which monitors prisons. He said: \"If Jesus Christ returned to Earth for the sole purpose of decreeing that it would be appropriate to release Mark Chapman, the parole board wouldn't be willing to take the political heat they would get by doing it.\" But even if Chapman were not a notorious murderer, his chances of release in December would still have been remote. Parole has been granted in the past three years to only 17 of the 303 people serving time in the state for murder or attempted murder and making their first application. A poll conducted by the cable channel Court TV, which showed a documentary including an interview with Chapman the night before the closed-door hearing, showed that only 6% of respondents believed he should be set free. The board received written submissions, one of them from Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow. It is known that she said she and the couple's son Sean would not feel safe if Chapman were let out of prison. It will now be two years before Chapman can reapply. On the Court TV documentary, Chapman talked of the murder - outside Lennon's Manhattan home in 1980 - as though he were describing the actions of someone else. He said of the day of the shooting: \"When you look at it, here was a man who was a blowing cauldron, very lucid and very clear. Yet my stomach and heart were disintegrating.\" Jack Jones, who conducted the interview, said: \"Mark is a creature of fiction to a large extent. He had this fantasy world where he was the fifth Beatle in his mind. \"From an early age he had an elaborate world of little people living in his bedroom. When he was happy and things were going his way he would reward the little people by playing Beatles music. Only Beatles music. He was also eliminating and punishing millions of little people.\"",

But one linguistic twist can generate wildly bizarre narrative fugues, often in the form of exotic machines that Roussel describes with the fastidious logic of an industrial manual. Roussel's admirers among the Surrealists may have produced imagery as fanciful, but rarely as hypnotically compelling, because their ethic of total imaginative freedom could hardly envisage the lab-coated decorum of Roussel's style. </p> <p>Roussel's direct descendants were the writers of the OuLiPo, or Workshop for Potential Literature. Raymond Queneau wrote novels informed by mathematical formulae; Harry Mathews devised verbal \"algorithms\" as a way of kick-starting invention; most notoriously, Georges P\u00e9rec wrote La Disparition, a novel that dispenses entirely with the letter \"e\".

The Treasury said the action was taken \"because of the shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy\".",

      "bodyText": "Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, issued a stern warning to EU states yesterday not to reduce integration to mere cooperation between governments. In an unusually hard speech, interpreted as criticism of France and Britain, Mr Prodi told members of the European Parliament at Strasbourg that there was a danger that the EU would become either an \"international talking shop\" or a \"government of bureaucrats\" if this trend was not reversed. Seeking to re-establish his authority after enduring months of criticism and demoralisation in Brussels, Mr Prodi made clear that he expected the EU's 15 members to agree to far-reaching changes - including less use of national vetoes - at their Nice summit in December. France's president, Jacques Chirac, ruffled feathers in the summer when he called for a \"pioneer group\" of countries to lead the EU, failing to mention the commission - the unique supranational executive of the EU where elements of sovereignty are pooled. Diplomats suspected that Mr Prodi was in part trying to make a pre-emptive strike before Tony Blair's heavily trailed speech in Warsaw on Friday: it is expected to call for closer collaboration between EU governments, an implicit relegation of EU institutions. British officials often privately give the impression they regret the choice of Mr Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, after the fall of the discredited Santer commission last year. EU sources insisted the commission president was not attacking specific national leaders, but was concerned about the general trend. \"This is meant to be a strong warning,\" said one official. \"Enhancing the intergovernmental model at the expense not only of the commission but also, ultimately, of the council [of ministers] would ... undermine the democratic nature of the whole European structure and would be a seriously retrograde step,\" Mr Prodi said in Strasbourg. Much of his speech was devoted to urging governments to settle long overdue institutional reforms, due for review at the Biarritz summit in a fortnight finalisation at Nice. Limiting national vetoes, Mr Prodi said, was the most important reform needed for an enlarged EU to function properly: decisions requiring unanimity should be restricted to an \"absolute minimum\". And in a message that will be especially unwelcome to Mr Blair, Mr Prodi signalled that no one should prevent a group of EU members from achieving closer union - eurospeak for saying that a \"two-speed Europe\" is a good thing. Denmark's rejection of the European single currency in a referendum last week - and the probability that Sweden and Britain will delay their own referendums - has made the two-speed option likelier. Mr Prodi received a rousing ovation, and Pat Cox, leader of the Liberal group of MEPs, said his speech had been the commission president's \"finest hour\" in his year in office. He urged governments to do more to promote a positive view of the possible near-doubling of EU membership over the next few years, in hopes of preventing extreme rightwing parties exploiting rising crime and mass immigration. Controversially, he also called for the commission to be given greater powers in formulating EU foreign and economic policies.",

      "bodyText": "A senior United Nations official called for a recount of the vote in last week's Yugoslav election yesterday as the poll victor, Vojislav Kostunica, signalled he could go to Moscow later this week for talks on the post-election crisis with President Vladimir Putin. In Belgrade, Jiri Dienstbier - the UN human rights rapporteur for present-day Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia - said the ruling party had rigged the results of the September 24 vote. He demanded a recount rather than support the plan by Slobodan Milosevic's regime for a second-round run-off this Sunday. \"The results must have been manipulated,\" Mr Dienstbier said in the Serbian capital. Mr Dienstbier, a former Czech foreign minister, has been one of the few international officials in Yugoslavia during the election crisis that many fear could spill into civil war due to Mr Milosevic's evident determination to hang on despite faring poorly in the September vote against Mr Kostunica, the main opposition contender. \"The truth should be discovered and both sides should accept the demand to recount the votes,\" he said, alleging that the main ballot-rigging occurred in Kosovo. His remarks put him at odds with Moscow, which is seeking to play the central role in mediating the crisis; President Putin had offered to host Mr Milosevic and Mr Kostunica in Moscow in the next few days. The Kremlin says Sunday's proposed second round should go ahead, tacitly accepting Mr Milosevic's argument that the opposition did not win an outright majority, although other Russian statements have favoured Mr Kostunica, who has said he would boycott a second-round run-off. Borislav Milosevic, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow and the president's older brother, yesterday insisted that Sunday's second round would go ahead whether or not Mr Kostunica boycotted it. He said he did not know if his brother would accept Mr Putin's offer of mediation and come to Moscow. Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, who knows Mr Kostunica and saw ambassador Milosevic yesterday, said the chances of crisis talks taking place in Moscow were slim. But Mr Kostunica's Democratic party of Serbia told Russian officials in Belgrade that its candidate would travel to Moscow if he was given an audience with the Russian president, who is in India until tomorrow. \"If there is an official invitation and if there are guarantees Putin himself will really see Kostunica, he would go, and that could be [tomorrow],\" a party source said. Moscow's Interfax news agency reported that Mr Kostunica had accepted the Russian offer, but Mr Kostunica, speaking to the Russian daily Kommersant for today's edition, appeared less sure. \"President Vladimir Putin's proposal is very much in my interests,\" Mr Kostunica said. \"All that remains to be done is work out certain details and the format of the meeting in Moscow.\" If the meeting goes ahead, its thrust could be to get Mr Kostunica to run on Sunday in return for international monitoring of the vote and Kremlin guarantees that Mr Milosevic will stand by the verdict, Interfax reported. What is uncertain is whether Mr Milosevic will make such commitments. The UN war-crimes tribunal has indicted Mr Milosevic for war crimes in Kosovo - and is about to extend the charges to war crimes committed by forces under his command earlier in Bosnia and Croatia. Russia is a permanent member of the UN security council and formally would be obliged to arrest Mr Milosevic in Moscow. After talks in Belgrade with Milosevic government officials and the Kostunica camp, Russia's Balkan envoy, Vladimir Chizhov, said both sides remained dangerously far apart. Returning to Moscow last night, Mr Chizhov called for a solution that \"would ensure the legitimacy of a new Yugoslav leadership disputed by no one\". That appeared to support Mr Kostunica, since the west will not recognise President Milosevic should he try to hold on. A website run by advisers to Mr Putin said bluntly that Mr Milosevic was finished and that Moscow should press him to step down. \"The current regime in Belgrade has been dealt a stunning blow from which it can barely recover,\" it said. \"The fall of Slobodan Milosevic is only a matter of time ... Russia's support could tip the scales in Serbia in favour of the opposition and convince Milosevic not to try to cling to power.\"",

      "bodyText": "James Dyson, inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, yesterday scored a landmark victory at the high court over his arch rival Hoover, which was ruled to have copied his best dust-busting machine. Mr Dyson, a serial inventor who first came to prominence in 1974 with his Ballbarrow - an \"easy to steer\" wheelbarrow - is hoping to win millions of pounds in damages and prevent further Hoover sales of bagless equipment at a final hearing on October 13. Hoover had argued that Dyson's technology involved nothing that was not already known inside the industry. But deputy high court judge Michael Fysh QC ruled that Hoover had infringed the patent and dimissed a counterclaim for its revocation. Hoover said it would appeal in the case, dubbed \"floor wars\", and has warned that hundreds of jobs at its Scottish production plant could be at risk if it failed. Mr Dyson, 53, who was used to fighting the sceptics and reluctant financial backers in the early years, said the case was important for his 1,900 workers at Dyson Appliances in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. He saw it as a landmark victory for individual inventors and smaller businesses. 'False claims' \"I spent 20 years developing this technology and I am very pleased to see Hoover, who made a lot of false claims about their product, can't just rip off our designs and copy us,\" he said. It is wrong for companies to be able to come in and copy other people's inventions, added Mr Dyson: \"This case shows that this can be stopped.\" The former interior designer, now feted by government, is not out of the woods yet. Alberto Bertali, managing director of Hoover UK, said its triple vortex cleaner had been a big success with customers and he would battle to the end to keep it on the shelves. \"We believe we were right to fight this case and presented what we thought was compelling evidence of technological and scientific differences [with Dyson's equipment].\" The case against Hoover involved infringement of Dyson's dual cyclone cleaner which uses centrifugal force to separate dirt from air. Hoover's triple vortex machine also dispensed with the traditional vacuum bag. Prior to Dyson all vacuum cleaners worked on the principle that dirt was sucked up and separated by passing a stream of dirty air through a bag or a filter. Mr Dyson made the first breakthrough in vacuum cleaner technology in 1979 and it was the first real change since Hoover pioneered a basic technique in 1908. He has spent the intervening years fighting off patent threats all over Europe but getting his revolutionary system off the ground was tough. He hawked his new design around many of the big manufacturers, including Electrolux, Phillips and Black &amp; Decker but none was interested in moving away from vacuum cleaners without bags. Eventually, he borrowed \u00a3600,000 and set up his own company. In the first year, Dyson's bagless cleaner clocked up sales of \u00a32.4m. This rose to \u00a310m the following year and by February 1995 the Dyson equipment had become the largest-selling cleaner in Britain. Now Dyson Appliances is selling nearly \u00a3300m worth of machines a year and claims to hold half of the British market by volume. By contrast, Hoover, once the global giant of the vacuum world, has seen its market share dwindle to an estimated 10% following a series of gaffes, culminating in a disastrous marketing campaign in 1992. Customers were offered free flights for every \u00a3100 spent on Hoover products. The open-ended offer attracted 600,000 people with the final cost - estimated at \u00a350m - to Hoover's US owner Maytag which immediately sold off Hoover to its current Italian owner, Candy. Mr Dyson likes to present himself as a plucky British underdog who has battled and won against the massive odds of multinational corporations. But he is one of the top 50 richest people in this country - with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a3500m - and has recently started doing some of his manufacturing in Malaysia in an attempt to reduce costs and counter the impact of a high pound. Self-made Such a self-made industrialist should be a natural ally of the Conservative party but he is an ardent Europhile and has warned that failure to join the euro could encourage him to move more production overseas. But he is no huge fan of the current government either, despite the fact that he lists Number 10 (along with Buckingham Palace and Elton John's house) as places where you will find his equipment. He said recently: \"In Britain there is more interest in making sure there are lots of dot.com millionaires and no interest in nurturing and caring about manufacturing.\" Dyson's personal life revolves between his millhouse and headquarters in Wiltshire, a Queen Anne townhouse in Chelsea and a holiday farmhouse in Provence. Born to academic parents in north Norfolk, Mr Dyson was educated at Gresham's School in Holt before going on to become a student of interior design at the Royal College of Art. Design is a passion he shares with his wife, Deirdre, who he met when they studied together earlier in his student career at Byam Shaw art school.",

      "bodyText": "In the first direct challenge to the wave of demonstrations against President Slobodan Milosevic, 11 striking miners and two Serbian opposition leaders were ordered to be detained on suspicion of sabotage yesterday. The miners are members of the strike committee at Serbia's largest coal mine, Kolubara, where 4,500 workers have been on strike since Friday. The two opposition leaders, Nebojsa Covic and Boris Tadic, visited the mine on Sunday night, when police sealed off the area. Mr Covic is the leader of the Democratic Alternative, a relatively small party within the opposition. Mr Tadic is deputy head of the larger Democratic Party. The Belgrade public prosecutor demanded an investigation, saying there was a suspicion that they had \"been accomplices in criminal sabotage\". Meanwhile, in the Yugoslav capital, tens of thousands of students walked out of exams and joined hands to form chains across major highways. Anti-riot squad police stood by in blue camouflage fatigues as the students moved down the road toward Beli Dvor, the white palace of President Milosevic, shouting \"Save Serbia and kill yourself, Slobodan\" to the accompaniment of blaring car horns. Two coachloads of the intervention squads were guarding Mr Milosevic's home, but the students sought disruption, not confrontation and when the road was blocked, they diverted to a square and another road. Another group of tens of thousands of students marched from Plato square to Autokomanda square, just below the leafy suburb of Dedinje, home of Belgrade's rich. The embattled government issued a statement threatening to crack down on the opposition, calling them subversive elements waging warfare through strikes and blockades. In a statement, read on state television, it was announced that judges could jail those involved in civil disobedience for two to three months. Dissenters in the judiciary were told to resign. But opposition leaders and supporters remained defiant and insisted that Mr Milosevic accept his landslide election defeat. They claim their results show that presidential challenger Vojislav Kostunica won the election outright and that the regime committed massive voting fraud. A campaign of strikes and civil disobedience combined with legal appeals is being used to pressure the state election committee, which claims Mr Kostunica was not the outright winner of the presidential poll and is calling for a second round. The opposition has ruled out participation in Sunday's planned run-off. \"No one has the right to so bluntly annul the people's will,\" said Mr Kostunica. The opposition claims that a computer diskette thrown through a window of the Yugoslav statistics office building has provided them with evidence of the real results of the election on September 24. Mladjan Dinkic, leader of the G17 independent think tank told a news conference: \"We've got the proof now, but the electoral commission is the one to present the real results to the public.\" Across the country, particularly in towns that fell to the opposition in last month's elections, strikes and blockades are crippling all activity. On Monday night miners at the Kolubara complex ignored an appeal to return to work by the Yugoslavia army chief, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic - the first time Mr Milosevic has called on the military to help end the protests. \"We are under pressure from the police, psychological not physical pressure,\" said Predrag Stepanovic, a member of the strike committee. After the general failed to resolve the coal mine impasse, the government struck back at opposition-run cities and towns across country by introducing four-hour power cuts allegedly triggered by the strike. Electricity was lost in parts of capital Belgrade for four hours as well as cities such as Nis and Novi Sad. The campaign of civil disobedience is the most serious challenge yet to Milosevic's 13-year rule.",

Their rebellion follows the failure of the state election commission to recognise the outright victory claimed by opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica in last month's presidential poll. Yesterday the head of French and Italian programmes at Radio Yugoslavia - the closest thing in Belgrade to the BBC World Service - was fired for seeking a more balanced editorial policy. Vladimir Pavlovic, who had worked for the broadcasting service for 26 years, said: \"The editorial policy of Radio Yugoslavia comes from federal government - and in reality it comes from Milosevic and his wife, Mira Markovic.\" The chief of Radio Yugoslavia, Ivan Markovic, is the minister of telecommunications and the spokesman for Ms Markovic's political party, the Yugoslav United Left. \"We have been all the time feeling bad about what Radio Yugoslavia does,\" Mr Pavlovic added. \"But I'm a professional and it is my job.\" He said that after the election eight journalists - out of a total of 200 employees at the service - formally requested a more balanced editorial policy. \"There's a big amount of repression.

We want to make it possible for other voices to b e heard,\" he said. When Mr Pavlovic went into work yesterday a security guard at the door confiscated his identity card. Belgrade-based staff from the culture department of Radio Television Serbia (RTS), which is also controlled by the state, were yesterday planning a similar written request for more open coverage. Six employees working for RTS in Novi Sad, the second largest city, who circulated a petition calling for objective reporting have been sacked. A number of local radio and TV stations that were within the RTS system have been boycotting the state news, which serves as the biggest television propaganda outlet for the Milosevic regime. According to information gathered by the Belgrade-based Association of Independent Media, nine stations have stopped broadcasting RTS news. They include three broadcasters in the eastern town of Zajecar, previously a heartland of support for President Milosevic's coalition. In the capital, more than 60 employees - including journalists - working for state-controlled Radio Belgrade are reported to be circulating a petition demanding a change in editorial policy. A second Radio Belgrade channel is also said to be disrupted by protests, with staff also said to be calling for fair reporting. Fifty reporters at the Vecernje Novosti newspaper are said to have called for a new editorial line. An open letter is also reportedly circulating demanding that the paper adopts an independent stance. Of all the cities across Yugoslavia, Belgrade has been the most affected by a clampdown on all non-government broadcasting media, with the exception of a small student radio station. In May police stormed the Belgrade City Studio B Station, the only non-government radio and television station with national reach. The station broadcast opposition viewpoints and was controlled by the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement. Western European governments have sought to break the media isolation by funding a non-government radio station, Studio B292, which runs a website and can be heard by those with a satellite dish. Most people in the capital cannot afford such luxuries. The B292 reports have been circulated and made available to radio stations in towns controlled by the opposition.

All 34 Britons arrested are believed to have been released. A 21-year-old university student from London told the Guardian he was picked up at a pub by police on the evening after the September 26 demonstration outside a meeting of international financiers. </p> <p>His hands were bound with plastic so tight, he said, that his wrists swelled. He was strip-searched, his fingerprints and photograph were taken and he was then kept in a four metre by four metre cell with 35 other people. </p> <p>Anyone who tried to sleep was woken up by bright lights and an officer running a stick along the cell bars. People were strip-searched in front of him and slapped when naked. </p> <p>\"I got off fairly lightly in comparison to the Italians and Israelis who they pointed at and beat up in a very fascistic way,\" he added. </p> <p>\"When they took 25 of us to the third destination we had to run towards the bus through two lines of police who hit us in the kidneys with their truncheons and fists. There were women as well, and they laughed as they hit us. Afterwards there were several bleeding noses.\" </p> <p>Like other detainees, the student said he was denied access to a translator most of the time, forced to sign Czech documents he did not understand and deprived of sleep and food. </p> <p>According to OPH - a group whose members, including several lawyers, monitored the observance of justice during the protests - two Norwegian tourists who went to a police station in the north of Prague to report a stolen mobile phone, saw \"a number of people handcuffed to the wall who were being beaten severely\". </p> <p>Other reports claim that arrested women were asked to strip and perform physical exercises in front of male officers. </p> <p>A British woman in her 20s, who suffers from epilepsy, was reportedly forced to mime her condition to prison officers and was then hit for refusing to take the medicine made available to her. </p> <p>Both legal observers and Inpeg, the organiser of the main demonstration, say that medical reports confirm the physical abuse. </p> <p>While the Czech police were widely praised for their handling of the street violence, most of those arrested appear to have been picked up on the streets long after the demonstration and had no direct connection with the violence launched by a few hundred hardcore anarchists. </p> <p>Legal observers and Inpeg say they are hiring lawyers to fight cases of alleged maltreatment. OPH also plans criminal complaints against the Czech police who have so far barely commented on the allegations. </p> <p>\"This is not some strange country like the Ukraine, and we have no information on anyone being badly treated,\" said a spokeswoman for the Prague division of Czech police. \"It's nonsense, but if anyone feels they have been badly treated they can go to the department of complaints and control.\"</p>",

Around 500 foreigners are believed to have been arrested, including a large number of Germans and Spanish. According to police, 25 people have been charged, including six Czechs. All 34 Britons arrested are believed to have been released. A 21-year-old university student from London told the Guardian he was picked up at a pub by police on the evening after the September 26 demonstration outside a meeting of international financiers. His hands were bound with plastic so tight, he said, that his wrists swelled. He was strip-searched, his fingerprints and photograph were taken and he was then kept in a four metre by four metre cell with 35 other people. Anyone who tried to sleep was woken up by bright lights and an officer running a stick along the cell bars. People were strip-searched in front of him and slapped when naked. \"I got off fairly lightly in comparison to the Italians and Israelis who they pointed at and beat up in a very fascistic way,\" he added. \"When they took 25 of us to the third destination we had to run towards the bus through two lines of police who hit us in the kidneys with their truncheons and fists. There were women as well, and they laughed as they hit us. Afterwards there were several bleeding noses.\" Like other detainees, the student said he was denied access to a translator most of the time, forced to sign Czech documents he did not understand and deprived of sleep and food. According to OPH - a group whose members, including several lawyers, monitored the observance of justice during the protests - two Norwegian tourists who went to a police station in the north of Prague to report a stolen mobile phone, saw \"a number of people handcuffed to the wall who were being beaten severely\". Other reports claim that arrested women were asked to strip and perform physical exercises in front of male officers. A British woman in her 20s, who suffers from epilepsy, was reportedly forced to mime her condition to prison officers and was then hit for refusing to take the medicine made available to her. Both legal observers and Inpeg, the organiser of the main demonstration, say that medical reports confirm the physical abuse. While the Czech police were widely praised for their handling of the street violence, most of those arrested appear to have been picked up on the streets long after the demonstration and had no direct connection with the violence launched by a few hundred hardcore anarchists. Legal observers and Inpeg say they are hiring lawyers to fight cases of alleged maltreatment. OPH also plans criminal complaints against the Czech police who have so far barely commented on the allegations. \"This is not some strange country like the Ukraine, and we have no information on anyone being badly treated,\" said a spokeswoman for the Prague division of Czech police. \"It's nonsense, but if anyone feels they have been badly treated they can go to the department of complaints and control.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives are planning the strongest signal yet of their support for marriage by offering a transferable personal tax allowances exclusively to married couples with young children. The plan would remove many of the current tax disadvantages facing a family when the wife wishes to stay at home to look after young children. At present the first \u00a34,500 of earnings is tax free. Making the notional allowance of a wife staying at home transferable to her husband would give him \u00a39,000 tax free. Shadow ministers are studying proposals for a \u00a31bn fund aimed at 3m married couples with young children. They believe the proposal would recognise marriage, extend women's choice, and help families with children at a time of particular financial pressure. The idea, supported by David Willetts, the shadow social secretary, was drafted by a welfare policy committee set up his predecessor, Iain Duncan-Smith. Its technical aspects have been tested by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. It is being studied by the shadow Treasury team. Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor has been cool about the proposal, first floated in the 1997 Tory manifesto, but is under pressure to accept it. The package is likely to replace the party's support for the return of the married couples allowance, a benefit enjoyed by all couples whether or not they had children, abolished earlier this year. The committee was initially divided on whether to suggest specific help to married couples, fearing that it would expose the party to a repetition of the disastrous era of \"back to basics\", when its MPs found their private lives did not matchparty policy. The suggestion that the allowance should be transferred only between married partners and not those cohabiting will prove controversial. However, the Conservatives have seen surveys which suggest that 75-80% of single parents would like their children to marry eventually and show that, despite the spiralling divorce rate, support for marriage remains stubbornly high among those not yet married and the formerly married. William Hague told the Conservative conference yesterday: \"I will restore the recognition of marriage in our tax and benefit system.\" He stressed that he did not want the party to insist that everyone had to live in a married family, but said: \"I do believe it is much the best thing for our society if the vast majority of people are in stable and happy families - and marriage is usually the cornerstone of a stable and successful family.\" Stressing that it was his personal view that transferable tax allowance should be restricted to married couples, Mr Willetts, one of the most experienced minds in welfare reform, said: \"Something happens when people marry that does not happen when they co-habit. It marks a public commitment.\" He added: \"If you become one family unit, the benefit system has no difficulty recognising this, but the tax system does not do so well in recognising marriage.\" He believes it is difficult to establish a watertight definition of cohabiting with which the Inland Revenue could be happy. In France experiments with so-called solidarity pacts between unmarried couples have proved flawed and liable to benefit abuse. He would like to see the transferable tax allowance aimed at the 3m families with children under five.The tight focus would have greater financial impact than helping all 13m married couples. The Conservatives believe that the policy chimes with the aspiration of many women who want to stay at home during their child's early years.

Since independence from Britain in 1956 there has been continuous war between the Arab north and the marginalised African south, except for one decade from 1972. The imposition by Khartoum of Islamic sharia law in 1983 unleashed a far more serious war which has spread from the south to the eastern front, the Nuba mountains, and is increasingly concentrated around the oilfields in the centre.</p> <p>Last week, in an unprecedented gesture, President Omar el Bashir travelled to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, to meet leaders of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which links the southern SPLA with opposition groups from the north in a military alliance which has inflicted major defeats on Khartoum.</p> <p>This was just one of a number of diplomatic meetings, with others in Uganda and Kenya at the same time. Egypt has become a key player.</p> <p>For several months Washington has been canvassing a Dayton-type scenario for Sudan with all the myriad opposition groups forced together to hammer out a settlement under international auspices.</p> <p>And Washington has begun to disburse $3m to civic projects in southern Sudan, such as a judicial system, which will soon trickle through to towns like Yirol.</p> <p><b> Bomb shelters</b><br></p> <p>The SPLA has taken control of almost this entire region, mainly of Dinka cattle-rearers, in the last three years. Earlier, control swung back and forth between rebels and government. Across the south the government controls only garrison towns supplied mainly from the north by air, though some traders cross between control areas.</p> <p>The only contact most southerners have with the government is the periodic bombing of church compounds, hospitals, airstrips, markets and boreholes, in retribution for SPLA military gains. In two weeks of August more than 100 bombs were dropped. Every church compound has a bomb shelter.</p> <p>The UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) has a 10-year-old programme with the government to fly in humanitarian supplies to designated sites in the south agreed by Khartoum. But, increasingly, aid agencies such as Christian Aid, Concern, and Norwegian People's Aid are flying in defiance of Khartoum, sending small civilian supply planes from northern Kenya to a dozen or more airstrips cut through the long grass. They are helping some 5m people in SPLA areas.</p> <p>Food, cement, even a generator, were on our plane, chartered by a church group and flown by a Russian former MiG pilot.</p> <p>Roads in the liberated areas are few and in terrible condition. A 100-mile drive took us eight hour. Many bridges and ferries have been destroyed and only canoes cross the wide tributaries of the Nile which criss-cross the area. The traders, who now bring salt, sugar, tea and cloth to Yirol's market, walk for a month to Uganda for supplies.</p> <p>But Yirol is a symbol of the extraordinary resilience which has kept the society from disintegrating under the squeeze of isolation. The old ways live on and an enthusiastic crowd soon gathers around a wild group of young men who have come into town from the huge cattle camp outside.</p> <p>Bunched tightly together by older men in skins and carrying spears, they perform a ceremonial dance to insistent drumming. They are celebrating the end of an initiation ceremony in which they have spent three months playing together, being fattened on milk, and looked after by a young girl who is then carried in on the shoulders of a group of men. This custom was officially banned by the SPLA last year, but some groups continue the tradition.</p> <p>\"If any of our old practices deserves to be banned it is this one - the most productive group sits idle for three months before becoming a man - this is just not sustainable given how people are living now with the war,\" said one former SPLA commander.</p> <p>He, and several others in the town, are dragging their people into the modern world and the New Sudan through a new organisation called the Bahr el Ghazal Development Association (BYDA).</p> <p>\"Look what happened in Somalia when they got rid of Siad Barre [the president], but hadn't prepared the society for a new situation - a decade without government. We cannot afford to wait for peace and then build a new society, we have to start now,\" said one senior ex-commander, Mario Muor Muor.</p> <p><b> End of isolation</b><br></p> <p>BYDA has introduced ox-ploughing and micro-credit - staples of modest rural development elsewhere but in this context as revolutionary as the microchip.</p> <p>It took six months of discussion before the SPLA allowed BYDA to operate, accepting it as a partner, not a rival. The organisation, with its many ex-SPLA commanders, is a product of dissent within the south's historic movement.</p> <p>The SPLA's unchallenged leader, John Garang, has been fighting for the south since the mid-1950s. But in the last 17 years of war the SPLA has been split by betrayals and factionalism. It has lived by a military culture imbued in years of training in Ethiopia which gave the movement military strength at the price of a culture of silence, according to Mr Muor. Despite a major conference in 1994 in which resolutions were passed to involve and empower the people they were fighting for, change never came within the SPLA.</p> <p>However, in the last year, the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) succeeded in organising a series of peace meetings which has ended muchof the south/south fighting which has been a constant strand of the north/south war.</p> <p>Mr Muor was part of the coalition that put together the first historic meeting at Wunlit, in March 1999. Three hundred youths were mobilised to build a road and airstrip. Elders, clan leaders and commanders were brought together by the NSCC and committed themselves to end the periodic fighting between the Dinka and Nuer tribes and the shifting alliances with the government against the SPLA.</p>",

Bomb shelters The SPLA has taken control of almost this entire region, mainly of Dinka cattle-rearers, in the last three years. Earlier, control swung back and forth between rebels and government. Across the south the government controls only garrison towns supplied mainly from the north by air, though some traders cross between control areas. The only contact most southerners have with the government is the periodic bombing of church compounds, hospitals, airstrips, markets and boreholes, in retribution for SPLA military gains. In two weeks of August more than 100 bombs were dropped. Every church compound has a bomb shelter. The UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) has a 10-year-old programme with the government to fly in humanitarian supplies to designated sites in the south agreed by Khartoum. But, increasingly, aid agencies such as Christian Aid, Concern, and Norwegian People's Aid are flying in defiance of Khartoum, sending small civilian supply planes from northern Kenya to a dozen or more airstrips cut through the long grass. They are helping some 5m people in SPLA areas. Food, cement, even a generator, were on our plane, chartered by a church group and flown by a Russian former MiG pilot. Roads in the liberated areas are few and in terrible condition. A 100-mile drive took us eight hour. Many bridges and ferries have been destroyed and only canoes cross the wide tributaries of the Nile which criss-cross the area. The traders, who now bring salt, sugar, tea and cloth to Yirol's market, walk for a month to Uganda for supplies. But Yirol is a symbol of the extraordinary resilience which has kept the society from disintegrating under the squeeze of isolation. The old ways live on and an enthusiastic crowd soon gathers around a wild group of young men who have come into town from the huge cattle camp outside. Bunched tightly together by older men in skins and carrying spears, they perform a ceremonial dance to insistent drumming. They are celebrating the end of an initiation ceremony in which they have spent three months playing together, being fattened on milk, and looked after by a young girl who is then carried in on the shoulders of a group of men. This custom was officially banned by the SPLA last year, but some groups continue the tradition. \"If any of our old practices deserves to be banned it is this one - the most productive group sits idle for three months before becoming a man - this is just not sustainable given how people are living now with the war,\" said one former SPLA commander. He, and several others in the town, are dragging their people into the modern world and the New Sudan through a new organisation called the Bahr el Ghazal Development Association (BYDA). \"Look what happened in Somalia when they got rid of Siad Barre [the president], but hadn't prepared the society for a new situation - a decade without government. We cannot afford to wait for peace and then build a new society, we have to start now,\" said one senior ex-commander, Mario Muor Muor. End of isolation BYDA has introduced ox-ploughing and micro-credit - staples of modest rural development elsewhere but in this context as revolutionary as the microchip. It took six months of discussion before the SPLA allowed BYDA to operate, accepting it as a partner, not a rival. The organisation, with its many ex-SPLA commanders, is a product of dissent within the south's historic movement. The SPLA's unchallenged leader, John Garang, has been fighting for the south since the mid-1950s. But in the last 17 years of war the SPLA has been split by betrayals and factionalism. It has lived by a military culture imbued in years of training in Ethiopia which gave the movement military strength at the price of a culture of silence, according to Mr Muor. Despite a major conference in 1994 in which resolutions were passed to involve and empower the people they were fighting for, change never came within the SPLA. However, in the last year, the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) succeeded in organising a series of peace meetings which has ended muchof the south/south fighting which has been a constant strand of the north/south war. Mr Muor was part of the coalition that put together the first historic meeting at Wunlit, in March 1999. Three hundred youths were mobilised to build a road and airstrip. Elders, clan leaders and commanders were brought together by the NSCC and committed themselves to end the periodic fighting between the Dinka and Nuer tribes and the shifting alliances with the government against the SPLA.",

The captain admitted that in June 1989, the year of the tragedy, he had captained the Bowbelle when it was involved in a collision with a commercial vessel at Newhaven harbour in East Sussex. But he denied Mr Mansfield's suggestion that the cause of that accident was \"a lack of liaison between the bridge and the engine room.\" Mr Mansfield pressed the captain on whether he saw the pleasureboat passengers' desperate battle to survive. Mr Mansfield: \"Did you see people in the water ?\" Mr Henderson: \"I'm not sure whether I did or not.\" Mr Mansfield: \"Would you want to know whether you had -\" Mr Henderson (interrupting): \"The whole thing went very quick and I cannot - I had difficulty then and I have difficulty now coming to terms - and I do not ...\" Mr Mansfield: \"Were you concerned whether anybody was injured in this collision?\" Mr Henderson replied: \"Of course I was.\" The inquiry continues today.",

East London and the City health authority, which runs the hospital, now the Royal London, contested her negligence claim, arguing that the mastectomy was beneficial because it stopped her from developing cancer.

Eden is not due to open until next Easter. But the project to transform the 24-hectare pit (60 acres) has been quick to capture the public imagination with around 400,000 people paying to view its progress from a visitor centre that opened in May. Eden, which is backed by \u00a340m of millennium commission money, says its aim is to awe visitors with man's relationship with and dependence on plants. The second biome will contain plants from southern Africa, the Mediterranean and California, while the outside grounds - including 10 miles of paths - will include plants from Chile and Australasia as well as those native to Cornwall. Many of the plants have come from Eden's nursery, while others have arrived from universities and nurseries in Holland. Among the more unusual species is the Cananga Odorata from Malaysia, which is used to make the classic fragrance Chanel No 5. Robin Lock, curator of the humid tropic biome, said: \"We will have a real variety of plants here and the challenge is getting the right combination.\" Horticulture director Philip McMillan Browse, said: \"When we first thought up the Eden Project we said why don't we build the biggest greenhouse in the world and put a rainforest in it?

The two, who were best friends from the age of 11, were drawn together by their differences and bonded by a desire to \"dominate and exploit\" women, the Old Bailey heard. Both had been singled out for bullying at Haverstock Hill secondary school in Hampstead. Through this experience, they became inseparable, truanting together and abandoning studies to go to work at the age of 16. At that stage they showed little interest in girls, the court heard, but were obsessed by martial arts and watched kung fu films. In their late teens they began fantasising about abusing women, Duffy later told police. They also enjoyed frightening people. A favourite prank was to surprise courting couples and homosexuals on Hampstead Heath, the court heard. \"They would jump out at them wearing Halloween masks,\" said Mark Dennis, prosecuting. \"This behaviour may have been understandable from teenagers, but they were in their 20s.\" Being married and having children did not affect their friendship.

      "bodyText": "In a far-reaching move which promises to lead to cheaper and faster internet access, the European Union yesterday agreed that the last mile of telephone lines into people's homes should be opened up to competition in January. Telecoms ministers meeting in Luxembourg reached agreement on a European commission proposal to unbundle the local loop in a deal that is likely to be approved by the European parliament later this month. The agreement was signed as the controversy continued surrounding the break-up of BT's local network. Cable &amp; Wireless said it had joined the chorus of rivals making a formal complaint against BT in the row over access to the company's local exchanges. Mike McTighe, chief executive of C&amp;W's global division, said the company had made its feelings known to the industry regulator, Oftel. \"The local exchanges they're making available are the ones that are least attractive from a commercial perspective. \"They've produced this wonderful blacklist of exchanges that are 'full'. Well, surprise, surprise, the exchanges that are full are more likely to be exchanges that are most likely to be commercially viable. \"While they've been prevaricating they've been able to deploy their own DSL [digital] equipment and take the space in those exchanges. So how fair does that sound? Is that a level playing field?\" Under the proposal the EU's 15 member states have to scrap remaining monopolies on phone lines into people's homes and offices. This will enable hi-tech firms to compete to install digital technology capable of squeezing even television pictures down the line. \"We have completed liberalisation of the sector,\" said Erkki Liikanen, the commissioner for the industry. \"We had done that with international and long distance calls but not with local. This last step is of growing importance because of the internet.\" Patricia Hewitt, the DTI minister for e-commerce, said after yesterday's meeting: \"It is an enormously important issue for the development of e-commerce across the EU.\" The agreement is expected to be a big boost for industry and the internet, and crucial in helping Europe catch up with the online revolution in the US and Asia. Telecoms liberalisation was a key feature of the Lisbon economic summit last March, in which Britain and the commission played a leading role. British officials made much of promising cheaper, better and faster net access, and yesterday hotly denied suggestions that they had attempted to delay the agreement. Only Germany and Denmark among EU members have open local loops, while France, Ireland and Belgium are some way behind the proposed liberalisation schedule. In Britain, Oftel is aiming to allow BT competitors to offer services on its local loop from July 2001, six months after the EU's target. \"Unbundling\" means identifying individual lines from the thick groups of wire inside a telephone exchange. The EU regulation goes further than some national unbundling already undertaken by requiring full access to the local loop for entrants as well as shared access - where the incumbent would continue to provide voice services but a new entrant would provide internet access through the same copper wire.",

      "bodyText": "Vosper Thornycroft yesterday warned that it may have to halve its shipbuilding workforce because of a lack of short term work. The company said 650 jobs were at risk unless it could secure a batch of new orders by the end of the year. But Martin Jay, chief executive, said he hoped to avoid any redundancies and revealed he was already in negotiations for two contracts. Vosper's problems were caused by a gap between orders as the current seven ship order for Royal Navy minehunters is coming to an end, he said. Although the company is expected to be part of the \u00a31bn contract for three Type 45 warships, awarded to BAE Systems by the Ministry of Defence, production is not scheduled to start until 2002. There is also an air of uncertainty over the deal as a contract is yet to be signed. Mr Jay admitted that he could not say it was definitely coming to Vosper until the deal was finalised, but insisted there had not been a significant delay. \"We have had a lot of discussions since July as they are highly complicated but there is nothing abnormal [about the time scale],\" he said. \"I need to find some short term work to bridge the gap between now and then. I am confident we are going to be able to do this.\" Yesterday's news was broken to workers in a series of meetings at the company's bases in Southampton and Portsmouth. Trade unions, which have 90 days to discuss the proposed job cuts, spent much of the day in talks with Vosper's management. Senior officials said last night that they thought it was a serious situation but one which could be resolved. Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the AEEU, said that if the problem was contracts not being signed, they would do everything in their power to speed up the process. An announcement released to the stock market yesterday morning said: \"We are taking this action as a precautionary measure. \"No company can keep people employed indefinitely on maintenance and other temporary work without damaging its overall prospects.\" The market reacted badly to Vosper's announcement although some industry observers said it did not come as a total surprise. They said that the shipbuilding industry had been suffering for years and this was a symptom of the \"feast and famine\" syndrome which often occurs. Vosper's shares slipped 62.5p to \u00a312.25 by the close of trading last night. This is well off its \u00a314.05 year high, but still comfortably ahead of the \u00a39.30 low. Analysts said that the decline could have been greater had the company not looked to diversify in the early 1990s. \"Vosper has been very successful in diversifying its sales away from the core shipbuilding business and more than 50% now comes from support services,\" said one.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Back in November, when Labour was worried that its poll lead had dropped to a mere 10%, the chairman of the Countryside Alliance, John Jackson, wrote to the home secretary, Jack Straw. It started with a complaint about \"an imminent announcement on fox-hunting\". But it ended with a warning: \"I must tell you,\" wrote Jackson,\"that the rural temperature is very high and the political landscape in the countryside is tinder dry.\"</p> <p>Straw \"noted\" concerns, assured Jackson that media reports had been \"entirely speculative\" and promised to \"bear the matters raised in mind\". His response was prompt, polite and essentially dismissive.</p> <p>It would be easy for the Labour leadership to dismiss the Alliance. This is an organisation with a predominantly Tory membership whose central aim has been to preserve the right to kill foxes and which readily compares Tony Blair to Adolf Hitler. One poster which bore its logo depicted the gay agriculture minister, Nick Brown, as a man \"who loves gays and buggers the countryside\". The logo also appeared in the magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog - from which the Alliance distanced itself. The publication described the black MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, Oona King, as \"typical of her species\", and told her to \"direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts\".</p> <p>To dismiss the Alliance would be a mistake. It may look like the provisional wing of the landed gentry, but since it started broadening its political horizons it has also broadened its base of support. Today, in Bournemouth, it will take pride of place at the working country fair, a Tory-backed event to show the party's concerns about the plight of rural Britain that will be attended by William Hague. It boasts 80 full-time staff, including 10 regional press and public relations officers, 90,000 individual members at \u00a335 a time, and 300,000 affliated members. All this is maintained with an annual budget of \u00a34.5m, from a range of very wealthy members. \"You can easily raise a few thousand pounds at a hunt meeting. There's a lot of money swilling around,\" says one former Alliance employee who did not wish to be named.</p> <p>Politically it has now become the most vocal and visible opponent of a weakened government. \"They have the potential to be a very potent, electoral force,\" says Michael Jacobs, the general secretary of the Labour-supporting Fabian Society. \"At the moment they have the capacity to mobilise opinion against Labour.\"</p> <p>Last week, nine months after Jackson wrote to Straw, on an overcast autumn day in Brighton and an altogether radically different political climate, the Countryside Alliance marched on the Labour party conference with a spring in its step.</p> <p>To the backing of whistles and hunting horns one member carried a placard stating: \"I love the countryside, I fear my government.\" One was dressed as Tony Blair with a noose around his neck. Numbering more than a thousand they strode purposefully in smart sweaters and pressed jeans, angry yet orderly, between metal railings and a considerable police presence, as Labour delegates in suits looked on bemused, as though viewing exhibits in a zoo.</p> <p>The day before, deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had rallied the conference with a blistering attack on the party's rural opponents. \"Every time I see the Countryside Alliance and their contorted faces, I redouble my determination to vote in the House of Commons to abolish fox-hunting for ever,\" he raged. Now the hunters and their allies are coming in for the kill.</p> <p>It is a stunning revival for an organisation which began life as a hybrid of three minority-interest groups - the British Field Sports Society, the Countryside Movement and the Countryside Business Group. The Countryside Movement was set up in 1995, with the former Liberal leader Sir David Steel as its executive chairman. \"The aim was that it would be a campaigning organisation rather than a membership organisation, that dealt with issues affecting the countryside in general,\" says Alex Armstrong, deputy chief executive of the Alliance who used to work for the Movement. \"But it was not terribly successful.\"</p> <p>Despite several wealthy backers the Movement, which was pro-hunting and received donations from the gun lobby, heavily outspent its budget and had to be rescued with \u00a31m from the Duke of Westminster.</p> <p>The Countryside Business Group was set up by the American financier, Eric Bettelheim, to raise funds to support the hunting lobby. Both were new organisations set up in response to, or anticipation of, a Labour government with a manifesto commitment to ban hunting. Neither had a particularly large following or could claim any great successes other than their ability to raise funds.</p> <p>The linchpin to the Alliance's creation and continued political presence is the now-defunct British Field Sports Society - an organisation dedicated to defending the right to hunt which bequeathed its offices to the Alliance. \"Two limping organisations were swallowed up by the BFSS,\" says a former Alliance employee . \"It was effectively a takeover. The idea was to wrap up hunting in the warm glow of the countryside and everyone will love it.\"</p> <p>What followed was a skilful exercise in rebranding which coincided with a dramatic slump in the fortunes of rural Britain. Sheep were being auctioned for seven pence each; farmers were selling pigs for a \u00a320 loss; hens couldn't be given away, suicides rose. These problems may or may not have been caused by the government, but it was to the government they looked to put things right. \"Rural people feel they have been victimised,\" says Nigel Henson, director of communications for the Alliance. \"They feel that urban Britain couldn't give a monkey's about them.\"</p> <p>The Alliance, with its recent makeover, was perfectly poised to step into the void and bring together the disparate discontent in the countryside.</p> <p>Initially it fared poorly. Its first national demonstration in London in 1998 was large but undermined by a poll which revealed that 80% of the demonstrators were Conservatives, leaving the government with few concerns about losing votes. No sooner had they arrived in the capital than stories emerged of employers coercing their employees into making the trip. If ever there appeared to be a battle between old and new Britain, between the forces of modernism and the agents of privilege then this was it; the squirearchy on parade waging a class war against a culturally metropolitan and ostensibly liberal Labour government</p> <p>When questioned about rural issues other than hunting, employees would simply make up a position on the spot. \"All we knew about was hunting. It was all we cared about too,\" says one.</p> <p>Then a change of management followed bitter in-fighting. A few months after the march the newly-appointed head of the Alliance, Edward Duke, resigned after all the regional chairmen demanded his removal. \"Our quest to be taken seriously is in tatters,\" said hunting's in-house journal, Horse &amp; Hound. \"We have been torn apart by ambition, power struggles, prejudice and the inability to see the bigger picture.\"</p> <p>Faced by a huge parliamentary majority, supporters took to the streets to make their grievances known. Its shambolic determination recalled the hard left of the 80s. It was riven with internal splits, the leadership was constantly denounced by the membership for selling out the cause, and it attempted to emulate the age-old leftist tactic of entryism. Through an organisation called Friends of the National Trust, Alliance supporters' attempts to infiltrate the upper echelons of the National Trust, which banned stag-hunting on its land, have so far proved unsuccesful. When they demonstrated in London two years ago one passer-by shouted: \"We subsidise you,\" while another asked: \"Why don't you get proper jobs?\" Replace the Barbours with donkey jackets and Labour with the Tories and they are, in many ways, a mirror image of how the hard left behaved and was perceived.</p> <p>This undoubtedly was the calculation Prescott made when he delivered his speech last week, when he treated the Alliance to the same contempt that Margaret Thatcher showed to CND supporters and miners. \"Fox hunters are one of the few enemies the Labour party allow themselves nowadays,\" says Jacobs.</p> <p>However, since its early, disorganised days the Alliance has developed policy on everything from pubs to poverty and abbatoirs to employment. Its chief executive, Richard Burge, is a Labour party member; neither he, his deputy, his chairman or Henson are hunters. The key issues for the countryside, Henson admits, are \"the demise in the economic and retail sectors which are crippling the social infrastructure\". The priority for the Alliance however remains saving the hunt. \"If you looked at our membership you will inevitably find a leaning towards people who joined for country sports reasons,\" says Henson. \"The reason we have concentrated on that recently is that it is immediately under threat. The Labour party is going to ban hunting, they are not going to ban rural post offices.\"</p> <p>Its project of acting as the hegemonic voice of rural Britain is by no means assured. \"We are a new organisation in a period of transition,\" says Henson. The failure of the Alliance to back the fuel protests, on the grounds that it would alienate it from public opinion, was received angrily by many in rural areas. \"There are completely contradictory forces involved,\" says Jacob. \"There is no coherent base apart from geographic proximity.\"</p> <p>Some wish it would ditch its support for the hunt in order to broaden its appeal. Others are concerned that it is diluting its central purpose to save its political skin. \"People think they are preparing for life after fox- hunting,\" says a former employee. \"But it won't have a life after fox- hunting. Most of its members joined to save the hunt. When that goes they'll leave.\" In the Daily Telegraph last week, the publisher of Gun Trade News, Simon Baseley, warned: \"Members and others should be rightly suspicious of the Countryside Alliance re-branding. This has given rise to a feeling that the alliance has at some level accepted that the fight for hunting is lost and is beginning to prepare a retreat to a better prepared position.\"</p> <p>None the less they represent a serious problem for Labour. Tory dominance in rural areas is much overstated and the countryside is an ideal battleground for Hague to recoup some of its losses.

      "bodyText": "Back in November, when Labour was worried that its poll lead had dropped to a mere 10%, the chairman of the Countryside Alliance, John Jackson, wrote to the home secretary, Jack Straw. It started with a complaint about \"an imminent announcement on fox-hunting\". But it ended with a warning: \"I must tell you,\" wrote Jackson,\"that the rural temperature is very high and the political landscape in the countryside is tinder dry.\" Straw \"noted\" concerns, assured Jackson that media reports had been \"entirely speculative\" and promised to \"bear the matters raised in mind\". His response was prompt, polite and essentially dismissive. It would be easy for the Labour leadership to dismiss the Alliance. This is an organisation with a predominantly Tory membership whose central aim has been to preserve the right to kill foxes and which readily compares Tony Blair to Adolf Hitler. One poster which bore its logo depicted the gay agriculture minister, Nick Brown, as a man \"who loves gays and buggers the countryside\". The logo also appeared in the magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog - from which the Alliance distanced itself. The publication described the black MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, Oona King, as \"typical of her species\", and told her to \"direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts\". To dismiss the Alliance would be a mistake. It may look like the provisional wing of the landed gentry, but since it started broadening its political horizons it has also broadened its base of support. Today, in Bournemouth, it will take pride of place at the working country fair, a Tory-backed event to show the party's concerns about the plight of rural Britain that will be attended by William Hague. It boasts 80 full-time staff, including 10 regional press and public relations officers, 90,000 individual members at \u00a335 a time, and 300,000 affliated members. All this is maintained with an annual budget of \u00a34.5m, from a range of very wealthy members. \"You can easily raise a few thousand pounds at a hunt meeting. There's a lot of money swilling around,\" says one former Alliance employee who did not wish to be named. Politically it has now become the most vocal and visible opponent of a weakened government. \"They have the potential to be a very potent, electoral force,\" says Michael Jacobs, the general secretary of the Labour-supporting Fabian Society. \"At the moment they have the capacity to mobilise opinion against Labour.\" Last week, nine months after Jackson wrote to Straw, on an overcast autumn day in Brighton and an altogether radically different political climate, the Countryside Alliance marched on the Labour party conference with a spring in its step. To the backing of whistles and hunting horns one member carried a placard stating: \"I love the countryside, I fear my government.\" One was dressed as Tony Blair with a noose around his neck. Numbering more than a thousand they strode purposefully in smart sweaters and pressed jeans, angry yet orderly, between metal railings and a considerable police presence, as Labour delegates in suits looked on bemused, as though viewing exhibits in a zoo. The day before, deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had rallied the conference with a blistering attack on the party's rural opponents. \"Every time I see the Countryside Alliance and their contorted faces, I redouble my determination to vote in the House of Commons to abolish fox-hunting for ever,\" he raged. Now the hunters and their allies are coming in for the kill. It is a stunning revival for an organisation which began life as a hybrid of three minority-interest groups - the British Field Sports Society, the Countryside Movement and the Countryside Business Group. The Countryside Movement was set up in 1995, with the former Liberal leader Sir David Steel as its executive chairman. \"The aim was that it would be a campaigning organisation rather than a membership organisation, that dealt with issues affecting the countryside in general,\" says Alex Armstrong, deputy chief executive of the Alliance who used to work for the Movement. \"But it was not terribly successful.\" Despite several wealthy backers the Movement, which was pro-hunting and received donations from the gun lobby, heavily outspent its budget and had to be rescued with \u00a31m from the Duke of Westminster. The Countryside Business Group was set up by the American financier, Eric Bettelheim, to raise funds to support the hunting lobby. Both were new organisations set up in response to, or anticipation of, a Labour government with a manifesto commitment to ban hunting. Neither had a particularly large following or could claim any great successes other than their ability to raise funds. The linchpin to the Alliance's creation and continued political presence is the now-defunct British Field Sports Society - an organisation dedicated to defending the right to hunt which bequeathed its offices to the Alliance. \"Two limping organisations were swallowed up by the BFSS,\" says a former Alliance employee . \"It was effectively a takeover. The idea was to wrap up hunting in the warm glow of the countryside and everyone will love it.\" What followed was a skilful exercise in rebranding which coincided with a dramatic slump in the fortunes of rural Britain. Sheep were being auctioned for seven pence each; farmers were selling pigs for a \u00a320 loss; hens couldn't be given away, suicides rose. These problems may or may not have been caused by the government, but it was to the government they looked to put things right. \"Rural people feel they have been victimised,\" says Nigel Henson, director of communications for the Alliance. \"They feel that urban Britain couldn't give a monkey's about them.\" The Alliance, with its recent makeover, was perfectly poised to step into the void and bring together the disparate discontent in the countryside. Initially it fared poorly. Its first national demonstration in London in 1998 was large but undermined by a poll which revealed that 80% of the demonstrators were Conservatives, leaving the government with few concerns about losing votes. No sooner had they arrived in the capital than stories emerged of employers coercing their employees into making the trip. If ever there appeared to be a battle between old and new Britain, between the forces of modernism and the agents of privilege then this was it; the squirearchy on parade waging a class war against a culturally metropolitan and ostensibly liberal Labour government When questioned about rural issues other than hunting, employees would simply make up a position on the spot. \"All we knew about was hunting. It was all we cared about too,\" says one. Then a change of management followed bitter in-fighting. A few months after the march the newly-appointed head of the Alliance, Edward Duke, resigned after all the regional chairmen demanded his removal. \"Our quest to be taken seriously is in tatters,\" said hunting's in-house journal, Horse &amp; Hound. \"We have been torn apart by ambition, power struggles, prejudice and the inability to see the bigger picture.\" Faced by a huge parliamentary majority, supporters took to the streets to make their grievances known. Its shambolic determination recalled the hard left of the 80s. It was riven with internal splits, the leadership was constantly denounced by the membership for selling out the cause, and it attempted to emulate the age-old leftist tactic of entryism. Through an organisation called Friends of the National Trust, Alliance supporters' attempts to infiltrate the upper echelons of the National Trust, which banned stag-hunting on its land, have so far proved unsuccesful. When they demonstrated in London two years ago one passer-by shouted: \"We subsidise you,\" while another asked: \"Why don't you get proper jobs?\" Replace the Barbours with donkey jackets and Labour with the Tories and they are, in many ways, a mirror image of how the hard left behaved and was perceived. This undoubtedly was the calculation Prescott made when he delivered his speech last week, when he treated the Alliance to the same contempt that Margaret Thatcher showed to CND supporters and miners. \"Fox hunters are one of the few enemies the Labour party allow themselves nowadays,\" says Jacobs. However, since its early, disorganised days the Alliance has developed policy on everything from pubs to poverty and abbatoirs to employment. Its chief executive, Richard Burge, is a Labour party member; neither he, his deputy, his chairman or Henson are hunters. The key issues for the countryside, Henson admits, are \"the demise in the economic and retail sectors which are crippling the social infrastructure\". The priority for the Alliance however remains saving the hunt. \"If you looked at our membership you will inevitably find a leaning towards people who joined for country sports reasons,\" says Henson. \"The reason we have concentrated on that recently is that it is immediately under threat. The Labour party is going to ban hunting, they are not going to ban rural post offices.\" Its project of acting as the hegemonic voice of rural Britain is by no means assured. \"We are a new organisation in a period of transition,\" says Henson. The failure of the Alliance to back the fuel protests, on the grounds that it would alienate it from public opinion, was received angrily by many in rural areas. \"There are completely contradictory forces involved,\" says Jacob. \"There is no coherent base apart from geographic proximity.\" Some wish it would ditch its support for the hunt in order to broaden its appeal. Others are concerned that it is diluting its central purpose to save its political skin. \"People think they are preparing for life after fox- hunting,\" says a former employee. \"But it won't have a life after fox- hunting. Most of its members joined to save the hunt. When that goes they'll leave.\" In the Daily Telegraph last week, the publisher of Gun Trade News, Simon Baseley, warned: \"Members and others should be rightly suspicious of the Countryside Alliance re-branding. This has given rise to a feeling that the alliance has at some level accepted that the fight for hunting is lost and is beginning to prepare a retreat to a better prepared position.\" None the less they represent a serious problem for Labour. Tory dominance in rural areas is much overstated and the countryside is an ideal battleground for Hague to recoup some of its losses. While hunting, and particularly hunters, remain unpopular with the general public, rural Britain is not. The more sucessful the Countryside Alliance becomes at presenting itself as the voice of impoverished rural Britain, the more sophisticated Labour will have to become about the manner in which it deals with them. To dismiss them will be perceived to be dismissing the countryside. Henson's claim that the Alliance is \"resolutely apolitical\" is laughable, but it remains to be seen just how party political it will be come the election. From the podium Prescott asked why they weren't outside the Tory party conference \"when Tories were shutting 2,000 post offices, selling off 10,000 council houses, ending bus services and closing village schools\". The Alliance replied that they simply did not exist then. \"If we did then of course we would have protested.\" Given the present complexion of its membership, it is doubtful they would have attracted much support for such a protest against a Conservative government.

In an article for yesterday's Telegraph, he implicitly appealed to Mr Mandelson to throw him what he sees as the only feasible lifeline: the rescinding of the government's commitment to implement the Patten report on the future of the RUC. To save the agreement, he says, the government must agree to a moratorium on Patten until decommissioning has occurred, and to a \"complete reopening\" of the argument over its name.</p> <p>If the fate of the agreement is to hang on complete decommissioning, rather than just further progress (Mr Trimble here is ambiguous) then the agreement is finished, with all the consequences that means for the province. But there may be some leeway here if, as is also suggested, the two special investigators, Martii Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa, are swiftly invited back for a second tour. That certainly ought to happen. But it is not, on any calculation, something within the power of the Northern Ireland secretary to deliver. Patten is different. Here, it is well within Mr Mandelson's powers to assent to what Mr Trimble is asking. Yet to do that would merely swap one intractable problem for another, no less intractable. Sinn Fein, which has listed London's failure to move faster on Patten as one of the reasons why dissident republican groups are flourishing, would not be alone in condemning it. The SDLP would find it a surrender too far: so would Dublin. Nor, crucially, would it serve the long-term interests of Northern Ireland. It must be as clear to politicians in London as to those in Dublin that the province cannot move to consensual policing if the RUC is sustained in anything like its present form.</p> <p>The terms in which Mr Trimble has made his bid have as much to do with his party audience as they have with the Northern Ireland secretary's agenda. He has to be heard talking tough. Because Mr Trimble is virtually irreplaceable, Mr Mandelson needs to explore all possible ways of helping him; but not where, as here, they would amount to a sell-out. And unhappy as they are, unionists at all levels ought to consider this. No Trimble is likely to mean no agreement. And what no agreement is likely to mean is already written in blood across Northern Ireland.</p>",

In an article for yesterday's Telegraph, he implicitly appealed to Mr Mandelson to throw him what he sees as the only feasible lifeline: the rescinding of the government's commitment to implement the Patten report on the future of the RUC. To save the agreement, he says, the government must agree to a moratorium on Patten until decommissioning has occurred, and to a \"complete reopening\" of the argument over its name. If the fate of the agreement is to hang on complete decommissioning, rather than just further progress (Mr Trimble here is ambiguous) then the agreement is finished, with all the consequences that means for the province. But there may be some leeway here if, as is also suggested, the two special investigators, Martii Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa, are swiftly invited back for a second tour. That certainly ought to happen. But it is not, on any calculation, something within the power of the Northern Ireland secretary to deliver. Patten is different. Here, it is well within Mr Mandelson's powers to assent to what Mr Trimble is asking. Yet to do that would merely swap one intractable problem for another, no less intractable. Sinn Fein, which has listed London's failure to move faster on Patten as one of the reasons why dissident republican groups are flourishing, would not be alone in condemning it. The SDLP would find it a surrender too far: so would Dublin. Nor, crucially, would it serve the long-term interests of Northern Ireland. It must be as clear to politicians in London as to those in Dublin that the province cannot move to consensual policing if the RUC is sustained in anything like its present form. The terms in which Mr Trimble has made his bid have as much to do with his party audience as they have with the Northern Ireland secretary's agenda. He has to be heard talking tough. Because Mr Trimble is virtually irreplaceable, Mr Mandelson needs to explore all possible ways of helping him; but not where, as here, they would amount to a sell-out. And unhappy as they are, unionists at all levels ought to consider this. No Trimble is likely to mean no agreement. And what no agreement is likely to mean is already written in blood across Northern Ireland.",

The speculation started as a result of the joint venture established by the two groups at a cost of \u00a3300m a year to provide banking and investment services over the internet to the \"mass affluent\". </p> <p>But, there appears little reason for HSBC's management team to bow to Merrill Lynch's rumoured advances. At three times the size of Merrill, it is HSBC which would have to take the lead. </p> <p>At their annual board meeting today in Kuala Lumpur John Bond and his HSBC team are unlikely to be considering ways to woo the staff of Merrill, who own as much as 40% of their bank. He will be able to remind his board that HSBC is one of the banks which can truly claim to be global. In the US, HSBC's hexagon is a familiar sight on the streets of New York after its acquisition of the Safra banking empire. The hexagon is now accepted on the streets in Britain after replacing the tired Griffin of the renamed Midland Bank. It will gain credibility in France after the acquisition of CCF. </p> <p>The City seems content with HSBC's progress. Its shares have galloped upwards in recent months and their power yesterday was much of the reason for the FTSE's gains. </p> <p>The biggest problem for investors is deciding whether it is too late to join in the ride at \u00a39.80. Perhaps so, says Richard Coleman, banking analyst at ABN Amro. But HSBC is also one of the few British banks on his recommended buy list. </p> <p>Hated during the Asian crisis three years ago, HSBC has convinced investors it has diversified from emerging markets. The shares look as if they should be held and bought gently on dips.</p>",

      "bodyText": "That HSBC is being courted heavily by US banking group Merrill Lynch is becoming part of City folklore. Scared by the might of the Citigroup conglomerate, which includes Salomon Smith Barney, many believe the \"thundering herd\" that is Merrill Lynch would feel much more comfortable if it could team up with HSBC. The speculation started as a result of the joint venture established by the two groups at a cost of \u00a3300m a year to provide banking and investment services over the internet to the \"mass affluent\". But, there appears little reason for HSBC's management team to bow to Merrill Lynch's rumoured advances. At three times the size of Merrill, it is HSBC which would have to take the lead. At their annual board meeting today in Kuala Lumpur John Bond and his HSBC team are unlikely to be considering ways to woo the staff of Merrill, who own as much as 40% of their bank. He will be able to remind his board that HSBC is one of the banks which can truly claim to be global. In the US, HSBC's hexagon is a familiar sight on the streets of New York after its acquisition of the Safra banking empire. The hexagon is now accepted on the streets in Britain after replacing the tired Griffin of the renamed Midland Bank. It will gain credibility in France after the acquisition of CCF. The City seems content with HSBC's progress. Its shares have galloped upwards in recent months and their power yesterday was much of the reason for the FTSE's gains. The biggest problem for investors is deciding whether it is too late to join in the ride at \u00a39.80. Perhaps so, says Richard Coleman, banking analyst at ABN Amro. But HSBC is also one of the few British banks on his recommended buy list. Hated during the Asian crisis three years ago, HSBC has convinced investors it has diversified from emerging markets. The shares look as if they should be held and bought gently on dips.",

      "body": "<p>When Lynda La Plante was Lynda Titchmarsh - Tittie or Loopy to her friends - and she lived with her family in the Crosby district of Liverpool, she used to enjoy terrifying her younger sister with horror stories late at night. The lights in the Titchmarsh household would go out and Lynda would pipe up: \"Right, story time! There's a man in the wardrobe with no head.\" </p> <p>She was bossy and exhibitionist. She would scalp her sister's dolls and dunk them down the toilet. She was the star of the household - the little girl who had to take the place of her five-year-old sister who was killed in an accident; a Scouse Shirley Temple, forever putting on shows, singing, dancing and telling stories. </p> <p>Today, La Plante is still telling amazing stories at a ferocious rate. She has just published her eighth novel; the fourth series of her crime show Trial and Retribution starts on ITV tonight; a fifth series has just gone into production and another pilot drama called Mind Games is to be broadcast this autumn. Before all this there was a string of tele-vision hits - Widows (1983), Civvies (1992), The Governor (1995), to name but three. </p> <p>La Plante, once a jobbing actress, is now one of the most prolific and successful television writers ever. Her name on a script can bring in millions of viewers. She has her own production company with swish offices in London's Soho. She is feted by Hollywood; she gets personal calls from Barbra Streisand and has more projects in development than Steven Spielberg. </p> <p>We meet in her office in Wardour Street - all pale wood and cream carpet. She looks like a million dollars, petite, with good skin and teeth - like a member of the First Wives Club (her 18-year marriage to writer and rock musician Richard La Plante ended in divorce in 1996.) </p> <p>She wears a long, grey, fitted dress coat and trousers, with a tight cream bustier which encases a large, brown, crumpled bosom. She has lots of heavy, shiny jewellery, and toys with a sparkly cigarette case and lighter as she talks in a gravelly posh voice. Entertaining, telling stories, mimicking, acting out scenes - she is very good company. Shirley Temple grown up. </p> <p>La Plante, now 52, has just returned from the US, where her work increasingly takes her. A display board in the boardroom of La Plante Productions lists projects in development. On the left there is a list of UK projects - five in total. On the right are the US projects - Widows, Prime Suspect and Cold Shoulder, plus a number of less likely ventures such as Wuthering Heights and Helen of Troy (a six-hour mini-series for US television). Eight in total. Little Tittie from Crosby is doing well. </p> <p>But La Plante is disillusioned. Her star may be in the ascendant in the US, but here the critics have not been kind about a couple of her recent productions. Her 1998 show Killer Net, about the dangers lurking within the burgeoning internet culture, was dismissed as a \"ridiculous, middle-aged fantasy\"; the Channel 5 mini-series Bella Mafia was, according to the Guardian, \"so bad it made you yearn for the magic of that master storyteller Jeffrey Archer\". The consensus seems to be that she has not recently matched the raw brilliance of her ear lier work, especially Prime Suspect, featuring the vividly drawn character of DCI Jane Tennison, played by Helen Mirren. </p> <p>It is little wonder La Plante feels persecuted. She is tired of the critics' snide remarks; she is sick of being accused of using gratuitous violence (the Daily Mail once posed the question: \"Is this the most dangerous woman on television?\"), and she is fed up because her work is shown no respect in this country, unlike in the US. \"I'm shown respect there for my work. I don't think there's the respect here. Truthfully I don't. </p> <p>\"When I did Killer Net I was six months too early. People here hadn't heard of www.com The journalists looked at me as if I had two heads.\" </p> <p>The inspiration for the story came from a dinner party where La Plante met a woman whose 12-year-old daughter had made a friend on the internet and arranged to meet him in a cafe in downtown Los Angeles. Her mother found out, contacted the police and discovered the man her daughter had arranged to meet was a known killer. \"She would probably never have seen her little girl again,\" says La Plante. \"Now everyone knows. Now everyone is warning, warning, warning. But when Killer Net went out the response to it was like [she puts on a scornful, boozie drawl], 'Well, this couldn't happen'. \" Then she spits out angrily: \"Why the fuck don't they just look at it and listen? </p> <p>\"This is the one area in my work I can never ever understand. I very rarely work off the truth. I don't put something on the screen that either hasn't happened or can't happen. So therefore when I'm given these snide remarks by the critics\" - she puts on the boozie drawl again - \" 'I notice Lynda La Plante's killers are always very handsome', I just want to say, [her voice drops to one of quiet suspense - I'm gripped], 'Do you want to see the real guy? Do you want to see what he really looked like? He was a movie star. He did look like Tom Cruise. That's how he could kill'. \" </p> <p>Her new book, Sleeping Cruelty, sees La Plante on unfamiliar territory. Her central character is an entrepreneur called Sir William Benedict who gets caught up in a political scandal which leaves his reputation in tatters. Among the themes swirling around, though not very satisfactorily explored, are paedophilia and the effect on abused children; children as killers; the hounding of public figures by the press; the rehabilitation of disgraced figures and sexual deviancy (some of the sex scenes had to be toned down on the advice of her agent). La Plante says she thought the plot was doing well up until about three-quarters of the way through. I found it a bit far-fetched. </p> <p>La Plante prides herself on her exhaustive research. For this book she talked to people who had been injured by the press (she won't divulge any names) and to people who grew up being abused by a paedophile. Previously she has trawled prisons, police stations and brothels, digging out real-life stories on which to hang nailbiting drama. Once she even stripped down to her sports bra and a rather large pair of tennis knickers to interview prostitutes in downtown Los Angeles, all in the name of research. </p> <p> Nowadays it is hard to picture this rather grand, glitzy multi- millionairess grubbing around among the miserable, the criminal and the dispossessed. She has got two full-time researchers to do a lot of the legwork. </p> <p>She still sits through trials to pick up the tiniest details - the way a barrister slips his pen in and out of his pocket, the way he gazes over the witness's shoulder to unnerve and unsettle. It all adds to the authenticity of a scene. She has a team of barristers, judges, detectives who go through every script, checking for inaccuracies - down to the way a hair is removed for forensics. </p> <p>So what has La Plante learned after all these years of rooting around the underworld? She has learned that we live in a very sick world. She has also learned that victims of crime get a very raw deal. She used to be concerned about the prisoner, and the need for rehabilitation. Now the focus of her concern has shifted from criminal to victim. </p> <p>\"Myra Hindley can stand up and say: 'I'm completely rehabilitated.

      "bodyText": "When Lynda La Plante was Lynda Titchmarsh - Tittie or Loopy to her friends - and she lived with her family in the Crosby district of Liverpool, she used to enjoy terrifying her younger sister with horror stories late at night. The lights in the Titchmarsh household would go out and Lynda would pipe up: \"Right, story time! There's a man in the wardrobe with no head.\" She was bossy and exhibitionist. She would scalp her sister's dolls and dunk them down the toilet. She was the star of the household - the little girl who had to take the place of her five-year-old sister who was killed in an accident; a Scouse Shirley Temple, forever putting on shows, singing, dancing and telling stories. Today, La Plante is still telling amazing stories at a ferocious rate. She has just published her eighth novel; the fourth series of her crime show Trial and Retribution starts on ITV tonight; a fifth series has just gone into production and another pilot drama called Mind Games is to be broadcast this autumn. Before all this there was a string of tele-vision hits - Widows (1983), Civvies (1992), The Governor (1995), to name but three. La Plante, once a jobbing actress, is now one of the most prolific and successful television writers ever. Her name on a script can bring in millions of viewers. She has her own production company with swish offices in London's Soho. She is feted by Hollywood; she gets personal calls from Barbra Streisand and has more projects in development than Steven Spielberg. We meet in her office in Wardour Street - all pale wood and cream carpet. She looks like a million dollars, petite, with good skin and teeth - like a member of the First Wives Club (her 18-year marriage to writer and rock musician Richard La Plante ended in divorce in 1996.) She wears a long, grey, fitted dress coat and trousers, with a tight cream bustier which encases a large, brown, crumpled bosom. She has lots of heavy, shiny jewellery, and toys with a sparkly cigarette case and lighter as she talks in a gravelly posh voice. Entertaining, telling stories, mimicking, acting out scenes - she is very good company. Shirley Temple grown up. La Plante, now 52, has just returned from the US, where her work increasingly takes her. A display board in the boardroom of La Plante Productions lists projects in development.

We may have had the death of Princess Diana, the Monica and Bill story, the Kosovo war, and any number of other dramas live on telly, but this story has not lost its heady mixture of violence, race, sex and Hollywood glitz: a glamorous blonde brutally murdered, a black sporting hero struck from his pedestal and for months held behind bars. </p> <p>What is more, there are some startling new revelations and a real-life American private eye to help guide us through the maze of new circumstantial evidence.

They offer two sets of circumstantial evidence that point to two quite separate suspects and two quite different lines of inquiry. So who do they think did it? There is no final chapter to this new investigation. Watch it, and decide for yourself if you still think OJ is guilty. </p> <p>But there's something else that makes this documentary thought provoking. Why did this case so fascinate Americans? Surely it was not just the ingredients of sex and violence. It was also the first time such a sensational court case was poured into living rooms, a godsend for cable TV ratings, a real live courtroom soap opera that was monitored for every gory, intricate detail. </p> <p>Imagine the OJ Simpson case happening now - with three or more 24-hour TV channels and a nation that constantly watches on the web, not just on television. </p> <p>And imagine this happening in Britain. Big Brother and its successors have shown our appetite for this sort of intrusive viewing. Do not think, these days, we are any different from our American cousins. You cannot yet televise the inside of a courtroom here, but for how long, I wonder? </p> <p>\u0095 OJ: The Untold Story, tonight, 10.25pm, BBC1</p>",

They offer two sets of circumstantial evidence that point to two quite separate suspects and two quite different lines of inquiry. So who do they think did it? There is no final chapter to this new investigation. Watch it, and decide for yourself if you still think OJ is guilty. But there's something else that makes this documentary thought provoking. Why did this case so fascinate Americans? Surely it was not just the ingredients of sex and violence. It was also the first time such a sensational court case was poured into living rooms, a godsend for cable TV ratings, a real live courtroom soap opera that was monitored for every gory, intricate detail. Imagine the OJ Simpson case happening now - with three or more 24-hour TV channels and a nation that constantly watches on the web, not just on television. And imagine this happening in Britain. Big Brother and its successors have shown our appetite for this sort of intrusive viewing. Do not think, these days, we are any different from our American cousins. You cannot yet televise the inside of a courtroom here, but for how long, I wonder? \u0095 OJ: The Untold Story, tonight, 10.25pm, BBC1",

That they have got neither is why their young men went out on the streets in such numbers.

It was Sharon who launched, in 1977, an offensive designed in his words \"to stem the hold of foreigners on state lands\", by which he meant the expulsion of Arab citizens of Israel from land around their own villages, which they claimed by customary right, but which Israel chose to designate as government owned.

Nevertheless they are better off than their cousins in the ter ritories: they have some political influence, and significant rights as individuals, thanks in part to the sincere efforts of Israeli Jewish liberals. A long honed system of Israeli control, dividing them from one another physically by judiciously establishing tracts of Jewish territory, politically by encouraging rivalrous forms of local govern- ment, and socially by co- opting the most intelligent and enterprising, has kept them largely passive in the past.

So do you expect Who Told You to chart quite high? \"I don't really look at the charts,\" Size deadpans. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the pair are not sullen or superior. They talk about the joy of working with the album's guest stars, Wu-Tang rapper Method Man and Zack De La Rocha of Yank agit-rockers Rage Against the Machine, and Size becomes a different person as he gushes animatedly about making In the Mode and putting together this autumn's live show. </p> <p>You can't help feeling he's more comfortable at expressing the wonders of himself and his mates' working lives than trying to bear the weight of an entire scene whose protagonists, frankly, don't make records as good as his.

They talk about the joy of working with the album's guest stars, Wu-Tang rapper Method Man and Zack De La Rocha of Yank agit-rockers Rage Against the Machine, and Size becomes a different person as he gushes animatedly about making In the Mode and putting together this autumn's live show. You can't help feeling he's more comfortable at expressing the wonders of himself and his mates' working lives than trying to bear the weight of an entire scene whose protagonists, frankly, don't make records as good as his. He tells me his wish list of guest collaborators. \"Quincy Jones. Sade. Lauryn Hill. So many! We wanna do a million artists on one record. No one has done that before!\" The new Reprazent album is astonishing. Go and see them live, because they rock (and pop) and because they transcend the underachieving scene they sprang from. \u0095 Reprazent play the Manchester Academy (0161-275 2930) on Saturday, then tour. In the Mode is released on Monday.",

When asked whether his departure was linked to disappointment about the firm's trading, he said: \"I don't think you can draw any assumptions at all.\" City Centre's chairman, John Jackson, said: \"The share price is very low and there have been a number of profit warnings. We feel James has done an awful lot for City Centre but we need someone with new ideas to take the reins.\" Fellow director Andrew Guy has been appointed acting chief executive. Mr Guy is a former director of My Kinda Town, the themed restaurants company which includes the Chicago Pizza Pie Factory and Henry J Beans. He will begin a review of City Centre's portfolio while a search is carried out for a permanent boss. City Centre has blamed bad weather, tough competition, poor divisional management and the Euro 2000 football tournament for its poor performance this year. Analyst Greg Feehely of Old Mutual Securities said: \"It's been a pretty tough market but I don't think they've been holding their own.\" He said that City Centre's brands were not strong enough to attract sufficient customers to pay the rent on its prime locations.",

After days of wilful blindness to the rising Palestinian toll and its possible repercussions on Middle East peace, newspapers yesterday published their first special editions. The spur to their attentions was the death of seven Israeli Arabs - fellow citizens of the Jewish state - shot dead by riot police during protests on Monday that stretched from rural Galilee to the borders of Tel Aviv. For Jewish Israelis, the sight of their fellow citizens hurling rocks at riot police was an uncomfortable reminder of the ties that bind 1m Israeli Arabs to their cousins in the West Bank and Gaza. Viewed as spies and collaborators in the Middle East world for choosing to live under Jewish rule rather than in exile, in recent years there has been growing identification between Israeli Arabs and their Palestinian kin. Though they account for one in six of Israel's citizenry, their towns get only a fraction of the funding reserved for Jewish cities. Israeli Arabs admit they were inspired by Palestinian protesters, but their struggle is for equal rights within the Israeli state. The distinction is lost on most Israelis, particularly in these days of trouble.

      "body": "<p>When Ariel Sharon set out on his infamous stroll up to the Dome of the Rock last week, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, faced a no-win situation.</p> <p>He was well aware of the anger that allowing Mr Sharon's visit to the sacred site would provoke among Muslims. But he also knew the political risks of preventing the opposition leader from expressing his views.</p> <p>Weighing up the costs and benefits, Mr Barak decided the greater danger to his government lay on the domestic front rather than among the Palestinians - and made the appropriate choice.</p> <p>When trouble flared, he responded in the tough way that many Israelis appreciate: with bullets, tanks and helicopter gunships.</p> <p>Despite the worldwide condemnation of the killings of Palestinians, whose deaths in the last few days of troubles outnumber those of Israelis by around 16 to 1, there has been no serious criticism within Israel of Mr Barak's handling of the military situation.</p> <p>At the same time, his rival, Mr Sharon, has not gained any noticeable credit from the affair.</p> <p>This led one Israeli source to suggest yesterday that Mr Barak \"will not be going down in a hurry\": his chances of survival in the short term are probably better than a week ago.</p> <p>Two alternative scenarios have been mapped out which depend, largely, on whether or not the violence continues.</p> <p>If the violence continues, the prospect of early elections could recede as Israeli politicians rally round Mr Barak to see the country through the emergency. For the sake of national unity, Mr Barak would almost certainly bring Mr Sharon's Likud into his coalition, but this would also bring the peace process to a halt.</p> <p>If the violence subsides, Mr Barak can be expected to make a further push for a peace deal within a few weeks - though no one is hopeful of a successful outcome. In this scenario, Mr Barak would try to assemble a different coalition with a civil agenda and keep the peace process ticking over through regular, but low-level, contacts.</p> <p>None of this would be good for Mr Barak's long-term prospects, however. He was elected 17 months ago on a peace platform and has so far failed to deliver anything beyond the withdrawal from Lebanon.</p> <p>Elsewhere, he had been trying to play off the Syrian track of the peace process against the Palestinian track, but that was stymied by the death last June of the Syrian president, Hafez al-Asad.</p> <p>Israel recognises that the Syrian track cannot be re-started until the late president's son, Bashar, is more firmly established. A high-level Israeli source told the Guardian last week that this might take 12 months, but they would be keen to move it along once he is ready.</p> <p>If Mr Barak survives long enough, there is, therefore, a slim chance that he could deliver peace with Syria before the next election. But on the Palestinian front there is continuing gloom because the political climate in Israel does not permit the kind of concessions - particularly over Jerusalem and the refugees - that would be accepted by the Palestinians and the wider Arab world.</p> <p>Mr Barak's other problem is the Israeli opposition. Despite the raucous noises, there is little sign that they want an immediate election. The Shas party, for one, lacks the funds to run a campaign.</p> <p>On the Likud side, there is the unspoken rivalry between the leader, Mr Sharon, and the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, whose rehabilitation began last week after the attorney general decided not to prosecute him for corruption.</p> <p>In the election 17 months ago, Mr Barak beat Mr Netanyahu to the premiership by 56 % to 44%. An opinion poll by Gallup/Ma'ariv on on September 13 showed Mr Netanyahu leading Mr Barak by 39% to 38%, but Mr Barak leading Mr Sharon by 39% to 32%.</p> <p>This suggests that Mr Netanyahu has a better chance than Mr Sharon of beating Mr Barak in an election.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Ariel Sharon set out on his infamous stroll up to the Dome of the Rock last week, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, faced a no-win situation. He was well aware of the anger that allowing Mr Sharon's visit to the sacred site would provoke among Muslims. But he also knew the political risks of preventing the opposition leader from expressing his views. Weighing up the costs and benefits, Mr Barak decided the greater danger to his government lay on the domestic front rather than among the Palestinians - and made the appropriate choice. When trouble flared, he responded in the tough way that many Israelis appreciate: with bullets, tanks and helicopter gunships. Despite the worldwide condemnation of the killings of Palestinians, whose deaths in the last few days of troubles outnumber those of Israelis by around 16 to 1, there has been no serious criticism within Israel of Mr Barak's handling of the military situation. At the same time, his rival, Mr Sharon, has not gained any noticeable credit from the affair. This led one Israeli source to suggest yesterday that Mr Barak \"will not be going down in a hurry\": his chances of survival in the short term are probably better than a week ago. Two alternative scenarios have been mapped out which depend, largely, on whether or not the violence continues. If the violence continues, the prospect of early elections could recede as Israeli politicians rally round Mr Barak to see the country through the emergency. For the sake of national unity, Mr Barak would almost certainly bring Mr Sharon's Likud into his coalition, but this would also bring the peace process to a halt. If the violence subsides, Mr Barak can be expected to make a further push for a peace deal within a few weeks - though no one is hopeful of a successful outcome. In this scenario, Mr Barak would try to assemble a different coalition with a civil agenda and keep the peace process ticking over through regular, but low-level, contacts. None of this would be good for Mr Barak's long-term prospects, however. He was elected 17 months ago on a peace platform and has so far failed to deliver anything beyond the withdrawal from Lebanon. Elsewhere, he had been trying to play off the Syrian track of the peace process against the Palestinian track, but that was stymied by the death last June of the Syrian president, Hafez al-Asad. Israel recognises that the Syrian track cannot be re-started until the late president's son, Bashar, is more firmly established. A high-level Israeli source told the Guardian last week that this might take 12 months, but they would be keen to move it along once he is ready. If Mr Barak survives long enough, there is, therefore, a slim chance that he could deliver peace with Syria before the next election. But on the Palestinian front there is continuing gloom because the political climate in Israel does not permit the kind of concessions - particularly over Jerusalem and the refugees - that would be accepted by the Palestinians and the wider Arab world. Mr Barak's other problem is the Israeli opposition. Despite the raucous noises, there is little sign that they want an immediate election. The Shas party, for one, lacks the funds to run a campaign. On the Likud side, there is the unspoken rivalry between the leader, Mr Sharon, and the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, whose rehabilitation began last week after the attorney general decided not to prosecute him for corruption. In the election 17 months ago, Mr Barak beat Mr Netanyahu to the premiership by 56 % to 44%. An opinion poll by Gallup/Ma'ariv on on September 13 showed Mr Netanyahu leading Mr Barak by 39% to 38%, but Mr Barak leading Mr Sharon by 39% to 32%. This suggests that Mr Netanyahu has a better chance than Mr Sharon of beating Mr Barak in an election.",

      "body": "<p>Pierre Trudeau (Obituary, September 30) identified with, and appealed to, the idealism of the young. President Lyndon Johnson may have wanted a \"great society\" for the United States, but Trudeau called for a \"just society\" in Canada.</p> <p>Trudeau caught and shaped the 60s wave. He articulated the values of a generation that desperately wanted to make a difference, and we never forgot. In Canada today, we are all Trudeau's children. He was not content to merely represent consensus, he intended to mould it. And his style was as great a magnet in attracting the attention of Canadians as the worth of his ideas. He was the perfect post-1967 representative of the Canada we wanted to be - bilingual, cosmopolitan and adventurous.</p> <p>I knew many different Pierre Trudeaus: the intellectual at peace in his study, and the exhibitionist doing a pirouette; the gunslinger taking on all comers in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and a lover of children, making them feel at ease outside his office; the willing recipient of the adulation of thousands, and the loner who never lost his private reserve. He did not manufacture or create a false self.</p> <p>Trudeau knew music, poetry, literature, history, economics, architecture, philosophy and law. He was at his best in a crisis - the FLQ in 1970, the election of the Parti Quebecois in 1976, the 1980 referendum and the 1981 patriation of the constitution - because he had judgment, intelligence, courage and, above all, inner steel.</p> <p>The main outlines of the Trudeau Project are well known: the Charter of Rights, the Official Languages Act, the fight against separatism, a multi-cultural Canada, an activist government, and an independent foreign policy. What is seldom remarked upon, however, is that the foundation of his philosophy was a belief that leaders draw their authority not from office, but as a gift from the people.</p> <p>In 1980, for example, having just been returned to office, a poll showed that the separatists were ahead in the upcoming referendum. The Cabinet Office was duly alarmed and aides and advisers rushed in full of foreboding. One man, however, was calm amidst the turmoil. \"I know Quebecers,\" the prime minister said, \"they will never vote to leave Canada.\" Confidence in the judgment of the people was the starting point of his approach to politics.</p> <p>I first met Trudeau in the autumn of 1966 at the National Liberal convention.

      "bodyText": "Pierre Trudeau (Obituary, September 30) identified with, and appealed to, the idealism of the young. President Lyndon Johnson may have wanted a \"great society\" for the United States, but Trudeau called for a \"just society\" in Canada. Trudeau caught and shaped the 60s wave. He articulated the values of a generation that desperately wanted to make a difference, and we never forgot. In Canada today, we are all Trudeau's children. He was not content to merely represent consensus, he intended to mould it. And his style was as great a magnet in attracting the attention of Canadians as the worth of his ideas. He was the perfect post-1967 representative of the Canada we wanted to be - bilingual, cosmopolitan and adventurous. I knew many different Pierre Trudeaus: the intellectual at peace in his study, and the exhibitionist doing a pirouette; the gunslinger taking on all comers in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and a lover of children, making them feel at ease outside his office; the willing recipient of the adulation of thousands, and the loner who never lost his private reserve. He did not manufacture or create a false self. Trudeau knew music, poetry, literature, history, economics, architecture, philosophy and law. He was at his best in a crisis - the FLQ in 1970, the election of the Parti Quebecois in 1976, the 1980 referendum and the 1981 patriation of the constitution - because he had judgment, intelligence, courage and, above all, inner steel. The main outlines of the Trudeau Project are well known: the Charter of Rights, the Official Languages Act, the fight against separatism, a multi-cultural Canada, an activist government, and an independent foreign policy. What is seldom remarked upon, however, is that the foundation of his philosophy was a belief that leaders draw their authority not from office, but as a gift from the people. In 1980, for example, having just been returned to office, a poll showed that the separatists were ahead in the upcoming referendum. The Cabinet Office was duly alarmed and aides and advisers rushed in full of foreboding. One man, however, was calm amidst the turmoil. \"I know Quebecers,\" the prime minister said, \"they will never vote to leave Canada.\" Confidence in the judgment of the people was the starting point of his approach to politics. I first met Trudeau in the autumn of 1966 at the National Liberal convention. He was a newly elected MP, I was a youth delegate from Winnipeg. On the floor of the conference, I argued for the federal government to take a direct role in urban affairs. He dissented vigorously. The debate continued in the hallway. As the doors to the elevator in the Chateau Laurier were about to close, he snapped: \"Look, read the constitution.\" For the next 20 years, I did little else but. Teaching the spirit of the constitution means that the role of the leader - by word, deed and example - is to embody our highest ideals. Leaders should appeal to the better angels of our nature. That is the secret of Trudeau's continuing hold on Canadians. He was our only prime minister to be as influential out of office as during his heyday of power. This was because he always had the largest, most inclusive vision - a tolerant, open, sharing, independent, just society. His vision may have been impractical, but it was never ignoble.",

      "body": "<p>Less flamboyant than his holidays tycoon rival Sir Billy Butlin, Sir Fred Pontin, who has died aged 93, was the more significant judge of social trends. He sensed that the blue-collar holiday camp concept pioneered by Butlin would be overtaken in the postwar years by the more middle-class holiday village; in short, that self-catering would erode the \"Wakey, wakey!\" ambience.</p> <p>The two pioneers were temperamentally at opposite poles. The bluffly moustached showman Butlin was fond of the limelight and any form of celebrity. The clean-shaven and seldom-smiling Pontin, a man of few words, valued his contacts with royalty, and coolly tailored himself to the demands of a more classy type of clientele. He merged a blunt, even pugnacious, management style with work for theatrical and sporting charities, which won him a knighthood in 1976.</p> <p>Perhaps Pontin was only superficially the less pushy of the pair. Butlin once paid a sneaky visit to a Pontins camp to get ideas from his rival, something Pontin would never have done. But he responded with a publicity brochure that included a photograph of Butlin at a Pontins bar, and the caption: \"All the best people come to Pontins.\"</p> <p>Like many self-made multi-millionaires, Sir Fred was fond of emphasising his lack of academic qualifications. His family had been East End cabinet makers for generations, and, after the local council school in Dalston, he attended the Sir George Monoux grammar school, Walthamstow, leaving at 15 without having passed any examinations.</p> <p>His father wanted him to seek security in the local bank, but Fred's fortune-hunting eyes alighted on the stock exchange, and he joined stockbrokers Gordon Askew and Biddough as a jobber for \u00a31 a week, plus commission. A week later, the firm went into voluntary liquidation. However, in addition to two weeks' pay, he also got \u00a3100 in commission, a large sum in those days. A week later, he got a job with a another stockbroker, Gow and Parsons, at 15 shillings (75p) a week.</p> <p>This time, he was sacked for allowing errors in the postal system, but he pleaded his case with such vigour that he was reinstated at 25 shillings a week - and the assurance that his work would not involve such details. He left after three years for the jobbers Bristow Brothers, and, after a year, moved on to the Rock Investments Company, where for 10 years he gained experience of company investment, market dealings and group shares. In 1937, he set up on his own, running a football pool in London.</p> <p>Called up at the beginning of the war, he found himself labelled medical grade 4 (the lowest) because of mastoid trouble, and was sent to Orkney to help 5,000 Irish labourers build a naval base. He soon found himself appointed catering manager, a task he relished.</p> <p>Directed to Kidderminster to manage a hostel for steel and sugar beet workers, he discovered that his predecessor was in hospital, having had his ribs kicked in by workers protesting over food grievances. With a typical blend of blunt ruthlessness and delight in being of service, Pontin got himself a large alsatian guard dog and a bodyguard even bulkier than himself, then set to work improving the conditions. He appears to have succeeded; at any rate, his ribs remained intact.</p> <p>After the war, Pontin decided to use all his painful experience in a more upbeat fashion. Abruptly demobbed servicemen and women found themselves with money - their demob gratuities - perhaps for the first time in their lives. What would they most want? A holiday, surely? Pontin backed his intuition, and set his eyes on a former military camp at Bream Sands, near Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset. It cost \u00a323,000, which Pontin didn't have. But he did have ingenuity: he formed a syndicate for \u00a325,000, ensuring he held 50% control by buying half the equity with a bank loan.</p> <p>This was to be the beginning of a strategy that would make him millions. He bought more camps, personally ran each for a year to lick it into shape, then sold it to the syndicate - in which he still had 50%. The Pontins company was formed in July, 1946, with 400,000 shares, all placed in one day - a feat never accomplished, or even attempted, before.</p> <p>By the 1960s, his British holiday camps and villages were thriving, and he cast his eyes abroad. Though he had managed to enlarge the domestic holiday season from April to October, the British weather prevented him from stretching it further. So, in 1963, he formed Pontinental and built a chain of holiday villages in Spain, Majorca, Sardinia, Ibiza, Greece, Morocco and Yugoslavia.</p> <p>The first was in Sardinia, a double-winged building of three storeys, which became the template for future developments. Each apartment had its own bathroom and tea-making machine and, because British holidaymakers still believed that all foreign food would upset their stomachs, the restaurants served plain English food, augmented by a single Mediterranean dish for bolder spirits. There was a nightclub, relegated to the basement. Foreign governments were at first eager to lend Pontin up to 50% of his building costs, at modest interest rates over 15 to 20 years. Then they realised they might be wasting their charity on lucrative foreign enterprises unpopular with their own electorates, and cut back the financial aid. Pontin lost \u00a3200,000 in two years on his overseas complexes.</p> <p>By then, however, he had seen the potential of the self-catering holiday in smaller housing units in a holiday village. He tried out the first at Wick Ferry village, near Christchurch, with entertainment and restaurants for the occasions when no one wanted to cook for themselves. His first year profit was only \u00a316,000, but by 1975 it had leapt to \u00a33.6m - from 25 villages, 18 with catering, and seven with self-catering, the largest with 5,000 beds. The self-catering idea had proved its worth against those who argued that, when people went on holiday, they wanted to be sociable and abandon cooking for themselves.</p> <p>By now, Pontin's wealth had helped him to acquire a string of racehorses, but, even here, his interest was less exhibitionism than calculated business. His first horse was named Go Pontin, followed by Pontingo and Go Pontinental. His instruction to his trainers and jockeys was that they must always finish in the first three or four - so that the sports commentators would keep on mentioning them - and give their owner free advertising worth millions. One of his horses, Specify, won the Grand National in 1971.</p> <p>Such flirting with the world of the turf might have irritated those who worked for him. But Pontin shrewdly kept on the right side of his employees, especially in the recessions of the 1970s, by voluntarily taking a salary cut of \u00a3928 a week and foregoing substantial sums in commission. This, he said, was because his workers were only getting small wage increases, although later he acknowledged that the money would have gone in tax anyway.</p> <p>Pontin's work for charities also kept him in favour. He had been chief barker of the Variety Club of Great Britain, for which he raised more than \u00a31m, and was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats, two of the biggest theatrical charities. He was also a member of the Lord's Taverners.</p> <p>In 1978, he sold out his main leisure interests to the Coral group. He remained a director, but was not suited to running in harness with the Coral family - or anyone else for that matter - and, after two years, resigned from the board with a \u00a3200,000 pay-off. His personal business was centred on his ownership of flagship hotels, including the Farringford, on the Isle of Wight, once the home of the poet Tennyson.</p> <p>At 80, he joined Ponti's restaurant chain, run by his friend Peter Ispani, and, in 1988, celebrated his 82nd birthday in the Covent Garden Ponti's, which specialised in serving fish and chips with champagne, a supposed levelling taste which was slower to gain ground than his previous ventures.</p> <p>By the 1990s, he was amazing his wife and daughter by his reluctance to ease back on work, taking an active interest in plans for a Euro Pontin company that would eventually take 3,000 trippers a week to Euro-Disney, where he had a 3,000-unit resort. He did not believe in retirement. \"When I take up golf or buy myself a yacht,\" he said, \"see that I am certified.\"</p> <p>After the death of his first wife, Dorothy, he married Joyce Hey last year.

      "bodyText": "Rescue teams at a mine in south-western China admitted yesterday that they had all but given up hope of saving any more miners trapped in caves full of poisonous gases. At least 107 miners have died and a further 52 remain entombed after an underground explosion last Wednesday at the Muchonggou coal mine in Guizhou province. Eighty-five people have been rescued. The state-run media have published moving accounts of the desperate attempts to save the trapped miners. Air, along with water, soup, porridge and milk, have been sent into the mine through a pipe in an effort to keep them alive during the long rescue attempt. The men, reported to include many sets of brothers, tapped on the pipe to communicate with people on the surface. But the official China Daily reported yesterday that those still stranded are believed to have suffocated in the poisonous gases released by the blast. More than 200 people involved in the rescue attempt have had to rely on picks, shovels and their bare hands, for fear of igniting the gases. \"We're using human power only, no machines,\" said one mine official. \"It's too dangerous to use machines or explosives.\" Efforts have also been hampered by the collapse of structures supporting the mine shafts, although rescuers did succeed in clearing some rubble and pumping in enough air to reduce the risk of further explosions. Those killed have been brought out under cover of darkness, apparently for fear of the public anger that might be ignited, and then turned on officials. \"Rescuers have found plenty of bodies but they're keeping them in the mine until night-time because there are a lot of people gathered around and mine officials don't want people to see all the bodies,\" said a doctor at the local mining bureau hospital. The accident at Muchonggou has highlighted the appalling casualty rate in China's coal mines. At least 2,730 people died in mining accidents in the first six months of this year, according to official statistics. In January, 22 miners died, trapped underground by a torrent of water in Dahuangshan mine in the eastern province of Jiangsu. Most of the deaths have been in small unlicensed mines, which the government says it is trying to close. Many have no emergency exits or vents, let alone safety certificates. Muchonggou, which employs 4,000 people, is properly licensed and mine officials insist it had been considered relatively safe.

But while he's happy to support motorists on his front page, Dacre's not so happy to have them outside his front yard. Paul and the 11 other home owners of Malvern Terrace, N1 (including Baroness Dean, the former Sogat union leader), have chipped in to raise \u00a3121,000 to buy the cul-de-sac from Islington council and end the road's status as a public highway. That would allow Paul and his neighbours to run their own mini traffic department - and stop the Mondeos of middle England from parking there. All was going to plan when the council approved the road's privatisation, but sadly for Dacre there has been a hitch. The buy-out was due to go before a final magistrates hearing, but objections from local residents have forced a delay. Fortunately Paul doesn't live in Malvern Terrace at the moment, and is renting his house out, so he doesn't have to endure the horror of the public parking outside his property.</p> <p>\u0095The BBC is, as we now know, going to move its late evening news bulletin to 10pm, head to head with ITV. Despite that discovery, we should not read anything into the news that Greg Dyke was seen wining and dining Sir Trevor Macdonald two weeks ago. \"There is no significance in the fact that Sir Trevor had lunch with Greg Dyke,\" says the ITN press office. Of course not. It was probably just a coincidence.</p> <p>\u0095The Japanese have given us so many of the products that make modern life such a delight - including the Walkman, the fax, and Pok\u00e9mon. Now scientists there have come up with something just as revolutionary: a pair of knickers with three leg-holes called \"six-day underwear\". The wearer is supposed to save money as well as time on washing. They come with instructions on how to put them on: \"Rotate 120 degrees each day for three days, then turn inside out for another three days.\" If this product is to take off anywhere in the world, my money is on the UK.</p> <p>\u0095Game as ever, Peter Hitchens rings to deny that he's changed his views between an article in the Express this week describing Nelson Mandela as a great man, and one on February 4 1998 where he called Mandela the incompetent leader of a \"greedily corrupt\" party. Peter sat impassively through Mandela's address to the Labour conference last week, unfazed by delegates flicking pellets of paper at his head. \"I must have a pretty thick skin,\" he said. One delegate sitting behind Peter reported that he sat stony-faced and didn't even clap when Mandela appeared or finished his speech. \"I never applaud at party conferences,\" the old dear retorted.</p> <p>\u0095Short memories of South Africa also abound at the Tory party conference in Bournemouth.

      "bodyText": "\u0095As editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre is a good friend of the motorist, as seen by the Mail's staunch support for the aims of the fuel blockades last month. But while he's happy to support motorists on his front page, Dacre's not so happy to have them outside his front yard. Paul and the 11 other home owners of Malvern Terrace, N1 (including Baroness Dean, the former Sogat union leader), have chipped in to raise \u00a3121,000 to buy the cul-de-sac from Islington council and end the road's status as a public highway. That would allow Paul and his neighbours to run their own mini traffic department - and stop the Mondeos of middle England from parking there. All was going to plan when the council approved the road's privatisation, but sadly for Dacre there has been a hitch. The buy-out was due to go before a final magistrates hearing, but objections from local residents have forced a delay. Fortunately Paul doesn't live in Malvern Terrace at the moment, and is renting his house out, so he doesn't have to endure the horror of the public parking outside his property. \u0095The BBC is, as we now know, going to move its late evening news bulletin to 10pm, head to head with ITV. Despite that discovery, we should not read anything into the news that Greg Dyke was seen wining and dining Sir Trevor Macdonald two weeks ago. \"There is no significance in the fact that Sir Trevor had lunch with Greg Dyke,\" says the ITN press office. Of course not. It was probably just a coincidence. \u0095The Japanese have given us so many of the products that make modern life such a delight - including the Walkman, the fax, and Pok\u00e9mon. Now scientists there have come up with something just as revolutionary: a pair of knickers with three leg-holes called \"six-day underwear\". The wearer is supposed to save money as well as time on washing. They come with instructions on how to put them on: \"Rotate 120 degrees each day for three days, then turn inside out for another three days.\" If this product is to take off anywhere in the world, my money is on the UK. \u0095Game as ever, Peter Hitchens rings to deny that he's changed his views between an article in the Express this week describing Nelson Mandela as a great man, and one on February 4 1998 where he called Mandela the incompetent leader of a \"greedily corrupt\" party. Peter sat impassively through Mandela's address to the Labour conference last week, unfazed by delegates flicking pellets of paper at his head. \"I must have a pretty thick skin,\" he said. One delegate sitting behind Peter reported that he sat stony-faced and didn't even clap when Mandela appeared or finished his speech. \"I never applaud at party conferences,\" the old dear retorted. \u0095Short memories of South Africa also abound at the Tory party conference in Bournemouth. On Monday evening the Commission for Racial Equality hosted a reception for delegates -sponsored by Barclays, the bank that insisted on working from the inside to bring down the apartheid regime for so many years. How times change. \u0095Meanwhile, the green shoots of Conservative party revival are not appearing in that most important of forums, the marketplace. The eBay auction website recorded no bids at all yesterday for signed photographs of Margaret Thatcher, Peter Lilley or John Redwood, even at \u00a32 for a colour 6x8 of the Vulcan ex-frontbencher. \u0095Those of you who can't wait for the start of National Toast Week on October 30 may be interested in an away-day to what the Polish Tourist Office newsletter describes as \"the first bread museum in Poland\".

They may only have learned the most gory of details over the past four weeks, but they knew the Real IRA had murdered 29 people in the biggest atrocity of what in Northern Ireland are euphemistically dubbed the Troubles.</p> <p>Mr Leckey, a veteran of scores of inquests into terrible slayings, was unable even to say that those who died had been unlawfully killed. His hands were tied, he said, for, unlike in England and Wales, the rules in Northern Ireland permit only the most basic findings of who, when, where and how.</p> <p>So there was an anti-climax as the families drifted away, bent in huddled groups, from the Omagh leisure centre yesterday. They were wondering whether sitting through the shocking video evidence, the horrifying witness testimonies, and the sickening pathology reports, had all been worth it.</p> <p>For some, it was a pointless, painful and even cruel exercise, the outplaying of callous bureaucracy. Others found it cathartic, bringing them tiny solace, another hurdle negotiated in a lonely road they know can never lead to the recovery they crave.</p> <p>Michael Gallagher, whose son and colleague Adrian, 21, was killed, admitted: \"In one way, it was just the carrying out of the duties of the state. Our dead weren't officially recognised as dead until today.</p> <p>\"It was important for us to have the details. We are never going to hear anything worse than we have heard during the inquests. We don't have to wonder any more.</p> <p>\"But the families have been forced to go back for two years. Many see it as a setback.\"</p> <p>Marion Radford, whose son, Alan, 16, died while they were out shopping, said: \"I am glad I came. I had a lot of unanswered questions, but I know now he died rapidly and I was able to meet the policeman who was with Alan's body. That was a great comfort to me, but it has been very painful, like a horror film.\"</p> <p>After delivering his findings, Mr Leckey, who yesterday laid a tribute of lilies in the Co Tyrone town's memorial gardens, told the families: \"The last four weeks have been a difficult time for us all. I personally found it an emotional experience the like of which I have never encountered previously, and which I will never forget. I have no doubt many others found it that way too.</p> <p>\"The investigation of the facts was often unpleasant and distressing, I always knew it was going to be. My strong view is that it would have been quite wrong for me to have engaged in an exercise whose purpose was to sanitise or dilute the horror perpetrated on behalf of the Real IRA. I believe that would not have served the interests of justice and it would have been unfair to the memory of those who did so tragically.\"</p> <p>Mr Leckey, close to tears, defended the work of the police, criticised by some lawyers, including Michael Mansfield QC, who questioned evacuation procedures. He said: \"The age of Robocop has not dawned. It is a film. The police officers who confronted the horror were real men and women, not robots without feelings and emotions. I am sure all who assisted in any way as a consequence of what happened - police officers, traffic wardens, civilians and members of the emergency services - are grateful for the way the bereaved families acknowledged their efforts.\"</p> <p>Mr Leckey continued: \"The Real IRA claimed responsibility for the car bomb, though they sought to pass responsibility to the police for the casualties. As far as I am concerned, they were responsible for all that happened.</p> <p>\"The bomb warnings they gave were inadequate and misleading and the self-serving statement they issued subsequently had been shown to be untrue. If you park a car containing up to 200kg of explosive in a busy shopping street, set a timer, and walk away, you do not walk away from the responsibility for any resultant carnage.</p> <p>\"I share the hope, expressed forcibly by many of the families, that those responsible for the explosion are brought before a court of law. The conclusion of these inquests may close a chapter in the story of the dreadful events that happened in Omagh on August 15 1998, but a criminal trial and convictions will be necessary to close the book.\"</p> <p>The families hope so too. They had a briefing on Monday with Eric Anderson, RUC acting assistant chief constable, leading the investigation into the atrocity, and believe criminal charges will follow.</p> <p>The inquest into the 29th victim, James Barker, 12, the boy whose remains were disinterred from a cemetery in Buncrana, Co Donegal, six months ago, and reburied at home in England, will be held tomorrow.

John Leckey took refuge in his glass of water, emotion overwhelming him as he read the pathetic, prosaic details, recording in the barest terms how 28 victims of the Omagh massacre two years ago had died. It took him precisely 12 minutes to record the name of each of the dead, his or her occupation - toddler, he gave for one - and the cause of death. Those ranged from decapitation, in the case of Olive Hawkes, 60, married with two children, through laceration of the brain, as with two-year-old Maura Monghan, to the most common of all, multiple injuries.

      "byline": "Peter Taylor-Gooby",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The United Kingdom is exceptional in the swiftness and decisiveness of policy-making. Prime ministers, provided they have an adequate majority, are able to make substantial shifts in policy much more rapidly than leaders in any other country in Europe.</p> <p>Here, single-member constituencies and first-past-the-post voting delivers parliamentary majorities; two-party politics is adversarial, with little opportunity for coalition or cross-party negotiation. Unlike in other European countries, trade unions have been unable to influence the policies of either Tory or Labour governments. No constitutional court limits the power of the executive and the powers of the second chamber are being curtailed. Prime ministerial authority has recently been extended - the Cabinet Office now employs more than 200 staff. The Treasury is ascendant.</p> <p>Reform of pensions (the highest spending programme across the European Union) is a good example of how these differences in the capacity of government to shift policy has played out. All face the same problem - ageing populations, leading to rising costs. Other countries spend more on state pensions (most have \"Bismarckian\" social insurance schemes and a much weaker tradition of private pensions than the UK). In most, the proportion of older people will increase more rapidly than in the UK (the chart shows changes in the balance of the pensioner pop ulation). The cost of ageing is thus lower in the UK than elsewhere, yet this is the country that has carried through the most rapid and thoroughgoing reform.</p> <p>Two decades ago, the majority of the British workforce expected to receive the bulk of their pensions from the state through the basic national insurance pension, the state earnings-related pension and means-tested supplementary pension. Reforms by both Tory and Labour governments have relied chiefly on private provision - personal pensions, the new stakeholder pensions or occupational provision. Elsewhere in Europe, policy change has been pursued more gradually. Consensus has been built between political parties and other interests; new policies are essentially adjustments to bring future pension spending within acceptable limits.</p> <p>In Germany, reforms in 1992 and 1999 altered the pension formula to reduce entitlement, removed incentives for early retirement, tapped VAT as an extra source of funding and introduced a \"demographic moderator\", so that pension rates take into account increases in life expectancy. The 1992 reform was supported by all parliamentary parties (except the Greens) and by both business and unions. The 1999 reform evolved through extended discussions between government and opposition parties (the Rentenkonsensgespr\u00e4che).</p> <p>Sweden, stronghold of social democratic universalist welfare, has also altered the formula and introduced a demographic moderator. An innovative scheme diverts a small proportion of contributions (2% of income) into a private funded scheme to supplement the state earnings-related pension. The basic pension has effectively become means-tested. The package was negotiated through a commission which involved the five main parties and representatives of pensioners' organisations in a broad investigation from 1984 to 1990. All five parties supported consensus legislation in 1994, which then gained a 90% majority.</p> <p>In France, the Balladur government introduced reforms which required longer contribution periods, eliminated incentives for early retirement and weakened the formula linking contributions to benefits for private-sector workers in the early 1990s. These changes were achieved through concessions to the unions which reinforced their role in the management of the schemes. When Alain Jupp\u00e9 attempted to extend this to the large French public sector in 1995, he ne glected to smooth the path with unions and a national transport strike forced abandonment of the scheme.</p> <p>In Italy, the Amato reforms of 1992 introduced some restrictions after extended debate. When Silvio Berlusconi sought more severe cuts (reminiscent of UK experience) in 1994, union resistance was one of the major factors leading to the fall of his government. The technocratic Dini administration negotiated a further reform package with unions and a coalition of leftwing parties and introduced it in 1995. More recently, Romano Prodi's attempt to introduce further cuts (at the recommendation of the 1997 Onofri commission) was confounded by opposition from his leftwing coalition partners. In all these countries, tax reforms are under way to encourage the growth of private funded pensions alongside the state sector, but have as yet had little impact.</p> <p>UK governments are precipitate because, once in power, they encounter fewer restraints. It is simply not possible for other leaders to put their policy ideas into practice without extensive negotiations, because they have to deal with coalition partners, stronger trade unions and political cultures where negotiation with the main interests on the major issues confronting the government is normal. Our policy-makers are swift and decisive - but the fact that we do not need to generate consensus for major policy upheavals leaves UK policy shifts vulnerable to fresh reforms from the next government. Proposals made in Bournemouth this week could in theory become public policy within a matter of months.</p> <p>Peter Taylor-Gooby is professor of social policy at the University of Kent</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The United Kingdom is exceptional in the swiftness and decisiveness of policy-making. Prime ministers, provided they have an adequate majority, are able to make substantial shifts in policy much more rapidly than leaders in any other country in Europe. Here, single-member constituencies and first-past-the-post voting delivers parliamentary majorities; two-party politics is adversarial, with little opportunity for coalition or cross-party negotiation. Unlike in other European countries, trade unions have been unable to influence the policies of either Tory or Labour governments. No constitutional court limits the power of the executive and the powers of the second chamber are being curtailed. Prime ministerial authority has recently been extended - the Cabinet Office now employs more than 200 staff. The Treasury is ascendant. Reform of pensions (the highest spending programme across the European Union) is a good example of how these differences in the capacity of government to shift policy has played out. All face the same problem - ageing populations, leading to rising costs. Other countries spend more on state pensions (most have \"Bismarckian\" social insurance schemes and a much weaker tradition of private pensions than the UK). In most, the proportion of older people will increase more rapidly than in the UK (the chart shows changes in the balance of the pensioner pop ulation). The cost of ageing is thus lower in the UK than elsewhere, yet this is the country that has carried through the most rapid and thoroughgoing reform. Two decades ago, the majority of the British workforce expected to receive the bulk of their pensions from the state through the basic national insurance pension, the state earnings-related pension and means-tested supplementary pension. Reforms by both Tory and Labour governments have relied chiefly on private provision - personal pensions, the new stakeholder pensions or occupational provision. Elsewhere in Europe, policy change has been pursued more gradually. Consensus has been built between political parties and other interests; new policies are essentially adjustments to bring future pension spending within acceptable limits. In Germany, reforms in 1992 and 1999 altered the pension formula to reduce entitlement, removed incentives for early retirement, tapped VAT as an extra source of funding and introduced a \"demographic moderator\", so that pension rates take into account increases in life expectancy. The 1992 reform was supported by all parliamentary parties (except the Greens) and by both business and unions. The 1999 reform evolved through extended discussions between government and opposition parties (the Rentenkonsensgespr\u00e4che). Sweden, stronghold of social democratic universalist welfare, has also altered the formula and introduced a demographic moderator. An innovative scheme diverts a small proportion of contributions (2% of income) into a private funded scheme to supplement the state earnings-related pension. The basic pension has effectively become means-tested. The package was negotiated through a commission which involved the five main parties and representatives of pensioners' organisations in a broad investigation from 1984 to 1990. All five parties supported consensus legislation in 1994, which then gained a 90% majority. In France, the Balladur government introduced reforms which required longer contribution periods, eliminated incentives for early retirement and weakened the formula linking contributions to benefits for private-sector workers in the early 1990s. These changes were achieved through concessions to the unions which reinforced their role in the management of the schemes. When Alain Jupp\u00e9 attempted to extend this to the large French public sector in 1995, he ne glected to smooth the path with unions and a national transport strike forced abandonment of the scheme. In Italy, the Amato reforms of 1992 introduced some restrictions after extended debate. When Silvio Berlusconi sought more severe cuts (reminiscent of UK experience) in 1994, union resistance was one of the major factors leading to the fall of his government. The technocratic Dini administration negotiated a further reform package with unions and a coalition of leftwing parties and introduced it in 1995. More recently, Romano Prodi's attempt to introduce further cuts (at the recommendation of the 1997 Onofri commission) was confounded by opposition from his leftwing coalition partners. In all these countries, tax reforms are under way to encourage the growth of private funded pensions alongside the state sector, but have as yet had little impact. UK governments are precipitate because, once in power, they encounter fewer restraints. It is simply not possible for other leaders to put their policy ideas into practice without extensive negotiations, because they have to deal with coalition partners, stronger trade unions and political cultures where negotiation with the main interests on the major issues confronting the government is normal. Our policy-makers are swift and decisive - but the fact that we do not need to generate consensus for major policy upheavals leaves UK policy shifts vulnerable to fresh reforms from the next government. Proposals made in Bournemouth this week could in theory become public policy within a matter of months.

      "body": "<p>As the German players left the Hamburg pitch after a 2-0 win over Greece in their opening World Cup qualifying match, the loudspeakers incongruously blasted out England's Euro 96 anthem, Football's Coming Home. </p> <p>This was either an indication of a previously uncharted German sense of irony or their national football team are as easily deluded as our own. </p> <p>The Germans did not play particularly well and their only other match since the disasters of Euro 2000, a 4-0 win over Spain, would have been as impressive as it sounded only if the Spanish had shown any signs of taking it seriously. </p> <p>There is, however, no doubt that Rudi V\u00f6ller, a World Cup winner in 1990 and scorer of 47 goals in 90 internationals, had begun to engender a renewed spirit in the German camp after taking over as coach from the unpopular Erich Ribbeck. Until, that is, the internecine warfare that has broken out following the sensational sex and drugs allegations against Christoph Daum, who is due to take over from V\u00f6ller next June. </p> <p>State prosecutors in Cologne confirmed last week that they had launched a preliminary investigation into Daum for fraud and embezzlement after a former business associate accused the coach of owing him money from a property deal in Mallorca. That triggered an investigation into Daum's personal life and a Munich newspaper then weighed in with talk of cocaine and prostitutes. </p> <p>Daum's lawyer dismissed the allegations as absurd and said the accuser, the ex-husband of Daum's girlfriend, had made the allegations only to exonerate himself in a separate fraud investigation. </p> <p>Whatever the truth of the affair, it has already led Uli Hoeness, the Bayern Munich general manager and a member of the national selection committee that voted for Daum, to suggest that he is no longer the man for the job. And it brought a stinging rebuke from Reiner Calmund, general manager of Bayern's hated rivals Bayer Leverkusen, whom Daum manages. Calmund said: \"Hoeness must have Alzheimer's as he voted for Daum. The allegations are infamous, insidious and malicious.\" </p> <p>Among the others entering the fray yesterday were Paul Breitner, who called it \"the biggest scandal in the history of German football\", and Franz Beckenbauer, who demanded an end to the infighting. Even V\u00f6ller issued a plea for the matter to be dropped until after Saturday's Wembley set-to. </p> <p>The German Federation is unable to apply damage limitation by cancelling the contract yet to be signed by Daum and appointing V\u00f6ller since the latter has made it clear that he cannot face the aggravation that would go with it. After the last few days one can understand why. </p> <p>Even the players appear to have become unsettled, with Germany's Bayern contingent adopting a uniform \"no comment\" at yesterday's press conference while their Leverkusen counterparts expressed concern for their coach. </p> <p>The 46-year-old Daum, has long been touted as the messiah of German football, though a reluctant one since he has previously turned down the role of national coach. He also shows signs of being barking mad, once forcing his players to walk over broken glass and, when at VfB Stuttgart, papering the dressing-room wall with banknotes to motivate the players. </p> <p>V\u00f6ller is much more in the Kevin Keegan style, a man respected by the players for his own achievements on the field and who believes in inspiring players not by making them walk on glass but by attempting to convince them that they can walk on water. </p> <p>As with Keegan, the tactical side is not his strength; he had no previous coaching experience. Then again, nor had Beckenbauer before guiding Germany to World Cup success; V\u00f6ller, like Beckenbauer, is just the sort of inspirational figure Germany needed to lift the players and steady the nation's nerves after the traumas of Euro 2000. </p> <p>That caused such a collective national angst that Ribbeck had no choice but to resign. While they looked for a new coach, the Germans also set up a task force (thankfully, no relation to the one led by David Mellor) to pick over the bones, appointing Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, another of the national team's favourite sons, as its head. </p> <p>Despite the two victories since, the debate is still raging across the country, though even Beckenbauer, who has become the arch critic of the German team, laces his criticism with some praise for V\u00f6ller and his deputy Michael Skibbe, former coach of Dortmund. </p> <p>Beckenbauer says: \"The wins over Spain and Greece didn't fall out of the sky. V\u00f6ller, Skibbe and Rummenigge have worked hard and in unison. Rudi speaks the players' language, which is important, and they believe what he tells them. </p> <p>\"For decades we believed we were the best and would say 'come on, Brazil, let's play'. Today it is more like 'not yet please, maybe in a few years' time'. The best in the world are 10 years ahead of us and we have been overtaken by France, who started to copy us 20 years ago. </p> <p>\"But, if there is some good to come out of Euro 2000, it is that everyone involved with the national team has woken up to our problems. We had been dozing for years.\" </p> <p>V\u00f6ller, as popular in the dressing room as he is with the fans, has done much to help the healing process of a nation that demands football success. The rebuilding process will take a lot longer, though he has laid one or two impressive foundation stones. </p> <p>One of them comes in the form of Bayer Leverkusen's Jens Nowotny, whose sweeping skills have apparently brought a bid from Arsenal. He has finally ascended to the role retained for so long by Lothar Matth\u00e4us, who at Euro 2000 became the symbol of an ageing, decaying German team. </p> <p>V\u00f6ller has also backed his intimate knowledge of Leverkusen players by giving midfield places to Carsten Ramelow and Michael Ballack, who has long been seen as a coming star. V\u00f6ller has turned to them after failing, seemingly prompted by Daum, to persuade Steffen Effenberg to reverse his international retirement. </p> <p>Alexander Zickler, the Bayern Munich striker, has also been brought in to replace the retired Ulf Kirsten and freshen up a strike force that still seems to get around the pitch by use of invisible zimmer frames. Though Oliver Bierhoff seems more asthmatic than talismatic these days, he is still regarded as the No1 choice and, after his goal for Milan against Vicenza at the weekend, seems certain to start at Wembley. </p> <p>V\u00f6ller's greatest achievement, though, is in charming the best out of Mehmet Scholl, a player who many fans insist can be the saviour of the new Germany and who just as many insist is a waste of space. Think Matt le Tissier. </p> <p>Scholl was impressive in the hole against the Greeks, linking with midfield and the two strikers and providing a tantalising low cross that a panicking Marinos Ouzounidis turned into his own net by way of a Greek gift. </p> <p>The second was scored by 20-year-old Sebastien Deisler from Hertha Berlin, the wunderkind of German football who is beginning to come of age. \"He is exceptional,\" says V\u00f6ller, though it will be interesting to see whether he again starts him on the right side of midfield against England, as he did in Charleroi. Given our frailties at left-back, maybe he will. </p> <p>Through V\u00f6ller's success in restoring faith in the side, or perhaps through an abiding German footballing arrogance, they now believe they can win at Wembley. But as the arguments continue to rage between the conflicting power barons of German football, the message behind the dressing-room door will doubtless be: \"Don't mention the civil war\". </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "As the German players left the Hamburg pitch after a 2-0 win over Greece in their opening World Cup qualifying match, the loudspeakers incongruously blasted out England's Euro 96 anthem, Football's Coming Home. This was either an indication of a previously uncharted German sense of irony or their national football team are as easily deluded as our own. The Germans did not play particularly well and their only other match since the disasters of Euro 2000, a 4-0 win over Spain, would have been as impressive as it sounded only if the Spanish had shown any signs of taking it seriously. There is, however, no doubt that Rudi V\u00f6ller, a World Cup winner in 1990 and scorer of 47 goals in 90 internationals, had begun to engender a renewed spirit in the German camp after taking over as coach from the unpopular Erich Ribbeck. Until, that is, the internecine warfare that has broken out following the sensational sex and drugs allegations against Christoph Daum, who is due to take over from V\u00f6ller next June. State prosecutors in Cologne confirmed last week that they had launched a preliminary investigation into Daum for fraud and embezzlement after a former business associate accused the coach of owing him money from a property deal in Mallorca. That triggered an investigation into Daum's personal life and a Munich newspaper then weighed in with talk of cocaine and prostitutes. Daum's lawyer dismissed the allegations as absurd and said the accuser, the ex-husband of Daum's girlfriend, had made the allegations only to exonerate himself in a separate fraud investigation. Whatever the truth of the affair, it has already led Uli Hoeness, the Bayern Munich general manager and a member of the national selection committee that voted for Daum, to suggest that he is no longer the man for the job. And it brought a stinging rebuke from Reiner Calmund, general manager of Bayern's hated rivals Bayer Leverkusen, whom Daum manages. Calmund said: \"Hoeness must have Alzheimer's as he voted for Daum. The allegations are infamous, insidious and malicious.\" Among the others entering the fray yesterday were Paul Breitner, who called it \"the biggest scandal in the history of German football\", and Franz Beckenbauer, who demanded an end to the infighting. Even V\u00f6ller issued a plea for the matter to be dropped until after Saturday's Wembley set-to. The German Federation is unable to apply damage limitation by cancelling the contract yet to be signed by Daum and appointing V\u00f6ller since the latter has made it clear that he cannot face the aggravation that would go with it. After the last few days one can understand why. Even the players appear to have become unsettled, with Germany's Bayern contingent adopting a uniform \"no comment\" at yesterday's press conference while their Leverkusen counterparts expressed concern for their coach. The 46-year-old Daum, has long been touted as the messiah of German football, though a reluctant one since he has previously turned down the role of national coach. He also shows signs of being barking mad, once forcing his players to walk over broken glass and, when at VfB Stuttgart, papering the dressing-room wall with banknotes to motivate the players. V\u00f6ller is much more in the Kevin Keegan style, a man respected by the players for his own achievements on the field and who believes in inspiring players not by making them walk on glass but by attempting to convince them that they can walk on water. As with Keegan, the tactical side is not his strength; he had no previous coaching experience. Then again, nor had Beckenbauer before guiding Germany to World Cup success; V\u00f6ller, like Beckenbauer, is just the sort of inspirational figure Germany needed to lift the players and steady the nation's nerves after the traumas of Euro 2000. That caused such a collective national angst that Ribbeck had no choice but to resign. While they looked for a new coach, the Germans also set up a task force (thankfully, no relation to the one led by David Mellor) to pick over the bones, appointing Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, another of the national team's favourite sons, as its head. Despite the two victories since, the debate is still raging across the country, though even Beckenbauer, who has become the arch critic of the German team, laces his criticism with some praise for V\u00f6ller and his deputy Michael Skibbe, former coach of Dortmund. Beckenbauer says: \"The wins over Spain and Greece didn't fall out of the sky. V\u00f6ller, Skibbe and Rummenigge have worked hard and in unison. Rudi speaks the players' language, which is important, and they believe what he tells them. \"For decades we believed we were the best and would say 'come on, Brazil, let's play'. Today it is more like 'not yet please, maybe in a few years' time'. The best in the world are 10 years ahead of us and we have been overtaken by France, who started to copy us 20 years ago. \"But, if there is some good to come out of Euro 2000, it is that everyone involved with the national team has woken up to our problems. We had been dozing for years.\" V\u00f6ller, as popular in the dressing room as he is with the fans, has done much to help the healing process of a nation that demands football success. The rebuilding process will take a lot longer, though he has laid one or two impressive foundation stones. One of them comes in the form of Bayer Leverkusen's Jens Nowotny, whose sweeping skills have apparently brought a bid from Arsenal. He has finally ascended to the role retained for so long by Lothar Matth\u00e4us, who at Euro 2000 became the symbol of an ageing, decaying German team. V\u00f6ller has also backed his intimate knowledge of Leverkusen players by giving midfield places to Carsten Ramelow and Michael Ballack, who has long been seen as a coming star. V\u00f6ller has turned to them after failing, seemingly prompted by Daum, to persuade Steffen Effenberg to reverse his international retirement. Alexander Zickler, the Bayern Munich striker, has also been brought in to replace the retired Ulf Kirsten and freshen up a strike force that still seems to get around the pitch by use of invisible zimmer frames. Though Oliver Bierhoff seems more asthmatic than talismatic these days, he is still regarded as the No1 choice and, after his goal for Milan against Vicenza at the weekend, seems certain to start at Wembley. V\u00f6ller's greatest achievement, though, is in charming the best out of Mehmet Scholl, a player who many fans insist can be the saviour of the new Germany and who just as many insist is a waste of space. Think Matt le Tissier. Scholl was impressive in the hole against the Greeks, linking with midfield and the two strikers and providing a tantalising low cross that a panicking Marinos Ouzounidis turned into his own net by way of a Greek gift. The second was scored by 20-year-old Sebastien Deisler from Hertha Berlin, the wunderkind of German football who is beginning to come of age. \"He is exceptional,\" says V\u00f6ller, though it will be interesting to see whether he again starts him on the right side of midfield against England, as he did in Charleroi. Given our frailties at left-back, maybe he will. Through V\u00f6ller's success in restoring faith in the side, or perhaps through an abiding German footballing arrogance, they now believe they can win at Wembley. But as the arguments continue to rage between the conflicting power barons of German football, the message behind the dressing-room door will doubtless be: \"Don't mention the civil war\". \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
