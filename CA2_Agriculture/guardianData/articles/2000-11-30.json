      "body": "<p>Fears that the Premiership would be swamped by low-cost foreign imports were increased last night after a landmark ruling in Spain.</p> <p>A court in Madrid has decided that the Russian midfielder Valery Karpin, who plays for Celta Vigo, should enjoy the same rights as players who are European Union citizens. </p> <p>In particular it means that the rule barring teams from signing more than five non-EU players and fielding more than three in any one match no longer applies to Karpin, allowing him to line up as a domestic player in this Saturday's match against Barcelona.</p> <p>Karpin's success was based on the fact that Russia has an association agreement with the EU which bars employers from discriminating against employees on the grounds of nationality. Some 20 countries, mainly in eastern Europe but also including Morocco and Mexico, have similar agreements with the EU.</p> <p>The case, which is being compared to the Bosman ruling, could lead to a rash of similar court challenges by other foreigners playing in European Union leagues.</p> <p>\"I believed that the Spanish league, federation and the club were all discriminating against me,\" said Karpin, who has more than 30 caps for Russia. \"In the end I've achieved my aim.</p> <p>\"I'm not a second Bosman, I'm the first Karpin. I'm not thinking about the consequences the decision might have for other players. I'm just thinking about myself.\"</p> <p>\"It will be good for the league but bad for Spanish players,\" he added.</p> <p>It may also be bad for English players. Southampton's squad, for example, contains two Latvians and two Moroccans, all of whom come from countries with association agreements. Any of these could potentially bring a court action if he felt the \"three foreigners\" rule was restricting his first-team chances.</p> <p>Players from eastern Europe, such as Tottenham's Sergei Rebrov would also be eligible to challenge their designation as non-EU players. That would remove one of the barriers that prevents Premiership managers from investing more in cheaper players, particularly from the former Soviet bloc.</p> <p>Football administrators and the players' union were last night studying the possible implications of the judgment.</p> <p>The agent Phil Smith saw the ruling as part of a trend to more freedom of movement for players. \"The frontiers are only going to open up more in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>Yesterday the Romanian international Cosmin Contra of the Spanish club Alaves said he was following Karpin's lead. \"I've brought an action against the club and the Spanish federation,\" he said.</p> <p>And a similar case involving a Hungarian former player of the Belgian club Charleroi, is currently being heard by the EU.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Fears that the Premiership would be swamped by low-cost foreign imports were increased last night after a landmark ruling in Spain. A court in Madrid has decided that the Russian midfielder Valery Karpin, who plays for Celta Vigo, should enjoy the same rights as players who are European Union citizens. In particular it means that the rule barring teams from signing more than five non-EU players and fielding more than three in any one match no longer applies to Karpin, allowing him to line up as a domestic player in this Saturday's match against Barcelona. Karpin's success was based on the fact that Russia has an association agreement with the EU which bars employers from discriminating against employees on the grounds of nationality. Some 20 countries, mainly in eastern Europe but also including Morocco and Mexico, have similar agreements with the EU. The case, which is being compared to the Bosman ruling, could lead to a rash of similar court challenges by other foreigners playing in European Union leagues. \"I believed that the Spanish league, federation and the club were all discriminating against me,\" said Karpin, who has more than 30 caps for Russia. \"In the end I've achieved my aim. \"I'm not a second Bosman, I'm the first Karpin. I'm not thinking about the consequences the decision might have for other players. I'm just thinking about myself.\" \"It will be good for the league but bad for Spanish players,\" he added. It may also be bad for English players. Southampton's squad, for example, contains two Latvians and two Moroccans, all of whom come from countries with association agreements. Any of these could potentially bring a court action if he felt the \"three foreigners\" rule was restricting his first-team chances. Players from eastern Europe, such as Tottenham's Sergei Rebrov would also be eligible to challenge their designation as non-EU players. That would remove one of the barriers that prevents Premiership managers from investing more in cheaper players, particularly from the former Soviet bloc. Football administrators and the players' union were last night studying the possible implications of the judgment. The agent Phil Smith saw the ruling as part of a trend to more freedom of movement for players. \"The frontiers are only going to open up more in the future,\" he said. Yesterday the Romanian international Cosmin Contra of the Spanish club Alaves said he was following Karpin's lead. \"I've brought an action against the club and the Spanish federation,\" he said. And a similar case involving a Hungarian former player of the Belgian club Charleroi, is currently being heard by the EU. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stumbled across the Guardian's Netjetter page the other night and was happy to see that your first stop is in my native province. I'm writing you from Montreal, where it is likely a good deal chillier than <strong>Vancouver</strong>, but perhaps less humid. I gather you're not staying very long in beautiful B.C, but thought I would offer some ideas for your stay. I guess that's the point of this whole experiment, right?</p> <p>I must echo the suggestions for the Capilano Suspension Bridge and <strong>Victoria</strong> (where I lived for three years). The ferry over to Vancouver Island is great. The last time I went over, it was early on a clear, calm Saturday morning and as I sat sipping my coffee a pod of killer whales burst out of the water in a graceful, synchronised arc a mere 100 yards away! If you want to head over to Washington State, there are ferries from Victoria, or if you're looking for a quick, unconventional way to get back to Vancouver from Victoria, there's a helijet. The view is amazing as you literally plummet down to the Vancouver waterfront. </p> <p>If you're feeling nostalgic, the Empress Hotel in Victoria offers a real-deal tea time. If you're into indigenous art, they have amazing collections of Haida (West Coast tribe famous for their distinctive, colourful carvings) totem, masks, etc. at the University of British Columbia campus and the museum in Victoria opposite the Parliament Buildings.</p> <p>You may be a little early for skiing, which is a shame, because world-class resort destination Whistler-Blackcomb is nearby. There's always hiking and mountain biking in and around Vancouver, though. Drop by Mountain Equipment Co-op for outdoors suggestions and equipment rentals. You could go climbing in Squamish, or rent a kayak on the Sunshine Coast. Not that you should expect any sunshine this time of year. Expect rain and fog - (now that'll be a change for ya!)</p> <p>Do visit Granville Island, in the heart of Vancouver (just down the hill from the Co-op, in fact). There's a large market for eats and meandering,plus The Granville Island Brewery, so you could send us your tasting notes. It's also home to the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design - check the notice board or <a href=\"http://www.eciad.bc.ca/\" target=\"_new\"> website</a> for happenings not advertised elsewhere.</p> <p>If you're a glutton for punishment, you could do the Grouse Grind - a masochistic hike up the face of Grouse mountain, which is another great way to see the city, although it might be a bit slick this time of year. Reward yourself with the great view then stumble into the gondola for the ride back down if your legs are jelly. The Nam (Robson Street, I think) is a funky place to do breakfast the healthy way. Commercial Drive has good energy, unless it has been gentrified since I was there a year ago - it was called one of the hippest 'hoods in North America a while back by the Utne Reader. Due to the fact that Vancouver increasingly straddles Asia and North America, your choice of food will be pleasantly baffling. I hope you appreciate seafood, because there's some great stuff here, especially Cantonese style. You'll also find great Indian food. Last visit I even enjoyed authentic Malaysian 'hawker' food, courtesy of this little hole-in-the-wall place that a friendly guy from Singapore had set up.</p> <p>Rent some blades or pull on the walking shoes and head along the Sea Wall around Stanley Park (Vancouver's answer to Central Park) - it's a great way to appreciate the city and work off jetlag or a hangover, or both. If you were staying longer, I would recommend getting off the beaten track in the Kootenay region, where my hometown of Nelson is located. Everyone from Vancouver seems to be moving there, so I'll leave you to enquire why. Well, I hope you're confused by all this. Have fun!</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stumbled across the Guardian's Netjetter page the other night and was happy to see that your first stop is in my native province. I'm writing you from Montreal, where it is likely a good deal chillier than Vancouver, but perhaps less humid. I gather you're not staying very long in beautiful B.C, but thought I would offer some ideas for your stay. I guess that's the point of this whole experiment, right? I must echo the suggestions for the Capilano Suspension Bridge and Victoria (where I lived for three years). The ferry over to Vancouver Island is great. The last time I went over, it was early on a clear, calm Saturday morning and as I sat sipping my coffee a pod of killer whales burst out of the water in a graceful, synchronised arc a mere 100 yards away! If you want to head over to Washington State, there are ferries from Victoria, or if you're looking for a quick, unconventional way to get back to Vancouver from Victoria, there's a helijet. The view is amazing as you literally plummet down to the Vancouver waterfront. If you're feeling nostalgic, the Empress Hotel in Victoria offers a real-deal tea time. If you're into indigenous art, they have amazing collections of Haida (West Coast tribe famous for their distinctive, colourful carvings) totem, masks, etc. at the University of British Columbia campus and the museum in Victoria opposite the Parliament Buildings. You may be a little early for skiing, which is a shame, because world-class resort destination Whistler-Blackcomb is nearby. There's always hiking and mountain biking in and around Vancouver, though. Drop by Mountain Equipment Co-op for outdoors suggestions and equipment rentals. You could go climbing in Squamish, or rent a kayak on the Sunshine Coast. Not that you should expect any sunshine this time of year. Expect rain and fog - (now that'll be a change for ya!) Do visit Granville Island, in the heart of Vancouver (just down the hill from the Co-op, in fact). There's a large market for eats and meandering,plus The Granville Island Brewery, so you could send us your tasting notes. It's also home to the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design - check the notice board or website for happenings not advertised elsewhere. If you're a glutton for punishment, you could do the Grouse Grind - a masochistic hike up the face of Grouse mountain, which is another great way to see the city, although it might be a bit slick this time of year. Reward yourself with the great view then stumble into the gondola for the ride back down if your legs are jelly. The Nam (Robson Street, I think) is a funky place to do breakfast the healthy way. Commercial Drive has good energy, unless it has been gentrified since I was there a year ago - it was called one of the hippest 'hoods in North America a while back by the Utne Reader. Due to the fact that Vancouver increasingly straddles Asia and North America, your choice of food will be pleasantly baffling. I hope you appreciate seafood, because there's some great stuff here, especially Cantonese style. You'll also find great Indian food. Last visit I even enjoyed authentic Malaysian 'hawker' food, courtesy of this little hole-in-the-wall place that a friendly guy from Singapore had set up. Rent some blades or pull on the walking shoes and head along the Sea Wall around Stanley Park (Vancouver's answer to Central Park) - it's a great way to appreciate the city and work off jetlag or a hangover, or both. If you were staying longer, I would recommend getting off the beaten track in the Kootenay region, where my hometown of Nelson is located. Everyone from Vancouver seems to be moving there, so I'll leave you to enquire why. Well, I hope you're confused by all this. Have fun!",

Firstly, stuff you MUST know about the transit here - it's breathtakingly efficient. The bus drivers don't give change, so you'll need 1.75 in loose change for each journey, or buy a book of 10 tickets in advance at a 7-11 store. When you pay on the bus, get a \"transfer\" from the driver and this entitles you to unlimited travel on the buses, seabus, and skytrain for two hours. The zonal system can be confusing (applies during weekdays). To get from the airport to downtown, take a number 100 to 70th Ave, then a number 8, which says 'Granville' on the front. Since this is a two zone journey, you'll need 2.50. Every coin has a nickname; 1c - a penny, 5c - a nickel, 10c - a dime, 25c - a quarter, $1 - a looney, $2 - a tooney. Beware that the prices displayed in stores are not what you actually pay. 14% Sales Tax is always added.</p> <p>The Jericho Beach Youth Hostel is great, and the view of the city from the beach is spectacular. You should see Lynn Canyon on the North Shore. Most people are desperate to get to the very hyped Capilano Suspension Bridge, but Lynn Canyon is better and free. The Harbour Centre Tower gives a good view and costs $9. Your ticket allows you unlimited access for the day, so you can go up after dark as well as daytime, or even watch the sunset there. Walk down Robson Street in the evening - it's full of light and colour and a great view of North American glamour shopping. If you feel culturally inclined, go to the impressive UBC museum of Anthropology. One of the best restaurants is Steppho's Greek Taverna on Davey Street (near the junction with Thurlow Street), where there's huge portions for $9. There are also queues around the block if you get there after 5.30, so be very early!</p> <p> Right now is the ice hockey season, and I definitely think you should see a game! Finally, if you have time, I recommend a trip to Victoria and/or Tofino. At Tofino you can watch whales or walk in the rainforest.</p>",

The city has <strong>6,411 families in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation</strong>. </p> <p>In March last year there were 36,677 families in temporary accommodation and 4,812 in bed and breakfast hotels - so in just 18 months, the capital has seen a 31% increase in the number in temporary accommodation and a 33% increase in the number in bed and breakfasts.</p> <p>The latest available figures from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in June this year showed 43,146 homeless in London compared with a total of 32,360 homeless for the rest of England. And these figures exclude the special needs of the 22,000 destitute asylum seekers who are in temporary accommodation.</p> <p>As is often the case, the levels of homelessness vary quite considerably across London and within the London boroughs. The highest levels of people accepted as homeless are in Brent, Camden, Croydon, Hounslow, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Westminster but while Lewisham has had to cope with a dramatic 118% increase, Islington and Westminster have each been left to face hefty 37% increases.</p> <p>The issue of affordable housing is a major one for London which also has far higher levels of overcrowding and home sharing than other parts of the country and there are signs that the capital's problems could well get worse before they get better.</p> <p>After years of slow decline, London's population is on the increase, with the Greater London Authority now projecting that it will reach 8.148m by 2016 - an increase of more than 1m on the 1996 figure of 7.071m. </p> <p>Even without tackling existing shortages, the increase in population will inevitable lead to a growing demand for housing in the capital where charity Shelter estimates there is already a backlog of around 240,000 homes. </p> <p>All this, remember, is in a city where housing is at an expensive premium. In Kensington and Chelsea the average house price is almost \u00a3360,000, which would suggest a household income of around \u00a3120,000 to support a mortgage - far beyond the means of most Londoners. </p> <p>No wonder London's councils are hard at work on a housing strategy and no wonder we have welcomed the promise of increased investment by the government. But we should be under no illusions, this is just the start of tackling the accumulated problems of years of underinvestment in our housing. </p> <p>\u0095 Tony Newman is chairman of the Association of London Government's housing panel</p>",

In the last financial year the bill for homelessness in our capital was more than \u00a392m and since March this year, it has already risen by about 13%. Homelessness is certainly not a problem that is unique to London, but it is true to say that the capital has disparities of wealth and poverty existing side by side and on a scale which is not seen in any other part of the UK. The \u00a31m home may be commonplace in some of London's more affluent areas, but even the most casual visitor to the city will be all too familiar with the scenes of homeless people wandering the streets and sleeping in shop doorways. Recent estimates published by the Rough Sleepers Unit suggest there was a 36% reduction in the number of rough sleepers between 1998 and 2000, but the figures for London show only a marginal reduction of some 4% and in at least one borough, the unit reports an increase in the number of rough sleepers. There has also been a significant increase in the number of families placed in temporary accommodation by the boroughs. There are now 48,000 homeless families in London - the highest level for 20 years and certainly not the proudest start to a new millennium. The city has 6,411 families in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation. In March last year there were 36,677 families in temporary accommodation and 4,812 in bed and breakfast hotels - so in just 18 months, the capital has seen a 31% increase in the number in temporary accommodation and a 33% increase in the number in bed and breakfasts. The latest available figures from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in June this year showed 43,146 homeless in London compared with a total of 32,360 homeless for the rest of England. And these figures exclude the special needs of the 22,000 destitute asylum seekers who are in temporary accommodation. As is often the case, the levels of homelessness vary quite considerably across London and within the London boroughs. The highest levels of people accepted as homeless are in Brent, Camden, Croydon, Hounslow, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Westminster but while Lewisham has had to cope with a dramatic 118% increase, Islington and Westminster have each been left to face hefty 37% increases. The issue of affordable housing is a major one for London which also has far higher levels of overcrowding and home sharing than other parts of the country and there are signs that the capital's problems could well get worse before they get better. After years of slow decline, London's population is on the increase, with the Greater London Authority now projecting that it will reach 8.148m by 2016 - an increase of more than 1m on the 1996 figure of 7.071m. Even without tackling existing shortages, the increase in population will inevitable lead to a growing demand for housing in the capital where charity Shelter estimates there is already a backlog of around 240,000 homes. All this, remember, is in a city where housing is at an expensive premium. In Kensington and Chelsea the average house price is almost \u00a3360,000, which would suggest a household income of around \u00a3120,000 to support a mortgage - far beyond the means of most Londoners. No wonder London's councils are hard at work on a housing strategy and no wonder we have welcomed the promise of increased investment by the government. But we should be under no illusions, this is just the start of tackling the accumulated problems of years of underinvestment in our housing. \u0095 Tony Newman is chairman of the Association of London Government's housing panel",

      "bodyText": "The government's education watchdog, Ofsted, yesterday agreed to drop its decision to label a London comprehensive \"failing\", admitting that there had been procedural errors in its inspection of the school which made the judgment \"unsafe\". In what would have led to a landmark case being launched in the high court today, Crown Woods school in Eltham, south London, had sought a judicial review to try to overturn Ofsted's decision to put it into \"special measures\" - the official term for failing. The school claimed that the decision was based on flimsy evidence from an unsatisfactory inspection in April. But in a humiliating 11th-hour climbdown, the office for standards in education agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the school, which spared it the embarrassment of a public hearing. Ofsted was ordered to pay the school's costs - estimated to run into five figures - as well as lifting its judgment that it should be placed in special measures, pending an imminent reinspection. The terms of the settlement were hammered out over the past few days in the run-up to chief inspector Chris Woodhead's last day in the job today. One theory was that the deal was sought by Mr Woodhead's successor, Mike Tomlinson, in order to allow him to start his new job with a clean slate. The school - one of the largest comprehensives in England and backed by its local education authority in Greenwich - was the first to threaten to test the results of an unfavourable inspection in the courts. Its teachers and governors claimed the inspectors' ruling was harsh and unfair, and that they had not gathered enough evidence to substantiate their argument. Local politicians and education officials welcomed the settlement, while teaching unions said it was a victory and underlined the need for an independent appeals procedure to eliminate the lengthy and expensive route to the courts. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: \"I welcome the settlement of the case, which undoubtedly represents a victory for the school and the LEA over the Ofsted dictatorship. \"It is a fitting farewell message to the departing chief inspector, Chris Woodhead.

One day they go away for a wedding and when they come back discover that a space has appeared between the master bedroom and the children's bedroom. The walls that appear are black and perfectly smooth. Will Navidson (the protagonist) begins to measure the inside of the house and soon discovers that the inside is larger than the outside by a quarter of an inch and that's where it all begins to happen. What it comes down to is how this family deals with a house that is larger on the inside than the outside and how it begins to influence those who live there and those who hear about it and those who write about it and maybe even those who read about it.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/2911danielskifirst.ra\">Audio clip:</a> Mark Danielewski on the House</p> <p> <strong>Where did the idea come from? </strong></p> <p>Way back in the beginning, I had a sense of a big project that I wanted to write and so I started writing about characters and writing these theoretical essays on film and sketching out philosophical ideas I was interested in pursuing. Then, in 1993, my father died and it was shortly after that that I had this idea about a house that was a quarter of an inch shorter on the inside than the outside. I really didn't know what it was, I thought it was a footnote or maybe a story, perhaps a poem\u0080 and then I realised it was exactly what I'd been looking for all along. It was the space in which the characters I'd been working on lived. It was a space where these philosophical ideas and theoretical concepts I had could be applied. I wanted to be as true to the book as possible so I kept following it and then when I was done, I looked back and I had this 750 page book. It was seven or eight years of a lot of work.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/2911danielski4.ra\">Audio clip:</a> Mark Danielewski on the project</p> <p><strong>What was the idea behind your unusual use of typography? </strong></p> <p>I would say that most of the typographical setting is influenced by film. That had been the design from the very beginning: to use the image of text itself in a way that had been studied very carefully for a hundred years by exquisite film-makers and to increase the reader's experience as they progress through the book. </p> <p>When I first began writing the book 10 years ago, I wrote a series of essays for myself on how cinematic grammar could be applied to text. One of the things that I've also noticed - thanks to my father who was a film-maker - was how film has a type of grammar that intensifies the viewers' experiences. A very simple example is in an action movie. Before an action sequence, a director tends to present the audience with long shots and static views so the eye is fixed on a certain focal point on the screen and doesn't move. When the action sequence actually comes in, a lot of short cuts are used and it intensifies the viewers' experience by shifting the focal point all over the screen. The eye is moving all around and there's an actual visceral response to that.</p> <p>So I began to theorise how one could adopt the same techniques textually. So, for example, in chapter nine, The Labyrinth Chapter, the density of the text intentionally slows the reader down, reorients the reader, redresses that question of direction inside the book. However, the next chapter, The Rescue Chapter, only has a few sentences per page so the reader will move through a hundred pages a lot quicker.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/2911danielski2.ra\">Audio clip:</a> Mark Danielewski on typography</p> <p><strong>Much has been made of your references to academic criticism within the book.

      "bodyText": "Can you tell us a bit about the book? House of Leaves is about a family who move into a small house in Virginia. One day they go away for a wedding and when they come back discover that a space has appeared between the master bedroom and the children's bedroom. The walls that appear are black and perfectly smooth. Will Navidson (the protagonist) begins to measure the inside of the house and soon discovers that the inside is larger than the outside by a quarter of an inch and that's where it all begins to happen. What it comes down to is how this family deals with a house that is larger on the inside than the outside and how it begins to influence those who live there and those who hear about it and those who write about it and maybe even those who read about it. \u0095 Audio clip: Mark Danielewski on the House Where did the idea come from? Way back in the beginning, I had a sense of a big project that I wanted to write and so I started writing about characters and writing these theoretical essays on film and sketching out philosophical ideas I was interested in pursuing. Then, in 1993, my father died and it was shortly after that that I had this idea about a house that was a quarter of an inch shorter on the inside than the outside. I really didn't know what it was, I thought it was a footnote or maybe a story, perhaps a poem\u0080 and then I realised it was exactly what I'd been looking for all along. It was the space in which the characters I'd been working on lived. It was a space where these philosophical ideas and theoretical concepts I had could be applied. I wanted to be as true to the book as possible so I kept following it and then when I was done, I looked back and I had this 750 page book. It was seven or eight years of a lot of work. \u0095 Audio clip: Mark Danielewski on the project What was the idea behind your unusual use of typography? I would say that most of the typographical setting is influenced by film. That had been the design from the very beginning: to use the image of text itself in a way that had been studied very carefully for a hundred years by exquisite film-makers and to increase the reader's experience as they progress through the book. When I first began writing the book 10 years ago, I wrote a series of essays for myself on how cinematic grammar could be applied to text. One of the things that I've also noticed - thanks to my father who was a film-maker - was how film has a type of grammar that intensifies the viewers' experiences. A very simple example is in an action movie. Before an action sequence, a director tends to present the audience with long shots and static views so the eye is fixed on a certain focal point on the screen and doesn't move. When the action sequence actually comes in, a lot of short cuts are used and it intensifies the viewers' experience by shifting the focal point all over the screen. The eye is moving all around and there's an actual visceral response to that. So I began to theorise how one could adopt the same techniques textually. So, for example, in chapter nine, The Labyrinth Chapter, the density of the text intentionally slows the reader down, reorients the reader, redresses that question of direction inside the book. However, the next chapter, The Rescue Chapter, only has a few sentences per page so the reader will move through a hundred pages a lot quicker. \u0095 Audio clip: Mark Danielewski on typography Much has been made of your references to academic criticism within the book. What was reason for that? Well, I read my share at Yale and Berkeley. It's also something that we're all aware of and we're constantly doing in our day-to-day lives. At the breakfast table we are footnoting everything that we read. We don't recognise it as such but we encounter an article in the newspaper and then suddenly we recall that a friend had a certain comment on that particular story, a certain bit of news that we saw on the television applies to that and we immediately assemble an idea of a story. It isn't exactly what*s on a newspaper in front of us. So, what I decided to do was adopt that mode of thinking, looking closely at the way we really process stories and how we encounter narratives and footnote them with our own personal experiences, our own emotional registers, and put it on the page. It's something that looks terribly foreign when you first glance at it in the book but then, as you begin to read it, you realise that actually it's patterned very naturally on the way we all think. \u0095 Audio clip: Mark Danielewski on academic criticism Are there any first books that you've read this year that have stood out? I'm excited by what I have read so far of Helen de Witt's The Last Samurai. I read White Teeth by Zadie Smith and was enchanted. After reading Zadie's book, I wanted to come to London, I wanted to see it. It got me all excited about it. I read Dave Eggers's book, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and thought the opening was absolutely devastating. Having lost a father to cancer it reminded me of lots of similar events that took place in my life. \u0095 Audio clip: Mark Danielewski on first books Any plans for another book?

Let battle commence!</p> <p><strong>1. Do you think the reputation you had as a hardman of football perhaps masked your footballing talent? And if it did, do you care? </strong> - George Davidson</p> <p>I had a great time when I was playing football and I think my tough reputation did go before me, but that is no bad thing as a lot of the game is down to a state of mind. Half the job of winning is down to making an opponent think he has already lost before he even steps onto the pitch. It's not for me to comment on my footballing talent but I can't complain about my achievements.</p> <p><strong>2. What pleased you more - winning the FA Cup final in 1988 or receiving rave reviews for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels?</strong> - Alexandre Gontijo</p> <p>Winning the final with Wimbledon was one of the most amazing things ever and nothing can take away from that. The previous question asked if I felt my hardman reputation masked by talent, well you don't win the Cup with just reputation. </p> <p>It was great to get recognition for all the work that I put into Lock, Stock. Guy Ritchie was a great director and his strong belief that I had what it took really inspired me. When the reviews came in I was really touched to see that all the hard work I put into the part wasn't in vain - and it has spurred me on even more in Snatch, Gone in Sixty Seconds and the films I am working on now.</p> <p><strong>3. Have you ever committed a foul and thought, \"Shit, I've gone too far here?\" If so, when and where?</strong> - Jack Saunders</p> <p>Not really. Every player knew what they were going up against when they stepped on to the pitch with me. I wasn't the only 'bad boy' out there anyway. There were tons of other players doing what I did and it still goes on now. The referees just kept watching me more than other players.</p> <p><strong>4. Exactly what possessed you to feel Paul Gascoigne's package?</strong> - Neil Butler</p> <p>He was annoying me and wouldn't stop and I thought I'd stop him once and for all. Simple as that!</p> <p><strong>5. At a time when the football club with whom you were earning your wages, QPR, were in real dire straits, financially, mentally and generally, why did you publicly mock our club on the late night TV show McCoist and McCauley? And why did you never apologise to QPR fans for not wanting to play for our club?</strong> - Tracy Stent</p> <p>There were things happening behind the scenes that I won't go into. This is all a long time ago and I've changed since then. I am sorry if the fans were offended but they have had their fair share of goes at me.</p> <p><strong>6. At the end of last season you offered to take the Wimbledon job for \u00a3200,000 a year. Do you still fancy becoming a football manager? If you do, which formation would you play and why? </strong> - Alex Clarke</p> <p>I'm really committed to my film career and am putting all of my effort into it so I don't have much time for the game - at the moment. Who knows what the future holds, though?</p> <p><strong>7. Which opposition player did you look forward to meeting on a Saturday, and which player did you hate playing against? Why?</strong> - KB8MPO@bolton.ac.uk</p> <p>Some things are better left unsaid. My fans will probably know the answer to this already.</p> <p><strong>8. Now you're spending six months of the year in Hollywood can you tell us: does anyone down to earth and normal (besides yourself) actually live in that God-forsaken hell hole?</strong> - Mark Bridges</p> <p>You can get strange people wherever you are in the world. I have got a great place in LA and quite enjoy it out there. It is obviously very different to home, and I miss the UK a lot, but it is where I need to be for my film career right now. </p> <p><strong>9. What's your juiciest piece of Hollywood gossip?</strong> - Lawrence Booth</p> <p>I'm not really in with the Hollywood party circuit. I prefer to spend time with my family and friends that come over from home, so I am not really the person to ask for hot gossip.</p> <p><strong>10.

Their response was misplaced. This white paper, and the activity that lies behind it, adds up to unprecedented change for those involved in urban regeneration and renewal.</p> <p>The urban white paper is the first attempt in almost a quarter of a century to bring together the government's approach to urban areas at the strategic, regional and local levels. Significantly, it sets up a new committee at cabinet level to oversee this process.</p> <p>The paper also paves the way for its rural counterpart by making explicit the link between urban population and pressure on the countryside.</p> <p>The paper takes on board key recommendations from Lord Rogers's urban task force report Towards an Urban Renaissance, and uses as its starting point the links between the social, economic and environmental factors at play in urban areas.

      "bodyText": "The urban white paper received a muted response in the House of Commons, and members of parliament struggled to find much that was new in the long-awaited document. Their response was misplaced. This white paper, and the activity that lies behind it, adds up to unprecedented change for those involved in urban regeneration and renewal. The urban white paper is the first attempt in almost a quarter of a century to bring together the government's approach to urban areas at the strategic, regional and local levels. Significantly, it sets up a new committee at cabinet level to oversee this process. The paper also paves the way for its rural counterpart by making explicit the link between urban population and pressure on the countryside. The paper takes on board key recommendations from Lord Rogers's urban task force report Towards an Urban Renaissance, and uses as its starting point the links between the social, economic and environmental factors at play in urban areas. To put it simply, joined-up problems require joined-up solutions. At the national level, the government committed itself in the chancellor's pre-budget statement to a series of measures designed to encourage physical development in run-down areas. This included additional expenditure in the transport strategy, and a review of the planning framework aimed at putting urban renewal at the heart of the country's planning system. At the regional level, a greater role in joining up urban initiatives is given to the government's regional office, and extra resources, announced in the pre-budget statement, go to the regional development agencies. At the local level, recently introduced legislation gives local authorities wide powers to act in the interests of economic, social and environmental wellbeing of their areas. The quality of public services is being monitored through pilot local public service agreements in individual councils, while the introduction of local strategic partnerships, bringing together local agencies and community groups to co-ordinate regeneration work, places much greater emphasis on genuine local consultation. The white paper aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion through economic growth, and links quality of life with quality of public services. All the new initiatives and structures are designed to recognise that the needs of individual areas are very varied. The \"tool kit\" approach - moving away from the previous \"one size fits all\" attitude - is to be welcomed. This white paper increases the scope for local action, though not necessarily local power. \u0095 Esther Knight is the assistant director of the Centre for Local Economic Strategies \u0095 Skills training for the new urban agenda will be examined at a CLES conference at Sheffield Hallam University on December 5.

The proposed National Treatment Agency must improve drug services, make them more accountable and focused on helping users to become drug free. They need to move away from just substituting heroin with methadone and meet the housing, health, educational and employment needs of drug users. Three-quarters of our vendors use illegal drugs but our research shows that 80% of them had a drug problem before they became homeless. Since 1996, the Big Issue in the North Trust has been helping homeless people move away from the streets to good homes, good health, good jobs and good lives. Unlike other Big Issues around the UK, vendors in the north participate in the Big Futures programme. Under the programme, they complete three accredited training courses, meet with staff every month and have access to a range of services including housing, fast access to drug detox, and a variety of projects, short courses and activities to help them develop self-esteem and realise that they have a right to the good things in life. We think it works. Since May, 40 vendors have moved into permanent accommodation, 30 have found employment and 50 have undertaken a detox. It is only this sort of holistic approach that can help homeless people to achieve their full potential and one which the Rough Sleepers Unit should embed in services all around the country. It may be a clich\u00e9 but what is a clich\u00e9 other than something that is true but which we are bored of hearing? \u0095 Stuart Bowman is research manager for the Big Issue in the North Trust",

      "body": "<p>It used to be so simple. Every December, the most lasting of trees would be brought down from the attic in a large brown box. Its prickly boughs would be dusted, then assembled and finally decorated by delighted owners. These days, however, we are unlikely to gaze admiringly at a conical-shaped bit of plastic. More and more people are opting for the real thing, leaving behind the artificial imitations that decked our halls in years gone by. This year, we will be spending well over \u00a3150m on the genuine article, with growers expect to sell some 7m Christmas trees compared with only 1.5m in the early 80s. </p> <p>Some authorities consider the Christmas tree to be a survivor of pagan worship and trace it to Egypt and ancient Rome. Others say that the first real Christian Christmas tree dates back to 8th century Germany where it was used as a replacement for pagan worship. However, it was not until the beginning of the 19th century that the Christmas tree as we know it really became part of celebrations in England. Although Christmas trees were not unknown in England in Georgian times, it was Prince Albert of Saxony, the prince consort of Queen Victoria, who set an example and encouraged people to have a decorated tree at Christmas. </p> <p>Until relatively recently, trees would be cut in the woods, brought into town and sold mostly by greengrocers. Some are still grown in this way but environmental concerns and a reluctance to spoil the woodlands has prompted farmers to start growing trees as a crop in special plantations. More than 85% of the trees in our homes are grown in Britain and the remainder imported from Denmark, Ireland and Belgium. </p> <p>Growers are keen to publicise the environmental benefits of their farms. The average six foot Christmas tree takes about eight years to grow in Britain. According to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association, an acre of 2.5m trees can take two tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release sufficient oxygen for 12 to 15 people to live on for a year. Trees are also replanted within six weeks of being cut down. </p> <p>Such a quick turnover means that finding an evergreen on which to hang your baubles is hardly difficult. Trees are sold by garden centres, supermarkets, DIY stores, garage forecourts and even on the internet. The more dedicated tree shoppers can also visit the growers who allow customers to choose and dig up their own tree. But for all the increasing availability, knowing which variety to pick and how much to pay for it is another matter. </p> <p>In Britain, the Norway spruce has always been the most popular species. It was, after all, Prince Albert's favourite. But the tree's habit of dropping its needles when brought into a heated room has prompted growers to plant hardier, if more expensive, varieties such as the Scots and lodgepole pine and the noble and nordmann fir. More exotic species are also creeping into our homes. This year, Number 10 will be decorated by a blue spruce instead of its more mundane Norway cousin. </p> <p>As a rule of thumb, the bigger and rarer the tree, the pricier it is. An ordinary six foot Norway spruce will set you back between \u00a312 and \u00a315 if you buy it directly from the grower. But you can expect to pay up to \u00a340 for a similar noble fir which does not drop its needles. </p> <p>Buying a potted tree is also more expensive and will set you back at least \u00a35 more than an equivalent cut tree. While it may last longer than a cut tree, potted trees are not necessarily any more alive and you may be disappointed if you plan to plant it in the garden come January. </p> <p>If you want your tree to live and can afford to part with an extra \u00a310, choose a variety that has been grown in a container rather than dug up and potted. Living trees tend to be bushier and more attractive because they have been grown in controlled conditions and not exposed to the ravages of the weather. However, you are unlikely to find anything over five foot in a container. </p> <p>Nobody would dream of putting fresh flowers in a vase without any water. But many of us simply forget to water our Christmas trees. They may be big but they are just like any other plant. In fact, an average six foot tree will happily drink its way through a pint of water a day, especially if it is not potted. So it is best to check the stand several times a day. </p> <p>If your tree is cut, it is a good idea to trim about half an inch off the end once you get home. When trees are cut, they tend to seal up so moisture is not lost. By slicing off the end you will help the tree soak up fresh water once you have brought it indoors. </p> <p>Tree specialists also advise buyers not to take trees indoors straight away, especially if you have bought the plant directly from the grower. Christmas trees which have been living out in the cold will suffer shock if brought straight into a heated house. It is best to leave it in the garage overnight or propped against the side of the house so it has time to get used to the severe change in temperature. </p> <p>For the ultimate convenience, you could order your tree over the inter net and have it delivered to your doorstep right up until Christmas. However, the prices could dent your festive spirit. Absolutechristmas.com not only sells trees up to 20 foot, they will also let you rent a living tree year after year at an extra charge. Those renting can expect to pay an extra \u00a314.99 on top of the normal charges which range from \u00a312.50 a foot for a pot-grown Norway spruce to \u00a317.50 a foot for a nordmann fir. </p> <p>The site will sell you cheaper cut trees starting at \u00a39 per foot for a nordmann fir, up to \u00a311 a foot for a noble fir. They promise to deliver throughout the country the following day right up to Christmas Eve, provided your orders are placed before midday. </p> <p>Their rivals at christmastreeland.com are slightly cheaper and will guarantee speedy nationwide delivery up until December 22 provided you order your tree by mid December. They will also pick up your dead tree in January for an extra charge of up to \u00a320 in London and \u00a315 elsewhere. </p> <p>Expect to pay \u00a376.59 for a noble fir with a stand and \u00a344.99 for a four-foot Norway spruce.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, today appealed to the public to help the police track down the killers of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor. On a visit to the dead boy's school in Peckham, south east London, Mr Straw said that anyone with information about the murder had a responsibility to the community to come forward. Damilola was left to bleed to death after being attacked by a group of 11 to 14-year-olds on his way home from school on Monday. \"We know young people and some adults and friends know exactly who killed Damilola Taylor,\" Mr Straw said. Althea Smith, chair of the local police consultative committee, backed the home secretary's appeal. \"Someone is shielding these children. There are bloodstains on someone's clothes,\" she said. Forensic experts are running tests on a knife discovered yesterday near the murder scene. The knife was wrapped in a piece of cloth but there were no visible signs of blood. Tests are also being run on a broken bottle found near the scene and detectives are examining CCTV footage. Mr Straw described the death as \"an awful evil\" and acknowledged fears among the local community that it would be stigmatised as a result of the crime. But he said he knew the area well and that it is full of \"law abiding people\" who want to get on with their lives. \"Someone said to me in the meeting that it is not the buildings that killed Damilola Taylor but some people,\" he said. Mr Straw also heard parents' concerns about bullying. Damilola's mother, Gloria, has claimed the school did not take seriously her complaints that he was being bullied in the days before his murder. She says that he wrote the name of one of his tormenters on a scrap of paper left in his locker, a clue that could provide the police with crucial evidence. Headteacher Mark Parsons is certain that none of his pupils were responsible for the murder and said he was \"immensely proud\" of the school's anti-bullying policy. Damilola staggered 100 yards with blood pouring from a sliced artery in his leg after being stabbed by a fleeing gang. Nearby workmen tried to save him but other passersby ignored Damilola as he lay dying on a stairwell near his council home. Police are hunting for three boys seen near the scene of the attack.

Mr King faces charges of buggery of a boy under 16, indecently assaulting a male, and attempting to bugger a male under 21. The offences are alleged to have taken place between December 27 1970 and December 26 1971. The 55-year-old record producer spoke only to confirm his name and address at the magistrates' court in Staines, Surrey. The charges, which Mr King has publicly rejected as absurd, relate to three men who were boys at the time of the alleged offences. Mr King, a bachelor, who was represented by Mr Ronald Thwaites QC, was appearing under his real name of Kenneth George King. The chairman of the bench, Dr Mary Trimble, gave Mr King bail on condition that he should surrender all passports and did not contact any victims or witnesses. Mr King, who was dressed in a black suit, white shirt, blue tie and trainers, was remanded to appear before the court again on January 2. After the hearing, he was whisked away in a chauffeur-driven blue Mercedes and refused to comment. The Cambridge university graduate, who discovered Genesis, became famous at the age of 21 when his hit single Everyone's Gone To The Moon became an overnight success, making him a millionaire.

Taunted Some children at Oliver Goldsmith primary school, where Damilola had been studying for three months, have already given preliminary interviews to detectives, under the supervision of specialist counsellors. Damilola had complained he was being taunted and bullied by pupils. The prime suspects remain three youths who were spotted at the bottom of the stairwell by a man who discovered Damilola's body.

Its endowment has been valued at approximately \u00a317 million. Swailes is the first person to see the thousands of applications that land on the doormat of their office in Bracknell. </p> <p>She says the two most important factors for applicants to consider are identifying the appropriate trust and writing a good application. To find the right trust, use directories produced by the Directory of Social Change and the Charities Aid Foundation, or search the computer programme FunderFinder. Most libraries or councils for voluntary services will hold copies of these resources. </p> <p>It might sound obvious, but check that a trust will fund charities in your area, that they wish to fund the kind of work your charity does and that they make grants of an appropriate size. \"Don't ignore their funding exclusions - believe what they say!\" warns Swailes. Once these criteria are met, she says, allow lots of time to write the application. \"Do a draft, put it aside for a week and ask someone outside of the organisation to read it.\"</p> <p>These are her top tips for a successful application:</p> <p>\u0095 Tailor it to the trust you are applying to - don't do generic applications<br> \u0095 Write between two and four pages of A4, and include your annual reports and accounts<br> \u0095 Glossiness is not important, but legibility and accessibility are<br> \u0095 Use headings, boxes, and shading - anything to make your application more readable<br> \u0095 Try to say what you actually do - avoid jargon and don't use sophisticated language<br> \u0095 Ensure the first paragraph grabs attention, encapsulates what you do and explains why you need the money<br> \u0095 If what you are doing is at risk of being excluded, address this early on - for example, \"We are part of a national organisation, but don't receive central funding\" <br> \u0095 Make sure you answer the questions \"who?\", \"what?\", \"why?\", \"when?\" and \"how?\" in your application<br> \u0095 Be realistic with the budget - not too small, but not padded out<br> \u0095 Show you have thought about costings, but don't go into too much detail - four to five lines would be sufficient<br> \u0095 Don't ask for \u00a34,999 if the maximum is \u00a35,000 - it looks suspicious<br> \u0095 Make sure you include the name, telephone number and address of your organisation - \"sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised\"<br> \u0095 Ask for a specific amount of money<br> \u0095 End the application with your vision - write it with \"fire in your belly\"<br> \u0095 Include a paragraph about a case study demonstrating who will benefit from the money - \"it brings it to life\"<br> \u0095 Give referees, but don't name drop<br> \u0095 If you have received money from a local trust before, indicate this - it is a good sign<br> \u0095 Use the name of the administrator or correspondent - don't say \"Dear Sir/Madam\"<br></p> <p>Once you have written the application, Swailes advises imagining you are a funder. Ask yourself:<br>\u0095 What is good about the application?<br> \u0095 What is not so good?<br> \u0095 Is there enough to interest me?<br> \u0095 Are there any gaps?<br> \u0095 What would I ask if I went on a visit to the organisation? <br></p> <p>A few final words of advice. Swailes says: \"Most of us don't want to be taken out to lunch - life isn't long enough.\" </p> <p>If, after taking on board all of this advice, you are not successful, ring up to find out why. If you have no luck elsewhere, go back and try again. But if you are successful, remember to say thank you and keep trusts informed of how their money is being spent.</p>",

Once these criteria are met, she says, allow lots of time to write the application. \"Do a draft, put it aside for a week and ask someone outside of the organisation to read it.\" These are her top tips for a successful application: \u0095 Tailor it to the trust you are applying to - don't do generic applications \u0095 Write between two and four pages of A4, and include your annual reports and accounts \u0095 Glossiness is not important, but legibility and accessibility are \u0095 Use headings, boxes, and shading - anything to make your application more readable \u0095 Try to say what you actually do - avoid jargon and don't use sophisticated language \u0095 Ensure the first paragraph grabs attention, encapsulates what you do and explains why you need the money \u0095 If what you are doing is at risk of being excluded, address this early on - for example, \"We are part of a national organisation, but don't receive central funding\" \u0095 Make sure you answer the questions \"who?\", \"what?\", \"why?\", \"when?\" and \"how?\" in your application \u0095 Be realistic with the budget - not too small, but not padded out \u0095 Show you have thought about costings, but don't go into too much detail - four to five lines would be sufficient \u0095 Don't ask for \u00a34,999 if the maximum is \u00a35,000 - it looks suspicious \u0095 Make sure you include the name, telephone number and address of your organisation - \"sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised\" \u0095 Ask for a specific amount of money \u0095 End the application with your vision - write it with \"fire in your belly\" \u0095 Include a paragraph about a case study demonstrating who will benefit from the money - \"it brings it to life\" \u0095 Give referees, but don't name drop \u0095 If you have received money from a local trust before, indicate this - it is a good sign \u0095 Use the name of the administrator or correspondent - don't say \"Dear Sir/Madam\" Once you have written the application, Swailes advises imagining you are a funder. Ask yourself: \u0095 What is good about the application? \u0095 What is not so good? \u0095 Is there enough to interest me? \u0095 Are there any gaps? \u0095 What would I ask if I went on a visit to the organisation? A few final words of advice. Swailes says: \"Most of us don't want to be taken out to lunch - life isn't long enough.\" If, after taking on board all of this advice, you are not successful, ring up to find out why. If you have no luck elsewhere, go back and try again. But if you are successful, remember to say thank you and keep trusts informed of how their money is being spent.",

The camera hops about, leaving you vulnerable to off-screen raptors. Your character is sometimes very slow to aim. While there are different types of dinosaur, their movement patterns are repetitive.

Shenmue is mind-boggling any way you look at it: in its beauty, its size, and its minutely observed detail. Every character - and there are hundreds - is unique, with his/her own voice, dialogue options, facial expressions, clothes and mannerisms. And if you go to the shops on Christmas Eve, they'll be playing festive Muzak. </p> <p>The game opens with a cut scene in which a young Japanese man looks on as his father is murdered. As Ryo, you vow to hunt down those responsible. With little to go on, you set out from the house and start looking for clues. </p> <p>But it's a big world out there, with a bewildering array of options. On any one day, add to your rip-off plastic toy collection, spar with your dad's pupil, listen to some tunes, feed the injured kitten down the road, go shopping, chat to the locals, go for a drink in the bar, hang with your buddy; play darts, pool, fruit machines, or, in the ultimate irony, kill a few hours at the local arcade. </p> <p>You never feel completely comfortable engaging in any of this - you're supposed to be hellbent on revenge, after all - but the daily routines of your various leads and witnesses often leave you no choice. </p> <p>Advancing the plot is a painstaking process - and a teensy bit dull. Tramp to and fro across town, talk to everyone, finally find someone with useful info, go on to X's house, find he's out, realise it's past 8pm and hurry home to avoid a ticking-off from grandma... </p> <p>Because beneath the fantastically ornate trimmings, Shenmue is, essentially, a point-and-click adventure. Sure, it's a huge, detailed, sumptuous, epic point-and-click adventure with a bucket- load of sub-games, but as with your average sumptuous, epic movie, sometimes lacking in the action department. The neat-looking fights are so few and fast they feel like a game within the game. </p> <p>Make no mistake, Shenmue is a grand vision superbly realised. As for whether you'll still be playing it in two months... I'll whisper it: nah. (AB)</p>",

It is the first strike since Greg Dyke took over as director general and comes as managers try to implement his plans to cull up to 1,000 posts from the corporation. The move also comes just one week after the BBC World Service faced a strike over pay and conditions. Bectu members will not work from midnight on Friday until midnight on Saturday in the first strike at Television Centre in over two years. The union is protesting at the announcement by the BBC that it plans to make over 50 resources staff redundant across BBC Resources including all 40 studio managers, and close an outside broadcast unit at BBC Manchester. A Bectu spokesman said the strike was designed to cause maximum damage to weekend programmes. \"We'd like to think they won't go out,\" he said. A spokeswoman for BBC Resources said that the BBC had \"extensive plans in place to prevent disruption\", but failed to rule it out. She said that the BBC was \"disappointed\" at Bectu's determination to strike.

From December 11, users will have to pay an annual fee of \u00a3500 to access all areas of the site, although limited access will still be available free of charge. Registered users have been offered the chance to take up a subscription at a discounted annual rate of \u00a3200. Explaining the reasons behind the change, spokesman Pete Pender-Cudlip, said it was always part of the plan and that the founders were convinced there was demand for \"premium high-grade content\". He said: \"The feedback we've had from the target audience [affluent decision-makers] is that it's a valuable service. \"There's a wealth of difference between what TheStreet tried to do - pumping out commodity news - and the451.com's niche news, and the crunchy financial comment a day ahead of Lex that BreakingViews.com provides.\" BreakingViews.Com has yet to reveal registered user figures or figures for the number of page impressions. However, it claims to reach more than 1m readers through its offline commissions, such as the columns it writes for Wall Street Journal Europe, La Repubblica, La Tribune and Handelsblatt.",

      "bodyText": "It has been the most extraordinary turnaround for a fuddy-duddy fashion label. And now, after winning the affection of Posh Spice, the Appletons and Japanese tourists everywhere, Burberry has announced it is to float on the stock market. Parent company Great Universal Stores announced the decision to float after an phenomenonly successful marketing campaign has made it a must-have for the fashion-conscious. Its recent marketing drive has transformed Burberry from a tired, old English gents' outfitters into the hottest fashion label in the land - worn by celebrities and fashion-conscious teenagers. Older generations will remember its hallmark tartan fabric simply as an upmarket lining for overcoats. But now the tan, black and red fabric is just about everywhere with Burberry scarves, bags and even wallpaper available on the high street. The marketing department at GUS scored a coup earlier this year when it persuaded Kate Moss and royal Frederick Windsor to star in its brand relaunch campaign leading to a remarkable revival for Burberry. They appeared as bride and groom, dressed head to toe in the distinctive print. In a profits statement issued today, GUS announced it will sell off part of its holding in the brand within the next 18 months. Burberry has proved the top performing division at GUS in the six months to the end of September, producing pre-tax profits of \u00a326.6m, up from \u00a34.3m year on year. Analysts have predicted the float could value the brand at between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn. Burberry was forced to issue a statement this year, warning of the dangers of using its trademark print after a spate of appearances on the catwalks from London to New York.",

Sexy politicians are not exactly thick on the ground in Russia.</p> <p>If power and money are aphrodisiacs everywhere, the cruel geriatrics who ran the Kremlin for much of the 20th century remained less than attractive to Russian women.</p> <p>Mikhail Gorbachev had charisma and a charming wife, but his appeal was avuncular. Boris Yeltsin, too, acquired the appeal of the erratic, forgetful grandfather.</p> <p>But Vladimir Putin, according to the newspaper, is virtually unique among Russian politicians in being seen as a sex object.</p> <p>''He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, he's into sport, he loves his wife and kids. What more do you want?'' Anna, 30, told the newspaper.</p> <p>Others detailed their erotic fantasies about the former KGB colonel and confessed that they dreamt of sleeping with the president.</p> <p>Only last week, Mr Putin surprised the Russian and British press by quipping, a propos of his get-together with Tony Blair in a Moscow pub, that in male company Russian men talked about women.</p> <p>According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, Russian women not only talk about, but dream about VVP. If the image of the steely, creepy secret policeman is cause for suspicion of Mr Putin in the west, it seems to be part of his appeal to Russian women who buy the spin-doctored version of a less flamboyant, Russian-style James Bond.</p> <p>''I've been in love with intelligence agents since I was a child,'' confessed Vika, 32. ''The KGB is so romantic - men in black suits, listening devices, impassionate faces, epaulettes. The president has an iron hand inside a velvet glove.</p> <p>''Even when Putin is shaking someone's hand on television with a little smile to show that he is human, I am frightened of him - in other words I want him.</p> <p>\"Danger and sex always go together... Putin is like a glass of 12-year-old whisky.''</p> <p>The top ten sex symbols listed for Russian women predictably include sports stars, singers, actors, and TV personalities. Perhaps the bad news for Mr Putin is that the only other politician who makes it to the top ten is the lager lout of the Russian parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.</p> <p>He is the loudmouth, extremist clown of Russian politics, the opposite of Mr Putin's sober and severe public image.</p> <p>Writing in Komsomolskaya Pravda, Darya Aslamova reveals: ''I dream of Putin at night.

      "bodyText": "Running at 70% in the opinion polls, with a supine parliament about to put him beyond the reach of the law, and spraying foreign policy initiatives into the vacuum left by America's political uncertainty, President Vladimir Putin could be forgiven for feeling that fortune is smiling on him. As he approaches the one-year mark in the Kremlin, Mr Putin's good fortune was compounded this week when the president of Russia's judo federation, Vladimir Shestakov, piped-up to comment that the black-belt president was in such good shape at the age of 48 that he could still occupy a place in Russia's Olympic team. What's more, for thirtysomething women, VVP, as he is commonly known, is the sexiest man in Russia. According to a poll conducted by a Moscow newspaper this week, Mr Putin outstrips the film stars, TV personalities, pop singers, and other celebrities in his sex appeal. Sexy politicians are not exactly thick on the ground in Russia. If power and money are aphrodisiacs everywhere, the cruel geriatrics who ran the Kremlin for much of the 20th century remained less than attractive to Russian women. Mikhail Gorbachev had charisma and a charming wife, but his appeal was avuncular. Boris Yeltsin, too, acquired the appeal of the erratic, forgetful grandfather. But Vladimir Putin, according to the newspaper, is virtually unique among Russian politicians in being seen as a sex object. ''He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, he's into sport, he loves his wife and kids. What more do you want?'' Anna, 30, told the newspaper. Others detailed their erotic fantasies about the former KGB colonel and confessed that they dreamt of sleeping with the president. Only last week, Mr Putin surprised the Russian and British press by quipping, a propos of his get-together with Tony Blair in a Moscow pub, that in male company Russian men talked about women. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, Russian women not only talk about, but dream about VVP. If the image of the steely, creepy secret policeman is cause for suspicion of Mr Putin in the west, it seems to be part of his appeal to Russian women who buy the spin-doctored version of a less flamboyant, Russian-style James Bond. ''I've been in love with intelligence agents since I was a child,'' confessed Vika, 32. ''The KGB is so romantic - men in black suits, listening devices, impassionate faces, epaulettes. The president has an iron hand inside a velvet glove. ''Even when Putin is shaking someone's hand on television with a little smile to show that he is human, I am frightened of him - in other words I want him. \"Danger and sex always go together... Putin is like a glass of 12-year-old whisky.'' The top ten sex symbols listed for Russian women predictably include sports stars, singers, actors, and TV personalities. Perhaps the bad news for Mr Putin is that the only other politician who makes it to the top ten is the lager lout of the Russian parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky. He is the loudmouth, extremist clown of Russian politics, the opposite of Mr Putin's sober and severe public image. Writing in Komsomolskaya Pravda, Darya Aslamova reveals: ''I dream of Putin at night. Black-and-white and handsome like the intelligence agent in the old Soviet cinema.'' The nostalgia for the old days of Soviet superpower is a common thread in the fantasies of Mr Putin. President Boris Yeltsin destroyed the Soviet Union and communism. President Vladimir Putin plays with that nostalgia, deliberately and probably genuinely ambivalent about the so-called Soviet glory days, and constantly pledges to restore a semblance of that past power. ''To be honest,'' Ms Aslamova goes on, ''I thought it was only me who was licensed for the nocturnal rendezvous with Putin... So I was a bit jealous when I asked my friends - all over 30 - and found out that they all had had sex with the president in their dreams.'' The Kremlin spin doctors could not have done a better job in maintaining those 70% ratings.

Food mouldered on plates around her. Even those close to her, feared infection through touching her or sharing utensils. She used to be a wealthy and attractive woman until she lost everything when she learned she was HIV-positive.</p> <p>\"It pained us to see it,\" says Bernadette Mulelebwe, director of Fondation Femme Plus (FFP), an organisation dedicated to helping HIV-positive women in the Congo. \"We took her away to a centre.\"</p> <p>Bernadette and others from FFP looked after the woman until she died. After her death, they asked her sister to come and bury the body, but she refused. No one from her family wanted to help. In the end, FFP bought a coffin and arranged a decent funeral. A young man at the cemetery was moved to tears to see the group of mourning women arrive and offered to carry the coffin. \"That was our first time in the cemetery,\" says Bernadette. \"That was the first experience which was followed by many others.\" FFP, which is supported by Christian Aid, did exactly what a family would normally do in such circumstances. Sadly, it is exactly what many families are not doing in the Congo. There is minimal funding for health services in the country, impoverished after years of war. People with HIV/Aids are ostracised, rejected and isolated. Many Aids widows sleep on the streets and in churches with their children. The number of Aids orphans is rising dramatically - and now stands an estimated 800,000. Organisations like FFP play a vital role in providing support services.</p> <p>FFP's work will gain an international profile this week with the opening of Positive Negatives, a photographic exhibition in London. Pictures taken by FFP women, given training by Christian Aid to become photographers, went on display at the Africa Centre in Covent Garden. </p> <p>Bernadette, who travelled to the UK for the exhibition with one of the photographers, reflects that FFP has come a long way from its beginnings six years ago. A social worker, she was in daily contact with women with HIV/Aids and saw an urgent need to do something to help. She and a few friends started to meet every Saturday, bringing food to share and talking as they ate. </p> <p>\"People brought something to eat, rice, fish, oil We were cooking, chatting. We said, well. 'Who has a story to share with us about Aids?' And then someone began to speak. And then we said 'Who can say something to our friend who has just told her story?' It helped people open up, simply to know that they were not alone.\"</p> <p>Gradually, women became more open about speaking about HIV/Aids. Hearing others' stories, they began to realise that they were not alone and gained a measure of confidence and self-respect. \"They realised that they should be strong, for themselves and for their children. The objective was to help them live positively and not to hide,\" Bernadette comments. \"They had so many negative thoughts.\" Now, more than 1,200 women belong to FFP and the organisation has branches in other parts of the Congo. It provides basic medical care, runs a sewing workshop and owns rice fields where members can work and raise crops. Two years ago, it started a restaurant in Kinshasa, which has become a popular meeting place.</p> <p>The Christian Aid photographic project has given its work a new dimension. Christian Aid wanted to help the women earn money through a new skill - but also a chance to express just how they felt about HIV/Aids. The UK-based training agency PhotoVoice provided two blocks of training for 15 women in Kinshasa, some of whom had never used a camera before. They started off with simple equipment, learning about theory and basic technique. The change in their appearance and morale was immediate, says Bernadette.</p> <p>\"I have never seen such a change from one day to the next,\" she comments. \"At first they came dressed in their everyday clothes. Then the next day, they had changed; they took care with their hair. Women who had been coming to the centre for medical attention suddenly needed it less frequently.\"</p> <p>Anna Blackman of PhotoVoice, who spent a total 12 weeks in Kinshasa, said that the women's attitude to the project inspired her.</p> <p>\"It was amazing. They all made such an effort even if they had to walk two hours, change buses three times and walk to the centre,\" she comments. \"More than anything, they are some of the strongest women I have met anywhere. They're so proud to be learning photography. They just haven't given up in any way at all. \"</p> <p>Gabrielle, a former television presenter who travelled to London for Positive Negatives, found that she was HIV-positive two years ago. Her husband died of an Aids-related illness in August. She says that the training gave her a new reason for live.</p> <p>\"It was beneficial for all of us because it gave us a means of working honourably. I had fallen very low. No one would shake hands with me. No one would look at me.\"</p> <p>Gabrielle's photographs show children, as young as four, sleeping in a huddle on a street in Kinshasa. A woman, gravely ill, lies on the most basic of hospital beds as her young son crouches beside her, because there is no one else to care for him. These were not easy images to take, she reflects. But it was necessary to face up to them, so that others could learn about the tragedy of HIV/Aids in Africa.</p> <p>\"We had to educate people,\" she comments. \"We had to take those photos. We must help others who have need of us.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Positive Negatives can be seen at the Africa Centre, 38 King St, Covent Garden, London until December 15.

      "body": "<p>While European politicians laid the blame for the collapse of the Hague negotiations squarely at the door of United States, the US media last weekend warned that the world may have missed its best chance to forge an effective climate treaty.</p> <p>The Washington Post took a mildly anti-European line, arguing that the negotiations \"fell apart after some EU countries, notably Germany, rejected an eleventh-hour compromise\". This compromise, it disclosed, had been hammered out on Friday night \"in a lengthy telephone discussion between President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\" The paper quoted Frank Loy, the US chief negotiator warning that \"while the United States was ready to resume negotiations at any time, there would obviously be something of a hiatus until a new U.S. administration gets settled in office, regardless of whether Gore or Bush becomes president.\"</p> <p>It added that American environmental groups, who had previously sided with the Europeans in demanding concessions from the Clinton administration, had expressed dismay on Saturday with what they described as the short-sighted attitude taken by those European delegates who decided to quash any compromise. \"There is no excuse for having walked away,\" the paper quoted Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust in Washington. \"This was Europe's best chance to achieve a strong climate treaty, and they decided to pass it up. This window of opportunity may not come again.\"</p> <p>Sunday's Los Angeles Times took a similar line. Denouncing the meeting's collapse as \"an embarrassing international fiasco,\" it laid much of the blame at Europe's uncompromising door. The US delegation, it reported, had made two \"generous\" last minute offers to the EU nations which responded by \"a reopening of old disagreements and America-bashing\". </p> <p>The paper added that, while America's role in future climate change talks remained \"pure conjecture\" until the next president was inaugurated, US participation in global talks was by no means guaranteed. </p> <p>\"Already on Saturday,\" it reported, \"there were indications that some Republicans believe that the process began in Kyoto has struck a dead end.\" The Republican-dominated US Senate has so far refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty and George W. Bush denounced the treaty as \"unfair\" during the election campaign. Sunday's New York Times was more measured, reporting simply that \"in the end the negotiators got lost in the trees.\" European nations, it said, suspected that America was playing a \"get out of jail free card\" in trying to use its existing forests as carbon sinks which could be counted towards meeting US Kyoto commitments. The US, on the other hand, was highly resistant to following the European path of higher fuel taxes to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>\"Despite a report issued during the conference from the Energy Department saying that the United States could reduce its fuel use though fairly simple, inexpensive changes with almost no harm to the economy, conservation measures have long been resisted in a country where big cars, low gasoline prices and economic growth have come to be considered nearly inalienable rights.\" </p> <p>The Times stated that the final analysis came down to a 20 million ton difference between the two sides - \"a minuscule amount of carbon dioxide in a world spewing 6 billion tons a year into the air.\" The crunch came, the paper said, \"when domestic political pressures, exhaustion, an exceptionally tight relationship between the Europeans and environmental groups and simply too much data to sort through in too little time all collided to destroy any environmental detente, at least for now.\" </p> <p>While the Hague negotiations made front page news across Europe for a fortnight, much of the mainstream US news media either downplayed or ignored them altogether. Preoccupied with the US election drama, their lack of coverage reflected widespread public indifference to the challenge of climate change.</p> <p>There were a few honourable exceptions.

      "bodyText": "While European politicians laid the blame for the collapse of the Hague negotiations squarely at the door of United States, the US media last weekend warned that the world may have missed its best chance to forge an effective climate treaty. The Washington Post took a mildly anti-European line, arguing that the negotiations \"fell apart after some EU countries, notably Germany, rejected an eleventh-hour compromise\". This compromise, it disclosed, had been hammered out on Friday night \"in a lengthy telephone discussion between President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\" The paper quoted Frank Loy, the US chief negotiator warning that \"while the United States was ready to resume negotiations at any time, there would obviously be something of a hiatus until a new U.S. administration gets settled in office, regardless of whether Gore or Bush becomes president.\" It added that American environmental groups, who had previously sided with the Europeans in demanding concessions from the Clinton administration, had expressed dismay on Saturday with what they described as the short-sighted attitude taken by those European delegates who decided to quash any compromise. \"There is no excuse for having walked away,\" the paper quoted Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust in Washington. \"This was Europe's best chance to achieve a strong climate treaty, and they decided to pass it up. This window of opportunity may not come again.\" Sunday's Los Angeles Times took a similar line. Denouncing the meeting's collapse as \"an embarrassing international fiasco,\" it laid much of the blame at Europe's uncompromising door. The US delegation, it reported, had made two \"generous\" last minute offers to the EU nations which responded by \"a reopening of old disagreements and America-bashing\". The paper added that, while America's role in future climate change talks remained \"pure conjecture\" until the next president was inaugurated, US participation in global talks was by no means guaranteed. \"Already on Saturday,\" it reported, \"there were indications that some Republicans believe that the process began in Kyoto has struck a dead end.\" The Republican-dominated US Senate has so far refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty and George W. Bush denounced the treaty as \"unfair\" during the election campaign. Sunday's New York Times was more measured, reporting simply that \"in the end the negotiators got lost in the trees.\" European nations, it said, suspected that America was playing a \"get out of jail free card\" in trying to use its existing forests as carbon sinks which could be counted towards meeting US Kyoto commitments. The US, on the other hand, was highly resistant to following the European path of higher fuel taxes to reduce carbon emissions. \"Despite a report issued during the conference from the Energy Department saying that the United States could reduce its fuel use though fairly simple, inexpensive changes with almost no harm to the economy, conservation measures have long been resisted in a country where big cars, low gasoline prices and economic growth have come to be considered nearly inalienable rights.\" The Times stated that the final analysis came down to a 20 million ton difference between the two sides - \"a minuscule amount of carbon dioxide in a world spewing 6 billion tons a year into the air.\" The crunch came, the paper said, \"when domestic political pressures, exhaustion, an exceptionally tight relationship between the Europeans and environmental groups and simply too much data to sort through in too little time all collided to destroy any environmental detente, at least for now.\" While the Hague negotiations made front page news across Europe for a fortnight, much of the mainstream US news media either downplayed or ignored them altogether. Preoccupied with the US election drama, their lack of coverage reflected widespread public indifference to the challenge of climate change. There were a few honourable exceptions. The Washington Post ran an impassioned opinion piece co-written by Jennifer Morgan, climate campaigner at World Wildlife Fund US, accusing the US government of adopting Orwellian.tactics and \"deceptive accounting\" in its negotiating stance over counting forest cover as carbon sinks. \"Internationally, Kyoto is the only game in town,\" she wrote. \"The next president should wake up, smell the carbon and make the United States a responsible actor in the world.\" The Detroit News, mouthpiece for America's \"motor city\" took the opposite view in a hard-hitting editorial. \"It is imperative that Kyoto not become an excuse to shake down the United States for billions of dollars. If it is fully implemented, an average American family of four would have to absorb an estimated $2,700 in loss of income just for the cost of containing US emissions.\" The paper also challenged the scientific consensus that man-made emissions are causing temperatures to rise: \"Science is no closer to establishing the causes of global warming than it was four years ago when Kyoto was written. It makes sense to wait for more conclusive evidencebefore any expensive commitments are made.\" The rightwing Washington Times ran a similarly hardline editorial last Wednesday (Nov 22) which warned that enforcing the Kyoto treaty \"could cripple the US economy\".

Eco heroine Julia \"Butterfly\" Hill, who spent two years living in a Californian redwood to save it from loggers, told the paper: \"We have to value natural systems.

Thanks to the South African president airing his irrational doubt that HIV causes Aids earlier this year, the world has sat up and once again taken some notice of the appalling progress of this disease. </p> <p>Aids is orphaning children in unprecedented numbers, wrecking lives and unpicking the development gains of a continent. But in the mud clouds stirred up by the Mbeki controversy, it was hard to see clearly where we were with Aids, let alone the road ahead. Now, some months on, before Aids slips once more into the background as just another of those disasters which are impossible to think about and don't affect us in the UK anyway, it is time for some clear and strategic thinking. </p> <p>Fallacy number one is that it doesn't affect us. Most of us don't notice it in our daily lives. There are no more iceberg advertisements on prime time TV. But what we should all know is that the number of HIV infections is soaring here in the UK. Last year 3,300 more people tested positive for the virus. That is more than double the average rate of diagnosis in the 1990s. Within five years, it is expected that 45,000 people in the UK will be HIV positive - half as many again as have the virus now. They won't die within 10 years, which is the fate of an impoverished African, but there is no cure. They will be condemned to a life-preserving cocktail of powerful drugs which at some unpredictable point the virus may mutate to overcome. Aids is held at bay in rich countries like ours - but that is all. </p> <p>Although the UK scenario vanishes in significance when set beside the disaster in sub-Saharan Africa, it is important to remember that Aids has not gone away and that the virus lurks and spreads among us, just as it does in Zambia or Malawi. This sickness is a disaster for every human being on the planet. The global statistics are frightening. Some 3m people died of Aids this year, according to UNAids figures this week, of whom 500,000 were children.</p> <p>The numbers incubating HIV who will probably die of Aids are far, far larger. There are 36.1m living with HIV, of whom 1.4m are children. In some parts of the world, new infections are rising almost off the scale. UNAids talks of \"exponential growth\" in the Russian federation, where 50,000 new infections have been reported in the first nine months of this year. There were only 29,000 registered in the previous 12 years. This massive rise is caused not by heterosexual sex, nor gay sex, but by intravenous drug use, and everybody recognises that the real figures are very much higher even than this, because only a minority of such cases will be reported. </p> <p>Throughout eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc the picture is the same. In the debris left by political and social upheaval, an epidemic of drug abuse and commercial sex has acted as a fast breeder for HIV. At the end of last year there were 420,000 cases in the region. Now the conservative estimate runs at 700,000. </p> <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, where a devastating 25.3m men, women and children are effectively under sentence of death with HIV, there is for the first time a glimmer of light. The number of new infections dropped slightly in 2000 to 3.8m from the 4m of last year. Prevention programmes like Uganda's - a shining light on the continent - may be part of the answer, but it is also true that so many are now infected that there is a smaller and smaller pool of sexually active people to whom they can transmit the virus. </p> <p>The new fear is for Asia. Huge populations are at risk. Unicef, the UN children's fund, fears Asia could eclipse Africa if more is not done to stop the virus spreading. In India, the numbers are thought to be under-reported in a political climate of denial that unsafe and promiscuous sex is rife. China is now seeing a steep rise in sexually transmitted infections, which usually bring HIV infection in their wake. Thailand - Asia's beacon, just as Uganda is Africa's - is showing a worrying increase in HIV infection. A powerful and effective campaign brought condoms to the red light districts, but now it appears the virus has passed out of the world of commercial sex to thrive among pregnant women who have had sex only with their husbands or boyfriends. And the Thai government, proud of its success in tackling HIV, has cut the budget. </p> <p>So much fear and horror can paralyse the best of us. No effort to tackle Aids is going to be big enough. The World Health Organisation has launched an impossibly heroic, all-out drive to slash the numbers of people with HIV and those who die from malaria and TB. It is a call to arms and a call for the wallets of the donor nations, but they are setting targets so daunting that they are hardly credible. </p> <p>Money is certainly needed in unprecedented sums. But the wrangling over what should be done with it does not encourage donors. While UN agencies have prevention at the top of their agenda, through educating people to use condoms and refuse unsafe sex, many of the aid agencies are increasingly calling for treatment. We in the rich countries have antiretroviral drugs. These drugs must be made available to the poor countries at prices they can afford. </p> <p>War has been declared on the multi-national pharmaceutical companies - another heroic struggle. Organisations like Medecins sans Frontieres have got Aids drugs for the developing world onto the agenda. In May, five of the biggest drug companies told the Wall Street Journal that they would slash their prices for poor countries that wished to negotiate a discount. But only Senegal has done so. </p> <p>Even at a discount, these drugs which cost $10,000 a year in the developed world are beyond the reach of countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Some countries like Brazil make generic versions (cheaper copies) but they are not cheap enough and countries that might buy them are afraid of falling foul of international patent law or incurring the wrath of the US which protects drug companies.</p> <p>It is shameful that the oldest drug, AZT, which was patented by Glaxo Wellcome in 1987 (even though most of the research was done by the US National Institutes of Health), should not now be given for free or a pittance to the developing world. It must happen. One really positive step forward has been nevirapine, which is going to be made freely available to prevent mothers transmitting HIV infection to their babies. But drugs are never an answer on their own. There must be masses more money for doctors, nurses and clinics to hand out the drugs and advise and monitor people taking them. Wrong use means the virus will become immune to them. </p> <p>Yes, we need the drugs and the clinics, but we have more hope of getting them if the renewed concern about HIV/Aids in the world can be sustained. We should all be thinking about it. Everyone on the planet needs to remember that sex can deliver HIV/Aids just as easily as it can make a woman pregnant. It is a fact of life, and countries where it is denied, hidden or where women are not given the moral authority to refuse unprotected sex are contributing to a massacre. The one hope on the horizon is a vaccine, but that may be a decade of deaths away. Until then, we all have a problem. </p> <p>Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health editor. <a href=\"mailto:sarah.boseley@theguardian.com\">sarah.boseley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Most importantly, though, it is the insularity that has gone. In our pain, grief and anger during the early part of the epidemic it was sometimes hard to appreciate the impact of Aids elsewhere. World Aids Day is no longer about what happens elsewhere. It happens here, every day and the future of how we respond to HIV is now intimately linked with how Aids moves worldwide, making World Aids Day this year more important than ever. </p>",

The Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse, along with other organisations, aims to campaign to create greater awareness of what living with HIV really means, to tackle the prejudice which sees people sacked for no reason or ostracised from their family, and to provide flexible, needs-driven services. But the stark reality is that HIV is one of the least popular causes to give to or get involved with, yet the help, support and information we all provide is needed more than ever. There is still no cure or vaccine for HIV and it affects some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the UK. Every day we help men, women and children deal with the consequences of this terminal illness. As the full scale of the tragedy unfolding in Africa and Asia has become so terribly apparent - none of us remains untouched by it. Most importantly, though, it is the insularity that has gone. In our pain, grief and anger during the early part of the epidemic it was sometimes hard to appreciate the impact of Aids elsewhere. World Aids Day is no longer about what happens elsewhere. It happens here, every day and the future of how we respond to HIV is now intimately linked with how Aids moves worldwide, making World Aids Day this year more important than ever.",

In the trendiest streets, houses sold for as much as $750,000.</p> <p>Local politicians and real estate groups have hailed this inflation as a sign that America's booming economy - with unemployment at record lows and spending at record highs - had filtered down to an area dogged by crime and poverty for most of the post-war period.</p> <p>For some, however, the rapid rise in the value of local properties appeared at odds with the number of dilapidated buildings left in some of the most expensive areas.</p> <p>Questions were raised about many of the homes bought under government assistance programmes designed to allow local residents or charities to buy crumbling brownstones and renovate them. Many of these homes, about 200 in total, appeared to have been sold on immediately for a much higher price and/or left to rot. In both cases, existing tenants were forced to leave.</p> <p>The Westside SRO Project, a law firm specialising in tenants' rights, was among the first to raise the alarm about the possible abuse of schemes run by the department of housing and urban development (HUD). It is understood that there are three investigations into several professed charities and developers suspected of doing sweetheart deals to drive up prices or of failing to meet the standards designed to help low income households.</p> <p>Matthew Franklin, a senior HUD official, told the New York Times that some non-profit organisations were selling the right to develop homes. \"We have very strong evidence that fraud was perpetrated by non-profits, as well as lenders,\" he said.</p> <p>Terry Poe, an organiser at Westside SRO, suspects that the fraudulent behaviour has artificially inflated house prices in Harlem. \"Real estate brokers saw that things were really hopping in Harlem in the last year or so and came up here,\" he says. \"But in fact, most of the action is going to wind up making no profit for anyone because it was all crooked.\"</p> <p>This week civil charges against a social services group were brought in Brooklyn, a nearby suburb.

Although residents have welcomed the local Disney store, Starbucks coffee house and a $68m Harlem USA shopping mall, some are less than happy with the high prices they charge. Last month over 200 people demonstrated in front of the glitzy mall chanting, \"Harlem is not for sale\".</p> <p>Mr Poe points out that brownstones have traditionally been divided into single room dwellings, which means that between eight and 12 rooms are carved out of the house and made into individual homes. Many of these apartments, with rents typically between $200 and $700 a month, do not have private bathrooms. Once such a property has been developed, rents can be as high as $3,000 per apartment.</p> <p>Such sums are impossible for many local residents to afford. The average household income in central Harlem is significantly less than that enjoyed by the rest of Manhattan.

But the stock market was not impressed and slashed the company's share price by an incredible 40% to a record low of 15p in three hours of trading early this morning. This year's worst performer on the FTSE TechMark 100 index has been forced to seek more cash after admitting it does not have enough in the bank to survive. The need for funding became apparent in the company's second-quarter results, which showed a loss of \u00a366.5m, compared to \u00a311m for the same period last year. QXL said the loss largely stemmed from extra costs relating to the \u00a3347m acquisition of Scandinavian rival Bidlet in March. The company also paid \u00a3668m for German online auctioneer Ricardo in a drawn-out takeover saga. The acquisition that was supposed to turn QXL into a rival to US giant eBay has almost proved to be its undoing. QXL was founded by journalist Tim Jackson three years ago and floated last October. Mr Jackson cashed in and left the company but it was still riding on a crest of optimism and even attracted the services of Mr Scully, veteran presenter of the BBC's Antiques Roadshow. Earlier this year the shares touched \u00a315 but today's spectacular collapse underlines the scale of the dot.com stock market crash. The company today said it will raise \u00a330m thanks to a share and bonds deal with the Credit Suisse First Boston bank, after touring investors over the past month. QXL has around \u00a345m left in the bank, which it claims will not be enough to see it through to profitability. Jim Rose, QXL's 39-year-old chief executive, said: \"QXL's business continues to experience solid growth in the recent quarter. \"We have developed our customer offering, increased our focus on multi-device access to QXL through the PC, mobile telephony and television, and completed significant corporate acquisitions.\" It has been a troublesome year for the company. Second-quarter turnover rose from \u00a31.9m to \u00a35.9m, but the market preferred to focus on the losses.

      "bodyText": "Millions of widows who were misled about their pensions won a multi-billion pound compensation package yesterday when the government bowed to pressure and abandoned an earlier scheme which had been branded as mean-spirited. In a spectacular u-turn, the social security secretary Alistair Darling pledged an extra \u00a34bn to exempt millions from a plan to cut pension payments to widows and widowers. His announcement was welcomed last night by pensioner groups which had campaigned against the initial compensation package for widows who were misled about plans to cut the state earnings related pension scheme. Mr Darling introduced his first compensation package last March after it emerged that pensioners had been misinformed about a Tory scheme to halve the amount of Serps that widows or widowers inherited on the death of their spouse. Up to 20 million people were not told about the Tory scheme which was announced in 1986 and was due to come into force this year. Widows without an occupational or personal pension, who relied on Serps to top up their state pension, could have lost up to \u00a362.50 a week. In his announcement yesterday, Mr Darling pledged an extra \u00a34bn to make three fundamental changes to his initial compensation package. The new scheme will mean that: \u0095 Pensioners will no longer have to prove that they were misled in order to receive compensation. The government's initial scheme, in which pensioners had to demonstrate in an interview that they had been misled, was condemned by a Commons committee last week as an unworkable fiasco which was open to fraud. \u0095 Anyone of pensionable age on October 5 2002 - the day the new scheme comes into force - will be exempt from the changes. Under the governmment's first scheme, existing pensioners would have been affected by the changes from that date; \u0095 A transitional scheme will soften the blow for people who become pensioners after the scheme is introduced. Anyone who becomes a pensioner between 2002-04 will be entitled to 90% of their spouse's Serps. This will decrease to 80% for people who become pensioners between 2004-06 and so on.

It's reasonable enough to expect that there will be quite a lot of information on small business out there if only it can be tracked down; in fact there is, loads. The trouble is sorting out what's genuinely useful from the company sales pitch.</p> <p> Possibly the two best places to start looking for information, then, are the government's own small business site and the independent Federation of Small Business. Cynics expecting New Labour propaganda and not much else from the government's site will be disappointed. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ukonline.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> UK Online for Business</a> contains useful information for businesses which have recently started on the internet, and plans to offer a lot more in terms of how-to guides later this year. The government will help find leads for overseas sales at <a href=\"http://www.tradepartners.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">www.tradepartners.gov.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tradeuk.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">www.tradeuk.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p> The independent sector is rather more unfettered. Groupings of independent business people can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.fsb.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> Federation of Small Business</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.iod.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> Institute of Directors</a>; the sole trader and teleworker is more likely to find items of interest at the <a href=\"http://www.tca.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> Telecottage Association</a>. </p> <p> Sites devoted to SMEs among private companies have proliferated in recent months: the ManageIT pages on www.vnunet.com are as independently and rigorously written as any of VNU's paper magazines, frequently using exclusive content from the company's established roster of experienced writers. Others such as <a href=\"http://www.businesseurope.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> www.businesseurope.com</a> have started as internet-only projects; this one is very new but contains much that should be of interest including a number of basic how-to guides.</p> <p> Some people have a specific service in mind, whether it's an account with free web space or the ability to develop a full-blown electronic commerce site online. <a href=\"http://www.virginbiz.net\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">Virgin Biznet</a> will develop such a site for a sliding scale of charges, as will <a href=\"http://www.sage.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">Sage</a> as long as you're a customer of its accounting systems.</p> <p> Other people prefer to ask specific questions, in which case there are discussion areas devoted to SMEs. Virgin Biznet has been established for a while in this area and <a href=\"http://www.themutual.net\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">Themutual </a> also offers a discussion area. BT has a small business area although its initial branding as Btclickforbusiness has recently been abandoned. </p> <p> The advantage these sites have over ordinary newsgroups is that they tend to be moderated, so the quality of the content is more reliable than it would be on an internet free-for-all. The disadvantage is that a number of similar sites launched at the same time, so competition for participants can be fierce. It's worth knowing about the even more closed areas that have established communities, such as the UKProfessional forum on CompuServe, though you need a CompuServe account: go to <a href=\"http://www.compuserve.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> www.compuserve.co.uk</a> and either download the software or ask for a disk. </p> <p>Likewise the own.business conference on <a href=\"http://www.cix.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> Cix</a> (order a disk and make sure you opt for an account with conferencing) is text only, no pretty pictures, but the signal to noise ratio is very high. AOL has also launched its small business area to complement its personal finance area.</p> <p> Clearly the internet is massive and smaller businesses don't have the luxury of time to trawl through it for the right information or service every time they need something. Sites are launched and shut down every week, but hopefully some of the above will offer a reasonable starting point. The author's own website at <a href=\"http://www.clapperton.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> www.clapperton.co.uk</a> contains links to a number of services for small business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The internet is supposed to be the ultimate repository of free information, and the government and others are making concerted efforts to persuade the small-to-medium enterprise that it really ought to be getting online. It's reasonable enough to expect that there will be quite a lot of information on small business out there if only it can be tracked down; in fact there is, loads. The trouble is sorting out what's genuinely useful from the company sales pitch. Possibly the two best places to start looking for information, then, are the government's own small business site and the independent Federation of Small Business. Cynics expecting New Labour propaganda and not much else from the government's site will be disappointed. UK Online for Business contains useful information for businesses which have recently started on the internet, and plans to offer a lot more in terms of how-to guides later this year. The government will help find leads for overseas sales at www.tradepartners.gov.uk and www.tradeuk.gov.uk. The independent sector is rather more unfettered. Groupings of independent business people can be found at the Federation of Small Business and the Institute of Directors; the sole trader and teleworker is more likely to find items of interest at the Telecottage Association. Sites devoted to SMEs among private companies have proliferated in recent months: the ManageIT pages on www.vnunet.com are as independently and rigorously written as any of VNU's paper magazines, frequently using exclusive content from the company's established roster of experienced writers. Others such as www.businesseurope.com have started as internet-only projects; this one is very new but contains much that should be of interest including a number of basic how-to guides. Some people have a specific service in mind, whether it's an account with free web space or the ability to develop a full-blown electronic commerce site online. Virgin Biznet will develop such a site for a sliding scale of charges, as will Sage as long as you're a customer of its accounting systems. Other people prefer to ask specific questions, in which case there are discussion areas devoted to SMEs. Virgin Biznet has been established for a while in this area and Themutual also offers a discussion area. BT has a small business area although its initial branding as Btclickforbusiness has recently been abandoned. The advantage these sites have over ordinary newsgroups is that they tend to be moderated, so the quality of the content is more reliable than it would be on an internet free-for-all. The disadvantage is that a number of similar sites launched at the same time, so competition for participants can be fierce. It's worth knowing about the even more closed areas that have established communities, such as the UKProfessional forum on CompuServe, though you need a CompuServe account: go to www.compuserve.co.uk and either download the software or ask for a disk. Likewise the own.business conference on Cix (order a disk and make sure you opt for an account with conferencing) is text only, no pretty pictures, but the signal to noise ratio is very high. AOL has also launched its small business area to complement its personal finance area. Clearly the internet is massive and smaller businesses don't have the luxury of time to trawl through it for the right information or service every time they need something. Sites are launched and shut down every week, but hopefully some of the above will offer a reasonable starting point. The author's own website at www.clapperton.co.uk contains links to a number of services for small business.",

But don't bother with this last scheme if you're planning to start a business in one of the established high-tech growth areas of Cambridge, Reading or Basingstoke. \"They will focus on areas outside the London, south-east and east England regions,\" warned Lord Sainsbury.

That's why he thinks business people would be happy to go to a neutral call centre, offering advice about a variety of services.</p> <p> Is that what's on the way?

Despite Mr Sharon's protests, it is far from certain whether Mr Barak can reach a deal with the Palestinians after so much blood has been spilled. Even before the start of the Palestinian uprising, Mr Barak and Mr Arafat viewed each other with loathing. Mr Arafat may not be inclined to ride to Mr Barak's rescue just to stop a rightwing opponent from coming to power. \"We signed agreements with Israeli governments, not Israeli parties,\" said Nabil Abu Rudeinah,a senior Arafat adviser. \"We hope we will see an Israeli government committed to the peace process, and to implement signed agreements.\" Useful links Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office",

When Mr Bush began his campaign for the presidency more than 18 months ago, he consciously dissociated himself from former president George Bush.</p> <p>\"He's not the candidate, I am,\" the Texas governor insisted when he announced the formation of his exploratory committee in March last year. \"America will know that it's George W Bush that's going to be the president.\"</p> <p>Now, as he inches towards the Oval Office his father occupied between 1989 and 1993, he is relying more than ever on daddy's team. In the increasingly dynastic culture of American politics, a new Bush administration is beginning to look uncommonly like a restoration presidency.</p> <p>Mr Bush's parents try resolutely to stay out of the spotlight but, as the former president said yesterday in a television interview in Florida: \"We're sitting on the sidelines, but we're in the game.\"</p> <p>The influence of Mr Bush Sr is strong enough for the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd to dub the son \"President-elect Mini-Me\", after the cloned villain of the Austin Powers movies.</p> <p>One of the most striking examples of the continuity from the old regime is the central role being played by the putative vice-president, Dick Cheney.</p> <p>Mr Cheney is not the traditional seen-but-not-heard running mate: on the contrary, he is the running mate who is actually running things.Mr Cheney, who was defence secretary in the earlier Bush administration, is chairing the transition team: its offices are temporarily housed just down the road from his Virginia home. It is Mr Cheney, who was in hospital with a heart attack only last week, who has been given the job of gathering the key players together.</p> <p>While Mr Cheney closes in on Washington, George W has disappeared once again to his west Texas ranch near Waco for the rest of the week.</p> <p>\"The grown-ups keep sending him off to play,\" Dowd wrote yesterday.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush, the man on the threshold of the White House, may belong to a new generation of Republicans, and may promise a fresh start for America, but the men and women at his side are overwhelmingly veterans of his father's presidency. It was not supposed to be like that. When Mr Bush began his campaign for the presidency more than 18 months ago, he consciously dissociated himself from former president George Bush. \"He's not the candidate, I am,\" the Texas governor insisted when he announced the formation of his exploratory committee in March last year. \"America will know that it's George W Bush that's going to be the president.\" Now, as he inches towards the Oval Office his father occupied between 1989 and 1993, he is relying more than ever on daddy's team. In the increasingly dynastic culture of American politics, a new Bush administration is beginning to look uncommonly like a restoration presidency. Mr Bush's parents try resolutely to stay out of the spotlight but, as the former president said yesterday in a television interview in Florida: \"We're sitting on the sidelines, but we're in the game.\" The influence of Mr Bush Sr is strong enough for the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd to dub the son \"President-elect Mini-Me\", after the cloned villain of the Austin Powers movies. One of the most striking examples of the continuity from the old regime is the central role being played by the putative vice-president, Dick Cheney. Mr Cheney is not the traditional seen-but-not-heard running mate: on the contrary, he is the running mate who is actually running things.Mr Cheney, who was defence secretary in the earlier Bush administration, is chairing the transition team: its offices are temporarily housed just down the road from his Virginia home. It is Mr Cheney, who was in hospital with a heart attack only last week, who has been given the job of gathering the key players together. While Mr Cheney closes in on Washington, George W has disappeared once again to his west Texas ranch near Waco for the rest of the week. \"The grown-ups keep sending him off to play,\" Dowd wrote yesterday. But Mr Cheney is among old and familiar friends. At his side is Andrew Card, designated White House chief of staff earlier this week. Mr Card was deputy chief of staff to John Sununu in former president Bush's administration, and then transportation secretary. Heading the campaign effort in Florida was, and is, James Baker, campaign manager for Mr Bush Sr's unsuccessful White House candidacy in 1980 and then secretary of state from 1989 to 1992, before being put in charge of the doomed effort to prevent Bill Clinton capturing the White House in 1992. According to Bush campaign sources, the next two significant appointments are likely to be every bit as familiar. As his secretary of state, Mr Bush is likely to appoint General Colin Powell, who was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under his father. And his national security adviser is expected to be Condoleezza Rice, the Mr Bush Sr's chief Russia specialist. A top economic job is likely to go to Larry Lindsey, a special presidential assistant for policy development in the previous Bush administration.Mr Cheney denies that the team is too reliant on the past. \"The fact is, we're looking for experienced people,\" he said yesterday. \"We welcome folks regardless of what prior administration they might have been affiliated with.\"",

      "bodyText": "The embattled Railtrack board is on the offensive against the government, saying it will not tolerate interference from ministers or regulators in the selection of its new chairman, it emerged last night. In an unprecedented letter to ministers and in a clear snub to John Prescott, Sir Philip Beck, who is to step down as chairman next year, spelled out the appointment procedure. It states: \"The appointment is not subject to any external approval.\" Never before has a listed company felt compelled to complain to ministers about the pressure to which it has been subjected from Whitehall. This pressure started after the Paddington rail crash last year when both Tony Blair and his deputy, Mr Prescott, made it clear they wanted the scalp of Gerald Corbett, then Railtrack's chief executive. In the wake of the Hatfield crash and Mr Corbett's subsequent resignation, there had been mounting speculation that the government would seek to influence the selection of the new chairman. There is understood to be particular concern in Whitehall that the Railtrack board immediately appointed the group's finance chief, accountant Steven Marshall, to take over from Mr Corbett. Gwyneth Dunwoody, the Labour chairwoman of the transport select committee, has been highly critical of Mr Marshall's appointment, pointing out a dearth of experienced railmen in the Railtrack boardroom. Sir Philip has also been widely criticised for his low profile as the crisis of confidence in the rail network has mounted. Industry sources also revealed last night that the government has been waging a subtle campaign to remove Mr Marshall. Potential candidates for a successor are being drawn up with the government's knowledge, although ministers have no right to interfere in the activities of a private company -even though it is being supported by the taxpayer. Last week Sir Alastair Morton, the chairman of the shadow strategic rail authority, met Sir Philip and Mr Marshall. The SSRA has quietly made it clear that it was not happy with the Corbett and Beck regime and sources close to the authority say Sir Alastair has been asked by Mr Prescott to ensure that Railtrack recruits the right person as its next chairman. Several high-profile names have already been linked with the job, including David James, a troubleshooter drafted in to oversee the final months of the Millennium Dome project, and the Conservative's London mayoral candidate, Steve Norris. David Varney, the former boss of British Gas and now head of the New Deal London taskforce, has also been named as a potential chairman. Mr Varney has close links with the Labour party. Another named candidate is Christopher Garnett, brother of Virginia Bottomley and chief executive of Great North Eastern Railway. Mr Norris, a former Tory transport minister and a member of Transport for London, the body set up to oversee plans for the capital's transport system, has already confirmed that he would be interested in the job. Mr James has only pointed out that he is unavailable until next year (when the Railtrack job becomes vacant). But the letter being circulated by Sir Philip insists that Railtrack is determined to select its own chairman in the same way as any other public company. It says headhunters have been appointed to find candidates and that a shortlist will be passed to the Railtrack board's nominations committee. This is a three-strong panel of non-executive directors chaired by Jonathan Bloomer, the chief executive of the Prudential insurance group. They will assess the candidates and their recommendation will then be put to the whole board for approval. The letter adds that this procedure is in line with standard corporate practice and that the company's stakeholders will be kept informed \"at the appropriate time\". A spokesman for Railtrack admitted last night that Sir Philip's letter was an unusual move, but he said: \"These are unusual times.\" He added that the selection procedure had already started and that the company had decided it was time for an \"injection of clarity\" to point out that it was down to Railtrack to decide who would become its next chairman. Sir Philip has not been regarded as a successful chairman, leaving Mr Corbett alone to face the music too frequently.",

The damage is usually so obvious that it is quickly spotted and repaired. </p> <p>Last week Unity, one of the Arab-Islamic groups involved in the cyber-war, circulated an email announcing that the Israel Institute of Technology's website had been defaced with a message saying: \"Leave Jerusalem... or better, drop dead!\" </p> <p>By the time the email arrived, the website was back to normal, and as proof of the exploit, Unity had to rely on pointing to a mirror copy of the offending page. </p> <p>The other type of attack, known as \"denial of service\", overloads a server - usually by bombarding it with emails or pings.

But the more they are publicised, the more likely it is that the host ISP will find out and remove them. </p> <p>This happened to one attack site hosted by Tripod. Last week it had been replaced by a message saying it was unavailable because the subscriber \"may have posted content in violation of the Tripod Terms of Service\". </p> <p>Unity's attack page still survives - possibly because it is difficult to find and can only be reached by redirection from another site. Visitors are invited to \"defend the Resistance\" by attacking groups of \"Zionist websites\" which include the Israeli defence forces, the prime minister's office, the Bank of Israel and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. </p> <p>\"One small windows will be opened for each link you click, and all what you have to do is not to close them as long you are on net, the program will be automatically work,\" it says, with scant regard for grammar. </p> <p>Trying this for a few seconds - purely in the interests of research - I found that my hard drive whirred madly, and I was struck by the frightening thought that anyone who joins in this kind of attack is taking a lot on trust. How could I be sure that Israeli hackers had not broken into the Unity site and replaced its attack software with some horrible bug that could, at this very moment, be scrambling my own hard drive? </p> <p>In reality, there is no evidence that these crude attacks have so far caused lasting damage. Israeli internet services may well be made more resilient as a result, and the companies that advise on defensive systems will get richer. </p> <p>But a more sophisticated attack hit the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group. </p> <p>The attacker, \"Doctor Nuker, founder of the Pakistan Hackerz Club\", not only defaced the site, but also downloaded the credit card details of 700 people - including a Republican senator - who had subscribed to AIPAC via the internet. The FBI advised them all to cancel their cards and monitor transactions. </p> <p>The Pakistan Hackerz Club had previously concentrated its efforts on defacing Indian websites, in support of Kashmir separatism. </p> <p>Opinions on the ethics of cyber-war range from \"cool\" to \"criminal\". Some see it as a legitimate form of political protest - \"hacktivism\" - while others regard it as vandalism, or worse. </p> <p>At one level, shutting down an \"enemy\" website can be considered a suppression of free speech - the electronic equivalent of book burning. It conflicts with the spirit of the internet, which is to let everyone have their say. </p> <p> In the crude form that it takes in the Middle East conflict, there is no sign that it is doing much to advance the cause of either side, though it does give some people a sense of participation and conceivably diverts them from more violent activity. </p> <p>We have yet to see the full weight of a government's resources deployed in a cyber-attack. Earlier this month there were reports that the Pentagon had considered bringing down Serbia's financial systems during the Kosovo conflict. </p> <p>It is said to have backed off, partly because of doubts about international law, and partly because of fears that such weapons, if used, could easily be adopted by America's enemies. </p> <p>On the other hand, an effective cyber-attack might have ended the war more quickly, with fewer lives lost.</p>",

Visitors are invited to \"defend the Resistance\" by attacking groups of \"Zionist websites\" which include the Israeli defence forces, the prime minister's office, the Bank of Israel and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. \"One small windows will be opened for each link you click, and all what you have to do is not to close them as long you are on net, the program will be automatically work,\" it says, with scant regard for grammar. Trying this for a few seconds - purely in the interests of research - I found that my hard drive whirred madly, and I was struck by the frightening thought that anyone who joins in this kind of attack is taking a lot on trust. How could I be sure that Israeli hackers had not broken into the Unity site and replaced its attack software with some horrible bug that could, at this very moment, be scrambling my own hard drive? In reality, there is no evidence that these crude attacks have so far caused lasting damage. Israeli internet services may well be made more resilient as a result, and the companies that advise on defensive systems will get richer. But a more sophisticated attack hit the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group. The attacker, \"Doctor Nuker, founder of the Pakistan Hackerz Club\", not only defaced the site, but also downloaded the credit card details of 700 people - including a Republican senator - who had subscribed to AIPAC via the internet. The FBI advised them all to cancel their cards and monitor transactions. The Pakistan Hackerz Club had previously concentrated its efforts on defacing Indian websites, in support of Kashmir separatism. Opinions on the ethics of cyber-war range from \"cool\" to \"criminal\". Some see it as a legitimate form of political protest - \"hacktivism\" - while others regard it as vandalism, or worse. At one level, shutting down an \"enemy\" website can be considered a suppression of free speech - the electronic equivalent of book burning. It conflicts with the spirit of the internet, which is to let everyone have their say. In the crude form that it takes in the Middle East conflict, there is no sign that it is doing much to advance the cause of either side, though it does give some people a sense of participation and conceivably diverts them from more violent activity. We have yet to see the full weight of a government's resources deployed in a cyber-attack. Earlier this month there were reports that the Pentagon had considered bringing down Serbia's financial systems during the Kosovo conflict. It is said to have backed off, partly because of doubts about international law, and partly because of fears that such weapons, if used, could easily be adopted by America's enemies. On the other hand, an effective cyber-attack might have ended the war more quickly, with fewer lives lost.",

      "bodyText": "An army whistleblower who has become the key witness in a police inquiry into collusion between the military and loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland will not be prosecuted for breaking the Official Secrets Act, the Guardian can reveal. The soldier, known by the pseudonym Martin Ingram, was charged under the act following a series of articles in a national newspaper which revealed the activities of a covert army intelligence cell, the force research unit (FRU), during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Ingram's allegations made him an invaluable witness for an investigation led by Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, who began an inquiry into collusion last year, focusing on the murder of the solicitor Pat Finucane. But Ingram's allegations also infuriated the Ministry of Defence, which sought and won gagging orders on the Sunday Times newspaper. While Sir John's team investigated Ingram's claims, Scotland Yard's special branch began its own inquiry into a man it believed to be Ingram. Security sources told the Guardian yesterday that the investigation had been halted and the charges against the former FRU soldier had been dropped. The police are also believed to have dropped their investigation into Liam Clarke, Northern Ireland editor of the Sunday Times. Ingram has said a military intelligence breaking and entry team tried to destroy evidence of FRU collusion by burning a Northern Ireland office used by Sir John's team. Fire broke out hours before the team planned to arrest Brian Nelson, paid by the army while also acting as intelligence officer for the Ulster Defence Association, and implicated in the unresolved murder of Mr Finucane. Ingram also claims that at least one soldier was killed because army handlers of an IRA quartermaster in Derry refused to sabotage weapons, fearing it would compromise him. The IRA later discovered his double life, and murdered him. The soldier accused of being Ingram has had his house burgled. A manuscript of a book he was writing went missing. The manuscript turned up a few days later in the hands of the prosecution at a court hearing when government lawyers obtained an injunction preventing him from publishing his book. Last night, the crown prosecution service said the police had conducted a \"thorough investigation\" into disclosures in the Sunday Times last year. It said that after carefully considering the matter it had decided there was insufficient evidence to provide a \"realistic prospect of prosecution of either of the individuals\" concerned.",

Railtrack last night estimated the cost of repairs could top \u00a3750,000, before compensation for passengers. In extensive repair work, four miles of sleepers will have to be relaid, and services for the town may be disrupted for a fortnight.</p> <p>Environment agency staff were called to the scene of the 2.30am Bristol derailment after diesel from the coal train's engine spilled into a stream.

      "bodyText": "Railtrack was last night carrying out emergency repair work at Northampton and Bristol after the derailment of two freight trains, causing widespread inconvenience to thousands of passengers. The most serious incident happened at Northampton in the early hours of yesterday morning and involved two wagons leaving the tracks. Railtrack last night estimated the cost of repairs could top \u00a3750,000, before compensation for passengers. In extensive repair work, four miles of sleepers will have to be relaid, and services for the town may be disrupted for a fortnight. Environment agency staff were called to the scene of the 2.30am Bristol derailment after diesel from the coal train's engine spilled into a stream. More than 1,000 litres of fuel polluted a brook and lake. Railtrack announced that limited services for peak time trains could begin tomorrow at Northampton. Work on the task of moving the two damaged wagons from the goods train of 27 wagons which, after the incident, was blocking the south entrance to Northampton station, began soon after 1.30am yesterday. Hydraulic lifts were used to carry out the work, which was complicated by the position of the trucks on a viaduct. Railtrack said that one of the wagons came off the rails four miles south of Northampton. The train had been travelling at 20 mph, but the driver was initially unaware of the problem due to the size of the train, which was more than a quarter of a mile long. The train had freight containers and flasks, some of which were marked \"hazardous substances''. Mr Dawson said initial investigations ruled out gauge corner cracking, the problem at the centre of the Hatfield crash last month; the likely cause was a broken sleeper. Northampton is on a branch line of the west coast main line, and is served by 71 trains each day, now working on an emergency timetable. Steve Brook, of the environment agency, said that it was too early to assess the impact the diesel spilled at the Filton junction in Bristol would have on the environment but that already some birds had been affected. The priority, he said, was to remove as much diesel as possible and keep damage to a minimum. The rail freight company, English, Welsh and Scottish Railways, yesterday said that the Bristol derailment probably had been caused by safety mechanisms activated after the train passed a red signal. Initial inquiries showed that the \"catch-point\" system automatically derailed the train to prevent it carrying on into further danger.",

      "bodyText": "Judges at the Lockerbie trial yesterday dismissed a defence motion to have the case against one of the Libyans accused of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 thrown out. Richard Keen QC, counsel for Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, had argued for the case against his client to be dropped on the basis that there was not enough evidence to sustain the charges. But the presiding judge, Lord Sutherland, said: \"We are not satisfied there is no case to answer.\" The judges' decision was welcomed by the families of those who died in the 1988 bombing. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was on board, said the ruling meant there would be a more thorough examination of the circumstances which led to the bombing. \"We didn't come here looking for convictions or acquittals. We came expecting the court to decide ... and to get to the truth,\" he said. Lawyers for Fhimah and the co-accused, Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, will begin the defence case when the \u00a32m-a-month trial at the Scottish court in the Netherlands reconvenes on Tuesday. Both men deny charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and a breach of the Aviation Security Act. They have lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming various Palestinian terrorist groups - including the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command - for the bombing. Mr Keen had moved to have the case against his client thrown out on the basis that there was no forensic evidence, and all other evidence presented by the prosecution was purely circumstantial. Prosecution lawyers agreed there was no direct evidence, but argued that, when the circumstantial evidence was looked at as a whole, it was enough to infer Fhimah's guilt. Although many of the prosecution's star witnesses have appeared to crumble under cross examination, yesterday's decision by the judges was not based on the credibility of the evidence produced in court. A key part of the prosecution's case against Fhimah is a diary entry, dated six days before the bombing, which refers to obtaining luggage security tags from Air Malta. The prosecution alleges that the bomb which blew up flight 103 was planted on an Air Malta plane at Luqa airport, before it was transferred to the New York bound jumbo at Frankfurt. Fhimah worked as station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines at Luqa airport and the prosecution claims this was a front for his work with the Libyan intelligence agency, the JSO. Although Fhimah had given up his job at the airport before the bombing, he kept his security pass. The prosecution says this was to allow Fhimah access to the Air Malta luggage tags. A Libyan double agent, Majid Giaka, who defected to the US in 1991, also claimed he had watched Fhimah take a case, similar to the one prosecutors say housed the Lockerbie bomb, unchecked through customs at Luqa airport. Mr Keen argued that these claims alone were not enough to warrant the continuation of the case against his client. The judges, however, disagreed. \"We have regard in particular to certain entries in the second accused's [Fhimah's] diary, his association with the first accused with whom he is charged with acting in concert and crucially the evidence of Giaka,\" he said. The judges' rejection of the defence submission will have no effect on the trial outcome. Yesterday they considered only the quantity of the evidence; when they come to their verdict they will also consider its quality.",

He may also, looking at last week's byelection results, have begun to think in terms of five more grinding, squabbling years in continuing opposition. It is traditional in politics for talented people to deny any aspirations to lead their parties. This time, though, the disavowal could turn out to be real.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Email facts</strong><br> The Financial Times has recently reported on a survey conducted in the US, which concluded that: \"The internet has become the fastest growing electronic business tool.\" </p> <p>Approximately 4,000bn emails are sent each year in the US compared to 101bn pieces of paper. 83% of companies with an annual turnover of \u00a31-5m do not display their company logo on emails </p> <p> How many emails do you receive on average a day? How many do you send out? Five, 25, 50? Either way you probably spend more time using email for your business communications than the telephone, and you are not alone. One in 10 of us sends more than 20 emails every day and 97% of UK service industries use email more than any other form of communication. </p> <p>Billions of pounds are spent each year on brand building, yet the emails you receive and probably the ones you send rarely have the company's address on it, let alone a logo or slogan and are usually bland black on white. </p> <p>In a world where branding is so important to distinguish one company, product or service from another and where even IT managers bang on about it, isn't it remarkable that 100 million blank emails are sent every 24 hours? </p> <p>Companies pay out up to 13.3% of their annual spend on marketing. We are deluged with brands everywhere we go from the moment we open our eyes to the moment we go to sleep - in fact, on average we are exposed to more than 3,000 brands every day. </p> <p>Yet companies are really missing a trick when it comes to email - they are sent and received without any branding whatsoever and are totally indistinguishable from each other. Ask yourself this question: Would you ever send an official business letter or fax on plain white paper? </p> <p>We live in a clustered world. When we go to meetings we hand out business cards. We still send letters; faxes; we produce corporate brochures; we send press releases. The volume of printed material available is astounding, yet much of it has yet to be transferred for use in the electronic world, a world in which we are communicating more and more. </p> <p>Whether you like it or not, email is taking over from traditional communication. To prove this you only have to look at the penetration of other forms of communication. It took 40 years for radio to have 10 million users and television 15 years to reach critical mass; a long time compared to services like Hotmail, which registered 10 million users in less than a year - with no advertising. The trend can only continue. </p> <p>However, email as it stands is highly under-utilised. It is commonly used for sending short messages about meetings and attaching documents rather than printing and faxing them. </p> <p>Some more advanced users use the \"reply to\" feature to comment on the message they have received, thereby increasing the speed of dialogue. </p> <p>Email in business is about rapid communication with multiple people. It is about keeping everybody informed about what is going on and documenting decisions. Bill Gates was famous for running Microsoft by email. It worked for him because he was not scared to share information with the whole organisation. </p> <p>It also worked because he documented the decision flow and he was not scared to be in control of the communication. </p> <p>The key to making email your most effective communication tool is simple - follow these rules: </p> <p>\u0095 Do not beat about the bush. </p> <p>\u0095 Do not think of email as a quick informal note. Instead, remember that it is not only a written record of what you are saying, but is likely to be broadcasted to more people that you have initially addressed. </p> <p>\u0095 Use email as a call to action. Ask for a response or use questions to be in control and have the recipient work for you. </p> <p>\u0095 Paste your entire message in the main email box to make it easier for users to get to your message quickly, ie don't use attachments. </p> <p>Email can also be used to market your company cost effectively, both to existing and new customers. Businesses spend most of their money on winning customers by communicating the benefits of being a customer. This is communicating their brand. To keep customers, and stay in business, it is vital to remind them why they first became a customer. </p> <p>Including your brand in their emails is just one simple way of communicating this. Hence branded email can build customer loyalty. </p> <p> Email can also be used for business development. Everybody forwards emails for one reason or another on a regular basis. If your emails are forwarded and they are branded then your company will benefit from increased awareness. </p> <p>Traditional sales techniques benefit tremendously from email, due to its personal nature and ability to reach the recipient quickly. </p> <p>Everybody knows that the best way to get new customers is to be referred. The traditional way of doing this is to ask your current customers who else they think will benefit from your services and obtain their contact details. </p> <p>Asking the question in an email is not only less embarrassing, but you can also get your customer to send a quick note to the prospect and copy you in. Hence the speed and the confidence of the introduction is greater. </p> <p>Using branded emails in the communication helps enforce even greater professionalism. It can increase the effectiveness of a direct marketing campaign as you get a 45% better response rate. </p> <p>Again this is about showing more efficiently what your company stands for. </p> <p>Your logo says a lot about your business. </p> <p>\u0095 Louis Halpern is chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://www.edesigns.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">edesigns.co.uk</a>.</p>",

The volume of printed material available is astounding, yet much of it has yet to be transferred for use in the electronic world, a world in which we are communicating more and more. Whether you like it or not, email is taking over from traditional communication. To prove this you only have to look at the penetration of other forms of communication. It took 40 years for radio to have 10 million users and television 15 years to reach critical mass; a long time compared to services like Hotmail, which registered 10 million users in less than a year - with no advertising. The trend can only continue. However, email as it stands is highly under-utilised. It is commonly used for sending short messages about meetings and attaching documents rather than printing and faxing them. Some more advanced users use the \"reply to\" feature to comment on the message they have received, thereby increasing the speed of dialogue. Email in business is about rapid communication with multiple people. It is about keeping everybody informed about what is going on and documenting decisions. Bill Gates was famous for running Microsoft by email. It worked for him because he was not scared to share information with the whole organisation. It also worked because he documented the decision flow and he was not scared to be in control of the communication. The key to making email your most effective communication tool is simple - follow these rules: \u0095 Do not beat about the bush. \u0095 Do not think of email as a quick informal note. Instead, remember that it is not only a written record of what you are saying, but is likely to be broadcasted to more people that you have initially addressed. \u0095 Use email as a call to action. Ask for a response or use questions to be in control and have the recipient work for you. \u0095 Paste your entire message in the main email box to make it easier for users to get to your message quickly, ie don't use attachments. Email can also be used to market your company cost effectively, both to existing and new customers. Businesses spend most of their money on winning customers by communicating the benefits of being a customer. This is communicating their brand. To keep customers, and stay in business, it is vital to remind them why they first became a customer. Including your brand in their emails is just one simple way of communicating this. Hence branded email can build customer loyalty. Email can also be used for business development. Everybody forwards emails for one reason or another on a regular basis. If your emails are forwarded and they are branded then your company will benefit from increased awareness. Traditional sales techniques benefit tremendously from email, due to its personal nature and ability to reach the recipient quickly. Everybody knows that the best way to get new customers is to be referred. The traditional way of doing this is to ask your current customers who else they think will benefit from your services and obtain their contact details. Asking the question in an email is not only less embarrassing, but you can also get your customer to send a quick note to the prospect and copy you in. Hence the speed and the confidence of the introduction is greater. Using branded emails in the communication helps enforce even greater professionalism. It can increase the effectiveness of a direct marketing campaign as you get a 45% better response rate. Again this is about showing more efficiently what your company stands for. Your logo says a lot about your business. \u0095 Louis Halpern is chief executive officer of edesigns.co.uk.",

The diamond draws heat from even the fastest silicon chip, preventing overheating and helping supercomputers carry out cool calculations. The industry is also looking at building transistors and diodes from diamond that could work at extremely high temperatures or in radioactive environments for military and space applications, where conventional semiconductors might simply burn out. </p> <p>\"This is why the US Department of Defence has funded a lot of diamond research,\" explains Robert Hamers of the University of Wisconsin whose team is at the forefront of modifying the surface of diamonds. </p> <p>Silicon is widely used in microelectronics because it is cheap. But for biochemical sensors, diamonds, being more chemically robust ,will probably be preferable to silicon, says Hamers. Attaching biological molecules and knowing where they are on the gene chip would be easier than with silicon. A diamond \"gene chip\" for biotechnology could detect, sample and sequence huge amounts of DNA. </p> <p>But, for these applications the chemists need to be able to change the surface features more than a scrub and polish will allow. While diamond is essentially a block of pure carbon, the surface carbon atoms are \"tied off\" with a hydrogen atom at the very point the crystal is formed. A layer of hydrogen though is not much use in terms of creating a useful device such as a transistor or a chemical sensor. So, chemists are looking at how to change a diamond's coat. </p> <p>\"Hydrogen-coated diamond is very unreactive and therefore difficult to modify,\" says Douglas Doren, of the University of Delaware, \"but bare diamond surfaces are very reactive.\" Hamers and colleagues Jennifer Hovis and Sarah Coulter are now working with colleagues at GE Corp in Schenectady, New York, and at the Naval Research Laboratory, in Washington DC. They have found they can strip a diamond of its hydrogen coat by blasting it at 1,600 degrees in a vacuum. When they then pump cyclopentene - molecules of five carbon atoms in a ring - into the vacuum, they attach themselves to the diamond's surface. </p> <p>The result is millions upon millions of cyclopentene rings linked up with the unstoppered ends of the carbon atoms on the diamond's surface like so many tiny fins jutting out across the surface. Stanford University's George Wang and Stacey Bent also working with the NRL and GE Corp have found they could similarly add another molecule, 1,3-butadiene, to the surface of diamond to make what look like six-carbon 'fins' on the diamond's surface. Both reactions mean it should be possible to attach other chemical groups, such as DNA or polymer chains, to a diamond. </p> <p>\"We have been working on attaching amines [NH2 groups] and then using these to attach DNA,\" explains Hamers. \"The basic idea is to attach single-stranded DNA to the surface, and then to try to detect when this DNA interacts with its complementary strand in solution making the familiar double helix.\" </p> <p>By doing this on diamond, it should be possible to make a direct electronic detector for DNA - rather like the \"tri-corder\" in Star Trek, he says. To try and explain what happens during these diamond reactions, Doren and Danesha Fitzgerald have used computational chemistry to model the way the molecules interact with the diamond surface. They have shown that the addition reactions work because pairs of carbon atoms on the naked surface of the diamond act as if they are themselves individual molecules. Doren adds that there have been several proposals for what to add to the diamond's surface including adding fluorine-containing water-proof and lubricating molecules to the surface of diamonds, giving them what amounts to a Teflon coat. Such materials could be used to build the components of new micromachines, such as cogs, pistons and pumps, for building near-microscopic robots. </p> <p> However, Fitzgerald and Doren's calculations show there might be lots of side-products in these reactions. This is something the experimentalists could not spot with the analytical techniques used. Nevertheless, the next step is to cover a diamond layer with a molecule, such as cyclopentene, then find ways to attach other molecules to these appendages. While the chemists might worry about how easy that will be, one wouldn't care to guess what Ms Monroe would have thought of them messing with her best friend. </p> <p>* Details of the studies are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.</p>",

A layer of hydrogen though is not much use in terms of creating a useful device such as a transistor or a chemical sensor. So, chemists are looking at how to change a diamond's coat. \"Hydrogen-coated diamond is very unreactive and therefore difficult to modify,\" says Douglas Doren, of the University of Delaware, \"but bare diamond surfaces are very reactive.\" Hamers and colleagues Jennifer Hovis and Sarah Coulter are now working with colleagues at GE Corp in Schenectady, New York, and at the Naval Research Laboratory, in Washington DC. They have found they can strip a diamond of its hydrogen coat by blasting it at 1,600 degrees in a vacuum. When they then pump cyclopentene - molecules of five carbon atoms in a ring - into the vacuum, they attach themselves to the diamond's surface. The result is millions upon millions of cyclopentene rings linked up with the unstoppered ends of the carbon atoms on the diamond's surface like so many tiny fins jutting out across the surface. Stanford University's George Wang and Stacey Bent also working with the NRL and GE Corp have found they could similarly add another molecule, 1,3-butadiene, to the surface of diamond to make what look like six-carbon 'fins' on the diamond's surface. Both reactions mean it should be possible to attach other chemical groups, such as DNA or polymer chains, to a diamond. \"We have been working on attaching amines [NH2 groups] and then using these to attach DNA,\" explains Hamers. \"The basic idea is to attach single-stranded DNA to the surface, and then to try to detect when this DNA interacts with its complementary strand in solution making the familiar double helix.\" By doing this on diamond, it should be possible to make a direct electronic detector for DNA - rather like the \"tri-corder\" in Star Trek, he says. To try and explain what happens during these diamond reactions, Doren and Danesha Fitzgerald have used computational chemistry to model the way the molecules interact with the diamond surface. They have shown that the addition reactions work because pairs of carbon atoms on the naked surface of the diamond act as if they are themselves individual molecules. Doren adds that there have been several proposals for what to add to the diamond's surface including adding fluorine-containing water-proof and lubricating molecules to the surface of diamonds, giving them what amounts to a Teflon coat. Such materials could be used to build the components of new micromachines, such as cogs, pistons and pumps, for building near-microscopic robots. However, Fitzgerald and Doren's calculations show there might be lots of side-products in these reactions. This is something the experimentalists could not spot with the analytical techniques used. Nevertheless, the next step is to cover a diamond layer with a molecule, such as cyclopentene, then find ways to attach other molecules to these appendages. While the chemists might worry about how easy that will be, one wouldn't care to guess what Ms Monroe would have thought of them messing with her best friend. * Details of the studies are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.",

      "body": "<p>PC buyers have never had it so good. It is hard to find a home PC that will not do a decent job of running Microsoft Office and browsing the web, no matter how little you pay. However, buying purely on price can be a recipe for disaster. In the long run, it is better to go for a machine that has been well put together out of quality components, with a specification high enough to last a few years. </p> <p>There is a myth that all PCs are the same. They are not. What is true is that it can be hard to tell a good PC from a bad one unless you test-drive it for a few weeks. Since you cannot do that, concentrate on getting good components in a machine from a name-brand supplier such as Dan, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, or IBM. (This is not a complete list.) </p> <p>In the UK, Compaq and Dell are by far the market leaders, according to Gartner Dataquest figures for this year's third quarter. Both companies shipped more than 260,000 PCs, and each took 17% of the market. </p> <p>Hewlett-Packard was in third place with 7%, selling 112,000 of the more than 1.5 million personal computers sold here. </p> <p><strong> Processor</strong><br> The processor is the \"engine\" that runs the PC, so you might think it the most important element in buying one. It isn't. Basically, anything with a speed of 500MHz or (preferably) more will do. Intel Celeron chips are a good choice for budget buyers, but the Pentium III is the best mainstream choice. </p> <p>Even then, it is not worth paying much of a premium for anything faster than about 733MHz unless you need a high-end machine to run games. If that is the case, you might consider an AMD Athlon processor or even the new Intel Pentium 4. </p> <p><strong> Memory</strong><br> If your budget means choosing between a faster processor and more memory, go for more memory. For running programs, today's minimum is 64 megabytes, but 128MB is better, and 256MB is common for high-end users. Make sure the PC has an empty slot to which you can add an extra memory module later. </p> <p>But \"main memory\" is not the whole story. It also helps to have lots of \"cache Ram\" and \"video Ram\" (VRam). </p> <p>Level 2 (L2) cache memory is where the PC stores instructions before they are fed to the processor, and it has a critical effect on performance. Video Ram (VRam) is where the screen image is stored, and more graphics memory means you can have more pixels on the screen (higher resolution) in more colours. Graphics cards with 8MB or 16MB are available in low-end PCs, but 32MB is now common, and a few high-end users have 64MB. </p> <p>Some PCs use part of main memory as graphics memory. This is cheaper but limits performance. It is a very bad idea in a PC that may be used for games. </p> <p><strong> Graphics and sound</strong><br> Nowadays, even business PCs have graphics and sound facilities. In low-end machines, these will be integrated on to the main system board. </p> <p>You get more power for more money by having separate sound and graphics cards that fit into slots on the motherboard. Sound cards usually fit into a PCI (peripheral component interconnect) slot and graphics cards into a 2x or 4x AGP (accelerated graphics port), so don't buy a PC without an AGP slot. </p> <p>Graphics cards usually have chips to speed up Windows graphics, particularly 3D images. These provide a faster and more responsive system, which is particularly important for games players. </p> <p>Extra sound and graphics facilities are of limited use unless software houses support them. Home users should therefore lean towards one of the Creative Labs SoundBlaster series and, for gamers, either an nVidia GeForce 2 or 3Dfx Voodoo graphics card, though there are many options. If you are going to splash out on better sound, it makes sense to go for a decent pair of speakers and a subwoofer as well. </p> <p><strong> Disk drives</strong><br> A PC should have at least three drives - five or six are not unusual. The basics are a 3.5in floppy, a hard drive, and a CD-rom. The floppy is useful for file transfer and backing up small files, and adds little to the cost of a PC. </p> <p>The hard drive is used for storing the operating system and other programs, so the bigger the better. Today, 10 gigabytes is average, and 15GB or 30GB is common. High-end machines pack up to 60GB. Cheap systems may only have 6GB or 7.5GB drives, but these are fine for most people. However, if you want to run lots of 3D games, edit videos or collect MP3 files, go for the biggest hard drive you can afford. </p> <p>The third essential is a CD-rom drive, which is needed for loading software and running encyclopedias such as Microsoft Encarta. Most people will want to upgrade this either to a DVD, which can play movies, or a CD-RW read/write drive, which can take back-ups or, for example, create picture or audio CDs. </p> <p>It is now possible to get \"combo\" drives, such as Toshiba's CD-R1002 and Samsung's SM-304B, which read DVDs and also write CDs. However, these are not that much cheaper than two separate drives, and you lose any ability to make disc-to-disc copies. CD-rom drives tend to be sold on speed, but there does not seem to be any practical advantage to having drives that are faster than x16 or even x12. </p> <p>Some people may also want a fifth drive, usually a high- capacity floppy such as a 250MB Iomega Zip drive. </p> <p><strong> Expansion</strong><br> One reason for buying a PC is that it can easily be customised and expanded: you can add TV and radio tuners, video capture cards, network cards, tape drives, modems, printers, scanners, cameras, music keyboards and other things. </p> <p>But expansion depends on having empty slots and drive bays inside the case and external communications ports for connecting peripherals. </p> <p>I would not feel comfortable buying a PC that did not have at least two free PCI slots and two empty 5.25in drive bays. </p> <p>Traditionally, PCs have been provided with a number of dedicated ports (sockets) for the keyboard, mouse, modem (a serial port) and printer, but USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports are slowly replacing them. </p> <p>I think it is best to go for a \"legacy free\" PC with as many USB ports as possible. Unfortunately many PCs have only two, which can be expanded by adding hubs. Five is better. </p> <p><strong> Cases</strong><br> Buy the biggest case you can bear. Small cases look less threatening and are easier to hide, but tower cases have many advantages. First, they provide room for expansion, and it is far easier to handle fiddly components and the spaghetti of internal wiring in a big case than a small one. </p> <p>Second, big cases tend to run cooler than small ones, and heat is the enemy of stability and reliability. </p> <p>PC manufacturers are keen to sell PCs in colourful, curvy cases, but try to avoid becoming a fashion victim. Make sure the case will accept cheap off-the-shelf components such as standard CD and DVD drives, and full-height expansion cards. </p> <p><strong> Keyboard and screen</strong><br> Cheap PCs usually come with poor keyboards and fuzzy screens, and mid-range PCs are not always much better. This is a pity because the keyboard and screen are how you interact with the system. </p> <p>However, most name-brand suppliers offer better screens for some extra cost. Aim for a refresh rate of 75MHz or more at the screen resolution you plan to use: probably 800 x 600 on a 15in screen, or 1,024 x 768 on a 17in model. A low refresh rate creates a disturbing flicker. </p> <p>There are lots of good monitors available from firms such as Iiyama, NEC, Mitsubishi and Philips. </p> <p>It is an advantage to have a big screen, because you can see more applications at the same time. Some PCs still come with 15in screens because they are cheap, but it is always worth upgrading to 17in. However, 21in screens tend to be too large and too expensive for home use, and 19in screens may not be a cost-effective compromise. </p> <p>Many companies also offer flat LCD screens, which take up less room and generate less heat, but they are still much too expensive for the mass market. </p> <p><strong> Which Windows?</strong><br> Most PCs come preloaded with Microsoft Windows, but there is a choice of versions. Windows Me (Millennium edition) is the latest, and has been designed for home users. However, it is slower than Windows 98SE (Second edition). Whichever you choose, make sure you also get a Windows CD-rom. </p> <p>Windows 2000 - a version of Windows NT (New Technology) - is more advanced and works with multiple processors. It is the best choice for business, but a bit too unforgiving for home users. </p> <p>If possible, buy a Windows 98SE/Me PC that is also offered with Windows 2000 and preferably Unix (eg Linux). Manufacturers can get away with supplying flaky hardware for Windows 98SE/Me, and blaming Microsoft when it crashes. Windows 2000 and Linux generally don't crash, and this exposes hardware flaws. </p> <p><strong> Bundles</strong><br> Manufacturers are keen to keep their average selling price as high as possible, and often throw in \"free\" software and peripherals rather than reduce it. But if these are not items you would buy separately, then you may not get much benefit from them. Free software has no value if you don't use it. </p> <p>Still, some worthwhile programs may be available free or for a small extra fee. Look for the Microsoft Works suite, Encarta or a similar encyclopedia, and games. </p> <p><strong> Where to buy?</strong><br> For most people, the choice is between retail and mail order, which includes telephone sales. Usually mail order offers a better deal, because the direct supplier does not have to buy parts and build PCs weeks or months before it gets your money (this is significant when the cost of computer parts falls every month), and because it cuts out the retailers' profit margin. </p> <p>However, retailers can offer competitive deals by buying large volumes and slashing margins - Tesco has done this in previous years - and by cutting prices to clear aging stock. </p> <p>Many firms offer extra information, special deals and clearance bargains on their websites, so check the main suppliers and firms such as <a href=\"http://www.action.com\">www.action.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jungle.com\">Jungle.com</a>. </p> <p>The drawbacks with mail order/telephone sales are that you cannot see the machine before you buy it, and if it goes wrong, it may be awkward to return it. But you can cover yourself by keeping a record of who you talk to, and what you agree, and by paying by credit card. </p> <p>You could also consider buying from a mail order supplier with shops or a showroom within driving distance. </p> <p>If you want something in time for Christmas, you need to act as soon as possible. If not, well, prices will be even lower in February.</p>",

It is now possible to get \"combo\" drives, such as Toshiba's CD-R1002 and Samsung's SM-304B, which read DVDs and also write CDs. However, these are not that much cheaper than two separate drives, and you lose any ability to make disc-to-disc copies. CD-rom drives tend to be sold on speed, but there does not seem to be any practical advantage to having drives that are faster than x16 or even x12. Some people may also want a fifth drive, usually a high- capacity floppy such as a 250MB Iomega Zip drive. Expansion One reason for buying a PC is that it can easily be customised and expanded: you can add TV and radio tuners, video capture cards, network cards, tape drives, modems, printers, scanners, cameras, music keyboards and other things. But expansion depends on having empty slots and drive bays inside the case and external communications ports for connecting peripherals. I would not feel comfortable buying a PC that did not have at least two free PCI slots and two empty 5.25in drive bays. Traditionally, PCs have been provided with a number of dedicated ports (sockets) for the keyboard, mouse, modem (a serial port) and printer, but USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports are slowly replacing them. I think it is best to go for a \"legacy free\" PC with as many USB ports as possible. Unfortunately many PCs have only two, which can be expanded by adding hubs. Five is better. Cases Buy the biggest case you can bear. Small cases look less threatening and are easier to hide, but tower cases have many advantages. First, they provide room for expansion, and it is far easier to handle fiddly components and the spaghetti of internal wiring in a big case than a small one. Second, big cases tend to run cooler than small ones, and heat is the enemy of stability and reliability. PC manufacturers are keen to sell PCs in colourful, curvy cases, but try to avoid becoming a fashion victim. Make sure the case will accept cheap off-the-shelf components such as standard CD and DVD drives, and full-height expansion cards. Keyboard and screen Cheap PCs usually come with poor keyboards and fuzzy screens, and mid-range PCs are not always much better. This is a pity because the keyboard and screen are how you interact with the system. However, most name-brand suppliers offer better screens for some extra cost. Aim for a refresh rate of 75MHz or more at the screen resolution you plan to use: probably 800 x 600 on a 15in screen, or 1,024 x 768 on a 17in model. A low refresh rate creates a disturbing flicker. There are lots of good monitors available from firms such as Iiyama, NEC, Mitsubishi and Philips. It is an advantage to have a big screen, because you can see more applications at the same time. Some PCs still come with 15in screens because they are cheap, but it is always worth upgrading to 17in. However, 21in screens tend to be too large and too expensive for home use, and 19in screens may not be a cost-effective compromise. Many companies also offer flat LCD screens, which take up less room and generate less heat, but they are still much too expensive for the mass market. Which Windows? Most PCs come preloaded with Microsoft Windows, but there is a choice of versions. Windows Me (Millennium edition) is the latest, and has been designed for home users. However, it is slower than Windows 98SE (Second edition). Whichever you choose, make sure you also get a Windows CD-rom. Windows 2000 - a version of Windows NT (New Technology) - is more advanced and works with multiple processors. It is the best choice for business, but a bit too unforgiving for home users. If possible, buy a Windows 98SE/Me PC that is also offered with Windows 2000 and preferably Unix (eg Linux). Manufacturers can get away with supplying flaky hardware for Windows 98SE/Me, and blaming Microsoft when it crashes. Windows 2000 and Linux generally don't crash, and this exposes hardware flaws. Bundles Manufacturers are keen to keep their average selling price as high as possible, and often throw in \"free\" software and peripherals rather than reduce it. But if these are not items you would buy separately, then you may not get much benefit from them. Free software has no value if you don't use it. Still, some worthwhile programs may be available free or for a small extra fee. Look for the Microsoft Works suite, Encarta or a similar encyclopedia, and games. Where to buy? For most people, the choice is between retail and mail order, which includes telephone sales. Usually mail order offers a better deal, because the direct supplier does not have to buy parts and build PCs weeks or months before it gets your money (this is significant when the cost of computer parts falls every month), and because it cuts out the retailers' profit margin. However, retailers can offer competitive deals by buying large volumes and slashing margins - Tesco has done this in previous years - and by cutting prices to clear aging stock. Many firms offer extra information, special deals and clearance bargains on their websites, so check the main suppliers and firms such as www.action.com and Jungle.com. The drawbacks with mail order/telephone sales are that you cannot see the machine before you buy it, and if it goes wrong, it may be awkward to return it. But you can cover yourself by keeping a record of who you talk to, and what you agree, and by paying by credit card. You could also consider buying from a mail order supplier with shops or a showroom within driving distance. If you want something in time for Christmas, you need to act as soon as possible. If not, well, prices will be even lower in February.",

If the web is a nation of voyeurs, who's watching the watchmen? Well, you can. Many search engines now offer \"Search Voyeurs\", services which display a random sample of searches taking place at that moment. </p> <p>Magellan <a href=\"http://voyeur.mckinley.com/cgi-bin/voyeur.cgi\" target=\"_new\">http://voyeur.mckinley.com/cgi-bin/voyeur.cgi</a> is typical, giving you a random selection of 10 searches updated every few seconds. As with all the Search Voyeurs, if any of the searches catch your eye, you can click on them to see the results for yourself. Most automatically filter out the more offensive search items (MetaCrawler's Search Voyeur at <a href=\"http://www.metaspy.com\">www.metaspy.com</a> offers you a choice: 'MetaSpy' or 'MetaSpy Exposed'). But sometimes what is not said makes you nervous. At <a href=\"http://www.askjeeves.com/docs/peek/\">www.askjeeves.com/docs/peek</a> you can Ask Jeeves to \"peek through the keyhole\": most people's questions are worryingly trivial or bizarre. In my case, what the butler saw included: \"Where do pencils come from?\" and \"Where can I find resources from Britannica.com on dynamite?\" </p> <p>It's not all depressing though: another 20 seconds produced \"Where can I find resources on otolaryngology?\" and \"Where can I learn about Pythagoras of Samos?\" Voyeurism isn't always about identification with the observed. Robert Burns wrote: \"O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us / To see oursels as others see us!\" We still can't do that; but we can see others and be glad we're not them. </p> <p>One curious voyeur ran a capture program on the MetaSpy Search Voyeur and placed the results on the web (see <a href=\"http://www.firstpr.com.au/curiosity/\">www.firstpr.com.au/curiosity</a>): even a quick look here will have you glad you're not the person who searched for \"Hello Metaspy, I know you want to see me!\" Apart from curiosity, watching people can also be an excellent way to learn something new. <a href=\"http://www.cyveillance.com\">www.cyveillance.com</a> that specialises in watching users online has estimated the number of web pages at 3 billion, with 7 million new pages every day. Research by another <a href=\"http://cyberatlas.internet.com\" target=\"_new\">corporate voyeur</a> suggests the average home surfer will use about six of those pages daily. </p> <p>So how do you find out what else is out there? Watch someone else using topic-specific search voyeurs - <a href=\"http://stockcharts.com/SharpCharts/voyeur.html\" target=\"_new\">http://stockcharts.com/SharpCharts/voyeur.html</a> for stock-market charts, <a href=\"http://food.epicurious.com/food_kwd/content.htm\" target=\"_new\">http://food.epicurious.com/food_kwd/content.htm</a> for new recipes (\"Pizza + marinade\" anyone?) - but for a truly expansive experience, you need a Webring. </p> <p>Webrings, strings of sites with connected themes which link themselves into a chain, often give the opportunity to jump to a random site on the ring. <a href=\"http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/\">www.webring.org/cgi-bin</a> webring?ring=milprod;random will give you a random site on the Military Products Webring. (I got Firebase Higgy's Supply Sergeant, for \"Custom-made Veterans [sic] patches and other memorabilia\"; and \"Scars of Honour\", \"a novel of the Russian Front by retired professional soldier Faron Norris.) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=\" diary;random\"\">The Diary Webring</a> brought me Moonlight Memoirs (\"My name is Electra, and I'm a Femme Fatale\") and the Jon Jon Diaries (although, sadly, \"Jon Jon has to go away for a while\"). The Yahoo Webring Directory ( dir.webring.yahoo.com/rw ) has all kinds: Quotations; Wiccans; Golden Retrievers (the Circle of Gold).

      "bodyText": "We all know the web can be a watcher's paradise. Type \"voyeur\" into any search engine and you get up to 800,000 sites. But you'd better pay more than usual attention to how blue your links are. What's less well known is that there are plenty of more intriguing ways to peer into the internet. If the web is a nation of voyeurs, who's watching the watchmen? Well, you can. Many search engines now offer \"Search Voyeurs\", services which display a random sample of searches taking place at that moment. Magellan http://voyeur.mckinley.com/cgi-bin/voyeur.cgi is typical, giving you a random selection of 10 searches updated every few seconds. As with all the Search Voyeurs, if any of the searches catch your eye, you can click on them to see the results for yourself. Most automatically filter out the more offensive search items (MetaCrawler's Search Voyeur at www.metaspy.com offers you a choice: 'MetaSpy' or 'MetaSpy Exposed'). But sometimes what is not said makes you nervous. At www.askjeeves.com/docs/peek you can Ask Jeeves to \"peek through the keyhole\": most people's questions are worryingly trivial or bizarre. In my case, what the butler saw included: \"Where do pencils come from?\" and \"Where can I find resources from Britannica.com on dynamite?\" It's not all depressing though: another 20 seconds produced \"Where can I find resources on otolaryngology?\" and \"Where can I learn about Pythagoras of Samos?\" Voyeurism isn't always about identification with the observed. Robert Burns wrote: \"O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us / To see oursels as others see us!\" We still can't do that; but we can see others and be glad we're not them. One curious voyeur ran a capture program on the MetaSpy Search Voyeur and placed the results on the web (see www.firstpr.com.au/curiosity): even a quick look here will have you glad you're not the person who searched for \"Hello Metaspy, I know you want to see me!\" Apart from curiosity, watching people can also be an excellent way to learn something new. www.cyveillance.com that specialises in watching users online has estimated the number of web pages at 3 billion, with 7 million new pages every day. Research by another corporate voyeur suggests the average home surfer will use about six of those pages daily. So how do you find out what else is out there? Watch someone else using topic-specific search voyeurs - http://stockcharts.com/SharpCharts/voyeur.html for stock-market charts, http://food.epicurious.com/food_kwd/content.htm for new recipes (\"Pizza + marinade\" anyone?) - but for a truly expansive experience, you need a Webring. Webrings, strings of sites with connected themes which link themselves into a chain, often give the opportunity to jump to a random site on the ring. www.webring.org/cgi-bin webring?ring=milprod;random will give you a random site on the Military Products Webring. (I got Firebase Higgy's Supply Sergeant, for \"Custom-made Veterans [sic] patches and other memorabilia\"; and \"Scars of Honour\", \"a novel of the Russian Front by retired professional soldier Faron Norris.) The Diary Webring brought me Moonlight Memoirs (\"My name is Electra, and I'm a Femme Fatale\") and the Jon Jon Diaries (although, sadly, \"Jon Jon has to go away for a while\"). The Yahoo Webring Directory ( dir.webring.yahoo.com/rw ) has all kinds: Quotations; Wiccans; Golden Retrievers (the Circle of Gold). A hundred lifetimes could be lost in here. If you're a fan of Luke Rhinehart's The Dice Man, and all this seems too predetermined, there are sites that give you a far more random experience. At www.maths.tcd.ie/cgi-bin/randurl you can see pages taken at random from the http cache of the University of Dublin Trinity College School of Mathematics. For students, they seem to be a suspiciously clean-living lot - the results are mainly academic sites, and fascinatingly dull, although you do get the odd surprise: on click 27, I reached www.sunbelt.net - a site I can honestly say I would otherwise never have seen.

Aside from transforming the business, there have been personal transformations too. Before going online, Loakes's only experience with computers had been to use a word processor for the odd letter, but by his own admission is now \"very good with spreadsheets\".

It has an order processing application that links orders from the browser's shopping trolley interface to the farm's sales office system, which integrates with Manor Farm Granaries' mail order business. The system also incorporates a spreadsheet to monitor the costs of hundreds of products, yields, margins, and price/ weight options for each of the farm's three sales channels.</p> <p> \"Having the mail order business made it easier to go online, because we had a distribution system and were used to handling credit card transactions,\" says Loakes. But the dominant concern for the site is delivery. Order fulfilment was found wanting during the earlier stages of selling online. It is now carried out by Business Express, signed up by the farm after initial \"problems\" with Parcel Force. However, the fear of losing customers through poor delivery remains prominent in the Loakeses minds.</p> <p> Delivery is currently only within the UK, although orders as far flung as Finland have been honoured. Loakes explains that because the cost of shipping rises above the value of the seed itself, large-scale exporting is uneconomical. \"The seed is cheap, but dispatching 25 kilo sacks of it abroad isn't, so at this point it is not viable.\" Loakes thinks the onus is on the delivery companies to develop cheaper, more efficient overseas routes. Future plans include a B2B element through which the farm can develop online relations with trading customers such as garden centres and agents, and through which it can render its own supply chain more efficient. As setting up shop on the web is increasingly seen as a realistic option for many a beleaguered farm, perhaps the only ones to survive in the 21st century will be virtual.</p> <p>\u0095 See also <a href=\"http://www.technologymeansbusiness.org.uk\">www.technologymeansbusiness.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mortonhodson-cambridge.co.uk\">www.mortonhodson-cambridge.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\">www.maff.gov.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>This Christmas, the virtual tills of Europe's online stores are expected to be ringing louder and faster than ever before. In a year when e-tailers have seen their businesses continue to grow rapidly, this holiday season will still make up 30% of the year's online sales, according to figures released this week by Forrester Research. In the UK, that adds up to \u00a3400m in the holiday season alone. </p> <p>Yet already this year's online Christmas is much more muted than last year's hugely hyped event. The cash might be rolling in, but many e-tailers are concentrating on actually delivering the goods rather than blowing millions on advertising campaigns, after a difficult year in which the bubble of investor and consumer confidence in dot.coms has been punctured. </p> <p>From the dot.com disasters of Boo.com and ClickMango through the abrupt calling-off of the stock markets' love affair with all things internet, consumers sense the e-tail industry is in trouble. Combine that with Christmas presents ordered last year arriving in January of this year, scare stories about credit card scams and online fraudsters, and it is easy to see why e-tailers have a job on their hands to persuade consumers that using their sites is safe. </p> <p>\"This Christmas will be a test of customer service and site performance,\" says Abigail Leland, consultant analyst at Forrester Research. \"For the larger projects, good retailers will have planned far in advance. They will have really learned from last year where merchants were not able to get products out on time and had to refund customers.\" </p> <p>Even at <a href=\"http://www.Amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Amazon.co.uk</a>, which has a customer service record most online retailers envy, preparations for the seasonal rush began long ago. </p> <p>\"This is our third Christmas, and one always wants to say that we're going to do a better job than we ever did before, but in fact we did a really good job last year,\" boasts Steve Frazier, managing director of Amazon.co.uk. \"The challenge for us is that we've gone on every quarter since then and done more business each quarter. What Christmas really means is that you are stepping up to the next plateau - it's like 2001 is happening in December. </p> <p>\"You have all this preparation and then it's showtime - you've got to do a really, really good job in November and December to persuade people that you're in business and doing a good job.\" </p> <p>Over the past year, the e-tailing giant's staff has been working on adding new product ranges and making its website run more efficiently in preparation for the end of year rush. The site's help section has been renovated (\"we've discovered customers like to help themselves\") and its \"Christmas messaging\" - on-screen details like ordering deadlines for the Christmas post and the various gift options - have been tweaked to make them more easily seen and understood. </p> <p>But most of all, Amazon has been trying to get across one message: we can deliver. At Christmas more than any other time of the year, says Frazier, \"that whole question of how you are taking care of that basic thing - getting packages to customers - becomes tremendously important\". </p> <p>To that end, Amazon's advertising campaign is being co-sponsored by the Royal Mail, which delivers its parcels. The message is clear: you can depend on Amazon not just because it's Amazon, but because the Royal Mail is delivering. \"We think that this point - that Amazon can be relied upon to make Christmas happen - is something that people in this market need reminding of,\" says Frazier. \"There has been enough doubt and confusion sown in e-commerce that we thought it was important to tell people: you really will get this stuff.\" </p> <p>That has also led to Amazon's slogan for the year - \"a real company in a virtual world\". \"I'm pretty sure it's not a slogan for the ages,\" laughs Frazier, \"but I'm sure it's a slogan for the year 2000. We saw how many companies failed to do a good job last Christmas, and our feeling was that this would be a year of doubts and confusion about e-commerce.\" </p> <p>At the other end of the scale are companies such as Father Christmas Ltd - a tiny web operation based in Cambridgeshire which emerges for only a few months at the end of each year. It relies on potential customers \"domain dipping\" and typing in its prime web addresses such as <a href=\"http://www.santa-claus.com\">www.santa-claus.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Christmas.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">www.Christmas.co.uk</a> by chance, rather than advertising. But despite the differences in scale its managing director, Stephen Bottomley, seems to be grappling with the same issues as his giant competitor. </p> <p>\"This may sound strange coming from the MD of an e-tail site, but the perception of e-tailing is not good at the moment,\" says Bottomley. \"That needs to change, and there's no way that is going to change in time for this Christmas. The only thing that you can do as an e-tailer is offer guarantees - like money back, no quibble guarantees should the worst happen - advise on when people should place their order so that it arrives at the right time, that kind of thing.\" </p> <p>But Bottomley also says that for him, unlike many e-commerce MDs, this is not the vital e-christmas for his company. \"I don't think this will be the one,\" he says. \"I think next Christmas will be more important, simply because of all the hurdles online retailers have to clear this time around. There's the confidence in fulfilment, security online and more, and I don't believe that this is the make or break Christmas.\" </p> <p>For some in the industry, the hurdles being put in e-tailers' way by nervous investors and consumers is a frustration. James Roper of the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) admits that he gets annoyed by e-tailers making the same mistakes but says he thinks the lack of faith has \"got a bit silly.\" </p> <p>\"I think this is a fundamental change in the way we communicate and do business and it will take many years - if not decades - to fully bed in,\" he says. \"Everything is having to be realigned from banking services to shipping, from media to how we spend our time and everything else. We set up the IMRG group because we realised that it was just far more complicated than people thought. We're getting just so fed up with people making the same mistakes over and over again.\" </p> <p>He says consumers are at much less risk than the media claims, thanks to protection from credit card companies against online fraud and a raft of new European legislation which means online shoppers have more legal protection than those in the high streets. </p> <p>\"There has been such noise about consumers' exposure, yet frankly there has been little - if any - consumer exposure. Anybody who uses a credit card is comprehensively protected, and now the law means you are more protected buying online thanfrom a shop,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It's very unhelpful to generalise because a lot of consumers, who only know what they see in the press, are very anxious. But those people who have actually shopped on the net find it works and continue. We find that people, in their first year online, have small ad hoc trials, but in their second year they get serious about it, booking holidays and flights and choosing what car to buy.\" </p> <p>This pattern of tentative first steps in e-commerce, followed by much more extensive - and expensive - e-shopping, is reported by many e-tailers. Forrester's Leland says that much of the growth in e-commerce is fuelled by more experienced net users overcoming their fears and using online stores more often. \"Consumers who have been online for three years are two and a half times more likely to shop online than when they were in their first year,\" she says. </p> <p>\"There is a sort of cumulative effect of both new people coming online and [existing users] buying more online, so it's natural to see continual growth. The holiday season is just all the new users being combined with the added incentive they have to spend at this time of year.\" </p> <p> Yet all this festive good cheer could still be tempered by e-commerce's continuing challenges.

      "bodyText": "This Christmas, the virtual tills of Europe's online stores are expected to be ringing louder and faster than ever before. In a year when e-tailers have seen their businesses continue to grow rapidly, this holiday season will still make up 30% of the year's online sales, according to figures released this week by Forrester Research. In the UK, that adds up to \u00a3400m in the holiday season alone. Yet already this year's online Christmas is much more muted than last year's hugely hyped event. The cash might be rolling in, but many e-tailers are concentrating on actually delivering the goods rather than blowing millions on advertising campaigns, after a difficult year in which the bubble of investor and consumer confidence in dot.coms has been punctured. From the dot.com disasters of Boo.com and ClickMango through the abrupt calling-off of the stock markets' love affair with all things internet, consumers sense the e-tail industry is in trouble. Combine that with Christmas presents ordered last year arriving in January of this year, scare stories about credit card scams and online fraudsters, and it is easy to see why e-tailers have a job on their hands to persuade consumers that using their sites is safe. \"This Christmas will be a test of customer service and site performance,\" says Abigail Leland, consultant analyst at Forrester Research. \"For the larger projects, good retailers will have planned far in advance. They will have really learned from last year where merchants were not able to get products out on time and had to refund customers.\" Even at Amazon.co.uk, which has a customer service record most online retailers envy, preparations for the seasonal rush began long ago. \"This is our third Christmas, and one always wants to say that we're going to do a better job than we ever did before, but in fact we did a really good job last year,\" boasts Steve Frazier, managing director of Amazon.co.uk. \"The challenge for us is that we've gone on every quarter since then and done more business each quarter. What Christmas really means is that you are stepping up to the next plateau - it's like 2001 is happening in December. \"You have all this preparation and then it's showtime - you've got to do a really, really good job in November and December to persuade people that you're in business and doing a good job.\" Over the past year, the e-tailing giant's staff has been working on adding new product ranges and making its website run more efficiently in preparation for the end of year rush. The site's help section has been renovated (\"we've discovered customers like to help themselves\") and its \"Christmas messaging\" - on-screen details like ordering deadlines for the Christmas post and the various gift options - have been tweaked to make them more easily seen and understood. But most of all, Amazon has been trying to get across one message: we can deliver. At Christmas more than any other time of the year, says Frazier, \"that whole question of how you are taking care of that basic thing - getting packages to customers - becomes tremendously important\". To that end, Amazon's advertising campaign is being co-sponsored by the Royal Mail, which delivers its parcels. The message is clear: you can depend on Amazon not just because it's Amazon, but because the Royal Mail is delivering. \"We think that this point - that Amazon can be relied upon to make Christmas happen - is something that people in this market need reminding of,\" says Frazier. \"There has been enough doubt and confusion sown in e-commerce that we thought it was important to tell people: you really will get this stuff.\" That has also led to Amazon's slogan for the year - \"a real company in a virtual world\". \"I'm pretty sure it's not a slogan for the ages,\" laughs Frazier, \"but I'm sure it's a slogan for the year 2000. We saw how many companies failed to do a good job last Christmas, and our feeling was that this would be a year of doubts and confusion about e-commerce.\" At the other end of the scale are companies such as Father Christmas Ltd - a tiny web operation based in Cambridgeshire which emerges for only a few months at the end of each year. It relies on potential customers \"domain dipping\" and typing in its prime web addresses such as www.santa-claus.com and www.Christmas.co.uk by chance, rather than advertising. But despite the differences in scale its managing director, Stephen Bottomley, seems to be grappling with the same issues as his giant competitor. \"This may sound strange coming from the MD of an e-tail site, but the perception of e-tailing is not good at the moment,\" says Bottomley. \"That needs to change, and there's no way that is going to change in time for this Christmas. The only thing that you can do as an e-tailer is offer guarantees - like money back, no quibble guarantees should the worst happen - advise on when people should place their order so that it arrives at the right time, that kind of thing.\" But Bottomley also says that for him, unlike many e-commerce MDs, this is not the vital e-christmas for his company. \"I don't think this will be the one,\" he says. \"I think next Christmas will be more important, simply because of all the hurdles online retailers have to clear this time around. There's the confidence in fulfilment, security online and more, and I don't believe that this is the make or break Christmas.\" For some in the industry, the hurdles being put in e-tailers' way by nervous investors and consumers is a frustration. James Roper of the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) admits that he gets annoyed by e-tailers making the same mistakes but says he thinks the lack of faith has \"got a bit silly.\" \"I think this is a fundamental change in the way we communicate and do business and it will take many years - if not decades - to fully bed in,\" he says. \"Everything is having to be realigned from banking services to shipping, from media to how we spend our time and everything else. We set up the IMRG group because we realised that it was just far more complicated than people thought. We're getting just so fed up with people making the same mistakes over and over again.\" He says consumers are at much less risk than the media claims, thanks to protection from credit card companies against online fraud and a raft of new European legislation which means online shoppers have more legal protection than those in the high streets. \"There has been such noise about consumers' exposure, yet frankly there has been little - if any - consumer exposure. Anybody who uses a credit card is comprehensively protected, and now the law means you are more protected buying online thanfrom a shop,\" he says. \"It's very unhelpful to generalise because a lot of consumers, who only know what they see in the press, are very anxious. But those people who have actually shopped on the net find it works and continue. We find that people, in their first year online, have small ad hoc trials, but in their second year they get serious about it, booking holidays and flights and choosing what car to buy.\" This pattern of tentative first steps in e-commerce, followed by much more extensive - and expensive - e-shopping, is reported by many e-tailers. Forrester's Leland says that much of the growth in e-commerce is fuelled by more experienced net users overcoming their fears and using online stores more often. \"Consumers who have been online for three years are two and a half times more likely to shop online than when they were in their first year,\" she says. \"There is a sort of cumulative effect of both new people coming online and [existing users] buying more online, so it's natural to see continual growth. The holiday season is just all the new users being combined with the added incentive they have to spend at this time of year.\" Yet all this festive good cheer could still be tempered by e-commerce's continuing challenges. No matter how efficient the dot.com is at its end, fulfilment can still be a problem, as anyone who has attempted to have bulky items delivered to their home will testify. Even the much simpler, but equally vital, signposting on e-tail sites is still a problem, with many dot.coms not including the simplest details such as contact telephone numbers and addresses to reassure nervous customers. And many consumers - especially the large number of first-time shoppers this Christmas - are still wary of handing over credit card details. \"There is a big discrepancy between the number of shopping carts which are started versus those which are checked out,\" says Leland. \"Usually about two-thirds of shopping cards are abandoned; that's down to a lot of things including finding out that the items are not available, that the merchandise cannot be shipped to wherever they are, but a lot of it has to do with security.\" Many expect to see a few big name e-tailers go to the wall after Christmas, although it will be the cumulative effect of a number of factors, including the City's harsh attitude towards dot.coms, that will trip them up, rather than a bad festive season. For those with more secure finances, all they can do is be good boys and girls this Christmas, helping themselves as much as they can through improved sites, better organisation and customer service, and hope that Santa brings them calmer consumers, and markets, next year.

      "body": "<p>To sum up what effective IT security is all about requires just three letters. CIA is the holy trinity of the anti-hackers, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. If you can keep your private information private, if you can trust the accuracy of your data, and if your staff can always gain access to information when they need it then, to quote Kipling, you've got exceedingly good security.</p> <p>But with CIA comes a problem. If you're a relatively small company, you probably can't afford to employ people specifically to keep your PCs safe from hackers, viruses, porn and all the other associated nasties that afflict modern-day computing. More than likely, the security problem will be dumped on whoever knows most about computers in general.</p> <p> Without the luxury of a full-time security person you have to prioritise, and this isn't as easy as it sounds. Many companies make the mistake of concentrating too much on availability of information while neglecting to protect confidentiality and integrity. It's easy to understand why this happens, as a loss of data availability means that no one can do any work. But neglect data confidentiality and integrity for too long and it might be the last mistake your company ever makes.</p> <p> Data confidentiality is crucial to every company. Although your computers are largely filled with unexciting stuff, there are almost certainly a handful of key files without which you could not trade, and which would cause serious problems if your competitors managed to obtain copies. Your customer database, for example, the plans and costings for the products you're launching next year, or even the file of customer complaints. After all, if your competitors know what people don't like about your products they can develop something without those weaknesses. Data integrity, meanwhile, means having confidence that a software bug, a hacker or a virus hasn't altered key information in your files without your knowledge. Not all viruses wipe the entire hard disk of all information, and not all hackers do something as obvious as replacing the entire content of your website with porn. Small changes are often more dangerous than large ones because they can easily go unnoticed.</p> <p>You can normally recover from major problems by restoring your information from backups. (You do have recent backups, don't you? And you have remembered to keep them somewhere other than the office, just in case the place burns down?) But if a hacker increased just a couple of the prices in your online web catalogue, it's unlikely that you'd ever notice. Well, not until the sales department started to ask why no one was ordering those items anymore.</p> <p> With so many different threats to your data, is there anything you can do to protect your secrets from the nosey, greedy and malicious? Yes, and it needn't be expensive. The crucial point to remember is not to wade straight in with chequebook. Instead, start with a little risk analysis. Find out where your main vulnerabilities lie.

      "bodyText": "To sum up what effective IT security is all about requires just three letters. CIA is the holy trinity of the anti-hackers, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. If you can keep your private information private, if you can trust the accuracy of your data, and if your staff can always gain access to information when they need it then, to quote Kipling, you've got exceedingly good security. But with CIA comes a problem. If you're a relatively small company, you probably can't afford to employ people specifically to keep your PCs safe from hackers, viruses, porn and all the other associated nasties that afflict modern-day computing. More than likely, the security problem will be dumped on whoever knows most about computers in general. Without the luxury of a full-time security person you have to prioritise, and this isn't as easy as it sounds. Many companies make the mistake of concentrating too much on availability of information while neglecting to protect confidentiality and integrity. It's easy to understand why this happens, as a loss of data availability means that no one can do any work. But neglect data confidentiality and integrity for too long and it might be the last mistake your company ever makes. Data confidentiality is crucial to every company. Although your computers are largely filled with unexciting stuff, there are almost certainly a handful of key files without which you could not trade, and which would cause serious problems if your competitors managed to obtain copies. Your customer database, for example, the plans and costings for the products you're launching next year, or even the file of customer complaints. After all, if your competitors know what people don't like about your products they can develop something without those weaknesses. Data integrity, meanwhile, means having confidence that a software bug, a hacker or a virus hasn't altered key information in your files without your knowledge. Not all viruses wipe the entire hard disk of all information, and not all hackers do something as obvious as replacing the entire content of your website with porn. Small changes are often more dangerous than large ones because they can easily go unnoticed. You can normally recover from major problems by restoring your information from backups. (You do have recent backups, don't you? And you have remembered to keep them somewhere other than the office, just in case the place burns down?) But if a hacker increased just a couple of the prices in your online web catalogue, it's unlikely that you'd ever notice. Well, not until the sales department started to ask why no one was ordering those items anymore. With so many different threats to your data, is there anything you can do to protect your secrets from the nosey, greedy and malicious? Yes, and it needn't be expensive. The crucial point to remember is not to wade straight in with chequebook. Instead, start with a little risk analysis. Find out where your main vulnerabilities lie. There's no use putting all your budget into protecting the chairman's PC if all the juicy stuff is actually held by the secretary or the HR person. After the risk analysis, make sure you have an IT security policy so that staff members know what they are and aren't permitted to do with the PC on their desk.

      "body": "<p>It is hard being an SME in this world of the internet and e-business. You feel bewildered. Everyone tells you to get into e-business at once or else competitors from all over the world will take away your livelihood. At the same time you have been assaulted by stories of dot.com failures and the dangers of using the world wide web, especially for making payments.</p> <p> A Which Online survey earlier this year showed that 51% of internet users have not purchased anything online, only 23% of users think it is safe to use credit cards online and yet 73% of e-traders did not give details of their contract terms online. Clearly we have a crisis of confidence at a time when all about are singing the praises of e-business.</p> <p>It is true that the use of the internet is intensifying the market economy of sellers and buyers in the business to business arena (b2b) in many parts of the world. The development of a common language for electronic business, based on <a href=\"http://www.ebXML.org\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">XML</a>, allows retailers and manufacturers to process orders and forecast demand across every continent. These b2b marketplaces are being developed in many sectors (see <a href=\"http://www.timberweb.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">www.timberweb.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-steel.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">www.e-steel.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.elogistics.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">www.elogistics.com</a>) and are truly worldwide. Again, the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, ranging from Ahold to Wal*Mart and Danone to Unilever are in the forefront, using the internet to accelerate the supply chain from manufacturer to consumer, reducing costs, giving shorter negotiating cycles, offering additional sourcing capabilities to buyers. These marketplaces do also offer new sales channels, bigger reach and increased profits to suppliers and manufacturers, many of whom are SMEs.</p> <p> There are sane and sensible reasons for SMEs to become part of this global internet world. The important thing is to develop enough understanding and experience to have trust and confidence in working in this e-world. There are many good case studies of UK SMEs that have embraced e-business to their advantage, ranging from companies such as Pentwyn Splicers in South Wales (<a href=\"http://www.splicer.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> www.splicer.co.uk</a>), a small specialist firm making pneumatic yarn splicers, to Cooksons, a Stockport firm selling 50,000 different lines of tools (<a href=\"http://www.cooksons.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> www.cooksons.com</a>) to other businesses.</p> <p> The following 10 suggested steps are the sort of things that may have started them on the road to best practice:</p> <p> 1. Business Process Analysis - remember that e-business is not an end in itself but a means to an end. Be clear about your business objectives first and only then consider how e-business can help. An essential starting point for all businesses is to consider the following: what are your objectives, which e-business activities can help you achieve these, at what cost (ie cost to your business v perceived benefits) and how can this be realised (ie a plan of action)?</p> <p> 2. Consider what your customers require from you (and talk with them about this) and how you can achieve these more easily through electronic processes (eg processing orders, providing information, more efficient administration procedures). Do you need to exchange information securely, using encryption or electronic signatures?</p> <p> 3. See the bigger picture: look at integrating all aspects of your business electronically. Identify every aspect of your business, both front and back end (ie what the customer sees and doesn't see), and consider what is required/ how you can integrate all these activities electronically. </p> <p> 4. Itemise exactly what e-business activities you want to use. For example, email, marketing on the internet, online trading, EDI, automated stock control. Consider the purpose of each of these activities and what you expect each activity to achieve, eg to save time, to minimise human error of data entries, to increase awareness of your company or to generate more sales. Do a breakdown of the different aspects of each e-business activity and what you believe it may entail: specialist equipment, software, trained staff, other factors/ resources?</p> <p> 5. Consult widely as to what the appropriate business solutions are, such as IT equipment and software. Consider whether your supplier has an \"ethical dealings\" policy, proven experience, runs a viable business, can provide a cost effective solution with a timely delivery.</p> <p> 6. Seek independent advice, particularly on what the best practices and standards are. You may not be aware, but the e-business solution you adopt may not be universally used, which may turn out to be a very costly waste of time, money and other valuable resources. </p> <p> 7. Consider the legal and financial implications of your e-business activities: e-centreUK and other support agencies, such as Business Links, can provide independent advice on these areas.</p> <p> 8. Review your business objectives and the performance of your e-business activities regularly. With technology moving so fast, your business or sector may be significantly affected and you will need to alter your plans accordingly. Invest in an e-business review process, such as the e-commerce scorecard (<a href=\"http://www.e-commscore.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\"> www.e-commscore.com</a>) which lets you establish and monitor key e-business performance measures and points the way ahead.</p> <p> 9. Make sure you can fulfil the expectations of your trading partners and/or customers. A new website for orders/inquiries is not much good if you respond to emails once a week, or cannot deliver items on time, or find that your new electronic communications channels are not compatible with other key trading partners. A survey by Reuters found that one in 10 online orders never arrived!</p> <p> 10. Maintenance of systems is crucial, as is having a total recovery service.

      "bodyText": "It is hard being an SME in this world of the internet and e-business. You feel bewildered. Everyone tells you to get into e-business at once or else competitors from all over the world will take away your livelihood. At the same time you have been assaulted by stories of dot.com failures and the dangers of using the world wide web, especially for making payments. A Which Online survey earlier this year showed that 51% of internet users have not purchased anything online, only 23% of users think it is safe to use credit cards online and yet 73% of e-traders did not give details of their contract terms online. Clearly we have a crisis of confidence at a time when all about are singing the praises of e-business. It is true that the use of the internet is intensifying the market economy of sellers and buyers in the business to business arena (b2b) in many parts of the world. The development of a common language for electronic business, based on XML, allows retailers and manufacturers to process orders and forecast demand across every continent. These b2b marketplaces are being developed in many sectors (see www.timberweb.com, www.e-steel.com, www.elogistics.com) and are truly worldwide. Again, the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, ranging from Ahold to Wal*Mart and Danone to Unilever are in the forefront, using the internet to accelerate the supply chain from manufacturer to consumer, reducing costs, giving shorter negotiating cycles, offering additional sourcing capabilities to buyers. These marketplaces do also offer new sales channels, bigger reach and increased profits to suppliers and manufacturers, many of whom are SMEs. There are sane and sensible reasons for SMEs to become part of this global internet world. The important thing is to develop enough understanding and experience to have trust and confidence in working in this e-world. There are many good case studies of UK SMEs that have embraced e-business to their advantage, ranging from companies such as Pentwyn Splicers in South Wales ( www.splicer.co.uk), a small specialist firm making pneumatic yarn splicers, to Cooksons, a Stockport firm selling 50,000 different lines of tools ( www.cooksons.com) to other businesses. The following 10 suggested steps are the sort of things that may have started them on the road to best practice: 1. Business Process Analysis - remember that e-business is not an end in itself but a means to an end. Be clear about your business objectives first and only then consider how e-business can help. An essential starting point for all businesses is to consider the following: what are your objectives, which e-business activities can help you achieve these, at what cost (ie cost to your business v perceived benefits) and how can this be realised (ie a plan of action)? 2. Consider what your customers require from you (and talk with them about this) and how you can achieve these more easily through electronic processes (eg processing orders, providing information, more efficient administration procedures). Do you need to exchange information securely, using encryption or electronic signatures? 3. See the bigger picture: look at integrating all aspects of your business electronically. Identify every aspect of your business, both front and back end (ie what the customer sees and doesn't see), and consider what is required/ how you can integrate all these activities electronically. 4. Itemise exactly what e-business activities you want to use. For example, email, marketing on the internet, online trading, EDI, automated stock control. Consider the purpose of each of these activities and what you expect each activity to achieve, eg to save time, to minimise human error of data entries, to increase awareness of your company or to generate more sales. Do a breakdown of the different aspects of each e-business activity and what you believe it may entail: specialist equipment, software, trained staff, other factors/ resources? 5. Consult widely as to what the appropriate business solutions are, such as IT equipment and software. Consider whether your supplier has an \"ethical dealings\" policy, proven experience, runs a viable business, can provide a cost effective solution with a timely delivery. 6. Seek independent advice, particularly on what the best practices and standards are. You may not be aware, but the e-business solution you adopt may not be universally used, which may turn out to be a very costly waste of time, money and other valuable resources. 7. Consider the legal and financial implications of your e-business activities: e-centreUK and other support agencies, such as Business Links, can provide independent advice on these areas. 8. Review your business objectives and the performance of your e-business activities regularly. With technology moving so fast, your business or sector may be significantly affected and you will need to alter your plans accordingly. Invest in an e-business review process, such as the e-commerce scorecard ( www.e-commscore.com) which lets you establish and monitor key e-business performance measures and points the way ahead. 9. Make sure you can fulfil the expectations of your trading partners and/or customers. A new website for orders/inquiries is not much good if you respond to emails once a week, or cannot deliver items on time, or find that your new electronic communications channels are not compatible with other key trading partners. A survey by Reuters found that one in 10 online orders never arrived! 10. Maintenance of systems is crucial, as is having a total recovery service. Get your IT specialist to consider each individual aspect of your e-business activity, and to identify possible weak links and problem areas. Consider how your business would cope with a partial or total collapse (eg power failure, fire, burst water pipes, security infringement of databases). And when you train staff make sure that you start with the MD! About a year ago the Cabinet Office produced an excellent report on e-business in the UK, entitled e-commerce@its.best.uk ( www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/innovation/index.htm) which said that building a stable environment for e-business needed awareness, access, trust and confidence. There are many initiatives about e-business awareness, ranging from the sorts of thing that independent bodies like e centre do ( www.e-centre.org.ukwww.e-centre.org.uk) to the major government initiatives through Business Links and the new Government portals (www.ukonlineforbusiness.gov.uk). The issue of access to good internet services at reasonable costs (during business hours) has been discussed at length elsewhere. Finally we (that is business and government) all need to work together to really build this trust and confidence in e-business, based on an open environment in which we can all develop best practice so that the UK and its many SMEs can flourish. \u0095 Dr Roger Till is director of e-centreUK, roger.till@e-centre.org",

      "body": "<p>Andy Grove, chief executive of microchip giant Intel, once said that if you weren't doing business online in a few years, you wouldn't be doing business at all. The famous quote was taken to mean that shops the world over would be pulling down their shutters for good, in favour of selling everything via a website. It is understandable, then, that even some of the world's biggest companies balked in the face of such aggressive techno-evangelism. It was hard to imagine that this wasn't all just hype, and that the internet could possibly change the business world that much.</p> <p> Of course, Grove was not predicting a complete end to traditional business. He meant that businesses would have to incorporate at least some new economy thinking to succeed in the years ahead. And he has been proved right: for big business, we know that the world has changed dramatically. </p> <p> Giants such as car manufacturers General Motors and Ford are getting together to create multibillion-dollar electronic marketplaces, to negotiate prices for the thousands of parts they need to source for each machine. Closer to home, established retailers such as Tesco, aggressively expanding their \"real world\" stores, have also had to move to accommodate a new generation of shoppers who want low prices - but also want to order online and get their weekly shopping delivered to their home.</p> <p> These corporate giants, with their multimillion-pound online initiatives and multibillion pound deals, grab the headlines. But with 99.2% of businesses in the UK employing under 50 people, it could be said that Grove's predicted e-revolution has yet to touch very much of Britain's business community.</p> <p> \"One in two employees in larger companies have access to the internet,\" says David Hands of the Federation of Small Businesses. \"In smaller businesses they're getting there. But in micro-businesses of less than 10 workers, which is 95% of the business make-up of the UK, there's still a low internet usage.\" </p> <p> Hands says that for many small businesses, using the internet is still something of a novelty. \"Those ones that do are typically a long way from having their own website.\" That is certainly the message from a survey of SMEs carried out by Durlacher Research, the findings of which were published in August. It found that while 90% of SMEs are now connected to the internet, only 41% of employees are given access, and only 34% of staff make any use of connections where they are available. Durlacher rated only 1% of SMEs as fitting their profile of \"cutting edge\" internet users, while 10% were regarded as \"luddites\".</p> <p> Durlacher analyst Sarah Skinner says there is still a great deal of confusion about what smaller businesses should be doing with technology. \"The general message of the report was that there was movement, but there is a fair way to go in terms of being a power user - an aggressive user of a range of technologies,\" she says. </p> <p> \"As a starting point, though, the penetration of SMEs with internet access has grown to saturation point - about 90%. That's quite a jump, if you think that a year ago quite a lot of SMEs had no kind of connection at all. So basic usage is growing. \"But in terms of major investment, it has been very small, especially in e-commerce and e-commerce applications. There is confusion in the market: people know they have to be there, but don't know what to do.\"</p> <p> So what is holding back the country's smaller firms? There are a variety of factors, says Hands. \"Small businesses don't have anyone to nominate to take on technology projects, and often it's the business owner's own money being used,\" he points out. </p> <p>\"It's not like someone in a big company who's given \u00a3500,000 to go off and put in place an IT strategy. It's more basic - the owner/manager going out and deciding what's good. And often they can be confused by what's out there, because a lot of business owners are of an age that have missed being educated about high-tech at school. There are a lot of younger people starting up, but the average age of startups is still in the late 30s. There has to be an education campaign as well.\"</p> <p> There will be a growth spurt in investment, however, over the next 12 months. Durlacher estimates that while the average SME has not spent huge amounts so far (on average, around \u00a318,000 to date), the relative growth in e-commerce applications will be considerable - up to \u00a317,300 for small companies over the next year alone, and \u00a326,700 for larger SMEs. Perhaps encouraging this investment is the fact that businesses will be able to take advantage of an investment allowance introduced at the last budget, which will allow technology costs to be written off against profits for the next three years.</p> <p> Also making internet-related investment more attractive is the imminent fall in price of internet connections. Unmetered internet access, after months of wrangling and high-profile failures, is finally available to the mass market through dial-up ISPs such as AOL, meaning businesses can access the internet right through the working day without worrying about massive telephone bills. \"In business, people go on the net at peak time - lower rates will encourage a lot of people,\" points out Hands. </p> <p> But getting businesses online with cheaper net connections is, of course, only the beginning. What are they expected to do when they get online? \"The kind of thing that could get them online includes the government's initiative to allow tax returns to be submitted electronically, with a rebate on any returns you send in. It's not major money - \u00a350 here and there - but more people will get involved if they are more aware of opportunities like that,\" says Hands. \"Once they've invested in the technology they can look at other things; not selling to the consumer online, perhaps, but buying online from other suppliers certainly. It's a gradual learning process, and there's still a bit of work to do.\"</p> <p> <strong>Jargon-buster</strong><br></p> <p><strong>ADSL:</strong> Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line - a way of upgrading ordinary telephone lines to offer an always on, high speed link to the net for a flat fee. <strong>ASP: </strong>Application Service Provider - an online provider of software applications and services.</p> <p><strong>B2B: </strong>Businesses selling to other businesses.</p> <p><strong>B2C: </strong>Businesses selling to consumers.</p> <p><strong>Broadband: </strong>Fast data connections via ADSL or cable.</p> <p><strong>Trading hub: </strong>A community where buyers and sellers trade together in a central online location.</p> <p> \u0095 Neil McIntosh is deputy editor of the Online section</p>",

And often they can be confused by what's out there, because a lot of business owners are of an age that have missed being educated about high-tech at school. There are a lot of younger people starting up, but the average age of startups is still in the late 30s. There has to be an education campaign as well.\" There will be a growth spurt in investment, however, over the next 12 months. Durlacher estimates that while the average SME has not spent huge amounts so far (on average, around \u00a318,000 to date), the relative growth in e-commerce applications will be considerable - up to \u00a317,300 for small companies over the next year alone, and \u00a326,700 for larger SMEs. Perhaps encouraging this investment is the fact that businesses will be able to take advantage of an investment allowance introduced at the last budget, which will allow technology costs to be written off against profits for the next three years. Also making internet-related investment more attractive is the imminent fall in price of internet connections. Unmetered internet access, after months of wrangling and high-profile failures, is finally available to the mass market through dial-up ISPs such as AOL, meaning businesses can access the internet right through the working day without worrying about massive telephone bills. \"In business, people go on the net at peak time - lower rates will encourage a lot of people,\" points out Hands. But getting businesses online with cheaper net connections is, of course, only the beginning. What are they expected to do when they get online? \"The kind of thing that could get them online includes the government's initiative to allow tax returns to be submitted electronically, with a rebate on any returns you send in. It's not major money - \u00a350 here and there - but more people will get involved if they are more aware of opportunities like that,\" says Hands. \"Once they've invested in the technology they can look at other things; not selling to the consumer online, perhaps, but buying online from other suppliers certainly. It's a gradual learning process, and there's still a bit of work to do.\" Jargon-buster ADSL: Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line - a way of upgrading ordinary telephone lines to offer an always on, high speed link to the net for a flat fee. ASP: Application Service Provider - an online provider of software applications and services. B2B: Businesses selling to other businesses. B2C: Businesses selling to consumers. Broadband: Fast data connections via ADSL or cable. Trading hub: A community where buyers and sellers trade together in a central online location. \u0095 Neil McIntosh is deputy editor of the Online section",

In an attempt to shore up the credibility of the passenger fleet, the government suspended the operating licences of more than 60 Greek ferries pending safety upgrades. Most have since returned to service. Although the Express Samina had recently passed an inspection, prosecutors are investigating claims that the vessel had propulsion and steering problems. Since the Paros crash survivors, relatives and crew have filed compensation suits against MFD. Last week a court awarded \u00a3180,000 to one survivor. An appeal is pending. The company also faces criminal charges for \"exposing passengers to danger\". Mr Sfinias had been due to testify. Friends said yesterday that since the disaster he had been racked by remorse and guilt. They suggested that the pressure of the pending lawsuits was the final straw.",

      "bodyText": "President Jacques Chirac, on a whistlestop tour of European capitals, will meet Tony Blair in northern England tonight amid mounting fears that a Franco-German rift may threaten the success of next week's EU summit in Nice. Talk of a marked deterioration in the the two countries' relationship, long regarded as the engine that has powered post-war European integration, has been forcefully denied in Paris and Berlin. But last night France's European affairs minister, Pierre Moscovici, said Paris still opposed giving Berlin more votes in EU decision-making despite Germany's larger population since reunification. Disagreements over the summit's agenda, aimed at paving the way for new members to enter the bloc, as well as personal tension between French and German leaders and an apparent parting of ways on the future shape of Europe, have prompted some observers to warn that the summit in the French Riviera city is destined for failure. Mr Blair will host a pre-summit dinner for Mr Chirac in his Sedgefield constituency tonight. Britain is likely to abandon its national veto in around a third of the 50 policy issues up for discussion at the two-day summit, which begins next Friday, according to diplomatic predictions at the Foreign Office. But it would defend the six \"red lines\" it has drawn around tax, social security and other issues, Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said yesterday. The six cover several of the 50 options identified by the French EU presidency team as an opening negotiating tactic. Boosted by opinion polls which showed that voters backed the government's aggressive defence of an EU rapid reaction force, Mr Cook went on the pre-summit offensive again yesterday. He argued that a treaty of Nice preparing the way for the entry of up to 12 new EU members would be in the national interest. A \"strong Britain in a wider Europe\" would be good for trade, good for democracy and for London's influence. Signs of strain in Franco-German ties surfaced after an article by the French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, appeared in Le Monde attacking the \"pied pipers\" who had led Europe's citizens astray with overambitious visions. The comment was widely interpreted as an attack on his counterpart, Joschka Fischer, for his repeated calls for a federal Europe with its own elected president. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der insisted that all was well in the relationship, saying that \"those who talk of irritations are on a wild goose chase\". But Germany's opposition Christian Democrats have warned the summit risks collapse because Mr Schr\u00f6der has not devoted nearly enough time to nurturing the all-important ties with France since taking office in 1998. \"What is wrong in the German-French relationship?\" asked a leading Christian Democrat MP, Friedrich Merz. \"Do you really believe Nice can be a success when there are so many personality problems?\" Mr Schr\u00f6der, Mr Chirac and Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister, are not bound by the same European enthusiasm that fired their predecessors Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl - they are pro-European by reason rather than by passion. France's EU position is further complicated by the fact that both the Gaullist president and Socialist prime minister are likely to contest the presidential election in 2002. Germany fears France's political leadership will be effectively paralysed. Mr Schr\u00f6der is unwilling to throw himself wholeheartedly into a such an electorally sensitive project as EU expansion to the east without full French support The root of the tension lies in the fact that for many years France was the senior partner.

The smoke has yet to clear in the aftermath of the disastrous collapse of what was designed to be the crowning diplomatic achievement of the Clinton presidency - the launch of a new round of global trade talks.</p> <p>Twelve months on, the world's biggest trading powers - the European Union, the United States and Japan - appear to be further apart than ever, and developing countries still feel excluded from the inner sanctums of the World Trade Organisation. There are vague hopes in the capitals of western Europe and north America that a new trade round might be launched next autumn when trade ministers meet for the first time since Seattle.</p> <p>But given that no city anywhere in the world is prepared to risk a week of violent protest and the bad publicity which would almost certainly accompany the WTO's arrival in town, even finding a venue for their meeting is proving problematic. Abu Dhabi was supposed to host the next gathering but has bowed out.</p> <p>Optimists believe the changing of the guard at the White House in January will remove one of the big stumbling blocks to progress, the lack of any impetus from Washington during the election campaign.</p> <p>But with George W Bush looking likely to inherit the presidency, the optimists may be whistling in the wind. Mr Bush is an isolationist by temperament with no great regard for any of the pillars of the multilateral system, and his critics say he is in hock to the US corporate interests. Big business in the US wants a new trade round, but only on America's terms - greater access for their goods to foreign markets without competition from cheap goods from developing countries at home.</p> <p>The Americans are under less pressure than the Europeans to restart talks because at the end of the Uruguay round in 1993 it was decided that unfinished business in agriculture and services - Washington's main concerns - would be dealt with early this century, even if a comprehensive round of talks had not begun.</p> <p>Brussels, which has most to lose in agriculture particularly, wants a broad ranging round so it can trade off the painful concessions it must make in its heavily subsidised farm sector with gains elsewhere. As a sweetner Pascal Lamy, Europe's top trade negotiator has proposed duty and tariff-free access to the world's 48 poorest countries.</p> <p>Development lobby groups dismiss the EU offer as a sop. \"The north appears to be intent on ramming its agenda down the throats of the developing world,\" says Duncan Green, policy analyst for Cafod. \"The atmosphere is one of suspicion and cynicism, and few signs of a new deal for the world's poor.\"</p> <p>Privately, the politicians are aware of the problems facing the WTO. Seattle taught them that they can no longer afford to ride roughshod over the views of developing countries which now make up a majority of the WTO's 139 members.</p> <p>But ministers say privately that little been done since Seattle despite promises from Mike Moore, the WTO's director general, to institute reforms. The body spent much of the past year dealing with a series of acrimonious disputes between the EU and the US - one of side-effect of the failure to restart talks.

      "bodyText": "It is a year ago today since the tear gas cannisters began rattling down the streets of Seattle. The smoke has yet to clear in the aftermath of the disastrous collapse of what was designed to be the crowning diplomatic achievement of the Clinton presidency - the launch of a new round of global trade talks. Twelve months on, the world's biggest trading powers - the European Union, the United States and Japan - appear to be further apart than ever, and developing countries still feel excluded from the inner sanctums of the World Trade Organisation. There are vague hopes in the capitals of western Europe and north America that a new trade round might be launched next autumn when trade ministers meet for the first time since Seattle. But given that no city anywhere in the world is prepared to risk a week of violent protest and the bad publicity which would almost certainly accompany the WTO's arrival in town, even finding a venue for their meeting is proving problematic. Abu Dhabi was supposed to host the next gathering but has bowed out. Optimists believe the changing of the guard at the White House in January will remove one of the big stumbling blocks to progress, the lack of any impetus from Washington during the election campaign. But with George W Bush looking likely to inherit the presidency, the optimists may be whistling in the wind. Mr Bush is an isolationist by temperament with no great regard for any of the pillars of the multilateral system, and his critics say he is in hock to the US corporate interests. Big business in the US wants a new trade round, but only on America's terms - greater access for their goods to foreign markets without competition from cheap goods from developing countries at home. The Americans are under less pressure than the Europeans to restart talks because at the end of the Uruguay round in 1993 it was decided that unfinished business in agriculture and services - Washington's main concerns - would be dealt with early this century, even if a comprehensive round of talks had not begun. Brussels, which has most to lose in agriculture particularly, wants a broad ranging round so it can trade off the painful concessions it must make in its heavily subsidised farm sector with gains elsewhere. As a sweetner Pascal Lamy, Europe's top trade negotiator has proposed duty and tariff-free access to the world's 48 poorest countries. Development lobby groups dismiss the EU offer as a sop. \"The north appears to be intent on ramming its agenda down the throats of the developing world,\" says Duncan Green, policy analyst for Cafod. \"The atmosphere is one of suspicion and cynicism, and few signs of a new deal for the world's poor.\" Privately, the politicians are aware of the problems facing the WTO. Seattle taught them that they can no longer afford to ride roughshod over the views of developing countries which now make up a majority of the WTO's 139 members. But ministers say privately that little been done since Seattle despite promises from Mike Moore, the WTO's director general, to institute reforms. The body spent much of the past year dealing with a series of acrimonious disputes between the EU and the US - one of side-effect of the failure to restart talks. He has become a scapegoat for all that has not been fixed since Seattle, and many negotiators have written off his chances of launching a new round in 2002 when his term ends. He admits the WTO has taken over the mantle of the world's most unpopular organisation from the International Monetary Fund. Changing that image will require root and branch reform of the institution itself - making it more open and transparent. But it will also require a political push from the west and a willingness to look beyond their own electorates' interests, to offer a better deal for developing countries. Neither seems likely.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>These are strange times for the Conservative party, even by the increasingly strange standards they have so often adopted during the three-and-a-half year Hague era. Only William Hague himself gives off an aura of unflappable calm at the eye of the storm.</p> <p>At this stage in the electoral cycle, governments expect to be in trouble, losing byelections and being humiliated at the dispatch box while trailing in the polls by 20%. None of which currently applies to New Labour.</p> <p>This week even John Prescott twice saw off his tormenters in the Commons. \"I sometimes look at them and wish I could set up as a political consultant so I could offer them advice,'' one Labour cabinet minister said pityingly of the Opposition after they had let him off the hook yet again.</p> <p>Instead yesterday's Daily Telegraph, bible of the once-mighty army of Conservative activists, devoted an eight column page one headline to \"Portillo: I Don't Want To Be Leader.''</p> <p>It was an apparent repudiation of the widely held assumption that if Mr Hague does as badly as the polls suggest on May 3 many Tories will want to replace him with his shadow chancellor.</p> <p>There may have been wheels turning within Tory wheels over the report. The Telegraph is close to Hague, whereas the Times which had earlier reported a \"stop Widdecombe'' cabal boasts a strong pro-Portillo lobby among its officer class.</p> <p>Yesterday Portillo aides insisted that it was all very straightforward. Responding to the leadership question Mr Portillo had said he had \"no ambition to be leader of the Conservative party'' (what else could he say?). As for his alleged lost appetite for politics, he denied it.</p> <p>Yet many MPs believe that Mr Portillo is not the man he was, not the ambitious thruster who electrified his party conference as defence secretary with his \"who dares wins'' speech which aped the SAS. To some the wellspring of ambition seems broken. Opposition is not the Tory forte. Gordon Brown is a hard nut to crack when the economy is doing so well.</p> <p>Others express distaste and bewilderment about the shadow chancellor's \"compassionate conservatism'' speech at the Bournemouth conference last month. In terms of addressing the ''inclusive'' centre ground of politics it made sense.</p> <p>So have other Portillo changes like the attempt to scale down Hague's inflexible tax-and-spending pledge which is such an easy target for Labour - the \"\u00a316bn black hole'' which translates handily into \u00a324m worth of public spending cuts per constituency.</p> <p>But destructive forces like Norman Tebbit, who has not forgiven Portillo's admission of a gay sexual past, as well as Margaret Thatcher reinforce their party's atavistic impulse towards the social authoritarianism of the Daily Mail. They will not leave him to find his own path. He seems to lack Hague's bouncy resillience.</p> <p>Though old hands like Stephen Dorrell MP yesterday expressed the hope that their talented colleague will not drop out of politics it was also noticeable that none of Mr Hague's aides appeared to be wearing black armbands at the prospect. Quite the reverse.</p> <p>If that was not enough Monday's Daily Mail had carried an interview with Mr Hague. The Tory leader was relentlessly cheerful about his prospects, though in fairness the interview was conducted before the voters of West Bromwich West destroyed Tory hopes of winning at least one of Thursday's three Labour-held byelections.</p> <p>The disappointed Mail marked its interview by adding a hatchet job analysis of Mr Hague's performance: a nice guy presiding over an incoherent political message and a bunch of shadow ministers who are nowhere near as energetic as the one he sacked, John Redwood.</p> <p>The Mail's editorial complained that Fleet Street does a better job opposing Tony Blair. Next day the Sun also took a poke at Mr Hague. Tory MPs with small majorities are getting jittery.</p> <p>\"The Lib Dems were second in my constituency last time. Their candidate is busy and Labour won't select one until close to polling day, just to help them,'' predicted one gloomy southern MP whose majority is below the 3,000 vote level.</p> <p>\"There is a sense of shadow ministers distancing themselves from William Hague, an air of detatchment,'' reports one academic who often talks in private to politicians. The Tory leader's habit of surrounding himself with unthreatening acolytes - notably Olympic ex-champion, Lord Seb Coe - enhances that feeling. He rarely discusses policy with shadow colleagues one-on-one.</p> <p>The brutal fact is that Labour spin doctors' confident assessments of where the Tory strategy has landed Mr Hague are often vindicated by the opinion polls. When the Telegraph's Gallup poll quizzed voters about the EU's new rapid reaction force (RRF) - against which the paper railed noisily last week - it found that more thought it a good idea (48%) than a bad one (34%).</p> <p>Not unreasonably, some Tory officials argue that polls can be unreliable and the mood of voters is volatile, as the September fuel protest briefly showed. \"Labour has increased taxes, yet failed to deliver on its promises or meet the public expectations it aroused,'' one said yesterday.</p> <p>But Her Majesty's official opposition is not well placed to cash in. Ann Widdecombe's efforts to reflect genuine public alarm about crime, drug policy or asylum have recoiled against her. This week she backtracked on her costly plans to lock up all asylum seekers pending their assessement.</p> <p>So it would be reasonable to assume that Hague would be the jittery introspective one and Widdecombe a busted flush whose hopes of winning a second round play-off ( MPs shortlist, but activists pick the winner under Hague-created rules) have crumbled.</p> <p>Instead the \"stop Widdecombe'' shadow ministers are said to be urging John Redwood and Iain Duncan Smith (a dark horse in any leadership stakes) to stand if William stumbles so as to soak up some of her votes.</p> <p>They rarely think of Ken Clarke, though he is still waiting for the call, cigar in hand at Nottingham-les-deux-Eglises. Hague, whose idyllic family childhood in Rotherham was recently filmed for TV (14 pints and all), appears to be unphased by it all. However misplaced, he does has self-belief. And it may be misplaced. Some MPs recall how the then Welsh secretary predicted the Tories could win 13 Welsh seats in 1997. They got none.</p>",

      "bodyText": "These are strange times for the Conservative party, even by the increasingly strange standards they have so often adopted during the three-and-a-half year Hague era. Only William Hague himself gives off an aura of unflappable calm at the eye of the storm. At this stage in the electoral cycle, governments expect to be in trouble, losing byelections and being humiliated at the dispatch box while trailing in the polls by 20%. None of which currently applies to New Labour. This week even John Prescott twice saw off his tormenters in the Commons. \"I sometimes look at them and wish I could set up as a political consultant so I could offer them advice,'' one Labour cabinet minister said pityingly of the Opposition after they had let him off the hook yet again. Instead yesterday's Daily Telegraph, bible of the once-mighty army of Conservative activists, devoted an eight column page one headline to \"Portillo: I Don't Want To Be Leader.'' It was an apparent repudiation of the widely held assumption that if Mr Hague does as badly as the polls suggest on May 3 many Tories will want to replace him with his shadow chancellor. There may have been wheels turning within Tory wheels over the report. The Telegraph is close to Hague, whereas the Times which had earlier reported a \"stop Widdecombe'' cabal boasts a strong pro-Portillo lobby among its officer class. Yesterday Portillo aides insisted that it was all very straightforward. Responding to the leadership question Mr Portillo had said he had \"no ambition to be leader of the Conservative party'' (what else could he say?). As for his alleged lost appetite for politics, he denied it. Yet many MPs believe that Mr Portillo is not the man he was, not the ambitious thruster who electrified his party conference as defence secretary with his \"who dares wins'' speech which aped the SAS. To some the wellspring of ambition seems broken. Opposition is not the Tory forte. Gordon Brown is a hard nut to crack when the economy is doing so well. Others express distaste and bewilderment about the shadow chancellor's \"compassionate conservatism'' speech at the Bournemouth conference last month. In terms of addressing the ''inclusive'' centre ground of politics it made sense. So have other Portillo changes like the attempt to scale down Hague's inflexible tax-and-spending pledge which is such an easy target for Labour - the \"\u00a316bn black hole'' which translates handily into \u00a324m worth of public spending cuts per constituency. But destructive forces like Norman Tebbit, who has not forgiven Portillo's admission of a gay sexual past, as well as Margaret Thatcher reinforce their party's atavistic impulse towards the social authoritarianism of the Daily Mail. They will not leave him to find his own path. He seems to lack Hague's bouncy resillience. Though old hands like Stephen Dorrell MP yesterday expressed the hope that their talented colleague will not drop out of politics it was also noticeable that none of Mr Hague's aides appeared to be wearing black armbands at the prospect. Quite the reverse. If that was not enough Monday's Daily Mail had carried an interview with Mr Hague. The Tory leader was relentlessly cheerful about his prospects, though in fairness the interview was conducted before the voters of West Bromwich West destroyed Tory hopes of winning at least one of Thursday's three Labour-held byelections. The disappointed Mail marked its interview by adding a hatchet job analysis of Mr Hague's performance: a nice guy presiding over an incoherent political message and a bunch of shadow ministers who are nowhere near as energetic as the one he sacked, John Redwood. The Mail's editorial complained that Fleet Street does a better job opposing Tony Blair. Next day the Sun also took a poke at Mr Hague. Tory MPs with small majorities are getting jittery. \"The Lib Dems were second in my constituency last time. Their candidate is busy and Labour won't select one until close to polling day, just to help them,'' predicted one gloomy southern MP whose majority is below the 3,000 vote level. \"There is a sense of shadow ministers distancing themselves from William Hague, an air of detatchment,'' reports one academic who often talks in private to politicians. The Tory leader's habit of surrounding himself with unthreatening acolytes - notably Olympic ex-champion, Lord Seb Coe - enhances that feeling. He rarely discusses policy with shadow colleagues one-on-one. The brutal fact is that Labour spin doctors' confident assessments of where the Tory strategy has landed Mr Hague are often vindicated by the opinion polls. When the Telegraph's Gallup poll quizzed voters about the EU's new rapid reaction force (RRF) - against which the paper railed noisily last week - it found that more thought it a good idea (48%) than a bad one (34%). Not unreasonably, some Tory officials argue that polls can be unreliable and the mood of voters is volatile, as the September fuel protest briefly showed. \"Labour has increased taxes, yet failed to deliver on its promises or meet the public expectations it aroused,'' one said yesterday. But Her Majesty's official opposition is not well placed to cash in. Ann Widdecombe's efforts to reflect genuine public alarm about crime, drug policy or asylum have recoiled against her. This week she backtracked on her costly plans to lock up all asylum seekers pending their assessement. So it would be reasonable to assume that Hague would be the jittery introspective one and Widdecombe a busted flush whose hopes of winning a second round play-off ( MPs shortlist, but activists pick the winner under Hague-created rules) have crumbled. Instead the \"stop Widdecombe'' shadow ministers are said to be urging John Redwood and Iain Duncan Smith (a dark horse in any leadership stakes) to stand if William stumbles so as to soak up some of her votes. They rarely think of Ken Clarke, though he is still waiting for the call, cigar in hand at Nottingham-les-deux-Eglises. Hague, whose idyllic family childhood in Rotherham was recently filmed for TV (14 pints and all), appears to be unphased by it all. However misplaced, he does has self-belief. And it may be misplaced. Some MPs recall how the then Welsh secretary predicted the Tories could win 13 Welsh seats in 1997. They got none.",

It is estimated the equipment can easily fetch up to 80% of its full retail price in this way and provide handsome profits for the thieves.

      "bodyText": "City detectives yesterday raided a gang of computer thieves who are believed to be responsible for a string of multi-million pound attacks on major banks. Eleven men were arrested during dawn raids carried out at 20 addresses across the capital by more than 150 officers from City of London police and Scotland Yard. The operation, which used the codenames Wheelwright and Regis, recovered a haul of stolen computer equipment, two replica hand guns and a quantity of drugs. The investigation was launched after a spate of burglaries at universities, institutions and IT firms across the country - some \u00a315m worth of equipment has been stolen since March. These valuable components, mainly processing units which act as a computer's brain, cost up to \u00a350,000 each and are said to be \"powerful enough to run the Iraqi defence system\". Most of the sought-after parts are made by Sun Microsystems but a black market has evolved as the company appears to be unable to keep up with demand. It is estimated the equipment can easily fetch up to 80% of its full retail price in this way and provide handsome profits for the thieves. Products made by Dell, Compaq and Cisco are also highly prized. Police believe those behind the thefts are part of a \"pool of burglars\" who started out by attacking universities which often have highly technical equipment but rarely the security to match. Detective Inspector Richard Jack, from Islington CID, said some of the attacks had been violent, with the victims tied up while the robbery was carried out. \"They have gone from universities to having the confidence to start hitting City banks,\" he said. \"This stuff is being stolen to order, but we don't know where it's going. It could be recycled in this country or it could be going abroad.\" City institutions are now so worried by the attacks that they have put up a \u00a3100,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible. The latest theft, believed to have taken place at Deutsche Bank last week, resulted in the loss of 49 pieces of equipment valued at \u00a31.6m, although the bank is rumoured to have suffered \u00a325m trading losses. Four other banks are also understood to have fallen victim. \"These computer parts are the tools of the trade for City banks,\" said a City of London police spokesman. \"Potentially, if a bank or institution loses its computers, until they are replaced it is not able to trade.\" According to figures released by the Association of British Insurers, computer theft now costs British firms \u00a31bn a year, and can be enough to close them down. Yesterday's operation, which followed weeks of covert surveillance and information gathering, was launched from the police station in Wood Street - right at the very heart of the City. A convoy of vehicles, mainly plain saloons and vans, then left for the destinations - 18 of which were in Islington, with the other two in East Ham and Fulham. At the stroke of 7am, as daylight broke in drizzling rain, officers began breaking down the doors of houses with red battering rams, known as enforcers, arresting suspects and searching properties. At one flat on the Bemerton Estate in Islington a suspect tried to climb out of an upstairs window wearing just his underwear before finally giving himself up to officers. He was then wearing a dark blue Nike sports top and jeans, bundled into the back of an unmarked police car. Insp Jack said: \"It will certainly disrupt this gang for some time to come, but it's a matter of who takes their place because the rewards for this type of crime are substantial. \"That is why we are trying to find out who is handling the property.\" Those arrested were still being questioned by detectives last night. They can be held for up to 36 hours without any charge being made. The maximum jail sentence for aggravated burglary is 14 years.",

The French chief executive has trumpeted the advantages of this communication sector for building his business. Now he needs to learn the art of better communications with his investors.</p> <p><strong>Gatecrashers</strong></p> <p>Trust the Americans to spoil the party. Just as the euro was beginning to tick up a touch on the foreign exchanges, along comes the dollar to take a bite out of the recovery on the back of better than expected US growth numbers.</p> <p>But pause for a moment. In recent days the foreign exchange options market has begun to suggest there is more risk of the dollar going down against the euro than up - albeit it only just.</p> <p>It may be, as some would suggest, that the euro is simply the least worst buy in the currency market at present. Opinion is still divided as to whether the US economy is on course for a hard or a soft landing.</p> <p>There is still an element of political uncertainty. In Japan the administration has a dead duck look, while the issue is not which type of landing is on the cards but whether the Japanese economy will ever get off the ground.</p> <p>As for the euro - well, things could hardly get worse, could they? Actually what is interesting about the euro's move briefly back above 86 cents yesterday is that it came despite rather gloomy news from Europe, including Tuesday's GDP figures from Germany, the single currency zone's biggest economy.</p> <p>What may be happening is that rather than looking for excuses to sell the single currency, big players in the foreign exchange markets are looking instead for reasons to offload the dollar.</p> <p>That is still a long way from saying anyone actually wants to buy the euro for its own sake. And it is a very long way indeed from the theoretical models to which the European commission drew attention yesterday and which suggest the single currency is 20%-25% below its medium term equilibrium levels, whatever they are. Still, it could be a start.</p> <p><strong>Minced words</strong></p> <p>The highly paid bankers and lawyers who draw up bid documents should look to their dictionaries to end the growing practice of referring to \"irrevocable undertakings\", which are nothing of the kind. Yesterday's \u00a3322m bid for the Hewden Stuart plant hire business is a typical example of the practice.</p> <p>The advisers refer to large irrevocable undertakings to accept the bid but add they will cease to be binding if something else happens. The dictionary defines irrevocable as \"not able to be revoked, changed or undone, unalterable\". The word these City brains should use is \"conditional\". It might not have the same ring of unswerving support as irrevocable, but is at least correct.</p>",

That deal has been a disaster. There were suggestions early on that Sema had overpaid, and that the technology used by LHS was not as cutting-edge as had been made out. Regulatory delays compounded the difficulties and the profit warning issued by Sema last Friday - stemming directly from LHS, whose performance had \"significantly deteriorated\" - seemed inevitable. In fact irate investors are now questioning how much was known about the precarious position of LHS in the run-up to the Sema deal and whether all this information was disclosed publicly. At the very least, Mr Bonelli is going to have his work cut out for him explaining to investors at hurriedly organised meetings next week that he acted as quickly as he could to make public these problems. The relevance of this to the breaking of stock exchange regulations in the share sale fiasco is that Mr Lademacher is either casual in his reading of rules or dismissive of them. So could Mr Lademacher be lined up as a scapegoat for wider blame if Mr Bonelli needs to save his own bacon? At least on Mr Bonelli's side is the fact there are few big shareholders to rock the boat - aside from France Telecom and BNP Paribas, which may be more supportive than some American and British institutions.

Gatecrashers Trust the Americans to spoil the party. Just as the euro was beginning to tick up a touch on the foreign exchanges, along comes the dollar to take a bite out of the recovery on the back of better than expected US growth numbers. But pause for a moment. In recent days the foreign exchange options market has begun to suggest there is more risk of the dollar going down against the euro than up - albeit it only just. It may be, as some would suggest, that the euro is simply the least worst buy in the currency market at present. Opinion is still divided as to whether the US economy is on course for a hard or a soft landing. There is still an element of political uncertainty. In Japan the administration has a dead duck look, while the issue is not which type of landing is on the cards but whether the Japanese economy will ever get off the ground. As for the euro - well, things could hardly get worse, could they? Actually what is interesting about the euro's move briefly back above 86 cents yesterday is that it came despite rather gloomy news from Europe, including Tuesday's GDP figures from Germany, the single currency zone's biggest economy. What may be happening is that rather than looking for excuses to sell the single currency, big players in the foreign exchange markets are looking instead for reasons to offload the dollar. That is still a long way from saying anyone actually wants to buy the euro for its own sake. And it is a very long way indeed from the theoretical models to which the European commission drew attention yesterday and which suggest the single currency is 20%-25% below its medium term equilibrium levels, whatever they are. Still, it could be a start. Minced words The highly paid bankers and lawyers who draw up bid documents should look to their dictionaries to end the growing practice of referring to \"irrevocable undertakings\", which are nothing of the kind. Yesterday's \u00a3322m bid for the Hewden Stuart plant hire business is a typical example of the practice. The advisers refer to large irrevocable undertakings to accept the bid but add they will cease to be binding if something else happens. The dictionary defines irrevocable as \"not able to be revoked, changed or undone, unalterable\". The word these City brains should use is \"conditional\". It might not have the same ring of unswerving support as irrevocable, but is at least correct.",

      "bodyText": "The British venture capital sector yesterday was accused of failing start-up businesses and growing rich on the back of established companies. The charge came in a new report from the Institute for Public Policy Research, which sought to explain why only 8% of venture capital was used for seedcorn investment compared to 24% in Germany and 31% in the US. Rebecca Harding, author of the centre-left think-tank's review, said the figures pointed to the part-failure of government policies to encourage venture capitalists to support new businesses. Britain was unique among those countries studied in having an \"equity gap\" between what businesses needed and what venture capitalists were prepared to provide. \"Despite the fact that the British venture capital market is the largest and most developed in Europe, our venture capital funds are disproportionately reluctant in comparison with their overseas counterparts to invest in high-risk business at a very early stage,\" said Ms Harding. But the British Venture Capital Association believed the IPPR figures were misleading, and pointed out that start-ups were by nature small scale affairs taking up relatively small amounts of money compared with that placed elsewhere. David Thorp, chairman of the Association and managing director of Friends Ivory &amp; Sime Private Equity, said the IPPR figures represented reasonable historic data but that the situation had changed. \"The last six months show a shift from late to early stage funding of businesses in Britain,\" Mr Thorp explained. Ms Harding said government policies in Germany and elsewhere helped by putting up public money alongside private investment.

      "bodyText": "The Church of England has written to all 13,000 parishes in the country asking whether they would like to have mobile telephone aerials concealed in their steeples. The move is seen as a potential money-spinner for churches weighed down by restoration costs, but they are being assured that the bats in their belfries will not be disturbed. Parishes are being asked to respond by the end of January to agree to allowing the church to negotiate on their behalf with potential operating companies. They are being lured with suggestions of annual rentals for aerials of \u00a35,000 - more in some urban areas - and a share of operating profits, which they can put towards church repairs. The mobile phone network is expanding rapidly with operators planning to have 87% of their coverage in place by 2007. It is estimated that 11,000 new aerial sites and 50,000 cell sites will be needed by 2004 to reach operators' targets. Richard Hopgood, the Archbishops' Council's director of policy, said: \"Doing nothing is not an option. Churches are already being approached by operators and it is a fairly unusual opportunity for us.\" Several dozen churches have already accepted radio aerials, including Guildford Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, described by Elizabeth I as the \"fairest and comeliest parish church in all England\" which has an aerial hidden in its spire. Norwich's Roman Catholic cathedral is also getting an aerial. Church officials believe some parishes may already have been ripped off by companies persuading them to lease the use of towers too cheaply. Vicars and parish councils are being told that the aerials will be safe and that regulations will prevent churches inadvertently transmitting sex chat lines.",

      "body": "<p>Six months ago, Britain deployed a rapid reaction force in Sierra Leone. The operation took only 48 hours, which even the Americans said they could never have done. At some point, though, the British troops were meant to come home. After rescuing European civilians, and helping restore a measure of stability while the UN got its act together, the intervention was thought likely to be at an end. The implied limit was about three months. Yet there are now 750 British military personnel in Sierra Leone, more not fewer than six months ago, and, the MoD quietly announced last week, they will be there for six more months.</p> <p>Behind this lies an unwritten story, which is not just military and not just about Sierra Leone. A new wind of change is blowing from London through Africa. This is not a publicly debated strategy. It is something more personal. By far the strongest pulse behind it is the prime minister's own sense of mission. The exercise may not be about territorial imperialism, but has a lot to do with converting the heathen to good government. Tony Blair is on a quiet crusade to help Africa, and do the British duty. Benign though this may be, it is strange that almost nobody knows about it.</p> <p>Before Christmas it is due to acquire more definition, with the report of a cabinet committee, which Blair set up under Clare Short. Ms Short is one of Blair's favourite ministers, and had something to do with his awakening. With two-thirds of her budget spent there, she is in effect the cabinet minister for Africa, though placing Peter Hain at the Foreign Office last year was part of the conscious choice to give Africa a higher profile. Hain, South African by origin and campaigner by formation, set about putting his continent on the map. A by-product of the signals from Downing St has been the elevation of Africa from its third division status among FCO careerists. Postings there are now sought after by younger diplomats.</p> <p>This is no doubt because of Blair's ambitious plans. The Short committee will come up with recommendations for a bigger British role in peace-keeping, and in military and police training. The two most potent African countries, South Africa and Nigeria, troubled though they are, will always be the linchpins on which outsiders must rely. But the Blair initiatives are meant to find new roles for Britain, after the Jubilee 2000 campaigns, beyond the familiar territory of aid and debt relief.</p> <p>Alongside that is an embryonic concept of partnership between OECD developed countries and the \"good\" African countries that are thought to be making headway towards uncorrupt government and liberal economics. This is still being worked up, but if it makes persuasive sense Uganda, Botswana, Senegal, Mali and Mozambique could be assigned to partner-godfathers in the developed world, to help them sustain their comparative economic success. This is what Blair would like to start putting to selected OECD members early in 2001.</p> <p>Though Ms Short had a role, nobody seems sure where Blair discovered his enthusiasm for Africa. Unlike John Major, he had no youthful experience there. Unlike Harold Macmillan, he's devoid of the inherited historical awareness that bestowed on leaders of the postwar period a taste for strategic grandeur. If anything, the Blair Africanism is part of the self-instruction that has enlightened him to the scale of the worlds that now touch him. He is an urgent and fascinated learner. No other prime minister has devoted time, as he has, to reading the Koran. Likewise, none has surely asked for special briefings on the Congo, the part of Africa that apparently most fascinates him, for its size, mineral wealth and massive potential for good or ill at the heart of darkness.</p> <p>Within this oddly covert plan, the decision to keep an indefinite British presence in Sierra Leone is less surprising than it would have seemed if announced last May. Of the 750, about 400 are soldiers, the rest sailors and airmen. On the face of it, they are there to train the Sierra Leone army, but the commitment is obviously deeper than that. A new headquarters group of 100 was announced last week, together with a reaffirmed promise that this group, as well as supporting the trainers and thereby helping the UN mission, would be there to support, if required, another rapid reaction capability of up to 5,000 British personnel. This seems more in line with one of the objectives defined by Robin Cook last June, when the original force was digging in. Among its purposes, he startlingly stated then, was \"to rebuild Sierra Leone\".</p> <p>Sierra Leone thus appears in the frontline of a more expansive British dream, of becoming a player in Africa once again. There are practical gains that might follow. It can be made to fit into a strategy of British interest. Wanting to export, we need growing markets in the developing world. Without political stability, these markets have little chance of creating the prosperity British business could help to feed. So there is self-interest in mission. Avoidable disaster beckons. Unless, with outside help, Aids is somehow held in check, whole countries will be decimated, perhaps, like Malawi, losing a quarter of the cabinet and a sixth of the teachers to the disease. But self-interest is not the driving-force behind the new British commitment. That has more to do with Blair's own sense of moral duty, combined with his belief that this prosperous and multi-soldiered country has the capacity to do the work. When defending the intervention in Kosovo, he formulated a doctrine of which Sierra Leone turns out to be the next beneficiary, and is unlikely to be the last. The finest army in the world, he thinks, can train a bad one. A stable government can teach a weak one how to build the institutions that might make it stronger. A rich country should be available to keep the peace in poor ones. And so forth.</p> <p>This is a distinct and novel foreign policy. Yet it has never been spelled out this way by Tony Blair or Robin Cook. Nor, of course, has it been debated in parliament. Indignation on that point last week, over the creation of the European rapid reaction force, was patently synthetic. The European defence initiative, which originated in Tory times, has been fully signalled and much discussed. The pretence that the EDI is another exercise in Euro-stealth smacks of the familiar phobic routines of Euro-mendacity. This African policy, by contrast, is new. In principle there's much to be said for it. Service chiefs are said to be pleased to have 750 men on active duty in a theatre where they might see some action. But for how long? To what wider end? With which allies? In what uncontrollable circumstances? Pursuing what relationship with the UN? On what assessment of Britain's strategic and \"moral\" interest? In other times, it would have been inconceivable that this kind of new priority was established without consulting the wisdom of parliament and notifying the country. Even when doing good, the Blair instinct is to keep things quiet rather than open up for an uncontrolled debate.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

Yet there are now 750 British military personnel in Sierra Leone, more not fewer than six months ago, and, the MoD quietly announced last week, they will be there for six more months. Behind this lies an unwritten story, which is not just military and not just about Sierra Leone. A new wind of change is blowing from London through Africa. This is not a publicly debated strategy. It is something more personal. By far the strongest pulse behind it is the prime minister's own sense of mission. The exercise may not be about territorial imperialism, but has a lot to do with converting the heathen to good government. Tony Blair is on a quiet crusade to help Africa, and do the British duty. Benign though this may be, it is strange that almost nobody knows about it. Before Christmas it is due to acquire more definition, with the report of a cabinet committee, which Blair set up under Clare Short. Ms Short is one of Blair's favourite ministers, and had something to do with his awakening. With two-thirds of her budget spent there, she is in effect the cabinet minister for Africa, though placing Peter Hain at the Foreign Office last year was part of the conscious choice to give Africa a higher profile. Hain, South African by origin and campaigner by formation, set about putting his continent on the map. A by-product of the signals from Downing St has been the elevation of Africa from its third division status among FCO careerists. Postings there are now sought after by younger diplomats. This is no doubt because of Blair's ambitious plans. The Short committee will come up with recommendations for a bigger British role in peace-keeping, and in military and police training. The two most potent African countries, South Africa and Nigeria, troubled though they are, will always be the linchpins on which outsiders must rely. But the Blair initiatives are meant to find new roles for Britain, after the Jubilee 2000 campaigns, beyond the familiar territory of aid and debt relief. Alongside that is an embryonic concept of partnership between OECD developed countries and the \"good\" African countries that are thought to be making headway towards uncorrupt government and liberal economics. This is still being worked up, but if it makes persuasive sense Uganda, Botswana, Senegal, Mali and Mozambique could be assigned to partner-godfathers in the developed world, to help them sustain their comparative economic success. This is what Blair would like to start putting to selected OECD members early in 2001. Though Ms Short had a role, nobody seems sure where Blair discovered his enthusiasm for Africa. Unlike John Major, he had no youthful experience there. Unlike Harold Macmillan, he's devoid of the inherited historical awareness that bestowed on leaders of the postwar period a taste for strategic grandeur. If anything, the Blair Africanism is part of the self-instruction that has enlightened him to the scale of the worlds that now touch him. He is an urgent and fascinated learner. No other prime minister has devoted time, as he has, to reading the Koran. Likewise, none has surely asked for special briefings on the Congo, the part of Africa that apparently most fascinates him, for its size, mineral wealth and massive potential for good or ill at the heart of darkness. Within this oddly covert plan, the decision to keep an indefinite British presence in Sierra Leone is less surprising than it would have seemed if announced last May. Of the 750, about 400 are soldiers, the rest sailors and airmen. On the face of it, they are there to train the Sierra Leone army, but the commitment is obviously deeper than that. A new headquarters group of 100 was announced last week, together with a reaffirmed promise that this group, as well as supporting the trainers and thereby helping the UN mission, would be there to support, if required, another rapid reaction capability of up to 5,000 British personnel. This seems more in line with one of the objectives defined by Robin Cook last June, when the original force was digging in. Among its purposes, he startlingly stated then, was \"to rebuild Sierra Leone\". Sierra Leone thus appears in the frontline of a more expansive British dream, of becoming a player in Africa once again. There are practical gains that might follow. It can be made to fit into a strategy of British interest. Wanting to export, we need growing markets in the developing world. Without political stability, these markets have little chance of creating the prosperity British business could help to feed. So there is self-interest in mission. Avoidable disaster beckons. Unless, with outside help, Aids is somehow held in check, whole countries will be decimated, perhaps, like Malawi, losing a quarter of the cabinet and a sixth of the teachers to the disease. But self-interest is not the driving-force behind the new British commitment. That has more to do with Blair's own sense of moral duty, combined with his belief that this prosperous and multi-soldiered country has the capacity to do the work. When defending the intervention in Kosovo, he formulated a doctrine of which Sierra Leone turns out to be the next beneficiary, and is unlikely to be the last. The finest army in the world, he thinks, can train a bad one. A stable government can teach a weak one how to build the institutions that might make it stronger. A rich country should be available to keep the peace in poor ones. And so forth. This is a distinct and novel foreign policy. Yet it has never been spelled out this way by Tony Blair or Robin Cook. Nor, of course, has it been debated in parliament. Indignation on that point last week, over the creation of the European rapid reaction force, was patently synthetic. The European defence initiative, which originated in Tory times, has been fully signalled and much discussed. The pretence that the EDI is another exercise in Euro-stealth smacks of the familiar phobic routines of Euro-mendacity. This African policy, by contrast, is new. In principle there's much to be said for it. Service chiefs are said to be pleased to have 750 men on active duty in a theatre where they might see some action. But for how long? To what wider end? With which allies? In what uncontrollable circumstances? Pursuing what relationship with the UN? On what assessment of Britain's strategic and \"moral\" interest? In other times, it would have been inconceivable that this kind of new priority was established without consulting the wisdom of parliament and notifying the country. Even when doing good, the Blair instinct is to keep things quiet rather than open up for an uncontrolled debate. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

Two recent images of Monod illustrate the passions of a man who described himself as \"an anarchist Christian\". Almost blind and deaf, he was filmed, at the age of 93, stumbling through the Sahara with a Touareg assistant, searching for another example of monodellia flexuosa, a desert flower he had discovered in 1940. This physical and scientific obstinacy is complemented by memories of a bent, old man with a white cane during recent demonstrations in support of decent housing for poor immigrant families in Paris. The link between the desert and the urban protester was clear; Monod wore a camel brooch on the lapel of his threadbare, three-piece suit. After more than 70 years of exploration in the Sahara, a region that was \"beautiful, clean and never lied\", Monod said the vast emptiness had only two conquerors - \"the camel and the goat\". Modesty at his own achievements in changing scientific perception of the western desert contrasted with his admiration for the nomads, soldiers and administrators who had tried to keep up with him during exhausting, near-mystical journeys through what he called his \"diocese\". Born in Rouen to a Protestant family, and with five generations of pastors behind him, Monod appeared destined for missionary work from birth. But on moving to the left bank in Paris with his family at the age of five, his real vocation was formed by a visit to the Jardin des Plantes - \"an enchanted world which I never quit\", as he wrote in his autobiography, Le Chercheur Absolu. By the time he was 14, he had developed the rigorous scientific methods of a born naturalist, with a report on the zoological and botanical features of Provence. A year later, he created his own natural science society, with a bulletin called Le Martin-P\u00eacheur (The Kingfisher). He had already installed a telescope in the family bathroom, prefiguring a fascination for other disciplines, including biology, geology and anthropology. The scholarship Monod displayed during his degree course in natural sciences at the Sorbonne was rewarded by his first period of practical exploration, aboard a French naval vessel studying sea-life off Brittany in 1920, a logical step towards his admission to the Paris natural history museum, whose most influential researcher of the century he was to become. But it was an expedition to study fish off the coast of Mauritania a year later that led to his passion for the Sahara, where his name gained the same ascetic renown as that of the reclusive French missionary, P\u00e8re Charles de Foucauld, who died in 1916. According to his own account, Monod set out on foot to reach Dakar to overcome an unhappy love affair. In the 70 years that followed, he undertook several epic journeys on foot, covering thousands of kilometres, accompanying camel caravans and collecting hundreds of insects, plants and fossils. One of his best-known discoveries was the skeleton of the Asselar Man, dating back to the neolithic era in Mauritania. Until the end of his life, he searched in vain for a giant meteor that fell on the desert during the first world war.

Recalled and disciplined, he became an active resistance worker, issuing pamphlets condemning the Vichy regime and broadcasting his opposition to its anti-semitic policies from Dakar, where he welcomed De Gaulle in 1944. Three years after the war, Monod joined the Swiss underwater pioneer, Auguste Piccard, during the first experiments with the bathyscaphe, and, in 1954, descended to 1,450 metres off the African coast. His most intensive Saharan journeys took place between 1956 and 1964 when, among other scientific work, he described prehistoric cave paintings in the Hoggar mountains, part of what he saw as his work as an \"encyclopaedist looking at the departure point of human adventure\".

      "body": "<p>When the time comes for the story of British art in the 1990s to be written, there will have to be a whole chapter on Michael Craig-Martin. Today he is a painter of household objects in acid colours. But it is his influence on younger artists that is extraordinary. As a tutor at Goldsmiths College in the late 1980s, he was acknowledged as an inspirational figure by Damien Hirst and other hardcore young British artists. He was also an influential Tate trustee throughout the 1990s and a key force in the creation of Tate Modern, for which he co-designed the purple light on top of the chimney. You could play a great art-world game called Six Degrees of Michael Craig-Martin. </p> <p>So it's a surprise to discover, talking to him on the eve of his retirement as Millard professor at Goldsmiths, that far from expressing quiet contentment, he has serious anxieties about the state of the visual arts in Britain, or at least about the state of art education. </p> <p>\"The whole nature of education has changed dramatically in the past 15 to 20 years; this is true at every level of education and it certainly has had an impact on art education,\" he says. </p> <p>What Craig-Martin worries about is an insidious growth in academicism. Artists have been drawn more than ever before into the university ethos, into certain patterns of activity and assessment that are associated with university education. All the models that are being used come from the academic world. People take PhDs in fine art; this is something that either didn't happen in the past or was at least very rare. </p> <p>This academicism is the opposite of the approach that Craig-Martin is famous for. The Goldsmiths class of the late 1980s, which included Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Mat Collishaw, Gary Hume, Simon Patterson - all of whom appeared in the show Freeze, curated by Hirst when he was still a student - were about as far from academically oriented perpetual students as it is possible to be. They were openly ambitious. They wanted, and got, careers as artists. This was a result of the way they were taught. At Goldsmiths, teachers including Craig-Martin and Jon Thompson had developed since the 1970s a style of teaching geared to producing artists rather than art teachers. </p> <p>\"Our model was, what is the nature of the world into which they leave? What's expected of an artist? Is there an equivalent of a painting department out in the world, and the equivalent of a sculpture department out in the world? The answer is no.\" Now Goldsmiths is changing. The academics are taking over. </p> <p>The next Millard professor will be Victor Burgin, an art theorist as well as an artist. Burgin makes photo-based artworks that are essentially illustrations of his academic writings. Despite coming from the same conceptual art generation of the 1970s - Craig-Martin acknowledges that it was Burgin who helped him get his first job at an art school - Burgin couldn't be further removed in his attitude to art. His artworks deconstruct Hitchcock, or stage cinematic scenarios with Lacanian subtexts. </p> <p>Of academic practices generally, Craig-Martin says, \"I feel uneasy about whether these formats are the ones that best enable people to have the kind of creative courage that's needed to be artists.\" Contemporary art, he says in a rather more relaxed way than Sir Nicholas Serota did in last week's Dimbleby Lecture, is in Britain to stay: the London art scene has an energy that is not going to go away. Nevertheless, he admits, \"That energy there was at the beginning with that particular group of people, that's not easily repeatable.\" </p> <p>This is something that is already affecting the art in galleries. More and more art, it seems, is being made with one eye on theory. Photo-based artists in particular, with the exception of Turner winner Wolfgang Tillmans, seem to be trying to conform to the writings of American academics such as Rosalind Krauss, Hal Foster and others associated with the journal October. Some academics, complains Craig-Martin, \"exercise an authority that would be considered shocking if they were artists\". The October group see themselves as overturning the high modernist word of Clement Greenberg, champion of the abstract expressionists, in favour of a feminist and queer postmodernism. But they seem to have more of a stranglehold over art in America today than any high modernist critic ever had, as is obvious from the new displays at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. </p> <p>The American critic David Hickey has blamed the rise of the museum and the academically minded curator for the crisis in American art. One thing never pointed out in gushing accounts of the success of British art in the 1990s is that it was made a lot easier by the suicide of the opposition. This was the decade in which American art's amazingly fertile, turbulent history spluttered and croaked. There has not been a single exciting new star in American art for more than a decade now. </p> <p>So what Craig-Martin is saying is chilling, because what is happening here sounds like what has already happened there. American art was suffocated by the elevation of postmodern theory to an orthodox museum language, as notoriously manifested in the heavily politicised 1991 Whitney Biennial. Their loss was our opportunity: while American artists were squabbling about politics, Damien Hirst was sawing cows in half. Now it looks as if the miasma of theory is coming over here. It takes a distinctively British form, with the post-Hirst generation claiming to be more serious and politically aware than its predecessor. The magazine Art Monthly is full of piss-poor Marxist theory. Even the venerable journal New Left Review has got in on what is becoming a retro-1970s art scene. The rise of the curator is part of the same phenomenon. </p> <p>No one describes better than Craig-Martin just what it was that was special about British art in the early 1990s, just how distinctive the art of Damien Hirst really is. Perhaps that is because of the depth of history he brings to it. Craig-Martin is anything but anti-intellectual. He just wears his knowledge lightly. Born in Dublin and brought up in Washington DC, he could not have had a more refined education. He studied art at Yale University, in a radical department shaped by the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Bauhaus teacher and artist Josef Albers. So he can claim a direct link to the art and design principles of the Bauhaus, the constructivist academy that flourished in Weimar Germany. </p> <p>The Bauhaus preached a simple acceptance of modern forms, and Craig-Martin has been fascinated by objects since the 1960s. It was the moment of minimalist and conceptual art, when, as he remembers, \"the question of what is art was one that artists thought about a lot. I suppose part of my interest in objects was why one object should be a work of art and another object not. How can you tell the difference?\" </p> <p>Craig-Martin came to Britain in 1966 to teach art in Bath, stayed on, and was invited to tutor at Goldsmiths in 1974. This was a time when artists did not expect to make money from their work, so being an artist almost inevitably meant being a teacher too. He continued his inquiry into what makes one object a work of art and another just a thing. His most famous joke on the mystery of objects was 1973's An Oak Tree, which consisted of a glass of water on a shelf and a text insisting that he had changed it into an oak tree without altering its appearance in any way. </p> <p>\"One of the things I wanted to do with the oak tree was to make something where the proof that it did happen was the same as the proof that it didn't happen, so that you couldn't conclusively say one way or the other. I suppose one of the things that intrigued me most - and it remains true in the drawings I do now - is that you can represent something with something that it doesn't look like.\" </p> <p> Today he is best known for his paintings and wall drawings; he was invited to do a large wall painting at the Museum of Modern Art in New York this year to celebrate the museum's rehang of its collection. His paintings, which grew out of drawings very much in the clear-eyed spirit of Bauhaus design, are of mass- produced objects that he paints in a deliberately uninflected way, in non-representational colours, everything marked out in bold lines and perfect linear perspective, floating freely in space. They are paintings that make you wonder how things are connected, why this bunch of keys has come together with that umbrella. </p> <p>It's probably the directness of his own art that enabled him to recognise the worth of Hirst and his contemporaries. \"Right from the beginning they made work in the language of their time that made it possible for people to engage with it,\" says Craig-Martin. \"People could understand what it was about. It was accessible work. It didn't have certain kinds of distancing things that were associated with high modernism.\" </p> <p>There was something special about British art 10 years ago, but it is disappearing fast. Today the very success of Hirst and co in creating a London art world, a system of talk and activity around art, seems to be making the simplicity of their art less and less likely to be repeated. Michael Craig-Martin is only talking about art education, but you can already see the debilitating effects of academicism on art in London. Where we once had artists but no art world, we are in danger of getting an art world on the scale of Manhattan's without any real artists. Someone needs to come along with a cocky attitude and a chainsaw - with someone like Michael Craig-Martin to teach them. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Craig-Martin's latest show opens at fig-1, 2-3 Fareham Street, London W1 (020-7734 9269), on December 12.</p>",

Artists have been drawn more than ever before into the university ethos, into certain patterns of activity and assessment that are associated with university education. All the models that are being used come from the academic world. People take PhDs in fine art; this is something that either didn't happen in the past or was at least very rare. This academicism is the opposite of the approach that Craig-Martin is famous for. The Goldsmiths class of the late 1980s, which included Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Mat Collishaw, Gary Hume, Simon Patterson - all of whom appeared in the show Freeze, curated by Hirst when he was still a student - were about as far from academically oriented perpetual students as it is possible to be. They were openly ambitious. They wanted, and got, careers as artists. This was a result of the way they were taught. At Goldsmiths, teachers including Craig-Martin and Jon Thompson had developed since the 1970s a style of teaching geared to producing artists rather than art teachers. \"Our model was, what is the nature of the world into which they leave? What's expected of an artist? Is there an equivalent of a painting department out in the world, and the equivalent of a sculpture department out in the world? The answer is no.\" Now Goldsmiths is changing. The academics are taking over. The next Millard professor will be Victor Burgin, an art theorist as well as an artist. Burgin makes photo-based artworks that are essentially illustrations of his academic writings. Despite coming from the same conceptual art generation of the 1970s - Craig-Martin acknowledges that it was Burgin who helped him get his first job at an art school - Burgin couldn't be further removed in his attitude to art. His artworks deconstruct Hitchcock, or stage cinematic scenarios with Lacanian subtexts. Of academic practices generally, Craig-Martin says, \"I feel uneasy about whether these formats are the ones that best enable people to have the kind of creative courage that's needed to be artists.\" Contemporary art, he says in a rather more relaxed way than Sir Nicholas Serota did in last week's Dimbleby Lecture, is in Britain to stay: the London art scene has an energy that is not going to go away. Nevertheless, he admits, \"That energy there was at the beginning with that particular group of people, that's not easily repeatable.\" This is something that is already affecting the art in galleries. More and more art, it seems, is being made with one eye on theory. Photo-based artists in particular, with the exception of Turner winner Wolfgang Tillmans, seem to be trying to conform to the writings of American academics such as Rosalind Krauss, Hal Foster and others associated with the journal October. Some academics, complains Craig-Martin, \"exercise an authority that would be considered shocking if they were artists\". The October group see themselves as overturning the high modernist word of Clement Greenberg, champion of the abstract expressionists, in favour of a feminist and queer postmodernism. But they seem to have more of a stranglehold over art in America today than any high modernist critic ever had, as is obvious from the new displays at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The American critic David Hickey has blamed the rise of the museum and the academically minded curator for the crisis in American art. One thing never pointed out in gushing accounts of the success of British art in the 1990s is that it was made a lot easier by the suicide of the opposition. This was the decade in which American art's amazingly fertile, turbulent history spluttered and croaked. There has not been a single exciting new star in American art for more than a decade now. So what Craig-Martin is saying is chilling, because what is happening here sounds like what has already happened there. American art was suffocated by the elevation of postmodern theory to an orthodox museum language, as notoriously manifested in the heavily politicised 1991 Whitney Biennial. Their loss was our opportunity: while American artists were squabbling about politics, Damien Hirst was sawing cows in half. Now it looks as if the miasma of theory is coming over here. It takes a distinctively British form, with the post-Hirst generation claiming to be more serious and politically aware than its predecessor. The magazine Art Monthly is full of piss-poor Marxist theory. Even the venerable journal New Left Review has got in on what is becoming a retro-1970s art scene. The rise of the curator is part of the same phenomenon. No one describes better than Craig-Martin just what it was that was special about British art in the early 1990s, just how distinctive the art of Damien Hirst really is. Perhaps that is because of the depth of history he brings to it. Craig-Martin is anything but anti-intellectual. He just wears his knowledge lightly. Born in Dublin and brought up in Washington DC, he could not have had a more refined education. He studied art at Yale University, in a radical department shaped by the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Bauhaus teacher and artist Josef Albers. So he can claim a direct link to the art and design principles of the Bauhaus, the constructivist academy that flourished in Weimar Germany. The Bauhaus preached a simple acceptance of modern forms, and Craig-Martin has been fascinated by objects since the 1960s. It was the moment of minimalist and conceptual art, when, as he remembers, \"the question of what is art was one that artists thought about a lot. I suppose part of my interest in objects was why one object should be a work of art and another object not. How can you tell the difference?\" Craig-Martin came to Britain in 1966 to teach art in Bath, stayed on, and was invited to tutor at Goldsmiths in 1974. This was a time when artists did not expect to make money from their work, so being an artist almost inevitably meant being a teacher too. He continued his inquiry into what makes one object a work of art and another just a thing. His most famous joke on the mystery of objects was 1973's An Oak Tree, which consisted of a glass of water on a shelf and a text insisting that he had changed it into an oak tree without altering its appearance in any way. \"One of the things I wanted to do with the oak tree was to make something where the proof that it did happen was the same as the proof that it didn't happen, so that you couldn't conclusively say one way or the other. I suppose one of the things that intrigued me most - and it remains true in the drawings I do now - is that you can represent something with something that it doesn't look like.\" Today he is best known for his paintings and wall drawings; he was invited to do a large wall painting at the Museum of Modern Art in New York this year to celebrate the museum's rehang of its collection. His paintings, which grew out of drawings very much in the clear-eyed spirit of Bauhaus design, are of mass- produced objects that he paints in a deliberately uninflected way, in non-representational colours, everything marked out in bold lines and perfect linear perspective, floating freely in space. They are paintings that make you wonder how things are connected, why this bunch of keys has come together with that umbrella. It's probably the directness of his own art that enabled him to recognise the worth of Hirst and his contemporaries. \"Right from the beginning they made work in the language of their time that made it possible for people to engage with it,\" says Craig-Martin. \"People could understand what it was about. It was accessible work. It didn't have certain kinds of distancing things that were associated with high modernism.\" There was something special about British art 10 years ago, but it is disappearing fast. Today the very success of Hirst and co in creating a London art world, a system of talk and activity around art, seems to be making the simplicity of their art less and less likely to be repeated. Michael Craig-Martin is only talking about art education, but you can already see the debilitating effects of academicism on art in London. Where we once had artists but no art world, we are in danger of getting an art world on the scale of Manhattan's without any real artists. Someone needs to come along with a cocky attitude and a chainsaw - with someone like Michael Craig-Martin to teach them. \u0095 Michael Craig-Martin's latest show opens at fig-1, 2-3 Fareham Street, London W1 (020-7734 9269), on December 12.",

      "bodyText": "Third world countries that refuse to ban the controversial practice of female genital mutilation could be stripped of their right to receive European Union development aid, an EU commissioner warned yesterday as campaigners from Africa lobbied in Brussels. In an impassioned speech before the European parliament, Anna Diamantopoulou, the EU's Greek commissioner for employment and social affairs, condemned the procedure as an appalling violation of fundamental human rights. As many as 2m girls are considered to be at risk of genital mutilation every year. The painful operation sees all or part of the clitoris and other genitalia removed, without anaesthetic and in conditions that are usually unsanitary. Death, disability and sterility can be the result. Female circumcision is practised in 28 African countries. In Somalia, it is done to 98% of women. Sudan, Djibouti, parts of the Arabian peninsula, and Democratic Republic of Congo, are among the places named in UN studies as practising ritual mutilation. The EU and the United Nations estimate that some 135m women have been circumcised. UN experts believe that the practice is gradually being rolled back through legal action. Last year Senegal outlawed it, and the year before, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Togo. Among other recent reformers are Ghana, Burkina Faso and Egypt. \"It is high time that member states, and indeed the EU as a whole, addressed the issue,\" Ms Diamantopoulou told the parliamentary hearing in Brussels. Some MEPs want EU states to recognises the threat of female circumcision as a reason for granting refugee status. In a speech that will enrage proponents who argue that their cultural traditions require control of female sexuality and keeping girls virginal until marriage, the commissioner also called on EU member states to outlaw the procedure among African immigrant communities. In Europe, laws banning female genital mutilation exist only in Britain, Norway and Sweden, Ms Diamantopoulou said. Britain, she noted, is the EU country with the highest number of female immigrants from cultures that practise circumcision - 300,000. But it is her suggestion that EU development aid be linked to stamping out female circumcision in Africa which is likely to cause controversy. \"We may consider making aid to recipient countries contingent on their commitment to fight the practice of female genital mutilation via legislation and education,\" she said. Sensitive to accusations of western interference, she went out of her way to justify her position. \"Europe is not in the business of preaching and imposing its culture on other countries and nations.

      "body": "<p>Visits to Margaret's were always the best. Margaret is my mum's older cousin, living in Cardiff with husband Brian. We'd go over for the evening; me, my mum and my brother. There'd be a mess of people coming and going - their three sons and one daughter, with partners and kids. Margaret would be elegantly perched on the edge of her sofa, cigarette in hand (she's since given up), pretending to complain about them (\"Dear God, look at this rabble. The state of this place . . . Fifteen for Sunday roast yesterday\") in her wonderfully dry, witchy Welsh voice. I used to wonder what it would be like to grow up in that crowded, wild household where Margaret was queen. My brother and I have always been welcomed - \"You know there's a room here if ever you need it.\" <br> Margaret grew up during the war years in Ystrad, Rhondda, where her Gran South also presided over a large working-class family: eight children, plus assorted waifs and strays. \"That house must have been made of bloody elastic,\" Margaret tells me. \"The back door was always open. Everyone felt welcome in Gran's house.\" <br> It's important to Margaret, now in her late 60s, that her Gran would be proud of the way she runs her household. But Margaret is more than a domestic matriarch. She's a woman who's made it in a man's world: she became the first ever woman credit controller in a steelworks company and ran her own debt recovery business. When you talk to Margaret, you can tell she's someone who's really struggled and survived. You can hear it in her ultra-dry humour. It sounds corny but you can see it in her eyes - she has stature, she has drama. She's as much grande dame as Bette Davis or Lauren Bacall. An envious woman in my family was once heard to mutter: \"She's like Joan Collins with that hat and that briefcase\" when Margaret walked into the room. <br> And Margaret is a stoic - a real one, which is very rare in my generation (the twenty and thirtysomethings). It's partly about having lived through a world war, but it's more than that. Margaret may have fulfilled her youthful ambition to marry a man with ginger hair and have four children, but the biggest tragedy of her life is that once upon a time there was a fifth child. Janet was born with a congenital heart disease. She died at the age of six. \"You can never get over something like that,\" Margaret tells me. \"But you can't be weeping and wailing and falling apart. There's the other children to think of. You have to be a brick wall . . . It's made me hard. It's made me what I am.\" <br> Stoic is a word that keeps cropping up when women talk about the grandes dames in their families. My friend Francesca, in her early 30s, used it when she told me about her Italian aunt, crippled by polio, who grew up illiterate in an orphanage, but who became a successful mother and teacher in the UK. \"It's incredible to think about what she's been through and what she's achieved,\" Francesca says. \"But she's never complained. She's just carried on. I don't think I could ever be like that.\" <br> I don't suppose many women of my age could be like that. These days, we communicate our feelings, unburden ourselves, believing this makes us healthier and less stoppered. <br> My paternal grandmother, Florrie (also known as The Duchess) subscribed entirely to the stiff-upper-lip philosophy of life. You kept your feelings under control. There was no use in moaning; you stuck together and you got through somehow. \"Family\" was Florrie's priority, her reason for being. When I was 11 and my parents' marriage was splintering and snapping, Florrie created an oasis of grandparently, chocolate-cakey, Monopoly-playing happiness for my brother and me. Crying was banned at Grandma's. You had to leave it outside with the shoes. The theory was that if you didn't indulge your unhappiness, maybe you could make it go away. If you let the tears come out, everything would get worse. This was how Florrie had always dealt with personal tragedy - this was how she survived. <br> When Florrie was a teenager, her sister Lil had an illegitimate baby. Florrie helped look after the little boy and grew to love him, but one day when the child was already two years old, she came home to find he was gone. She was told he'd been taken off to be adopted in Australia. Florrie was heartbroken and determined that when she had children, they would always come first. <br> Talking to friends about the charismatic, opinionated older women in their lives, the conversation returns time and again to family. Family was at the heart of everything. All your aspirations were for your children. Grandma Florrie married Grandad Len because she thought he could give her the harmonious family life she'd never known. She wasn't in love with him - and that's all wrong, isn't it? Isn't it? <br> Well, now, maybe. But Grandma chose to focus her dreams on the next generation. Somehow shop assistant Florrie and lorry driver Len saved enough money to send their son to a private primary school so he'd have a chance at an education. Education was the key to a better life. Florrie was bright: if she were young today, she would certainly go to university instead of leaving school at 14 to get a job and help support the family, but it wasn't possible then. She wanted for her son what she couldn't have for herself and this was the way forward: you strove, you struggled and you didn't complain. If you succeeded, you might live to see your kids posing for photos in their mortarboards. <br> In recent years, I've become critical of Grandma Florrie and her strategy of bottling things up and putting on a brave face. I've often thought it was wrong of her to tell me and my brother not to cry when our parents were breaking up. But if I'd been born 50 years ago, I could have been her. <br> My life is full of anxiety over my career; dilemmas over whether to get married and whether marriage really means anything. Should I have kids? When? Where? It could be said my generation is a petulant one, forever dawdling on the therapist's couch. We will never be like those queens of stoicism who brought us up. We indulge our emotional traumas, analyse our neuroses; we weep and wail and fall apart. We do it because we can. But it's worth remembering that ours is not the only way.</p>",

And Margaret is a stoic - a real one, which is very rare in my generation (the twenty and thirtysomethings). It's partly about having lived through a world war, but it's more than that. Margaret may have fulfilled her youthful ambition to marry a man with ginger hair and have four children, but the biggest tragedy of her life is that once upon a time there was a fifth child. Janet was born with a congenital heart disease. She died at the age of six. \"You can never get over something like that,\" Margaret tells me. \"But you can't be weeping and wailing and falling apart. There's the other children to think of. You have to be a brick wall . . . It's made me hard. It's made me what I am.\" Stoic is a word that keeps cropping up when women talk about the grandes dames in their families. My friend Francesca, in her early 30s, used it when she told me about her Italian aunt, crippled by polio, who grew up illiterate in an orphanage, but who became a successful mother and teacher in the UK. \"It's incredible to think about what she's been through and what she's achieved,\" Francesca says. \"But she's never complained. She's just carried on. I don't think I could ever be like that.\" I don't suppose many women of my age could be like that. These days, we communicate our feelings, unburden ourselves, believing this makes us healthier and less stoppered. My paternal grandmother, Florrie (also known as The Duchess) subscribed entirely to the stiff-upper-lip philosophy of life. You kept your feelings under control. There was no use in moaning; you stuck together and you got through somehow. \"Family\" was Florrie's priority, her reason for being. When I was 11 and my parents' marriage was splintering and snapping, Florrie created an oasis of grandparently, chocolate-cakey, Monopoly-playing happiness for my brother and me. Crying was banned at Grandma's. You had to leave it outside with the shoes. The theory was that if you didn't indulge your unhappiness, maybe you could make it go away. If you let the tears come out, everything would get worse. This was how Florrie had always dealt with personal tragedy - this was how she survived. When Florrie was a teenager, her sister Lil had an illegitimate baby. Florrie helped look after the little boy and grew to love him, but one day when the child was already two years old, she came home to find he was gone. She was told he'd been taken off to be adopted in Australia. Florrie was heartbroken and determined that when she had children, they would always come first. Talking to friends about the charismatic, opinionated older women in their lives, the conversation returns time and again to family. Family was at the heart of everything. All your aspirations were for your children. Grandma Florrie married Grandad Len because she thought he could give her the harmonious family life she'd never known. She wasn't in love with him - and that's all wrong, isn't it? Isn't it? Well, now, maybe. But Grandma chose to focus her dreams on the next generation. Somehow shop assistant Florrie and lorry driver Len saved enough money to send their son to a private primary school so he'd have a chance at an education. Education was the key to a better life. Florrie was bright: if she were young today, she would certainly go to university instead of leaving school at 14 to get a job and help support the family, but it wasn't possible then. She wanted for her son what she couldn't have for herself and this was the way forward: you strove, you struggled and you didn't complain. If you succeeded, you might live to see your kids posing for photos in their mortarboards. In recent years, I've become critical of Grandma Florrie and her strategy of bottling things up and putting on a brave face. I've often thought it was wrong of her to tell me and my brother not to cry when our parents were breaking up. But if I'd been born 50 years ago, I could have been her. My life is full of anxiety over my career; dilemmas over whether to get married and whether marriage really means anything. Should I have kids? When? Where? It could be said my generation is a petulant one, forever dawdling on the therapist's couch. We will never be like those queens of stoicism who brought us up. We indulge our emotional traumas, analyse our neuroses; we weep and wail and fall apart. We do it because we can. But it's worth remembering that ours is not the only way.",

A monocled toff watching telly over his brandy and soda might be exposed to the hitherto unperceived realities of Ken Loach's Cathy Come Home. A slob in a stained string vest might turn over after the pools and suddenly find himself entranced by a ballet. \"Educate, inform, entertain\" was the great Reithian mantra of public-service television. But now, for good or ill, and despite the fact that two terrestrial channels are still funded by the licence fee, it is over. <br> The days are gone when TV producers took risks. Who would have known that David Attenborough would thrill the masses by means of crouching in the bushes and whispering about wildlife? Or that Panorama might encourage a nation to reflect on the political issues of the day? Or that something with the unpromising name of Monty Python's Flying Circus might have a profound impact on what we thought of as funny? <br> Now our whole culture - not just television, but nearly every cultural outlet - is saturated with consumers being given more of what they want. Typical is If You Liked That, You'll Like This, the Sunday morning programme on Classic FM hosted by David Mellor. In Q magazine, CD reviews end with a list of similar records. In such a culture it is difficult to encounter new, challenging experiences, much easier to insulate yourself from anything threatening. The media - television especially - prefer to expose us to the familiar, to fit everything (arguably even the news) into existing patterns of thought. Nothing can disturb us. Nothing can, in a sense, enrich or entrance us. <br> This is the digital philosophy that has replaced the Reithian vision. We are treated as desiring machines who can be satisfied only by more of the same. If you're a film fan, then you'll want as many movie channels as possible. If you're a football fan, you'll want Sky Sports 1 to 7. True, you'll be shelling out a fortune and still wind up watching Lethal Nonsense VII on widescreen on Wednesday night, or Burnley reserves versus Bury reserves with Player Cam, but this is, we are to suppose, progress. <br> It is in this climate that Artsworld, a subscription cable channel devoted to the arts, starts broadcasting on Saturday. Airing for 10 hours a day with news, previews, concerts and documentaries, it is the brainchild of Jeremy Isaacs, former Royal Opera House general director and founding chief executive of Channel 4. \"We know how great the hunger is for the arts in this country,\" he wrote earlier this week. \"Attendance at the Tate Modern alone attests to that. But public-service broadcasting appears to have chosen just this time to shrink the spaces they inhabit.\" <br> Isaacs writes about going with fellow sixth-formers to Saturday night symphony concerts in Glasgow: \"I still remember the way their spines jolted them upright at the beginning of the last movement of Beethoven's Fifth.\" This is the epitome of the Reithian vision of entertainment: Isaacs's schoolmates may not have known that they would have loved Beethoven before they went to the concert, but they found that they did. <br> Isaacs's idea for Artsworld came from the notion that Something Had To Be Done. But we no longer live in an era where Those Who Know programme TV for Those Who Really Ought To Find Out. Such patrician programming today would be commercial suicide, and wisely, despite Isaacs' rhetoric, his new channel is doing all it can not to fall on its own sword. In other words, Isaacs may talk like a Reithian, but his channel delivers something utterly digital. <br> If one looks at Artsworld's schedules, one finds not patrician programming of difficult art, but extremely safe, middlebrow programmes that make one wonder if Isaacs isn't at the helm of a Classic FM for telly. Thus, there will be opera, but it will be Maria Callas and Tito Gobbi at Covent Garden, tenor Andrea Bocelli singing sacred arias. There will be classical music, but it will feature the likes of Lesley Garrett, Roger Norrington and Michael Nyman. There will be dance, but it will include ex-Riverdance stars in a fly-on-the-wall rehearsals documentary and a ballet with music by Queen, costumes by Versace, choreography by Maurice B\u00e9jart. There will be world music, too, but by the likes of the MOR and already overexposed Ladysmith Black Mambazo. <br> There will be arts and architecture - but mostly featuring already famous practitioners such as Norman Foster and David Hockney. There will be a George Melly panto at Christmas and Bryan Ferry singing from his album of 1930s favourites, As Time Goes By. There is too little to challenge the viewer, too little at the cutting edge. <br> This is not to damn Isaacs's project before it has started. Rather, it is to suggest that to set up a channel like this, in times like these, is extremely perilous. A couple of years ago, a study of the least popular programmes in the previous decade found that opera occupied the three lowest places, and that arts programmes in general were a turn-off. This may show that people think opera is not best seen or heard on the small screen, which is something that may preoccupy Isaacs and his colleagues in the sleepless nights ahead. <br> In principle, it need not matter that Artsworld is devoted to the most unpopular forms of broadcasting, since the great dream of digital TV was that it would give everybody what they wanted, no matter how abstruse their demands. The corset of terrestrial TV had burst open and everybody could now express themselves freely. But that dream was fanciful, and Artsworld will not be run on such lines. <br> Artsworld occupies a similar position to FilmFour in this respect. Both are reserved for viewers who have already paid their monthly subscription to their digital TV provider and are prepared to pay an extra \u00a36 each month to receive the new channel. But the nature of this subscription dictates in a large measure the nature of the programming. Just as FilmFour has had to resort to programming mainstream movies and marginalises the more outr\u00e9 stuff until the early hours, so Artsworld cannot afford to position itself at the cutting edge of culture. <br> If it is to succeed commercially, Artsworld must court the viewers who have subscribed to Sky to see more movies or football. Isaacs must hope that these people might be persuaded to shell out a few extra quid to see some art. But this seems unlikely: such viewers are not exercised about the dearth of ballet on the box. It seems even less likely that aesthetes who already go to the operas, read the novels, hear the recitals, etc, will shell out \u00a350 for a Sky subscription as well as the few quid charged for Artsworld. <br> But the bigger question is this: where is the creative, challenging television these days? It comes from people who take risks, who are trying to jolt the spines of their viewers in the way Beethoven jolted those of Jeremy Isaacs's schoolmates. One of the few recent examples is Chris Morris's Jam. Morris was allowed to take a risk and he exploited that opportunity, thus putting himself at the cutting edge of television culture. But Artsworld risks only commercial failure, which, if you care primarily about art, isn't very interesting at all.</p>",

Oddly - although it's the title of the film he's here to promote - those words are not \"The Grinch\". Neither, despite it being the character that made his name, are they \"Hank Kingsley\". They're not even \"When's lunch?\" The words are these: penis, and vagina. </p> <p>Bear with me. There is a reason. In an early episode of The Larry Sanders Show, already the most inspired show on American television, Tambor's monstrous, preening alter-ego Hank discovers an error in the latest issue of his (self-published) fanzine Hanks For The Memories. On every page, someone, somehow has replaced every queasy showbiz bon mot with those two common nouns. Certain of the culprit's identity, an enraged Hank confronts them, bellowing like a mantra: \"Penis! Vagina! Penis! Vagina!\" The victim - entirely innocent - stands baffled, then gestures towards the terrified elderly couple beside him: \"Uh, Hank... meet my parents.\" </p> <p>As an example of what Tambor - perhaps the finest comic actor currently active - is routinely called upon to essay, it's perfect: grotesque hubris leading, inexorably, to abject humiliation. Which, appearing opposite Jim Carrey as the bumptious Mayor of Who-ville, is precisely his role in Ron Howard's imminent, baroquely sentimental Grinch. For every cockle-warming group hug, there's Tambor, spewing bile and condescension; for every small child bursting winsomely into song, there he is again, a snout-nosed vision of pompous self-delusion. \"Wonderful\", is how he describes his six months making the film, with the same open-faced sincerity he uses when calling Howard \"a true human being\" or Carrey \"generous, giving and, ah... gentlemanly\". </p> <p>He gets the same crack in his voice (\"it's been such a marvellous life\") whenever he mentions his chosen profession: the epiphany of stumbling into a tiny San Francisco theatre as a child, the decade spent as a twentysomething hopeful touring in Brecht and Shakespeare. \"The thing is, I lost my hair when I was very young. It was all gone by 18. But rather than seeing that as a tragedy, it was really a boon, because I could play these older guys, which were always the best roles.\" </p> <p>Then, at the end of the 70s, came a small part on Taxi as a budding Romeo with a sweat problem, swiftly followed by the ceaseless flow of TV and movie gigs (in everything from Hill Street Blues to Muppets From Space) that cemented his reputation as the man to call whenever you needed insane vanity, seismic arrogance, and male pattern baldness. Which, gently glinting scalp apart, hardly suggests the cerebral, actorly individual in front of me. </p> <p>\"I was never going to be the hero. The guy in Titanic yelling 'I'm King Of The World'? That's not going to be me. And I think people are basically foolish. I do. I know we make these attempts at being noble, but really we're all kind of... ridiculous. And I like playing those guys. They're part of a great tradition. Moli\u00e8re knew about those guys. Dickens knew about those guys.\" </p> <p>As, indeed, did Garry Shandling (\"a mensch - a real stand-up guy\") when, back in 1992, he offered Tambor Hank, fawning sidekick to his own neurotic talk-show host Larry. By turns craven and manic, given to abusing his minions and filming himself with escort girls, it was a peach of a role, a chance to hone his staple traits over seven gloriously acerbic seasons. By the time the show finally ended last year, Hank wasn't so much a sitcom character as a universal byword for self-pitying venality. </p> <p>\"Right. And when people called him a buffoon, I never understood it. To me he was anything but. He was smart.\" The way he talks about him, he sounds like a friend. Not a friend you'd care to be seen with in public, but a friend all the same. \"You know, I have a feeling that Hank was basically very lonely. That he really didn't have any real human connection. I mean, I think in this world, the more communication we have, the more people tend to be glib, and arch, and Hank could never do that. He's a child, and we all recognise that, and we're all scared of it. We're all afraid of the gushing, overweening child inside us. Which is Hank.\" </p> <p>Yet, while he admits to missing him (\"Hanks don't come along too often\"), he says he doesn't regret the show itself folding. \"We went at the right time, you know? And it's done wonderful things for me. I mean, I don't want to sound like the grand poobah, but I'm so happy with the way things are going professionally.\" </p> <p>As we leave, he takes my photograph - \"isn't that what tourists do?\" - and trades favourite Hank moments (his being Kingsley's ill-fated, careerist flirtation with Judaism). I'll never have a better chance. Without admitting I've been thinking of genitals throughout our conversation, I tell him mine was the fanzine episode. His face lights up. </p> <p>\"Oh, that's great. That's so great. See that's what I loved about the show, and about Hank.

Perhaps he was a pessimist for whom life itself appeared to be some kind of trap. But he was indisputably a great director. </p> <p>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, in which Dana Andrews gives one of his most effective performances, illustrates that greatness perfectly. It is a film of great economy and precision (it lasts only 80 minutes), with the terrifying inevitability of Greek tragedy and a pervading sense that man is his own worst enemy. </p> <p>Andrews plays a reporter who agrees to incriminate himself in a murder case because his editor (Sidney Blackmer) is pursuing a campaign against capital punishment. They plant a lighter that was given to the reporter by his fiancee (Joan Fontaine) and the reporter then poses for the photographs that will prove his innocence. Almost immediately Lang's long shot of the scene seems to suggest that things may go badly wrong. </p> <p>They do. He seduces a stripper who was the murdered girl's friend, infuriating his own girlfriend although he is sure that she'll understand when all is explained.

The tearoom is where reputations rise and fall, where plots are hatched and discovered, while nosy reporters can only press their noses against the window pane.</p> <p>\"The tearooms are a unique place,\" says the rascally Tory ex-minister Steven Norris. \"First of all, it is actually divided into three areas. You might think that meant Tory, Liberal and Labour. It doesn't. It means Labour round the counter, where you're served literally as though you were in some kind of 60s railway canteen. The next room you go into is the Conservative room, detached from Labour very definitely. And then the third room is not for the Lib Dems, strangely enough, but for the officers of the house, where discreet figures whose name one never knows after 30 years in the place go and take their cup of tea and sit down.\"</p> <p>Actually, I also discovered a Welsh table. The Ulster Unionists have a table too. And Labour's Margaret Hodge, now a minister, owns up to a dodge of her own: if you want a quiet cuppa, go and sit at the Tory end, where no one will talk to you.</p> <p>The members' tearoom is a period caff - tea urns, toast, waitresses in uniforms, armchairs and newspapers. The Tory, Sir George Young, confirms it does a very good breakfast: \"Much better than years ago. One of our colleagues, who shall remain nameless, has breakfast at home and then he has a second breakfast in the tearoom.\" Labour's Fraser Kemp pops in for \"a sausage sandwich and a cuppa\".</p> <p>In an era when MPs, like everyone else, don't have time to stop for a proper lunch, a tearoom snack can be a compromise between three courses and a sandwich at the desk. But food and non-alcoholic beverages are only part of it: the real purpose is gossip, chatter, ideas, or bad news from a recent byelection; the kind of informal focus grouping that ministers do when they turn up to take the political temperature. Which usually means they are in trouble.</p> <p>\"It's the favourite place for prime ministers to drop into,\" says Norris. \"If the PM wants to take a quick five or 10 minutes just to be known and be seen, then rather than go to the bar where you can get tied down for rather a long time with a bunch of old bores, most of whom have had far too much to drink, you go to the tearoom, spend 10 minutes schmoozing around. It pays great dividends.\"</p> <p>There is some dispute about which grandees used the tearoom. Austin Mitchell, a veteran of the Labour minority government of 1977-79, remembers prime minister Jim Callaghan turning up and pouring out his woes. \"You felt an instinctive sympathy and support for Jim because the troubles of the world were on his shoulders and he was such a nice man.\"</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher preferred to descend on - and terrify - colleagues in the dining room, often bearing a plate of Welsh rarebit. \"When she didn't have an official dinner she did make a point of going over to rub shoulders with MPs,\" says her spokesman, Sir Bernard Ingham.</p> <p>As a former whip, always on the prowl, Young recalls how John Major \"was a regular tearoom visitor. He enjoyed it - and actually he had been in the tearoom regularly before he was PM.\" William Hague pops in after PM's question time, but few of his colleagues dare to tell him when he has done badly, I was assured by one Tory troublemaker. Tony Blair put in an appearance once, during the fuel crisis, and thoroughly alarmed Labour MPs.</p> <p>Who's up, who's down: plenty of high-grade gossip is hatched in the tearoom, though Mitchell recalls how the whips got wind of a tearoom plot against Michael Foot's leadership in 1983 and quickly scotched it.</p> <p>\"Only foolish people conspire in the tearoom because it's so public,\" says Michael Mates, chief lieutenant to Michael Heseltine (not the tearoom type). \"Like-minded people sit together, but it's the same as the dining room - you go and sit where there's a seat, regardless of who else is sitting there. If you want a particular chat with someone then you'd take them off to a quiet corner and of course this would be observed - do it again and again and again, then people will draw their own conclusions - that's why it's a bad place to have a plot.\"</p> <p>That's not how it worked for Michael Martin. Older MPs such as Labour's Joe Ashton attribute his election to the speakership last month entirely to \"the power of the tearoom\", where the teetotal MP sat for years, simply being nice to colleagues, especially nervous new ones.</p> <p>It all sounds a bit clubby, as much in the working men's club sense as the Atheneum. New MPs, especially women, feel a bit uneasy. They would prefer somewhere where they can leave their mum or teenage sons. But old sweats are nostalgic for the days when MPs didn't have a fancy office, full of computers and keen young staff, often 200 yards away in a plush new building such as the \u00a3200m Portcullis House. The word they seem to use is \"community\".</p> <p>MPs are better, more professional nowadays, according to old hands such as Ashton and the Tory Eric Forth - a man who prefers the tearoom to a pager to keep in touch. But there's not the fun or the camaraderie of the old days when Labour MPs - sharing Callaghan's misfortunes - used to gather in the tearoom and sing songs from the trenches of 1914-18 to cheer themselves up.</p> <p>Ashton recalls how old MPs used to outdo each other with grim tearoom tales which vied to see which of them had the most deprived childhood, just like the Monty Python sketch. The winner was a Gorbals MP whose slum neighbour not only murdered his wife, but chopped her into pieces and threw them into a canal (until a dog retrieved an arm and he was caught).</p> <p>Not the sort of story which would appeal to Roy Hattersley, even though he and Ashton were once rising stars on Sheffield council. He takes a dismissive view of the tearoom. \"The idea that it was vivacious never passed through my head,\" he concedes, before describing its denizens as \"worthy\" seekers after pie and tea. But it also occurs to him that this attitude towards the tearoom (\"in my day, a bit of a joke\") may have cost him the Labour leadership. He may be right.</p>",

But food and non-alcoholic beverages are only part of it: the real purpose is gossip, chatter, ideas, or bad news from a recent byelection; the kind of informal focus grouping that ministers do when they turn up to take the political temperature. Which usually means they are in trouble. \"It's the favourite place for prime ministers to drop into,\" says Norris. \"If the PM wants to take a quick five or 10 minutes just to be known and be seen, then rather than go to the bar where you can get tied down for rather a long time with a bunch of old bores, most of whom have had far too much to drink, you go to the tearoom, spend 10 minutes schmoozing around. It pays great dividends.\" There is some dispute about which grandees used the tearoom. Austin Mitchell, a veteran of the Labour minority government of 1977-79, remembers prime minister Jim Callaghan turning up and pouring out his woes. \"You felt an instinctive sympathy and support for Jim because the troubles of the world were on his shoulders and he was such a nice man.\" Margaret Thatcher preferred to descend on - and terrify - colleagues in the dining room, often bearing a plate of Welsh rarebit. \"When she didn't have an official dinner she did make a point of going over to rub shoulders with MPs,\" says her spokesman, Sir Bernard Ingham. As a former whip, always on the prowl, Young recalls how John Major \"was a regular tearoom visitor. He enjoyed it - and actually he had been in the tearoom regularly before he was PM.\" William Hague pops in after PM's question time, but few of his colleagues dare to tell him when he has done badly, I was assured by one Tory troublemaker. Tony Blair put in an appearance once, during the fuel crisis, and thoroughly alarmed Labour MPs. Who's up, who's down: plenty of high-grade gossip is hatched in the tearoom, though Mitchell recalls how the whips got wind of a tearoom plot against Michael Foot's leadership in 1983 and quickly scotched it. \"Only foolish people conspire in the tearoom because it's so public,\" says Michael Mates, chief lieutenant to Michael Heseltine (not the tearoom type). \"Like-minded people sit together, but it's the same as the dining room - you go and sit where there's a seat, regardless of who else is sitting there. If you want a particular chat with someone then you'd take them off to a quiet corner and of course this would be observed - do it again and again and again, then people will draw their own conclusions - that's why it's a bad place to have a plot.\" That's not how it worked for Michael Martin. Older MPs such as Labour's Joe Ashton attribute his election to the speakership last month entirely to \"the power of the tearoom\", where the teetotal MP sat for years, simply being nice to colleagues, especially nervous new ones. It all sounds a bit clubby, as much in the working men's club sense as the Atheneum. New MPs, especially women, feel a bit uneasy. They would prefer somewhere where they can leave their mum or teenage sons. But old sweats are nostalgic for the days when MPs didn't have a fancy office, full of computers and keen young staff, often 200 yards away in a plush new building such as the \u00a3200m Portcullis House. The word they seem to use is \"community\". MPs are better, more professional nowadays, according to old hands such as Ashton and the Tory Eric Forth - a man who prefers the tearoom to a pager to keep in touch. But there's not the fun or the camaraderie of the old days when Labour MPs - sharing Callaghan's misfortunes - used to gather in the tearoom and sing songs from the trenches of 1914-18 to cheer themselves up. Ashton recalls how old MPs used to outdo each other with grim tearoom tales which vied to see which of them had the most deprived childhood, just like the Monty Python sketch. The winner was a Gorbals MP whose slum neighbour not only murdered his wife, but chopped her into pieces and threw them into a canal (until a dog retrieved an arm and he was caught). Not the sort of story which would appeal to Roy Hattersley, even though he and Ashton were once rising stars on Sheffield council. He takes a dismissive view of the tearoom. \"The idea that it was vivacious never passed through my head,\" he concedes, before describing its denizens as \"worthy\" seekers after pie and tea. But it also occurs to him that this attitude towards the tearoom (\"in my day, a bit of a joke\") may have cost him the Labour leadership. He may be right.",

Widows without an occupational or personal pension, who relied on Serps to top up their state pension, could have lost up to \u00a362.50 a week.</p> <p>In his announcement yesterday, Mr Darling pledged an extra \u00a34bn to make three fundamental changes to his initial compensation package. The new scheme will mean that:</p> <p>\u0095 Pensioners will no longer have to prove that they were misled in order to receive compensation. The government's initial scheme, in which pensioners had to demonstrate in an interview that they had been misled, was condemned by a Commons committee last week as an unworkable fiasco which was open to fraud.</p> <p>\u0095 Anyone of pensionable age on October 5 2002 - the day the new scheme comes into force - will be exempt from the changes. Under the governmment's first scheme, existing pensioners would have been affected by the changes from that date;</p> <p>\u0095 A transitional scheme will soften the blow for people who become pensioners after the scheme is introduced. Anyone who becomes a pensioner between 2002-04 will be entitled to 90% of their spouse's Serps. This will decrease to 80% for people who become pensioners between 2004-06 and so on. The transitional scheme is designed to avoid a \"cliff edge\" in which pensioners suddenly find themselves hit by the new rules; Mr Darling declared yesterday that his announcement would remove any worries pensioners have about providing for their spouses. \"This problem should have been sorted out 14 years ago,\" he told MPs. \"What happened in the years after 1986 was a series of colossal blunders which was inexcusable and caused untold distress to millions of people.\"</p> <p>Mr Darling admitted that his initial compensation package, known as the protected rights scheme, would have been unfair. \"Over the past few months I have become convinced that [it] would not work in the way intended,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be fair because we cannot be sure that it would reach all those affected and it would be difficult to safeguard against fraud and abuse.\"</p> <p>The news was welcomed by Age Concern. Gordon Lishman, its director general in England, said: \"Alistair Darling's announcement is a victory for Age Concern's two year campaign. It will come as a huge relief to pensioners... who can now enjoy retirement knowing their spouse will be properly provided for if they die before them.\"</p> <p>Tony Wright, the Labour chairman of the Commons public administration commitee which had condemned the initial package, welcomed \"an act of justice that all the Serps pensioners will be thankful for\".</p> <p>Mr Darling's announcement represents a significant victory over the Treasury which had been resisting the extra costs of the new scheme. However, the government has decided that it must do more for pensioners after a successful campaign against last year's 75p rise in the basic state pension.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Millions of widows who were misled about their pensions won a multi-billion pound compensation package yesterday when the government bowed to pressure and abandoned an earlier scheme which had been branded as mean-spirited. In a spectacular u-turn, the social security secretary Alistair Darling pledged an extra \u00a34bn to exempt millions from a plan to cut pension payments to widows and widowers. His announcement was welcomed last night by pensioner groups which had campaigned against the initial compensation package for widows who were misled about plans to cut the state earnings related pension scheme. Mr Darling introduced his first compensation package last March after it emerged that pensioners had been misinformed about a Tory scheme to halve the amount of Serps that widows or widowers inherited on the death of their spouse. Up to 20 million people were not told about the Tory scheme which was announced in 1986 and was due to come into force this year. Widows without an occupational or personal pension, who relied on Serps to top up their state pension, could have lost up to \u00a362.50 a week. In his announcement yesterday, Mr Darling pledged an extra \u00a34bn to make three fundamental changes to his initial compensation package. The new scheme will mean that: \u0095 Pensioners will no longer have to prove that they were misled in order to receive compensation. The government's initial scheme, in which pensioners had to demonstrate in an interview that they had been misled, was condemned by a Commons committee last week as an unworkable fiasco which was open to fraud. \u0095 Anyone of pensionable age on October 5 2002 - the day the new scheme comes into force - will be exempt from the changes. Under the governmment's first scheme, existing pensioners would have been affected by the changes from that date; \u0095 A transitional scheme will soften the blow for people who become pensioners after the scheme is introduced. Anyone who becomes a pensioner between 2002-04 will be entitled to 90% of their spouse's Serps. This will decrease to 80% for people who become pensioners between 2004-06 and so on. The transitional scheme is designed to avoid a \"cliff edge\" in which pensioners suddenly find themselves hit by the new rules; Mr Darling declared yesterday that his announcement would remove any worries pensioners have about providing for their spouses. \"This problem should have been sorted out 14 years ago,\" he told MPs. \"What happened in the years after 1986 was a series of colossal blunders which was inexcusable and caused untold distress to millions of people.\" Mr Darling admitted that his initial compensation package, known as the protected rights scheme, would have been unfair. \"Over the past few months I have become convinced that [it] would not work in the way intended,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be fair because we cannot be sure that it would reach all those affected and it would be difficult to safeguard against fraud and abuse.\" The news was welcomed by Age Concern. Gordon Lishman, its director general in England, said: \"Alistair Darling's announcement is a victory for Age Concern's two year campaign. It will come as a huge relief to pensioners... who can now enjoy retirement knowing their spouse will be properly provided for if they die before them.\" Tony Wright, the Labour chairman of the Commons public administration commitee which had condemned the initial package, welcomed \"an act of justice that all the Serps pensioners will be thankful for\". Mr Darling's announcement represents a significant victory over the Treasury which had been resisting the extra costs of the new scheme. However, the government has decided that it must do more for pensioners after a successful campaign against last year's 75p rise in the basic state pension.",

It's seven years since Madonna has played in this country, and as annoying as her past few singles have been, as irritating as you find her current earth-mother aura, you immediately remember why she is talked about and why she is so loved: she is a natural performer, bursting with energy and enthusiasm, enthralling to watch on stage.</p> <p>She is in fantastic voice, too: stripped of the ridiculous, excessive vocoder that marred her recent album, Music, each note rings out clean and pure.

Consumer confidence rose sharply last month following the resolution of the fuel crisis. But it fell two points in November to minus two, according to the monthly survey by market research company GfK for the European commission published today. However, monthly consumer credit figures published yesterday by the Bank of England gave no sign of a slowdown in high street spending. Net consumer credit jumped \u00a31.5bn in October, the highest figure since May and well above City forecasts. Two thirds of the increase came from non-credit card lending, suggesting that shoppers are taking advantage of cheap in-house finance deals for large purchases. \"The robust rise in credit suggests UK consumers remain in bullish mood and warnings of any significant weakening in consumer demand look premature,\" said Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. The figures also hinted at a rebound in the housing market, with new mortgage approvals - seen as a good forward-looking guide to sales and prices - rising by 1,000 to 98,000, compared with an average of 95,000 in the three months to September.

Growing insecurity was reflected in a sharp increase in the perceived benefits of saving, which rose to the highest level since September 1998. GfK said it was possible the threat of a second fuel crisis - since diffused by Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report - had depressed sentiment, suggesting that it may recover next month. Low inflation and slowing global economic activity has persuaded the City that the next move in British interest rates will be downwards.

Willingly overshadowed by younger brother Angus's barmy showmanship, Malcolm does very much the same thing in every song, because that's what every song demands.

Egos aren't allowed in this most self-effacing outfit. Brian Johnson has been lead singer for nearly three times as long as his deceased predecessor Bon Scott, yet he still happily screeches his way through chunks of Scott's canon without a murmur. How long his 52-year-old lungs can stand the strain must be a moot point.

Fortunately, just as Van Gogh painted the same vase of flowers a hundred times without diminishing the wonder of his art, so AC/DC make a virtue out of endlessly reploughing the same gnarly furrow, each time unearthing hitherto unimagined nuggets of base wisdom. Rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young is the group's core. Willingly overshadowed by younger brother Angus's barmy showmanship, Malcolm does very much the same thing in every song, because that's what every song demands. Only he knows for sure how many times he has played Highway to Hell, but it always sounds like the first. No wonder he's one of the few guitar-players to whom Keith Richards pays respect. Indeed, AC/DC are probably the only band today who could credibly claim to rock like the Rolling Stones in their satanic majestic pomp. Not that they themselves would claim such a thing. Egos aren't allowed in this most self-effacing outfit. Brian Johnson has been lead singer for nearly three times as long as his deceased predecessor Bon Scott, yet he still happily screeches his way through chunks of Scott's canon without a murmur. How long his 52-year-old lungs can stand the strain must be a moot point. But so long as there are riffs to be played, AC/DC are the only ones fit to play them. \u0095 At Sheffield Arena (0114-256 5656) tonight, then touring.",
