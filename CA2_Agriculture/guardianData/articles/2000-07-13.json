Novick wrote as a Jew, concerned that his fellow Jews were taking a path that could only end in harm. This new book has none of that sensitivity or human empathy - surely prerequisites of any meaningful debate about the Holocaust.

It is perhaps too easy to write off a critic like Finkelstein as a self-hating Jew, but it is striking to hear someone who appears to have nothing but contempt for his own people. He issues the same call sent out by David Irving in the high court this year - that Jews should not simply condemn anti-semitism, but examine their own role in provoking it. Like Irving, Finkelstein sees Jews as the authors of their own suffering. He claims that Jews have made up stories of persecution and that there are too many survivors to be true - another Irving favourite. In fact, what this claim amounts to is the fair statement that Jews expanded their definition of survivor to mean not just those who were held in camps, but those who fled or hid from the Nazis. But to put it like that would be to give Jews the benefit of the doubt. And Finkelstein, like Irving, is not in that game. </p> <p>Besides the animus and the vitriol, there is a subtler way in which Finkelstein does the anti-semites\u0092 work for them. He constructs an elaborate conspiracy theory, in which the Jews were pushed from apathy to obsession about the Holocaust by a corrupt Jewish leadership bent on building international support for Israel. He has no truck with the idea that Jews might themselves have changed their attitude to the Shoah, for a complex range of reasons. Instead Jews are mere sheep, pushed around by a wicked Jewish elite. </p> <p>Finkelstein sees the Jews as either villains or victims - and that, I fear, takes him closer to the people who created the Holocaust than to those who suffered in it.</p>",

Thankfully, there are scenes when the writing rejects style and irony in favour of something more searching, most notably in the exchanges between the already unfaithful MP's wife and her government minister husband where the lies and evasions of politics have insidiously infected the marital bed. But although Hare occasionally seems poised to say something interesting about the way love fades like a suntan and the gap between our imagination and reality, he never spits it out and appears far too amused by his creations to capture the soulless hole at the heart of all their relationships. If he had concentrated as much on the state of the characters' hearts and heads as he does on the state of their genitals it would be infinitely more satisfying. At the close of each sexual encounter, the length of the coupling is detailed above the stage in hours, minutes and, in one sorry case, seconds. Hare's engagement with his audience takes precisely 90 minutes. All right as a quickie, but definitely not a meaningful relationship. Until July 29. Box office: 01243 781312.",

      "bodyText": "Banks can use external or internal data to judge credit worthiness. Barclays insists it will only use its own information. External data, used by most British credit card and loan companies, involves credit scoring. This counts \"positive\" and \"negative\" lifestyles and other personal attributes to come up with a total which is compared against a pass mark. The raw figures usually come from the application form and a credit reference agency; the main agencies are Experian and Equifax. Positive factors include appearing on the electoral register,living at one address for more than three years, working full time, and having other loans and credit cards which are paid off on time. Negatives range from self-employment to county court judgements. Not appearing on the electoral roll usually results in instant rejection. Failing to have existing credit facilities will also depress the score. Banks prefer someone with a handful of cards rather than a \"plastic virgin\", although a few worry that someone with many cards might use them all at once then disappear. Credit scoring can be less than scientific. The external data may be incomplete and records of late repayments do not take account of legitimate reasons such as illness.

IF is the latest online bank to fall foul of technical problems, and the delay is a severe embarrassment for the venture, which had arranged for Gordon Brown to open its new Edinburgh call centre today. Advertisements for the bank were about to air on television, featuring the Fatboy Slim hit Right Here, Right Now - a choice of anthem now looking inappropriate. Going live has been put back to some time in August, although IF's chief executive, Jim Spowart, admitted he was unable to give a cast-iron guarantee that it would go live even then. During the course of testing the bank's systems and carrying out live simulations, experts identified an intermittent fault which caused the system to grind almost to a halt. Mr Spowart said the fault cast doubts over the bank's ability handle the expected high levels of demand. The bank had been carrying out tests based on 15,000 calls a day - the number of people who have already registered. \"It [the system] slowed right down. We decided we were clearly not going to have time to fix this before we launch,\" he said. \"It is embarrassing but we think it is better to disappoint customers than to anger them should we have had any problems. We simply cannot launch until we are sure we can handle the anticipated levels of customer activity.\" Testing will continue over the next few weeks. The delay means the loss of a month's sales. Halifax is investing \u00a3120m over two years in IF, including \u00a310m on an advertising push which started earlier this month with a national billboard campaign. Only last month IF was still assuring customers that its \"cutting-edge systems\" would be able to cope with the expected large volume of applications. It was quick to highlight the problems experienced by Abbey National's rival online offering, Cahoot, which was brought to its knees by a glitch on its start-up day a month ago. Mr Spowart said that, while the plan was to go live next month, \"we are not going to go until we are ready\". The bank is contacting all those who have registered during recent weeks to explain the situation and apologise for any inconvenience. Mr Spowart said that the problem \"would not have put customers at risk\". IF was due to open for telephone business today and for internet applications 10 days later. It decided on a two-stage start-up following Cahoot's technical problems, and said it had made a \"substantial investment in the most advanced technology available\" to ensure it could meet the pent-up demand for its products, which include a current account, flexible mortgage, savings account, credit cards and personal loans. The phone banking operation is supported by 1,200 call centre staff. The Livingston and Edinburgh operations are said by IF to add up to the largest integrated call and web centre in Europe.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Andy Flintoff's weight has been bulking out the column inches for the best part of a week, but it now turns out that everyone got it wrong. He is fatter than we thought. </p> <p>Flintoff, the player known as \"Fat Slogger\" to his team-mates, is listed in the Cricketers' Who's Who as 13st 10lb. In fact he is 17st 12lb, which means he is heavier than Britain's world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, who is expected to weigh 17st 9lb when he faces Frans Botha on Saturday. </p> <p>Yesterday Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, was on the defensive when he said: \"His weight is very slightly down on what it was in April. But now everyone is saying he's fat. </p> <p>\"He's upset about what's been written about him. There is a slight difference in Freddie's attitude at the moment. He's under a lot of pressure. He realises he's got to prove a point.\" </p> <p>Fletcher then revealed that Flintoff's current weight was \"114 kilos\". He added that the player's target weight was 108kg, or about a stone less than he is at the moment. \"We got him down to this in South Africa.\" </p> <p>Fletcher also set the imagination boggling when he said: \"If you have a look at his weight when he was 20, it was far in excess of what it is now.\" Clearly the Who's Who is crying out for a reprint. </p> <p>The England management are upset about the player's weight problem and do not mind if they shame him into doing something about it. </p> <p>Fletcher looked very serious indeed when he said: \"He's got to work on his weight if he's going to maintain his progress in cricket.\" Widening his point to take in the entire squad he added: \"Careers are at stake. We can give guidelines but at the end of the day it's up to the individual to take on board what we are offering.\" </p> <p>Flintoff, 22, also known as Freddie, as in Flintstone, has been represented as English cricket's long lost Ian Botham, a destructive hitter and a bowler capable of generating pace from a short approach. </p> <p>There is nothing wrong with his weight that a bludgeoning century or a five-wicket return would not put right. Shane Warne's waistline is rarely the subject of criticism from the Australian Cricket Board. </p> <p>Flintoff's weight is not his only worry as England prepare for their first home international under lights.

      "bodyText": "Andy Flintoff's weight has been bulking out the column inches for the best part of a week, but it now turns out that everyone got it wrong. He is fatter than we thought. Flintoff, the player known as \"Fat Slogger\" to his team-mates, is listed in the Cricketers' Who's Who as 13st 10lb. In fact he is 17st 12lb, which means he is heavier than Britain's world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, who is expected to weigh 17st 9lb when he faces Frans Botha on Saturday. Yesterday Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, was on the defensive when he said: \"His weight is very slightly down on what it was in April. But now everyone is saying he's fat. \"He's upset about what's been written about him. There is a slight difference in Freddie's attitude at the moment. He's under a lot of pressure. He realises he's got to prove a point.\" Fletcher then revealed that Flintoff's current weight was \"114 kilos\". He added that the player's target weight was 108kg, or about a stone less than he is at the moment. \"We got him down to this in South Africa.\" Fletcher also set the imagination boggling when he said: \"If you have a look at his weight when he was 20, it was far in excess of what it is now.\" Clearly the Who's Who is crying out for a reprint. The England management are upset about the player's weight problem and do not mind if they shame him into doing something about it. Fletcher looked very serious indeed when he said: \"He's got to work on his weight if he's going to maintain his progress in cricket.\" Widening his point to take in the entire squad he added: \"Careers are at stake. We can give guidelines but at the end of the day it's up to the individual to take on board what we are offering.\" Flintoff, 22, also known as Freddie, as in Flintstone, has been represented as English cricket's long lost Ian Botham, a destructive hitter and a bowler capable of generating pace from a short approach. There is nothing wrong with his weight that a bludgeoning century or a five-wicket return would not put right. Shane Warne's waistline is rarely the subject of criticism from the Australian Cricket Board. Flintoff's weight is not his only worry as England prepare for their first home international under lights. His back injury will prevent him from bowling today against Zimbabwe - who have already qualified for the final - and he will play as a specialist batsman, if he plays at all. In the nets yesterday Fletcher spoke to Flintoff after he had miscued one particular cow shot and the batsman knocked over his stumps in frustration when he played the same stroke a little later. England will again be without their captain Nasser Hussain, whose hand injury has not improved. Nick Knight, who also misses today's game, could return for Saturday's match against West Indies.

      "bodyText": "England have recovered some of the pride they lost over the weekend with a thumping eight-wicket victory over Zimbabwe at Old Trafford. After dismissing the Zims for 114 in the 39th over, they raced to a crucial win with almost 30 overs to spare. It was England's first day/nighter in this country - but the lights were hardly needed. England now have three points from three games, two more than West Indies and with a significantly better run-rate. Zimbabwe had won the toss and elected to bat on a firm wicket. It was the right decision at the time, and when the 50 came up in the 15th over for the loss of Neil Johnson, caught behind off Andy Caddick for 7, and Guy Whittall, also held by Alec Stewart, off Darren Gough, for 15, Zimbabwe were all set for the onslaught.

They'd rather talk about the impressively staged battle scenes and the quality of Mel's acting. Instead, they find themselves forced to defend their picture, point-by-point, against accusations ranging from fascism to racism.</p> <p>Let's first look at Jonathan Foreman's scathing attack in <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2000/07/03/patriot/index.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Salon</a>, which damned The Patriot for painting the English army as \"cartoonish paragons of evil\", and went on to remark that the picture was fascist. \"If the Nazis had won the war in Europe,\" Foreman claimed, \". . .The Patriot is exactly the movie you could expect to see.\" </p> <p>Mention of the f-word prompts Emmerich to draw heavily on his cigarette. \"That's pretty hard to deal with,\" he drawls in an accent one-part Berlin versus two-parts Beverly Hills. \"I would have to talk about what I've learned all my life about fascism in my own country. But [Foreman's] using the word 'fascism' very lightly.\" Devlin agrees: \"It's a real disrespect to those people who've actually suffered under fascism. It's not really worthy of our comment.\"</p> <p>To call The Patriot a fascist movie may be stretching things, but the film's glossy re-ordering of history still raises troublesome issues. Possibly its UK success depends on your own feelings about the American War of Independence. Triumph of liberty and democracy, or - to quote the hippie history teacher in Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused - \"a bunch of slave-owning, aristocratic white males who didn't want to pay their taxes\" ? Resistance to England's taxation of a slave-owning economy was central to the War of Independence. Its heroes were predominantly wealthy plantation owners who saw their slaves switch sides and fight with the English army against them. </p> <p>In tidying up its tale, The Patriot opts to gloss over this side of the story. Spike Lee, for one, is not impressed (see our <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,340344,00.html\">news story</a>). In a damning letter to The Hollywood Reporter, the Afro-American director dismissed Emmerich and Devlin's film as \"pure blatant Hollywood propaganda; a complete whitewashing of history.\" Lee continued: \"When talking about the history of this great country, one can never forget that America was built upon the genocide of the Native Americans and the enslavement of African people. To say otherwise is criminal.\" </p> <p>Devlin shakes his head. \"Look, there is a very interesting movie to be made about the American Revolution, and when Spike Lee wants to make it I'll be the first in line to see it. But this is not that movie. It's one man's story. It's the story of a man trying to protect his family.\" Emmerich: \"If we were making a film about the Revolution we would have made a film about George Washington. This is more in the tradition of Gone With the Wind or The Last of the Mohicans. The historical event is a backdrop.\"</p> <p>Lee, however, was particularly incensed by the rose-tinted presentation of Gibson's character (a South Carolina landowner) as a tolerant soul morally opposed to slavery. </p> <p>Gibson's character is based on true-life revolutionary hero Francis Marion. However, a bit of homework revealed that Marion was actually a slave-owner who raped his slaves and hunted Indians for fun (see our <a href=\" http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,332358,00.html\">news story</a>). A spot of hasty re-writing was called for, and Francis Marion became Benjamin Martin.</p> <p>\"Yes, we fictionalised him,\" admits Devlin. \"He's a fictional character. Look, when we started this movie we believed that everyone at the time of the Revolution was of the same opinion about slavery. And they weren't. Slavery was a hotbed even then. There was a small minority of farmers in South Carolina who made a moral choice not have slaves and to hire free men. So we thought: 'If we're going to turn this man into a hero, should we take one who's a slave-owner and inherently a racist, or should we put the spotlight on somebody who made that moral choice?'. We thought it was more responsible. Now Spike Lee's upset about that. Would he rather we made a hero out of a slave-owner? I just don't understand the logic.\"</p> <p>In a sense the man's confusion is understandable. It typifies America's greatest dilemma. The contradiction that lies at the very heart of the country: a great libertarian community forged on the back of slave labour. </p> <p>So how does your average movie-maker tackle this incongruity? Does he make a warts-and-all overview of the War of Independence and risk offending Middle America, or does he airbrush away the unpleasant bits and find themselves accused of irresponsibly doctoring the facts? The Patriot, by and large, has gone for the second option. In doing so it has reaped the rewards in box-office, and paid the price in adverse criticism. \"Whatever you do,\" sighs Devlin, \"you're never going to please everyone.\"</p> <p>Next Devlin and Emmerich are taking a back-seat away from the front-lineof film-making. The duo are currently preparing to produce a monster movie about giant spiders who invade a small Nevada township. \"I think it's going to be a lot of fun and a real change of pace,\" Emmerich says happily. Humans versus monsters. Good Americans versus evil spiders. The moral terrain, thankfully, is much more clear-cut. </p>",

It was a tremendous shock. For some Tories, it must have been like hearing that nanny is leaving to get married. They'd pretend to be happy for her, but inside they'd be screaming \"what about me?\".</p> <p>Betty then said that she would also resign from her seat in West Bromwich West. A startled \"ooh\" swept round the chamber, and you can bet there were plenty of MPs who at that point could actually recall her majority when she was last opposed by a Tory (7,830 should be just about safe barring another rise in petrol tax).</p> <p>But she clearly thought the \"ooh\" was one of dismay, because she departed from her script and said passionately, \"Be happy for me!\" - and for the first time I have ever heard, the House of Commons started clapping.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary sight and an extraordinary sound. Clapping is not what they do. You are simply not supposed to clap, in the same way as you are not meant to throw toilet rolls.</p> <p>You can go \"year, year, year\" like a manatee with indigestion. You may shout and jeer and yell. You can wave your order paper in the air. You can even, like Le Petomane, fart Frere Jacques, and you will find nothing to forbid it in Erskine May.</p> <p>But against all the rules they clapped, wildly, with warmth and gratitude and affection, as if she were Judi Dench at the Oscars, Shirley Bassey on the Des O'Connor Show, or the Williams sisters at Wimbledon.</p> <p>Or at least the Labour and Liberal benches clapped. Some strange atavistic impulse stopped almost all the Tories from joining in (Michael Ancram and Ann Widdecombe did clap, but in a rather tired, thanks-due-to-our-hon-sec kind of way). Did the rest imagine that on this day of all days the Speaker would reprove them?</p> <p>Betty does not - how can I put this - have serious problems with her self-esteem, and I suspect she was awfully pleased to find that the announcement of her going was greeted by a total break-down in parliamentary order.</p> <p>Then Margaret Beckett announced that there would be a full valediction in a fortnight, allowing Betty to represent the house in Ukraine, New York, Scotland and other foreign climes. (In the US I saw, on Saturday Night Live, a take-off of our own prime minister's question time, based on the assumption that viewers would recognise it. That's like Rory Bremner spoofing the Danish parliament and expecting us to get the gags.)</p> <p>Mrs Beckett added that the election of Speaker will be held when the house returns for autumn, when the father of the house - Ted Heath - will take the chair. So instead of the Speaker saying, \"Order, order!\" MPs will have to yell \"Wakey, wakey!\"</p> <p>MPs filed away to discuss the succession. They love elections for Speaker they can conspire and wheedle and trade without caring two hoots what their constituents think.</p> <p>Oh, and thanks to the Tory u-turn on taxes, Tony Blair did much better at question time, which left his troops in a very good mood, with a leader who looks once more like a winner, and 15 blissful weeks of plotting to come.</p> <p>Politics, page 11</p> <p>David McKie, page 19</p> <p>Back to Results</p>",

A startled \"ooh\" swept round the chamber, and you can bet there were plenty of MPs who at that point could actually recall her majority when she was last opposed by a Tory (7,830 should be just about safe barring another rise in petrol tax). But she clearly thought the \"ooh\" was one of dismay, because she departed from her script and said passionately, \"Be happy for me!\" - and for the first time I have ever heard, the House of Commons started clapping. It was an extraordinary sight and an extraordinary sound. Clapping is not what they do. You are simply not supposed to clap, in the same way as you are not meant to throw toilet rolls. You can go \"year, year, year\" like a manatee with indigestion. You may shout and jeer and yell. You can wave your order paper in the air. You can even, like Le Petomane, fart Frere Jacques, and you will find nothing to forbid it in Erskine May. But against all the rules they clapped, wildly, with warmth and gratitude and affection, as if she were Judi Dench at the Oscars, Shirley Bassey on the Des O'Connor Show, or the Williams sisters at Wimbledon. Or at least the Labour and Liberal benches clapped. Some strange atavistic impulse stopped almost all the Tories from joining in (Michael Ancram and Ann Widdecombe did clap, but in a rather tired, thanks-due-to-our-hon-sec kind of way). Did the rest imagine that on this day of all days the Speaker would reprove them? Betty does not - how can I put this - have serious problems with her self-esteem, and I suspect she was awfully pleased to find that the announcement of her going was greeted by a total break-down in parliamentary order. Then Margaret Beckett announced that there would be a full valediction in a fortnight, allowing Betty to represent the house in Ukraine, New York, Scotland and other foreign climes. (In the US I saw, on Saturday Night Live, a take-off of our own prime minister's question time, based on the assumption that viewers would recognise it. That's like Rory Bremner spoofing the Danish parliament and expecting us to get the gags.) Mrs Beckett added that the election of Speaker will be held when the house returns for autumn, when the father of the house - Ted Heath - will take the chair. So instead of the Speaker saying, \"Order, order!\" MPs will have to yell \"Wakey, wakey!\" MPs filed away to discuss the succession. They love elections for Speaker they can conspire and wheedle and trade without caring two hoots what their constituents think. Oh, and thanks to the Tory u-turn on taxes, Tony Blair did much better at question time, which left his troops in a very good mood, with a leader who looks once more like a winner, and 15 blissful weeks of plotting to come.

If anything, Tuesday's anonymous allegations of cheating will have reinforced the idea that it is all hopeless. This corrosive proposition, that nothing can be done until poverty has been completely eliminated, undermines the drive to raise standards and the excellent results which teachers are achieving. It suggests that those of us who found education to be the ladder out of poverty should have accepted our lot in life rather than seizing the opportunity which lifelong learning gave us. </p> <p>Davies suggested that the exam system was fraudulent, without providing a shred of evidence. This is a disgraceful slur on hard-working heads and teachers across the country. The implication was that if they weren't cheating, they should be because several people whom Davies declined to name said they knew someone who cheated. </p> <p>This is not only poor journalism but, more importantly, is deeply damaging to the youngsters whose life chances are being transformed. Should he let me have any names, I will ensure each case is investigated. But over the past three years, I have made sure that the procedures we use are consistent, fair and rigorous. </p> <p>Literacy and numeracy standards have increased because we introduced a clearer focus through daily hour-long lessons, better teaching and extra money for training. I know it is difficult for cynics to accept, but the reality is that the literacy and numeracy hours have made a difference and teachers and parents know it. </p> <p>Expectation is what matters most. If you assume that children from a disadvantaged background will fail, they will do so. If you believe they can and should fulfil their potential, there is a much greater chance that they will. I know because I was there myself. I know also because I've seen how good schools in poorer areas can and do make a difference. </p> <p>That is what \"Excellence in cities\" is about. It started in 450 secondary schools last September and extends to others this coming school year. Each school ensures that the curriculum meets the needs of its most able pupils, regardless of background. They have money for on-site learning support units so that teachers can get pupils who misbehave out of the classroom quickly and without red tape. </p> <p>The units are based on a model of proven success. They were piloted for three years and were independently evaluated. They improved behaviour, reduced the need for exclusions and were cost effective. That is why we recently announced funding for more than 1,000 units by 2002. These inner-city schools also get money for learning mentors, who, as full-time staff members, can tackle truancy and other social issues quickly, leaving teachers free to teach. Casually dismissing them as Davies does is to ignore the idea that such help should be available quickly and when it is needed. </p> <p>This government is doing more to tackle the problems of discipline, exclusion and truancy than has ever been attempted before. We are spending \u00a3140m this year - compared to \u00a317m four years ago - which is certainly not leading to any \"simultaneous cuts\" in spending on disaffected children. Quite the opposite. </p> <p>On-site units are not a replacement for off-site pupil referral units. Where schools do have to exclude - and headteachers have my full support in excluding where they need to, for example, violent or seriously disruptive pupils - they will get a full-time education instead of an average of three hours a week as in the past. By 2002, all education authorities will be required to offer 25 hours a week to excluded pupils. In the past year there has been a net increase of 28 pupil referral units - there are more pupils on roll and contact time is increasing. </p> <p>Education authorities most certainly do continue to have a statutory responsibility for truants outside school, contrary to Davies's assertions. They are responsible for making sure that children go to school regularly, and for taking action against parents who deprive children of their education. Far from simply \"relying on heavier fines and home-school contracts\" to cut truancy, we are funding schools to improve their monitoring of attendance and to chase up truants. </p> <p> Davies is right that we do need more good vocational education. That is why we have provided more work-related alternatives for 14 to 16-year-olds, with new vocational GCSEs planned. It is why we are introducing more and better apprenticeships, new vocational A-levels and vocationally oriented foundation degrees. </p> <p>Nobody is suggesting that schools can \"be expected to completely neutralise the harsh conditions in which many of these adolescents live\", as his article puts it. That would be absurd. It will take time, but we are doing more than ever before to confront and tackle the complex issues of social exclusion, both in our education and social policy. We are confronting the challenge head on, and putting our money where our mouth is. </p> <p>I know there is more to do both to improve standards overall and to give youngsters from poorer backgrounds the help they need to succeed. I know we need to do more to help failing schools turn themselves around - pretending such failure doesn't exist would be a profound betrayal of children and their families. </p> <p>However, in three years, we have seen real improvements in literacy and numeracy. We are spending far more on schools - in real terms \u00a3300 more per pupil this year than in 1997 and three times as much on capital. We are employing more teachers, have cut infant class sizes, introduced a better pay structure for teachers, turned around failing schools far quicker than before, improved access to computers greatly, provided 120,000 more free nursery places and are spending seven times as much on directly dealing with the problems Davies identified on Monday. </p> <p>With next week's spending review, I hope we can continue this progress. But one thing is certain: we will only do it when pupils, parents and teachers believe they can make a difference and know that they can do it. To pretend otherwise, as Davies does, would be to consign a large number of today's youngsters to the scrapheap. I for one have no intention of accepting such a counsel of despair. I have more faith than that in the ability of our pupils and in the capacity of our teachers to make a real difference. </p> <p>David Blunkett is secretary of state for education and employment.</p>",

Should he let me have any names, I will ensure each case is investigated. But over the past three years, I have made sure that the procedures we use are consistent, fair and rigorous. Literacy and numeracy standards have increased because we introduced a clearer focus through daily hour-long lessons, better teaching and extra money for training. I know it is difficult for cynics to accept, but the reality is that the literacy and numeracy hours have made a difference and teachers and parents know it. Expectation is what matters most. If you assume that children from a disadvantaged background will fail, they will do so. If you believe they can and should fulfil their potential, there is a much greater chance that they will. I know because I was there myself. I know also because I've seen how good schools in poorer areas can and do make a difference. That is what \"Excellence in cities\" is about. It started in 450 secondary schools last September and extends to others this coming school year. Each school ensures that the curriculum meets the needs of its most able pupils, regardless of background. They have money for on-site learning support units so that teachers can get pupils who misbehave out of the classroom quickly and without red tape. The units are based on a model of proven success. They were piloted for three years and were independently evaluated. They improved behaviour, reduced the need for exclusions and were cost effective. That is why we recently announced funding for more than 1,000 units by 2002. These inner-city schools also get money for learning mentors, who, as full-time staff members, can tackle truancy and other social issues quickly, leaving teachers free to teach. Casually dismissing them as Davies does is to ignore the idea that such help should be available quickly and when it is needed. This government is doing more to tackle the problems of discipline, exclusion and truancy than has ever been attempted before. We are spending \u00a3140m this year - compared to \u00a317m four years ago - which is certainly not leading to any \"simultaneous cuts\" in spending on disaffected children. Quite the opposite. On-site units are not a replacement for off-site pupil referral units. Where schools do have to exclude - and headteachers have my full support in excluding where they need to, for example, violent or seriously disruptive pupils - they will get a full-time education instead of an average of three hours a week as in the past. By 2002, all education authorities will be required to offer 25 hours a week to excluded pupils. In the past year there has been a net increase of 28 pupil referral units - there are more pupils on roll and contact time is increasing. Education authorities most certainly do continue to have a statutory responsibility for truants outside school, contrary to Davies's assertions. They are responsible for making sure that children go to school regularly, and for taking action against parents who deprive children of their education. Far from simply \"relying on heavier fines and home-school contracts\" to cut truancy, we are funding schools to improve their monitoring of attendance and to chase up truants. Davies is right that we do need more good vocational education. That is why we have provided more work-related alternatives for 14 to 16-year-olds, with new vocational GCSEs planned. It is why we are introducing more and better apprenticeships, new vocational A-levels and vocationally oriented foundation degrees. Nobody is suggesting that schools can \"be expected to completely neutralise the harsh conditions in which many of these adolescents live\", as his article puts it. That would be absurd. It will take time, but we are doing more than ever before to confront and tackle the complex issues of social exclusion, both in our education and social policy. We are confronting the challenge head on, and putting our money where our mouth is. I know there is more to do both to improve standards overall and to give youngsters from poorer backgrounds the help they need to succeed. I know we need to do more to help failing schools turn themselves around - pretending such failure doesn't exist would be a profound betrayal of children and their families. However, in three years, we have seen real improvements in literacy and numeracy. We are spending far more on schools - in real terms \u00a3300 more per pupil this year than in 1997 and three times as much on capital. We are employing more teachers, have cut infant class sizes, introduced a better pay structure for teachers, turned around failing schools far quicker than before, improved access to computers greatly, provided 120,000 more free nursery places and are spending seven times as much on directly dealing with the problems Davies identified on Monday. With next week's spending review, I hope we can continue this progress. But one thing is certain: we will only do it when pupils, parents and teachers believe they can make a difference and know that they can do it. To pretend otherwise, as Davies does, would be to consign a large number of today's youngsters to the scrapheap. I for one have no intention of accepting such a counsel of despair. I have more faith than that in the ability of our pupils and in the capacity of our teachers to make a real difference. David Blunkett is secretary of state for education and employment.",

Of 127 headteachers in Warwickshire who took part in a survey by the National Association of Head Teachers, 22 said they were \"alcohol dependent\" and eight were \"drinking more than they should, - a significant amount every day\". David Hart, general secretary of NAHT, told MPs on the education sub-committee there was \"clear and increasing evidence\" that the introduction of performance-related pay and new management systems, combined with the government's standards agenda, was \"taking its toll\" on headteachers. More than half the 250 headteachers in Warwickshire replied to the survey. Of those who replied, 61 had visited a doctor in the last year for complaints including high blood pressure, severe depression, bulimia, skin problems and sleepless nights, 44 are or had been on medication, and 42 are actively looking for less stressful work. The local education authority has been named as one of the top three in the country by Ofsted inspectors and its schools have a good reputation. \"Warwickshire is the last place in the world where you would expect these sort of results,\" Mr Hart said. \"The pressures that heads in leafy lanes suffer from are different from the deprived areas. But they all suffer from stress.\" If the Warwickshire pattern was repeated across the country, between 5,000 and 6,000 headteachers would have a drink problem. A primary school headteacher from Essex wrote to him this week that \"a frightening proportion\" of headteachers were \"on medication related to stress or other psychological illness, brought on largely by trying to do the impossible\". Mr Hart said he was sure the government would reach its targets for key stage tests, but said: \"Headteachers are just sick and tired of the target-setting agenda, with those targets being ratcheted up year after year after year.\" In general evidence from unions to the education sub-committee yesterday, Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, described pupil behaviour, government-generated bureaucracy and aspects of Ofsted inspections as the main problems facing teachers. John Bangs, assistant general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said teachers were being kept \"outside the loop\" when government developed policy. Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said that when 50% of teachers were over 45 and 40% over 50, the government had to motivate these teachers whose highest aspiration had been premature retirement. In evidence on the sub-committee's inquiry into elitism in higher education, Neil Hopkins, principal of Peter Symonds sixth form college in Winchester, said state school pupils were discouraged by Oxbridge's admissions. \"To an outsider Oxford and Cambridge admissions seem arcane...

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday swept away uncertainty about his government's strategic direction when he capped an upbeat Downing Street press conference with a bravura Commons performance that restored his tarnished authority. After weeks of unwelcome setbacks, the prime minister seized on official employment figures - showing that 1m jobs have been created since his 1997 election victory - to explain directly to impatient voters how his strategy is gradually becoming reality. Using No 10's dining room for a rare press conference in the presidential White House style, Mr Blair set the scene for the chancellor's \u00a340bn spending review next Tuesday: the investment-oriented third stage of Labour's programme of national rejuvenation which will pour billions into health, education, transport and science. In a foretaste of Labour's election campaign he said: \"Britain is stronger because we are delivering on the fundamentals but there is a lot more hard work to be done. We are not in the least complacent. Over 1m people are still unemployed, but at least we are getting there.\" Not only did he proclaim record levels of employment - 28m people in work and the jobless total of 1,098,000 the lowest since 1980 - Mr Blair said the cost of welfare, \"the price of social and economic failure\", is finally falling. Showing no signs of recent fatigue he even said that, with the pound dropping in value, \"we are beginning to turn the position round on manufacturing\" - of crucial importance to Labour's core vote. At his side David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, added: \"Full employment is within our grasp.\" William Hague later used question time to mock the phrase \"we are getting there\" and accused Labour of another desperate relaunch after a succession of mishaps, including rows over the euro and the much-mocked \"cashpoint\" plan for lager louts. But in contrast to a week ago, when the Tory leader hammered him at the dispatch box, Mr Blair was in fighting form. During fierce exchanges he sprang what he called a \"spending cuts guarantee\" trap on the Conservatives, which his advisers believe could keep them in opposition for the rest of the decade. Deriding the series of guarantees Mr Hague made last October - on which he has been forced to retreat - Mr Blair seized upon every Conservative complaint about failing local services. The new Conservative pledge to cut public spending by up to \u00a316bn would make matters worse - \"fewer nurses, fewer teachers, fewer police, fewer hospitals\" in their constituencies, he predicted. Downing Street - which now plans to hold regular prime ministerial press conferences to circumvent what it calls a cynical and hostile media - believes that with their u-turn, Mr Hague and his shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, have committed a blunder from which it will take years to escape. Building on Mr Blair's bid to drive home the government's message that it is delivering on its pledges to improve public services, the chancellor will today announce an unexpected windfall of \u00a32bn-3bn to be spent on education, transport and law and order over the next three years. The chancellor will say that Whitehall's big departments are to receive extra funding in next week's comprehensive spending review, on top of the \u00a340bn they were expecting to receive, thanks to falling levels of unemployment and lower interest payments on the national debt. According to the Treasury, proceeds from the \u00a322bn sale of licences for the third generation of mobile phones will reduce debt interest payments by just over \u00a31bn by 2003/04 and this will be more than matched by savings from the shortening of dole queues. In a speech to the Royal Economic Society in St Andrews, Mr Brown will say that this \"allows us to devote more to the country's priorities for vital public services - spending on education, health, transport and policing which this government is committed to delivering. \"This is extra public spending which comes not at the expense of our prudence, but because of our prudence.\" Labour sources said last night that Mr Brown's announcement would put extra pressure on the Tories to say how they would find the reductions in spending to pay for their promised tax cuts. Mr Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, who has recently been taking a back seat, later confirmed that Mr Blair intends to become more visible as the general election - probably next May or June - looms. \"The more his voice is heard, the better it is, because when his voice is heard and listened to, they understand what this government is about,\" he explained. Today the prime minister will appear before MPs to present the government's annual report. At the press conference yesterday Mr Blair took questions across a range of policies for an hour. He kept emphasising how Labour's 1997 plans are now bearing fruit because of Mr Brown's commitment to economic stability and to the welfare-to-work programme. The third stage, huge investment in what he called an \"under-invested-in country\", is now happening. \"Good economic management is essential but not enough, falling unemployment is essential but not enough. We now need the next stage - to tackle the problem of poor productivity and lack of essential investment in the nation's future.\" Ministers faced expert criticism yesterday over the performance of the flagship New Deal programme for getting long-term and young unemployed people into work. But ministers insist it is getting 7,000 people into jobs each month and virtually pays for itself. Mr Blair told reporters that New Deal recruits who were inarticulate and unemployable when they joined the programme were transformed in three months.",

      "body": "<p>I f you're tired of the third way, consider for a moment the fourth. The third way has produced the most tedious political meditations of our time. It's a confusion of opposites, a blur of contradictions, a proud denial of the need for a party to choose. Touted as the New Labour vision, it can be marked down as the prime reason for the government now having no vision. When people say Tony Blair is an unprincipled opportunist, roaming over the spectrum to offer all things to all men and women, the vacuities of the third way, his theology, are what they have in mind.</p> <p>But the third way is a model of clarity by comparison with the fourth way. That's what we discover as these July days unfold. By this time next week, Labour will have put some first-way flesh on the third-way bones. The party line is emerging from its nebulous obscurity. It's becoming clear what all-purpose Blairism really stands for, just at the time when the fourth wayers, led by William Hague, reveal the philosophical chaos of their project.</p> <p>New Labour is making a rendezvous with old Labour, as the comprehensive spending review will show. New Labour believes in public spending, and will apply unprecedented quantities of it to the problems of our time. It is true that Mr Blair boxes the compass. Of all the things he said at his press conference yesterday, what seemed to fill him with most pride was citing the global survey which found the UK to be the world's second favourite economy in which to invest: something the last Labour government could not have dreamed of, might indeed have been horrified to learn.</p> <p>But next week's spending announcements will make Labour feel comfortable with itself. Not only Labour, but its leader. Though he hasn't had time to become a statesman, he is a state-man. He believes in the enabling role of public money in the services at the core of daily life. This is not an apologetic stance, born of temporary convenience. Mr Blair delivers it with passion. Reeling off the record of the new deal, and the promise of money to come in schools and hospitals and police stations, he speaks to the same moral code, out of the same political impulses, as Harold Wilson or Tony Benn. He may frame the money as social investment, and place the emphasis on preparing people for the capitalist world of work. But he has no doubt the state must do it.</p> <p>The fourth way has no such clarity. In 1997, Labour got to power on the basis of maintaining Tory spending plans for two years ahead. In 2001, the Conservatives will seek power on the basis of rejecting Labour's spending plans for three years ahead. Labour was shedding its reputation as the party that couldn't be trusted with the economy. The Tories are hellbent on confirming their reputation as the party that is anti-state - yet also, somehow, compassionate. They are not making themselves clear to us, because they cannot resolve the unclarity in their own head.</p> <p>For Mr Hague to reverse his tax guarantee is an embarrassment. How a policy which, only months ago, was pledged with \"no escape clauses, no fudges\" can now become expendable will confuse people who might have been warming to a bit of upright, downright, Yorkshire common sense. But the language has changed more than the policy. Tax-cutting will be suspended only if the economy is in a bad way. Spending cuts, which are the main consequence of tax cuts, remain the goal. The guarantee is redirected, but with the same purpose, of declaring against the state as the necessary agent of provision in the areas where it has performed that role for a very long time.</p> <p>Yet the Tories are not prepared to spell that out in honest detail. Their stance is half-hearted. It lacks philosophical coherence. They attitudinise, but do not organise. On tax and spending, their strategy partly resembles what they've done on asylum seekers and criminals, who are being promised the kind of hard time the Tory heartland voters are slavering to watch. But in the end, the stance on this core issue of the state and its size is different. It is much warier of the voters. While some voters may warm to the promise of extreme measures against muggers and burglars, most would be displeased to hear that public investment in education and health was to be dramatically reduced, as the minimal state materialised before our eyes.</p> <p>So the Tories announce a general priority against state spending, in keeping with their prejudice. Under Mrs Thatcher, their anti-state ideology was satisfied by the privatisation of industries and utilities, but unfortunately there are none of these left to sell. In their heart, Tories would like to do more - hence the promise to hold spending below growth, even if this means, as it would on present forecasts, cutting \u00a317bn from the public budget. The party is pleased to hear it. The number of Conservative politicians who believe in the positive merits of state spending has much diminished. Whereas a cohort of ministers, not just the Priors and the Gilmours but Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson, ensured that the Thatcher government left the state taking as much of national wealth in 1990 as it had in 1979, Mr Hague and Mr Portillo think of themselves as crusaders against the state.</p> <p>But they will not say how or where to cut. They have a dogmatic preference, which they pragmatically shrink from. They want the state to reduce in general but not, it seems, in particular. Their retreat from the tax guarantee into a cuts guarantee has been welcomed by commentators as very wise. But the nature of the cuts is not an academic question, to which the answer can be patiently awaited. It is the essence of the matter. Until the choice of cuts is declared, the retreat seems like the tactical manoeuvre of a party, torn between heart and head, that cannot decide what to do or think.</p> <p>Even Mr Hague, in other words, seems to suspect that his position is at odds with the preferences of the British people. Popular attachment to public services is very great, and a party that promises to cut spending on them, in a time of so much private prosperity, will be unelectable. Yet here is a party which combines anti-state ideology with rhetoric that indicates more not less spending on health, defence, law and order, to name but three. It wants to take Conservatism further right, on the model of the Texas Republicans, while pretending that nobody will pay.</p> <p>The truth is that it cannot do that. The muddle is too obvious, the opportunism too shallow. The British belief in the welfare state not the minimal state is so strong, as the Thatcherites discovered long ago, that serious cutting back on education and health could be done after a long, serious, bruising ideological campaign. Mr Hague dare not try that. So he dabbles in obscure undertakings and fancy contradictions. It is the fourth way, which makes the third seem a model of harmony and coherence.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto: hugoyoung@compuserve.com\"> hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

Which is why we wholeheartedly support the Labour MP for Eastwood, Jim Murphy, in his little survey of all the \"so-called fans\" (\"s-cfs\") who are currently banned or restricted from watching their clubs play. </p> <p>Of course, the survey doesn't say why the \"s-cfs\" have been banned, whether the numbers are the tip of an iceberg or just a sign that clubs are acting more vigilantly. But Mr Murphy finds them \"shocking\" all the same, and has chosen to release his findings on the day Jack Straw looks to push through his enlightened Football (disorder) bill aimed at stopping \"s-cfs\" (or indeed anyone) from leaving the country if the fuzz take a dislike to them.</p> <p>There are currently 402 \"s-cfs\" banned from England's 92 league clubs, and Mr Murphy (a Celtic supporter) found that Leeds United came out top with a total of 59. Busy as he is, Peter Ridsdale found time today to comment on this very substantial and in no way superficial report. \"I am surprised to find us at the top of such a list, given all the hard work we have put in over recent years,\" Ridsdale said. \"And if you look at the arrests at Elland Road and away grounds involving Leeds games recently then there would hardly be an incident of note.\"</p> <p>Stoke City came second in the hate club list with 43 \"s-cfs\" and Man City's notoriously humourless support came third with 23. This was no consolation to a very uncool daddy Ridsdale however. \"I am not trying to pretend that we have eradicated problems 100% and we will never rest on our laurels,\" he said. \"But I have no knowledge or statistics that would put us at the top of such a list.\" Not that this impressed Mr Murphy. \"I am sure that the clubs near the top will be up in arms at the findings,\" he smugged, \"but then again, so they should be.\" If that's the substance, perhaps spin ain't that bad after all.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>YOU CAN'T BEAT THE REAL THING</strong></p> <p>Pledges are made. Deals are struck, and things generally get downright dirty. And then after a long, drawn-out campaign what happens? Germany win. Is it any wonder no one votes any more? So thank God for Lorenzo Sanz and Florentino Perez, whose increasingly ludicrous fight for the presidency of Real Madrid is putting the 'Excitement' back into election. </p> <p>It all started when the outsider Florentino made an outrageous pledge to bring Barecelona's Luis Figo to Real if he won the election - despite the player possessing a contract with a whopping \u00a340m buy-out clause. A certain Zinedine Zidane might be on his way as well, he hinted. Yeah right, claimed an upstaged Sanz, who dismissed Perez's prattle as \"a joke, probably to be followed by the signing of Claudia Schiffer.\" </p> <p>Then, strangely, it turned out to be true. Well the Figo part anyway. Because a day after claiming he would be \"mad\" to do any such thing, the Portuguese playmaker admitted: \"I have an offer from senor Florentino Perez and that is why I want him to win the elections.\" And the offer? A cool \u00a35m a year. Furthermore, Spanish paper Marca claims that Figo's agent has signed a bizarre pre-contract which means Figo would have to pay \u00a320m if he didn't sign for the European champions once Florentino became president. </p> <p>Yesterday Sanz struck back with the launch of a \"save Real Madrid campaign\" which urged voters to concentrate on Sanz's record (the two Champions League victories, not the estimated \u00a3163m debt we assume). When that didn't work Sanz then decided to send a video of Figo insulting Real (\"Madridistas, cry babies, hail the champions!\") to all 66,000 club members with a vote in Sunday's ballot. Not to be outdone, Florentino then promised a free season ticket to each member - out of his own money - if he wins the election and Figo doesn't sign.

An increase in the amount of recycling collected and a drop in the market for recycled materials means that collections are being incinerated or dumped at tips. \"I'd be very, very cross if I thought the people who collected my recycling just sent it to the dump,\" says Paula Brockes. \"I go out of my way to put it into the right containers and drive four miles to the recycling dump each week.

Though again MPs will say to themselves:he would do the job well, but is he too close to Blair? July 26, when she goes, will be a great party, with love and no doubt with tears. \"Be happy for me,\" she instructed MPs yesterday; they're used to doing as Betty tells them, so no doubt they will. It is hardly how Mr Speaker Lenthall, Tony Benn's 17th century hero, would have addressed the House, or Arthur Onslow, who served it for 34 years a century later. But it's certainly no worse for that. david.mckie@theguardian.com",

An International Bunbury XI, including players like Graham Gooch, Shane Warne, Graham Thorpe, Mike Gatting and Robin Smith, will take on a West Indian XI, captained by Viv Richards and containing many of Marshall's former team-mates in that all-powerful West Indian side of the 1980s.

All proceeds will go to a special charitable trust set up to provide for Mali Marshall, Malcolm's young son.</p> <p> <strong>Can you tell me anything about the West Indies Test cricketer Ellis Achong? </strong> asks Maryse Achong from Trinidad</p> <p>Ellis Edgar \"Puss\" Achong (1904-86) was a left-arm spinner of Chinese extraction who played six Tests for West Indies in the 1930s, taking eight wickets. He is credited with inventing the chinaman delivery - the left-arm wrist-spinner's googly. After he bowled Walter Robins, the Middlesex and England allrounder, in a match at Lord's, Robins is supposed to have returned to the dressing-room and exclaimed \"Fancy being bowled by a Chinaman!\", whereupon one of his team-mates asked him whether he meant the bowler or the ball. Achong was the subject of a long article by Scyld Berry in Wisden Cricket Monthly in April 1998. This back issue is still available: e-mail wisden@ndirect.co.uk or ring 01483 570358 or for details.</p> <p> <strong>Can you please explain how the County Championship points system works? </strong> asks Phil Bowker</p> <p>The points system has changed a lot over the years - and it has changed again for the current season. The easy part is that the side winning the match gets 12 points, and both sides receive four points in a drawn game (six points each for a tie; no points for losing). The complicated bit is the bonus points, which are only available in the first 130 overs of each side's first innings. You can earn a maximum of five batting bonus points, for passing 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400. And you get bowling points - a maximum of three - for taking three, six and nine wickets. So the maximum number of points a county can score in a game is 20. </p> <p> <strong>What were the first names of Leyland, who played cricket for Yorkshire in the 1930s? </strong> asks Norman Brindley</p> <p>His one and only Christian name was Maurice (it was spelt \"Morris\" on his birth certificate). He was born in Harrogate on July 20, 1900, and died there on New Year's Day, 1967. Leyland was a fine left-hand batsman, who scored 33,660 runs in first-class cricket between 1920 and 1947, at an average of 40.50, with 80 centuries. He scored 2764 runs (46.06) in 41 Tests. He was also a handy left-arm spinner, who took 466 first-class wickets at 29.31. </p> <p> <strong>I hope to visit England in 2001. Have details of the international matches been released yet? </strong> asks Boyd Dempsey</p> <p>You're in luck: the dates were announced earlier this week. England will play two Tests against Pakistan, at Lord's (May 17-21) and Old Trafford (May 31-June 4), and five against Australia, at Edgbaston (July 5-9), Lord's (July 19-23), Trent Bridge (Aug 2-6), Headingley (Aug 16-20) and The Oval (Aug 23-27). In between the two Test series the three sides will contest a one-day competition. It starts with a floodlit match (England v Pakistan) at Edgbaston on June 7; the final will be at Lord's on June 23. </p> <p> <strong>Who has taken most wickets in one-day internationals? </strong> asks Otto Sreedharan</p> <p>Top of the list is Wasim Akram, who recently took his 400th one-day wicket to go with 400 in Tests as well. He's now got 427, and is well clear of his team-mate Waqar Younis, who's second with 311. Anil Kumble (India) is third with 267. For a list of the leaders <a href=\"http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/STATS/ODIS/BOWLING/ODI_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html\">click here</a>.</p> <p> <strong>The biggest win in history was by an innings and 851 runs. Do you have any more details of the match? </strong> asks Alex Roberts</p> <p>This was a match in Pakistan's Quaid-e-Azam Trophy at Lahore in 1964-65. Railways piled up 910 for 6 dec against Dera Ismail Khan, who replied with 32 and 27. DIK, as it is known, is a small town which didn't really have enough players to field a proper team - this turned out to be their one and only first-class match.</p> <p> <strong>Can you settle an argument please? I think that Alec Stewart scored the most Test runs during the 1990s. Am I right? </strong> asks Mick Collins</p> <p>Yes you are. Stewart scored more Test runs in the decade (6407) than anyone else. He was just ahead of Mark Waugh (6371), Mark Taylor (6306), Mike Atherton (6277) and Steve Waugh (6213). The decade's top Test wicket-taker was Shane Warne, with 351, ahead of those West Indian wonders Curtly Ambrose (309) and Courtney Walsh (304). </p> <p><strong>Against which bowler did David Gower score his first Test run? </strong> asks Toby Joyce</p> <p>It was Pakistan's Liaqat Ali, a left-arm medium-pacer, at Edgbaston on June 2, 1978. Liaqat's first ball was a friendly, shortish one on leg stump. Gower, who was two months past his 21st birthday, swivelled and pulled the ball effortlessly to the boundary. He went on to score 58, and made his first Test century against New Zealand later that summer. Gower actually made his full international debut in a one-dayer against Pakistan at Old Trafford in May 1978: he made 33.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Lars Von Trier's already infamous Palme D'Or winner <strong>Dancer In The Dark</strong> will open proceedings, and Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wai's exquisite story of unrequited love, <strong>In the Mood for Love</strong>, has been chosen to close the two-week festival. The director will be present in Edinburgh to give a masterclass - part of the Reel Life series of classes from directors, actors and writers. </p> <p>Also scheduled to participate in the Reel Life series are Se7en cinematographer Darius Khonji, Swedish director Liv Ullman (whose highly acclaimed film <strong>Faithless</strong> will be playing), and Basic Instinct and Robocop director Paul Verhoeven, whose <strong>The Hollow Man</strong> receives its international premiere. </p> <p>Terence Davies's sumptuous adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel <strong>The House of Mirth</strong>, starring Gillian Anderson, gets its world premiere, and the likes of Neil LaBute's <strong>Nurse Betty</strong> (think Doris Day meets David Lynch), Anthony Hopkins in Julie Taymor's bloody Shakespeare adaptation <strong>Titus</strong>, and the Coen brothers' eagerly anticipated <strong>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong> are sure to attract critical and popular interest.</p> <p>Digital technology and the endless possibilities of the medium of film are at the forefront of this year's festival. Dancer In The Dark, the opening film, was shot entirely digitally, as was the moving and deeply human drama <strong>One Life Stand</strong>. Showing as part of the Focus on British Cinema Strand, the latter also boasts the distinction of being the first ever feature film to be shown digitally in the UK. There will also be a special screening of Mike Figgis's <strong>Time Code</strong>, which was shot digitally, in real time, and will be accompanied by a live sound mix.</p> <p>The Focus on British Cinema section includes Cannes hits <strong>Purely Belter</strong> and <strong>Billy Elliot</strong> (formerly called Dancer); most films are showing for the first time in the UK, if not the world. </p> <p>Late Night Romps highlights the best of horror and thrillers from around the world; perhaps this year's biggest treat is the Japanese horror series <strong>The Ring</strong>, which has been a phenomenon in its native Japan. The films, based on the work of Koji Suzuki (Japan's equivalent to Stephen King), are true psycho-horror that descend into unimaginable terror, with scenes of extreme violence and paranormal activity. All three films in the series will be showing. </p> <p>This year's retrospective looks at the work of master visual stylist <strong>Max Ophuls</strong>. There is also a selection of family films (look out for David Bowie in a cameo role in Mr Rice's Secret), and, although the festival is non-competitive, six high-profile awards will be given out, including the Guardian New Director's Award and the Michael Powell Award for Best New British Feature.</p> <p>\u0095 To order a programme, call the Hotline on 0907 0131 500 (calls cost \u00a31 to cover post and packaging), or check the website on <a href=\"http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.edfilmfest.org.uk</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 54th Edinburgh International Film Festival, one of the most important, influential and longest-running in the world, will be held this year between August 13 and 27. The programme for the year's festival was announced this morning. Lars Von Trier's already infamous Palme D'Or winner Dancer In The Dark will open proceedings, and Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wai's exquisite story of unrequited love, In the Mood for Love, has been chosen to close the two-week festival. The director will be present in Edinburgh to give a masterclass - part of the Reel Life series of classes from directors, actors and writers. Also scheduled to participate in the Reel Life series are Se7en cinematographer Darius Khonji, Swedish director Liv Ullman (whose highly acclaimed film Faithless will be playing), and Basic Instinct and Robocop director Paul Verhoeven, whose The Hollow Man receives its international premiere. Terence Davies's sumptuous adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel The House of Mirth, starring Gillian Anderson, gets its world premiere, and the likes of Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty (think Doris Day meets David Lynch), Anthony Hopkins in Julie Taymor's bloody Shakespeare adaptation Titus, and the Coen brothers' eagerly anticipated O Brother, Where Art Thou? are sure to attract critical and popular interest. Digital technology and the endless possibilities of the medium of film are at the forefront of this year's festival. Dancer In The Dark, the opening film, was shot entirely digitally, as was the moving and deeply human drama One Life Stand. Showing as part of the Focus on British Cinema Strand, the latter also boasts the distinction of being the first ever feature film to be shown digitally in the UK. There will also be a special screening of Mike Figgis's Time Code, which was shot digitally, in real time, and will be accompanied by a live sound mix. The Focus on British Cinema section includes Cannes hits Purely Belter and Billy Elliot (formerly called Dancer); most films are showing for the first time in the UK, if not the world. Late Night Romps highlights the best of horror and thrillers from around the world; perhaps this year's biggest treat is the Japanese horror series The Ring, which has been a phenomenon in its native Japan. The films, based on the work of Koji Suzuki (Japan's equivalent to Stephen King), are true psycho-horror that descend into unimaginable terror, with scenes of extreme violence and paranormal activity. All three films in the series will be showing. This year's retrospective looks at the work of master visual stylist Max Ophuls. There is also a selection of family films (look out for David Bowie in a cameo role in Mr Rice's Secret), and, although the festival is non-competitive, six high-profile awards will be given out, including the Guardian New Director's Award and the Michael Powell Award for Best New British Feature. \u0095 To order a programme, call the Hotline on 0907 0131 500 (calls cost \u00a31 to cover post and packaging), or check the website on www.edfilmfest.org.uk.",

The release of the hostages ended a two month crisis which has paralysed the country and imperilled the tourist trade. The possibility of the releases came after the army agreed to abolish the country\u00d5s multiracial constitution, grant the rebels amnesty and remove Mr Chaudhry from office. Mr Speight was finally pushed into delivering the hostages after Fuji\u00d5s traditional leaders, the Council of Chiefs, issued a statement saying that no constitutional changes would occur until the hostages were freed. Mr Chaudhry has made an initial statement saying he feels no acrimony towards Mr Speight, and calling for the Fijians to work harmoniously together to secure a prosperous future. <p><b>Has Mr Speight been granted all his demands?</b><br> Basically, yes, although the role he will play in the new government is as yet undetermined. Mr Speight's main goal was to get rid of Fiji's multiracial constitution and replace it with one which would only permit Fijians to hold the posts of prime minister and president. He also demanded an amnesty for himself and his collaborators. All these key demands have now been met by the military, which declared martial law after the takeover of parliament. </p> <p><b>Have there been other incidents of unrest?</b><br> Other groups have followed Mr Speight's example. Four tourist resorts were taken over by supporters of Mr Speight, including the exclusive Turtle Island beach resort where the movie The Blue Lagoon was filmed. They briefly held 40 tourists. In other incidents, about 70 people, also wanting to discuss land rights, gathered outside Suva's airport, while the military reported a riot in the maximum security wing of Naboro prison 10 miles outside Suva, the capital. </p> <p><b>Who is George Speight?</b><br> He is a failed businessman and the son of an opposition MP, Sam Speight. George Speight was chairman of two Fijian firms involved in the country's lucrative $60m mahogany timber trade, but was sacked by Mr Chaudhry after he came to power in last year's landslide victory.</p> <p><b>Is there anyone behind Mr Speight?</b><br> Mr Speight always seemed a rather implausible coup leader, and there have been reports that the real coup leader is a former special services soldier loyal to former prime minister Rabuka. APF, the French news agency, has reported that the actual leader is Colonel Ilisoni Ligairi, 60, who received training in the UK. He is in charge of the counter revolutionary warfare unit (CRWU) which Mr Speight used to seize Fiji's parliament. The CRWU, considered Fiji's version of the Special Air Service, frequently operates with special forces from Britain, Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p><b>Didn't analysts think the coup was going to peter out quickly?</b><br> That was the initial thinking. But the longer the coup went on, the more support Mr Speight received from the Fijian population. Fiji's traditional chiefs eventually gave their blessing to the coup, calling for Mr Chaudhry to be replaced by an indigenous Fijian. The chiefs, wield enormous influence, and have now agreed to all of Mr Speight's demands, including a pardon for all those involved in the coup.</p> <p><b>What will be the effect on the island's Indian population?</b><br> Fiji is bracing itself for a mass Indian emigration similar to that after the 1987 coup. Indians started coming to Fiji as labourers on sugar plantations at the end of the 19th century, when Fiji was a British colony. By 1970, when Fiji became independent, ethnic Indians were in a majority. But after the 1987 coup, many Indians - especially professionals - left the country, and now 51% of the 800,000 population are indigenous Fijians. Indians form 44% of the population.</p> <p><b>What is the political background to the crisis?</b><br> The Fijian-dominated Alliance Party led by former president Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara (he resigned at the start of the crisis as one of Mr Speight's demands) dominated Fijian politics after independence. But elections in April 1987 saw the Alliance Party supplanted by a multi-racial coalition which divided ministerial jobs evenly between Fijians and Indians, to the consternation of hard-line indigenous nationalists. After colonel Sitiveni Rabuka took power in the 1987 coup, he declared Fiji a republic and the country was expelled from the Commonwealth.

But though Hollywood films, especially of the pre-war variety, were his model, his work remained unmistakably French. In fact, many thought Melville was as much influenced by Bresson as by films such as Huston's Asphalt Jungle. But he would usually reply that, on the contrary, Bresson was influenced by him. Melville was the true ancestor of the French New Wave. </p> <p>Certainly, he made a series of films that were unlike anyone else's, and Le Samourai, one of the best of them, could be regarded as one of the greatest psychological thrillers, addressing questions of honour, loyalty and betrayal. </p> <p>It gave Alain Delon his best part. Filmed on the wide screen and in wonderfully muted colour to add atmosphere - the great Henri Deca\u00eb was Melville's cinematographer - it has Delon as a ruthless hired killer living alone in a dingy apartment with a bullfinch as his sole companion. The girl who loves him (Nathalie Delon, Alain's wife) lives in greater luxury elsewhere at another man's expense and is prepared to give him a perfect alibi after his next contract. He executes it with chilling skill in a nightclub and successfully avoids a hood sent to kill him and a posse of police on his trail. </p> <p>He is, however, doomed from the first, or, as Melville puts it, \"laid out in death\". He is tempted by a girl he saw in a corridor of the nightclub and should have killed as a witness; thus he breaks the first rule of his trade, which is not to get emotionally involved. It's a bad mistake and honour demands that she has to be his next contract. But, almost masochistically, he deliberately uses an empty gun and is shot down by the police. He has virtually committed hari-kiri. </p> <p>It is difficult to see how this story could be better accomplished. It has all the best virtues of American film noir but with a European sensibility that could have seemed melodramatic or pretentious in a Hollywood film. Paris becomes a city of shadows. In the first scene, where Delon lies stretched out on his bed in the half-light, a sense of acute foreboding is created. This is rigorously maintained throughout, with very little dialogue to disturb it. </p> <p>Le Samourai is as efficient a piece of cinema as it is darkly romantic. Melville shows us his lone killer's methodical precision with great flair, and the police manhunt through the M\u00e9tro is as good an action sequence as any. </p> <p>The film opens with a purported line from the Book of Bushido - the source of the Japanese warrior class's knowledge: \"There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai, unless perhaps it be that of the tiger in the jungle.\" After the film was shown in Japan, Melville admitted he wrote the quotation himself. But Delon expresses this perfectly with his deliberately impassive performance. </p> <p>It wasn't for nothing that Godard gave Melville a bit part in A Bout de Souffle.

The Ministry of Agriculture has released the <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/publications/progress/miniprog1.shtml\" target=\"_new\">latest figures</a> on the spread of bovine tuberculosis, showing a 6% rise over the past year. Many farmers believe that badgers are responsible for spreading the disease.</p> <p>2. <a href=\"http://www.lincstrust.co.uk/news/1998/krebsreport.html\" target=\"_new\">Wildlife lobbyists</a> point out that <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/abouttb/abouttb.shtml\" target=\"_new\">myobacterium bovis</a>, the bug responsible for bovine TB, affects less than 0.1% of British cattle, compared with 40% before the second world war. The alleged link with badgers was first postulated only in the early 1970s.</p> <p>3. The Ministry is keen to <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">stamp out bovine TB</a>, not least because all infected cattle must be slaughtered and their owners compensated at market rates.</p> <p>4. <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">MAFF</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/isg/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">independent advisers</a> are working on a <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/abouttb/abouttb.shtml\" target=\"_new\">five-point programme</a>, including a detailed study of whether badgers can transmit the disease to cattle.</p> <p>5. The study will involve the <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/point5/point5.shtml\" target=\"_new\">shooting of some 12,500 badgers</a> - about 3% of the estimated population. Conservation groups like <a href=\"http://www.badgers.org.uk/brockwatch/8tbpage.html\" target=\"_new\">Brockwatch</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Canopy/2626\" target=\"_new\">National Federation of Badger Groups</a> say the cull is unscientific, inhumane, and <a href=\"http://www.badgers.org.uk/brockwatch/4tb.html\" target=\"_new\">unnecessary</a>.</p> <p>6. They also accuse the government of making <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Canopy/2626/980819-1.htm\" target=\"_new\">a sharp U-turn</a> on its pre-election pledge to stop the cull, which was recommended in <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmagric/233/23303.htm\" target=\"_new\">a report by Professor John Krebs</a> at the end of 1997. Maff has acknowledged, <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/hpanel/summary.shtml\" target=\"_new\">as recently as May</a>, that the badger-factor is as yet unproved, but insists that it must be investigated thoroughly.</p> <p>7. The <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">National Farmers' Union</a> also has doubts, but insists that the <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/badgers.asp\" target=\"_new\">cull must go on</a>. The NFU is also keen to promote its members as wildlife custodians, but makes no mention of badgers on its <a href=\"http://www.nfucountryside.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">attractive countryside web pages</a>.</p> <p>8. Badgers and their setts are <a href=\"http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/watches/wild2.htm\" target=\"_new\">protected by law</a> - but not from Maff. The sadistic 'sport' of <a href=\"http://www.badgers.org.uk/brockwatch/3baiting.html\" target=\"_new\">badger baiting</a> has been outlawed since 1835, but a small minority of perverts still get their kicks from <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/police/mps/mps/cprevent/badger.htm\" target=\"_new\">torturing animals</a>. It is thought that many of the mutilated badgers seen dead on country verges are put there by the badger baiters to give the impression that they are road casualties.</p> <p>9. Bovine TB can be <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/tb/point1/point1.shtml\" target=\"_new\">transmitted to humans</a>, but is extremely rare.</p> <p>10. Though most people have never seen a badger, the beast's <a href=\"http://www.badgerwatch.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">appeal is universal</a>.

      "bodyText": "1. The Ministry of Agriculture has released the latest figures on the spread of bovine tuberculosis, showing a 6% rise over the past year. Many farmers believe that badgers are responsible for spreading the disease. 2. Wildlife lobbyists point out that myobacterium bovis, the bug responsible for bovine TB, affects less than 0.1% of British cattle, compared with 40% before the second world war. The alleged link with badgers was first postulated only in the early 1970s. 3. The Ministry is keen to stamp out bovine TB, not least because all infected cattle must be slaughtered and their owners compensated at market rates. 4. MAFF and its independent advisers are working on a five-point programme, including a detailed study of whether badgers can transmit the disease to cattle. 5. The study will involve the shooting of some 12,500 badgers - about 3% of the estimated population. Conservation groups like Brockwatch and the National Federation of Badger Groups say the cull is unscientific, inhumane, and unnecessary. 6. They also accuse the government of making a sharp U-turn on its pre-election pledge to stop the cull, which was recommended in a report by Professor John Krebs at the end of 1997. Maff has acknowledged, as recently as May, that the badger-factor is as yet unproved, but insists that it must be investigated thoroughly. 7. The National Farmers' Union also has doubts, but insists that the cull must go on. The NFU is also keen to promote its members as wildlife custodians, but makes no mention of badgers on its attractive countryside web pages. 8. Badgers and their setts are protected by law - but not from Maff. The sadistic 'sport' of badger baiting has been outlawed since 1835, but a small minority of perverts still get their kicks from torturing animals. It is thought that many of the mutilated badgers seen dead on country verges are put there by the badger baiters to give the impression that they are road casualties. 9. Bovine TB can be transmitted to humans, but is extremely rare. 10. Though most people have never seen a badger, the beast's appeal is universal. Kenneth Grahame did more than most to spread the notion of the gentle old brock, in The Wind in the Willows.",

Movies, however, are another matter. Indeed, recent years have seen Hollywood increasingly showing drug use in a positive, or at least less than disastrous light, from the stoned babblings of Cheech And Chong to Bulworth itself, where the senator's dope-smoking has little adverse effect other than turning him into the world's worst - and worst-dressed - rapper. </p> <p>In short, anti-drugs conspiracy theorists would have us believe that if The Sound Of Music were remade today then the hills would be alive not with the sound of music but with rustling fields of marijuana.

      "body": "<p>In May 1995, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war, Switzerland's president formally apologised for denying Jews refuge during the Nazi Holocaust. Discussion reopened on the question of Jewish assets deposited in Swiss accounts before and during the war. </p> <p>Swiss bankers declared that they could locate only 775 unclaimed dormant accounts, worth a total of $32m. They offered this sum as a basis for negotiations with the World Jewish Congress, which refused it as inadequate. </p> <p>The WJC, working with institutions including the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, mobilised the US political establishment. Using the House and Senate banking committees as a springboard, the Holocaust industry orchestrated a shameless campaign of vilification. </p> <p>The campaign rapidly degenerated into a libel of the Swiss people. Tom Bower, in a study supported by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre [Nazi Gold], reports that they had \"knowingly profited from blood money\"; \"committed an unprecedented theft\"; that \"Swiss greed was unique\"; that the \"Swiss character\" combined \"simplicity and duplicity\"; that the Swiss were \"not just a peculiarly charmless people who had produced no artists, no heroes since William Tell and no statesmen, but were dishonest Nazi collaborators who had profited from genocide\", and so on. </p> <p>The Holocaust industry first alleged that Swiss banks had systematically denied legitimate heirs of Holocaust victims access to dormant accounts worth between $7bn and $20bn. </p> <p>In late 1996 a parade of elderly Jewish women and one man delivered moving testimony before the Congressional banking committees on the malfeasance of the Swiss bankers. Yet almost none of these witnesses, according to Itamar Levin, an editor of Israel's main business newspaper, \"had real proof of the existence of assets in Swiss banks\". </p> <p>In 1997 the Swiss reportedly spent $500m to fend off the Holocaust industry attacks.

      "bodyText": "In May 1995, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war, Switzerland's president formally apologised for denying Jews refuge during the Nazi Holocaust. Discussion reopened on the question of Jewish assets deposited in Swiss accounts before and during the war. Swiss bankers declared that they could locate only 775 unclaimed dormant accounts, worth a total of $32m. They offered this sum as a basis for negotiations with the World Jewish Congress, which refused it as inadequate. The WJC, working with institutions including the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, mobilised the US political establishment. Using the House and Senate banking committees as a springboard, the Holocaust industry orchestrated a shameless campaign of vilification. The campaign rapidly degenerated into a libel of the Swiss people. Tom Bower, in a study supported by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre [Nazi Gold], reports that they had \"knowingly profited from blood money\"; \"committed an unprecedented theft\"; that \"Swiss greed was unique\"; that the \"Swiss character\" combined \"simplicity and duplicity\"; that the Swiss were \"not just a peculiarly charmless people who had produced no artists, no heroes since William Tell and no statesmen, but were dishonest Nazi collaborators who had profited from genocide\", and so on. The Holocaust industry first alleged that Swiss banks had systematically denied legitimate heirs of Holocaust victims access to dormant accounts worth between $7bn and $20bn. In late 1996 a parade of elderly Jewish women and one man delivered moving testimony before the Congressional banking committees on the malfeasance of the Swiss bankers. Yet almost none of these witnesses, according to Itamar Levin, an editor of Israel's main business newspaper, \"had real proof of the existence of assets in Swiss banks\". In 1997 the Swiss reportedly spent $500m to fend off the Holocaust industry attacks. In April 1998 they started buckling under pressure. In June the banks made a \"final offer\" of $600m. The next month stiff US sanctions were threatened. The Swiss caved in and agreed to pay $1.25bn. The settlement covered three classes: claimants to dormant Swiss accounts; refugees denied Swiss asylum; and victims of slave labour which the Swiss benefited from. For all the righteous indignation about the \"perfidious Swiss\", however, the comparable American record is, on all these counts, just as bad, if not worse.

      "body": "<p>\"We haven't begun to push the boundaries on books yet,\" says America's literary sensation of the year, Mark Z Danielewski. \"Scholars want to tell you that it doesn't matter what language looks like, but it's not true.\" Danielewski's assault on that orthodoxy arrives in the UK this week in the 700-page shape of House of Leaves, a novel about the footnotes in a treatise about a film about a haunted house that's one quarter inch bigger inside than out. Lost? That's the point. Danielewski's trick is to reflect the disorientation at his story's core with a series of mind-bending narrative and visual devices, which at their most extreme would have ee cummings reaching for the smelling salts. </p> <p>Navigating the book, it's easy to understand why House of Leaves has taken its 33-year-old author 10 years to complete. It takes the form of a series of essays about a supposedly famous home video in which a Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist records his family's adventures in their spooky new house. Danielewski filters those essays - which both relate and deconstruct the horror story in a series of breathtakingly erudite foot notes - through the increasingly freaked-out commentary of the drop-out tattooist who wishes he'd never discovered them in a trunk next to claw-marks on a dead man's floor. </p> <p>American reviewers duly paid tribute to Danielewski's admirable achievement: \"The most impressive literary debut since Thomas Pynchon's V 40 years ago,\" cooed the San Diego Tribune, while Newsweek called House of Leaves \"the most ambitious, complicated and eagerly awaited debut of the year.\" </p> <p>The public responded: published in the US in March, House of Leaves is now into its second print run. Suddenly, Danielewski's face, crowned by a crop of blue hair, is everywhere. Later this summer, he and his songwriter sister Poe release a House of Leaves-inspired CD. </p> <p>\"It's easy to see the final product and convince yourself that it was predestined,\" he tells me. \"But the book could easily have been a heap of paper burning in some barrel right now, and I could look back and say, 'Well, that was 10 years of wasted life'.\" Wasted? Danielewski has toiled these 10 years in occupations as diverse as film student, plumber, waiter and teacher to fund the development of what began as nothing more than \"this sense that I was going to write something large\". </p> <p>House of Leaves began to coalesce when its author penned a series of essays \"about how text could be used in cinematic ways\". Heritage was at work here: Danielewski's father, Tad, was an avant-garde film-maker. \"There's a long history in film,\" says the son, \"of intensifying and controlling the viewer's experience by using long shots, close-ups, rhythmic patterns, colour. I began to wonder how that could be applied in a textual way.\" When he later conceived the idea of a house whose interior dimensions kept morphing he cottoned on that, \"the theoretical ideas I'd been working on were represented by that space\". </p> <p>So when the novel's protagonist, Will Navidson, explores his house's subterranean labyrinth, Danielewski's text becomes labyrinthine. The act of reading, slowed down by the need to decipher backwards text or rotate the page full circle, reflects the act of exploration. When Navidson escapes the maze, the reader speeds through pages with only a handful of words on each. Some will find the devices gimmicky and will be thrown, predicts Danielewski, \"into a murderous rage\", but it's hard to deny that they generate something of the disquiet at which their author aims. The novel's other quirk is its frame of fabricated footnotes and appendices, in which Greek myth, Camille Paglia and Jung, among others, substantiate the essays' critique of Navidson's film. </p> <p>Danielewski studied at Yale, where he was rejected by every writing course for which he applied, and his book pokes fun at the academic world's arcane debates. But the footnotes serve other than satirical purposes. They heighten the tension (frustratingly) by interrupting the moments of suspense. \"It's very theatrical,\" says Danielewski. \"I've always had a fondness for the way the page, when wrapped in footnotes and marginalia, seemed to come to life. It was like some strange, two-dimensional stage. Our words and phrases have all been influenced by the writers that came before us. I thought this was a more honest way of relating how stories are told.\" </p> <p>The miracle was that his American publisher, Pantheon Books, was receptive to this outbreak of honesty. They released House of Leaves in precise accordance with Danielewski's strictures - the labyrinth chapter took its writer nine months to lay out. \"I think that was one of the glories of living in LA,\" he reflects. \"There is no publishing industry here, so I wrote this book in my own bubble. If I'd lived in New York, I would have become aware of the rules, and everyone would have said, 'Are you kidding? For your first novel?'.\" </p> <p>Pantheon also co-operated with Danieleweski on the novel's online serialisation, a first in the American book world and apt for a novel which seems to parallel the development of the web. One medium via which you won't be receiving House of Leaves, however, is film. Despite his novel's cinematic inspiration, Danielewski refuses to sell the movie rights. \"Have you seen [the new George Clooney vehicle] The Perfect Storm?\" he asks. \"It's an awful movie. Yet the book has some marvellous sequences.\" </p> <p>It's the ultimate proof of his radicalism: he lives in LA and cares neither for movies nor for the money they're offering him. \"In this day and age people feel that their life isn't ratified unless they've had a TV movie made about them.\" He thinks he \"can set an important example\". </p> <p>House of Leaves' success should guarantee him a plumbing-free run at his next novel, on which, however, he won't promise to continue his test of the limits of textual possibility. \"I'll only explore insofar as it benefits the reader and complements the story. If I decide to tell a story about a wheelbarrow sitting by itself in the middle of the street, I don't know if all these dynamics would be appropriate\". </p> <p>After reading House of Leaves, you'll believe that if anyone can twist text to lay bare that dormant wheelbarrow experience, it's Danielewski. </p> <p>Mark Danielewski's House of Leaves (<a href=\"http://www.houseofleaves.co.uk)\">www.houseofleaves.co.uk)</a> is published tomorrow by Anchor, priced \u00a313</p>",

      "body": "<p>A letter opened has been placed on the window sill in the corner of a kitchen. On the wall of white tiles behind is a poster of a donkey. Near the envelope stand a jar of paint brushes and an empty vase. Through the window I see trees. </p> <p>Why do people go to galleries and look at paintings? This question probably has as many answers as people. Another naive question: after they've really looked at a painting, where do they keep it in their memory? With their memories of places? With their memories of other spectacular sights? Or somewhere quite different? You would know, Marisa, but you're not saying. </p> <p>It seems to me one looks at paintings hoping to find some secret. A secret not about art, but about life. And if one finds one, it remains a secret, because, finally, it is untranslatable into words. With words one can only, sometimes, make a clumsy map, hand-drawn, to show where the secret was found. </p> <p>I'm trying to make a map. The starting point is the category of paintings called still lifes in English, natures mortes in French and bodegones in Spanish (which could mean coming-from-a-cool-cellar). The difference in these names is already promising and confusing. </p> <p>I'll begin by drawing a line, a list of names: Zurbaran, Chardin, C\u00e9zanne, Morandi, Barcelo. When it gets dark, I'll use my list as a cord. </p> <p>As in every genre, masters were rare. Masters were those who met the public demand yet pushed their art beyond it. Yet whether one is thinking of masters or modest artisans, the genre has its own logic, its own metaphysics, which tends to push its practitioners in a certain direction. </p> <p>Still lifes - even before they begin to be painted - have been deliberately assembled: objects which the painter finds intriguing or touching have been arranged as compositions on the table or shelf. Still life is a sedentary art, connected with the activity of keeping house. A home may be tidy or informal but there is always a certain welcoming order to it. Which is why Rembrandt's Slaughtered Ox, or certain canvases of carcasses by Soutine, are not still lifes but dramatic works, whereas Goya's heartbreaking Dead Pheasant is nevertheless a still life. </p> <p>The drama in a still life is the drama found in a juxtaposition, a placing, an encounter, within a protected space. Every still life is about safety, just as every landscape is about risk and adventure. Still lifes tell about how certain things have come together and, despite their evident ephemerality, will stay together. They are images of residence, in every sense of the term. And so the painter is forced to study the neighbourliness of the things in front of him, how they adjust and live together, how they intersect, overlap and keep separate, and how they converse. </p> <p>An oyster speaks to a loaf of bread, an apple to a piece of cloth, a carnation to a clock. They converse through colour, texture, shadow, luminosity, shape, and what they talk about is prompted by their juxtaposition. In the safety zone and silence of still lifes the visibility of objects becomes eloquent. </p> <p>The portraitist contests the mortality of his sitter. The landscape painter contests the ceaseless movement of nature; the history painter the forgetting of history; and the still-life painter the dispersal of objects. His antagonists are decay, the bailiff and the junk merchant. </p> <p> <strong> I</strong> hold on to the cord - it is getting dark - and I begin with Zurbaran, who was more or less contemporary with some of the first Dutch or Flemish still-life painters. Therefore, I'll place among the early still lifes Zurbaran's paintings of the Holy Face of St Veronica's Veil. He made at least six or seven versions of this subject, of which the most remarkable is in Stockholm. </p> <p>A whitish, pinkish cotton or linen scarf is pinned to a dark wall, filling the canvas. The folds and the pins are painted in a style which borders on trompe l'oeil. They are very tangible, in contrast to the image of Christ's face printed on the cloth as a fading ochre stain. This is, of course, in keeping with the story of how Veronica used her scarf to wipe the sweat from Christ's face, as he was carrying the cross to Golgotha. But does it also hint at the secret of still lifes? </p> <p>Another Zurbaran painting shows just four pots and two pewter plates on a shelf. A modest still life. Behind them there is darkness. They are strongly lit, with evident volume. At first one believes in both their presence and their materiality. They are without question there, more there than many painted objects, because they are precisely lit and tangibly solid before a curtain of darkness. </p> <p>Yet, after a while, one begins to question whether this impression isn't an illusion. What is there, so strongly lit, is only the \"appearance\" of each object. The six \"appearances\" on the shelf have been newly laundered, ironed and put on hangers, awaiting a wearer. No wearer has come forward. There is nothing inside or behind the freshly laundered appearances. The empty pots are doubly empty. The true subject of this painting is the darkness behind, the darkness in which everything is invisible. The vessels on the shelf are there, not for their own material sake but to show that the darkness is - not a curtain - an infinity; just as the cloth with all its folds and woven texture is there, in the painting of St Veronica's Veil, to insinuate the eternity of the immaterial Holy Face. I use the verb insinuate (to bring-in-with-a-curve) in a positive sense: to suggest rather than to enforce. It is a key word and I like it; we can use it. </p> <p>Zurbaran, at the height of the Counter Reformation, was painting mostly for the monasteries. Chardin was born a century later and worked for the emerging French bourgeoisie of the Enlightenment. He was a friend of Diderot, who wrote with enthusiasm about his art. It is difficult to imagine two painters working for two more opposed or different publics. Yet, as still-life painters, both of them found themselves facing the same persistent question before each object: how is it there? </p> <p>Chardin was secretive about his working methods - do you know any painter who isn't? It seems that he first applied everywhere on the canvas a kind of paste, with an uneven, rough surface, which he built up slowly, and which, at a certain moment, he coloured with lead white and some reddish brown. The stuff of this surface was both luminous and earthy. He did not apply it mechanically or uniformly; he worked on it and in it with much patience, until it took on the air of being the ground for all substantiality, until he could see in it the unspecified material of the whole world, with its infinitude of possibilities. \"Corporeal substance,\" said Spinoza, \"can only be conceived as infinite, unique and indivisible.\" </p> <p>He waited until the objects began to glance at him, until their glances came towards him through the act of painting, intimate, furtive glances which became his broken, correcting, crumbling brush-strokes, or sometimes finger smears. The wiggles of a walnut, the mat white shells of newly laid eggs, the black redness of wine in a glass, the fire in dented copper: each of them glanced at him in a breathtakingly distinct and particular way, yet all of them belonged to the indivisible substantial world and the single mystery of its existence. </p> <p>Like Zurbaran, Chardin in his still lifes confronted the infinite. For the Spaniard it was the infinity of darkness; for the Frenchman the infinity of substantiality. </p> <p>About 130 years later, between 1900 and 1906, C\u00e9zanne was painting his late watercolours. As a young man he had made no secret of his admiration for \"the cunning fellow\" Chardin. I believe that every time C\u00e9zanne laid a knife on his still-life table, a knife pointing diagonally into the picture, he did it as a homage to the old cunning master. </p> <p>Gradually, still lifes became C\u00e9zanne's favourite genre because, as he said, they meant \"grappling directly with objects\". What happened during this grappling? In his late watercolours there is, it seems to me, a light which hadn't been seen before in European painting. When he applied the colours - blue, green, ochre, red - they all referred to this white in deference. They never referred directly to each other, as in earlier paintings, they referred to each other by way of the white. And the white arranged each of them, according to its wave-length, somewhere between surface and void. The sum of all these exchanges constitutes the new light. </p> <p>This light enters between things to reveal that every point has its tangent, that everything is touching, and that all the existing distances and spaces which separate objects are no more than clefts or folds. It is a light which, as it travels, bestows continuity, a light which does not allow separation. </p> <p>I look at the palm of my hand. Now I begin to close my fingers slowly, and watch the creases forming between the phalanges of each finger. Within these paintings, the edges of the apples on the table, or the edges of the casserole dish or of the jar, are like those creases, because they mark both an apparent separation and a real continuity. If I open my fingers a little, the creases will disappear, just as the contours of the objects on the table will disappear if, instead of looking at them, I feel my way either by touch or philosophy from one to the other. </p> <p>When C\u00e9zanne spoke about being faithful to the \"motif\", faithful to nature, what he had in mind, I think, was the fidelity of an unbroken embrace between his perception and the continuous, infinite extension of everything in front of him. </p> <p>Giorgio Morandi was probably the most austere still-life painter of all time. Repeatedly during his long life he painted the same dozen or so objects: his bottles, whose glass he painted white or red before painting them on the canvas, his coffee pot, his two jugs, his carafe, his dried flowers, his seashells. </p> <p>His art divides itself into three periods. From the 1920s until 1940, he painted in order to approach the objects being painted. He goes closer and closer. The final closeness has nothing to do with detail or photographic precision. It is a question of the presence of the object; almost its body temperature being felt. In Morandi's second period, between 1940 and 1950, one has the impression that he stayed still while the objects approached the canvas. He waited and they arrived. In the last period, from 1951 until his death in 1964, the objects seem to be on the point of disappearing. Not that they are faint or faraway. Rather they are weightless, in flux, on the frontier of existence. </p> <p>If this is a progression - if his mastery increased as he grew older - one has to ask: what was he trying to do? The answer often given - that Morandi was the poet of the ephemeral - doesn't convince me. The energy of his work is neither nostalgic nor - in any personal sense - intimate. In his life he may have shut himself away. And his odious fascist politics suggest panic. Yet his art is strangely affirmative. Of what? </p> <p>What interests him is the process of the visible first becoming visible, before the thing seen has been given a name or acquired a value. The visible begins with light. And as soon as there is light there is shade. All drawing is a shadow around light. Slowly the eye registers and reads the space which the coffee pot and the jug are going to occupy. In other words, the objects Morandi paints can be bought in no flea market. They are not objects. They are places, places where some little thing is about to come into being. The infinity of becoming. </p> <p>Morandi's vision depended upon a certain quiet; around it was the afternoon throbbing of cicadas and the silence of the siesta. Within 30 years of Morandi's death, life radically changed and the world was filled with a new kind of noise: the din of commodities. In 1994, Miquel Barcelo painted a series of very large still lifes entitled In Extremis. And at that time he wrote: \"To paint a flayed ox has become important_ one has to take things, one after another, from the stickiness of Berlusconi and make them anew, fresh and clean, show them palpitating, or with their own sweet rottenness.\" </p> <p>Barcelo paints on the ground, as if with a stick in the dust. In his still lifes there is no affluence and little security - enough maybe for the next 24 hours. And this is where they differ from their predecessors and why they belong specifically to the end of our millennium. </p> <p>His fruit, carcasses and fish offer no illusion of permanence. What he is painting with each thing that he handles is a moment, a phase, in a repeated cycle of seeding, flowering, fading, dying. The paintings make this clear. They do not celebrate what things look like. What they celebrate, accidents notwithstanding, is recurrence, and the secret of recurrence is mortality. Barcelo's still lifes oppose the crass promises of consumerism with the insinuation of death and the respect which death demands. </p> <p>In their own way, these paintings are images of paradise. A paradise which has nothing to do with perfection, for perfection is unlovable, and if there's no love in paradise, what is it? Barcelo's is a paradise painted on the reverse side of pain, following the same contours. The infinity he confronts is that of desire. </p> <p>You are right, Marisa, I'm trying to make a still life with words! My favourite flower is lilac, either white or mauve. Sprigs of lilac always come in pairs. So there is a couple against a green curtain of leaves. And I place them in the empty vase beside the jar with brushes. And their minutely small white petals resemble the white letters in all the words I've written down. </p> <p>This is an edited extract of the Peter Fuller Memorial Lecture, given by John Berger at Tate Modern on Saturday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A letter opened has been placed on the window sill in the corner of a kitchen. On the wall of white tiles behind is a poster of a donkey. Near the envelope stand a jar of paint brushes and an empty vase. Through the window I see trees. Why do people go to galleries and look at paintings? This question probably has as many answers as people. Another naive question: after they've really looked at a painting, where do they keep it in their memory? With their memories of places? With their memories of other spectacular sights? Or somewhere quite different? You would know, Marisa, but you're not saying. It seems to me one looks at paintings hoping to find some secret. A secret not about art, but about life. And if one finds one, it remains a secret, because, finally, it is untranslatable into words. With words one can only, sometimes, make a clumsy map, hand-drawn, to show where the secret was found. I'm trying to make a map. The starting point is the category of paintings called still lifes in English, natures mortes in French and bodegones in Spanish (which could mean coming-from-a-cool-cellar). The difference in these names is already promising and confusing. I'll begin by drawing a line, a list of names: Zurbaran, Chardin, C\u00e9zanne, Morandi, Barcelo. When it gets dark, I'll use my list as a cord. As in every genre, masters were rare. Masters were those who met the public demand yet pushed their art beyond it. Yet whether one is thinking of masters or modest artisans, the genre has its own logic, its own metaphysics, which tends to push its practitioners in a certain direction. Still lifes - even before they begin to be painted - have been deliberately assembled: objects which the painter finds intriguing or touching have been arranged as compositions on the table or shelf. Still life is a sedentary art, connected with the activity of keeping house. A home may be tidy or informal but there is always a certain welcoming order to it. Which is why Rembrandt's Slaughtered Ox, or certain canvases of carcasses by Soutine, are not still lifes but dramatic works, whereas Goya's heartbreaking Dead Pheasant is nevertheless a still life. The drama in a still life is the drama found in a juxtaposition, a placing, an encounter, within a protected space. Every still life is about safety, just as every landscape is about risk and adventure. Still lifes tell about how certain things have come together and, despite their evident ephemerality, will stay together. They are images of residence, in every sense of the term. And so the painter is forced to study the neighbourliness of the things in front of him, how they adjust and live together, how they intersect, overlap and keep separate, and how they converse. An oyster speaks to a loaf of bread, an apple to a piece of cloth, a carnation to a clock. They converse through colour, texture, shadow, luminosity, shape, and what they talk about is prompted by their juxtaposition. In the safety zone and silence of still lifes the visibility of objects becomes eloquent. The portraitist contests the mortality of his sitter. The landscape painter contests the ceaseless movement of nature; the history painter the forgetting of history; and the still-life painter the dispersal of objects. His antagonists are decay, the bailiff and the junk merchant. I hold on to the cord - it is getting dark - and I begin with Zurbaran, who was more or less contemporary with some of the first Dutch or Flemish still-life painters. Therefore, I'll place among the early still lifes Zurbaran's paintings of the Holy Face of St Veronica's Veil. He made at least six or seven versions of this subject, of which the most remarkable is in Stockholm. A whitish, pinkish cotton or linen scarf is pinned to a dark wall, filling the canvas. The folds and the pins are painted in a style which borders on trompe l'oeil. They are very tangible, in contrast to the image of Christ's face printed on the cloth as a fading ochre stain. This is, of course, in keeping with the story of how Veronica used her scarf to wipe the sweat from Christ's face, as he was carrying the cross to Golgotha. But does it also hint at the secret of still lifes? Another Zurbaran painting shows just four pots and two pewter plates on a shelf. A modest still life. Behind them there is darkness. They are strongly lit, with evident volume. At first one believes in both their presence and their materiality. They are without question there, more there than many painted objects, because they are precisely lit and tangibly solid before a curtain of darkness. Yet, after a while, one begins to question whether this impression isn't an illusion. What is there, so strongly lit, is only the \"appearance\" of each object. The six \"appearances\" on the shelf have been newly laundered, ironed and put on hangers, awaiting a wearer. No wearer has come forward. There is nothing inside or behind the freshly laundered appearances. The empty pots are doubly empty. The true subject of this painting is the darkness behind, the darkness in which everything is invisible. The vessels on the shelf are there, not for their own material sake but to show that the darkness is - not a curtain - an infinity; just as the cloth with all its folds and woven texture is there, in the painting of St Veronica's Veil, to insinuate the eternity of the immaterial Holy Face.

I believe that every time C\u00e9zanne laid a knife on his still-life table, a knife pointing diagonally into the picture, he did it as a homage to the old cunning master. Gradually, still lifes became C\u00e9zanne's favourite genre because, as he said, they meant \"grappling directly with objects\". What happened during this grappling?

England thumped Zimbabwe at Old Trafford so quickly that the ECB's electric bill will be smaller than expected, as the floodlights weren't really needed at all. </p> <p>What will have made this win doubly satisfying is the fact that England have usually struggled to bury Zimbabwe in one-dayers. This was the 14th meeting between the two sides, and it's now seven-all (the tiebreaker's on Tuesday at Edgbaston). Alec Stewart has been involved in all of those embarrassing defeats, but he couldn't have done much more to help win this one: six catches, to equal Adam Gilchrist's one-day record, and a few runs before looking a little unlucky to get an afterthought lbw from John Holder, one of county cricket's most renowned finger-raisers.</p> <p>Stewart resisted the temptation to whip them both off (it's an overused tactic that rarely works, anyway), and gave Mullally eight overs and Ealham his full ten. Then White nipped in with a couple of morale-boosting wickets. So did Trescothick, who's rapidly becoming England's good-luck charm. He batted well again, before he also received a marginal leg-before decision, and even managed a slick run-out.</p> <p>England's batting was solid, to say the least. Trescothick, Flintoff, Hick ... all cruiserweights, with the odd heavyweight thrown in. In comparison Maynard, sitting expectantly on the dressing-room balcony, looked like the team's cox. But the big three did the business, although Flintoff lived dangerously at times, teasing the fielders with some uppish miscues.</p> <p>Now the pressure's on West Indies, still pointless after all these matches. Chances are that Courtney, who'd hoped to rest during the qualifiers, will be easing those big bowling boots back on up at Chester-le-Street.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "You might say that normal service has been resumed. England thumped Zimbabwe at Old Trafford so quickly that the ECB's electric bill will be smaller than expected, as the floodlights weren't really needed at all. What will have made this win doubly satisfying is the fact that England have usually struggled to bury Zimbabwe in one-dayers. This was the 14th meeting between the two sides, and it's now seven-all (the tiebreaker's on Tuesday at Edgbaston). Alec Stewart has been involved in all of those embarrassing defeats, but he couldn't have done much more to help win this one: six catches, to equal Adam Gilchrist's one-day record, and a few runs before looking a little unlucky to get an afterthought lbw from John Holder, one of county cricket's most renowned finger-raisers. Stewart resisted the temptation to whip them both off (it's an overused tactic that rarely works, anyway), and gave Mullally eight overs and Ealham his full ten. Then White nipped in with a couple of morale-boosting wickets. So did Trescothick, who's rapidly becoming England's good-luck charm. He batted well again, before he also received a marginal leg-before decision, and even managed a slick run-out. England's batting was solid, to say the least. Trescothick, Flintoff, Hick ... all cruiserweights, with the odd heavyweight thrown in. In comparison Maynard, sitting expectantly on the dressing-room balcony, looked like the team's cox. But the big three did the business, although Flintoff lived dangerously at times, teasing the fielders with some uppish miscues. Now the pressure's on West Indies, still pointless after all these matches. Chances are that Courtney, who'd hoped to rest during the qualifiers, will be easing those big bowling boots back on up at Chester-le-Street.

Today just over 3% are in agriculture. It employed 3.8m in 1962; now it gives work to fewer than 900,000 - of whom only 350,000 work full-time. </p> <p>Drive towards the Paris basin from Calais and you\u0092ll pass hedgeless fields of cereals, industrial piggeries, beef farms and acres of sugar beet. </p> <p>France is the world\u0092s second biggest food exporter and largest food producer, accounting for 21.5% of EU farm output. </p> <p>But discontent remains. Daniel Levesque, who produces wheat, barley and potatoes (for McCain\u0092s frozen chips) on some 400 hectares (1,000 acres) west of Chalons-sur-Marne, reckons his income has fallen 20% in seven years. </p> <p>He blames bureaucracy and the malign role of subsidies. But, with four full-time and one seasonal worker, he rails against social charges - and the 35-hour week. </p> <p>The son of Norman farmers, he abandoned civil engineering to take over the family busines. Now he employs a manager to run the farm while he spends most of his time seeking new markets - including renewable energy and extracting proteins from crops such as alfalfa. </p> <p>His near-neighbour at Vitry-le-Francois, Michel Delaunoy, is much happier.

      "bodyText": "Rioting farmers storming the local mairie, routes to Channel ports blocked by burning straw: the French farmer in revolt can still violently reshape the political landscape. But stereotypes of a countryside kept going by EU subsidies and fixed in the tough but joyous culture immortalised by Marcel Pagnol\u0092s Jean de Florette are false. A century ago half the population worked on the land and even in 1946 three in 10 did so. Today just over 3% are in agriculture. It employed 3.8m in 1962; now it gives work to fewer than 900,000 - of whom only 350,000 work full-time. Drive towards the Paris basin from Calais and you\u0092ll pass hedgeless fields of cereals, industrial piggeries, beef farms and acres of sugar beet. France is the world\u0092s second biggest food exporter and largest food producer, accounting for 21.5% of EU farm output. But discontent remains. Daniel Levesque, who produces wheat, barley and potatoes (for McCain\u0092s frozen chips) on some 400 hectares (1,000 acres) west of Chalons-sur-Marne, reckons his income has fallen 20% in seven years. He blames bureaucracy and the malign role of subsidies. But, with four full-time and one seasonal worker, he rails against social charges - and the 35-hour week. The son of Norman farmers, he abandoned civil engineering to take over the family busines. Now he employs a manager to run the farm while he spends most of his time seeking new markets - including renewable energy and extracting proteins from crops such as alfalfa. His near-neighbour at Vitry-le-Francois, Michel Delaunoy, is much happier. He employs 18 on his 580 hectares, and sees a profitable future as technology enables farmers to switch to renewable energy, industrial alcohol or maybe organic products. \u0093There\u0092s still a place for the small farmer,\u0094 he says, \u0093provided he does something else like running a gite for tourists.

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin's crackdown on Russia's leading business tycoons intensified yesterday, when a criminal tax-evasion case was launched against its largest car manufacturer, Avtovaz. Announcing the latest in a stream of criminal investigations against the country's business elite, the head of Russia's tax police declared that the car-manufacturing giant - which is reportedly associated with the country's most influential tycoon, Boris Berezovsky - had \"concealed huge sums\" from the state. In televised interviews, which appeared designed to spread unease throughout Moscow's corporate elite, senior tax officials warned that a criminal investigation against another massive Russian business would be launched today. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, also hinted that the country's oligarchs - the small group of businessmen who used their political contacts to amass vast fortunes when Soviet state monopolies were privatised in the early 1990s - were in for a difficult time. This unexpected wave of high-level, anti-oligarch activity began on Tuesday when another tax-evasion case was opened against the chairman of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov. Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, denied the charges, with officials pointing out that it had received last year's \"honest tax-payer of the year\" award. At the same time, Vladimir Potanin, who heads the group controlling one of the world's largest nickel producers, Norilsk Nickel, came under separate attack. He was asked by the state prosecutors' office to make a voluntary payment of $140m (\u00a392m) to the government in compensation for the amount it claims he underpaid for a large stake in Norilsk when it was privatised in the mid-1990s. Meanwhile, criminal action against the press baron, Vladimir Gusinsky - the head of the independent media company, MediaMost - was stepped up, with new searches of its headquarters in Moscow by officials from the FSB, the successor to the KGB. Prosecutors this week widened their investigation to include the links between Mr Gusinsky's company and the natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, from whose head offices documents were also seized on Tuesday. In his pre-election campaigning, Mr Putin courted popular approval by promising to act against the widely despised oligarchs, pledging that, under his rule, they would \"cease to exist as a class\". However, until this week, he had moved only against Mr Gusinsky, whose media holdings have been conspicuously critical of the Kremlin since Mr Putin's arrival in power last summer. The move against Avtovaz was particularly unexpected, given its links with Mr Berezovsky, who was hugely influential in orchestrating Mr Putin's rapid rise to power. There was speculation last night that the case was simply a flexing of muscles - an attempt by Mr Putin to see how much independence he is able to leverage from the powerful business figures who wielded so much influence over his predecessor Boris Yeltsin. \"Putin needs to show that he is in charge. These moves are more political than criminal,\" said Yevgeny Volk, a political analyst with the Heritage Foundation.

Mr Robinson was a key player in the negotiations. </p> <p>Since Mr Dyke took up his position at the BBC, he has attempted to lure a number of friends and colleagues to senior positions. Lord Bragg was said to have been offered a key role in developing a new arts and culture channel, which the corporation wants to launch as part of controversial plans to restructure its television services. </p> <p>The corporation insisted he had merely been talking to the controller of BBC2, Jane Root, about a number of projects. </p> <p>Poaching Lord Bragg would have been a coup for the BBC, and a blow for ITV, which relies heavily upon the veteran broadcaster to provide much-needed gravitas to its output. </p> <p>But Lord Bragg was swayed by the offer of a guaranteed future for the South Bank Show, plus a sweetener of a \"signature piece\" documentary for ITV for each year of his new contract - described by one industry source as \"a vanity project\". </p> <p>His current deal with LWT was not due to expire until next year, but the BBC offer forced the company to move quickly. Mr Robinson is understood to have been determined to keep Lord Bragg at LWT, where he has worked since 1978. An ITV source said the negotiations had been \"touch and go\". </p> <p>Lord Bragg, who will continue to broadcast on Radio 4, said he was delighted. \"I'm impressed that in what we might call challenging times, LWT and ITV have decided not to retreat but to back and strengthen arts broadcasting on the major channel.\" </p> <p>Steve Anderson, ITV's controller of news and arts, said: \"Melvyn Bragg provides a benchmark for quality television and we are proud that he is part of the ITV family. The South Bank Show is currently on top form, and unrivalled as the standard bearer for arts on television.\" </p> <p>However, some critics question ITV's reliance on Lord Bragg. The South Bank Show has been attacked in some quarters for not being challenging enough and for shifting the balance too far towards populist subject matters. </p> <p>But Lord Bragg's landmark series on the history of Christianity, 2000 Years, was widely held up as an example of innovative public service broadcasting. The Ten Commandments, another religious series from his department at LWT, begins this month. </p> <p>Production of the 24th series of the South Bank Show is under way, and plans are being made to celebrate its 25th anniversary, which falls at the start of Lord Bragg's new contract in September 2001. </p> <p>Marcus Plantin, LWT's director of programmes and another key figure in the deal, said he was delighted to retain \"television's unrivalled arts authority\".</p>",

Lord Bragg was said to have been offered a key role in developing a new arts and culture channel, which the corporation wants to launch as part of controversial plans to restructure its television services. The corporation insisted he had merely been talking to the controller of BBC2, Jane Root, about a number of projects. Poaching Lord Bragg would have been a coup for the BBC, and a blow for ITV, which relies heavily upon the veteran broadcaster to provide much-needed gravitas to its output. But Lord Bragg was swayed by the offer of a guaranteed future for the South Bank Show, plus a sweetener of a \"signature piece\" documentary for ITV for each year of his new contract - described by one industry source as \"a vanity project\". His current deal with LWT was not due to expire until next year, but the BBC offer forced the company to move quickly. Mr Robinson is understood to have been determined to keep Lord Bragg at LWT, where he has worked since 1978. An ITV source said the negotiations had been \"touch and go\". Lord Bragg, who will continue to broadcast on Radio 4, said he was delighted. \"I'm impressed that in what we might call challenging times, LWT and ITV have decided not to retreat but to back and strengthen arts broadcasting on the major channel.\" Steve Anderson, ITV's controller of news and arts, said: \"Melvyn Bragg provides a benchmark for quality television and we are proud that he is part of the ITV family. The South Bank Show is currently on top form, and unrivalled as the standard bearer for arts on television.\" However, some critics question ITV's reliance on Lord Bragg. The South Bank Show has been attacked in some quarters for not being challenging enough and for shifting the balance too far towards populist subject matters. But Lord Bragg's landmark series on the history of Christianity, 2000 Years, was widely held up as an example of innovative public service broadcasting. The Ten Commandments, another religious series from his department at LWT, begins this month. Production of the 24th series of the South Bank Show is under way, and plans are being made to celebrate its 25th anniversary, which falls at the start of Lord Bragg's new contract in September 2001. Marcus Plantin, LWT's director of programmes and another key figure in the deal, said he was delighted to retain \"television's unrivalled arts authority\".",

The vulnerability was there, but the toughness also enabled him to withstand the constant attacks from the tabloid and rightwing press that were mounted on him and his family throughout the middle years of his time at Lambeth Palace.</p> <p>For a short honeymoon period, it had delighted the media that this pig-keeping, ex-tank commander archbishop should officiate at a royal wedding, welcome the Pope to Canterbury, and deploy Terry Waite to rescue hostages. But the dramatic change came when he preached penitence and reconciliation at the service of thanksgiving after the Falklands war in 1982, instead of the triumphalism the press and politicians had looked for. From then on, all his considerable achievements were set against a background of a tabloid venom - aided and abetted, many believed, by a mafia of homosexual Anglo-Catholics and rightwing politicians. His survival was a triumph of intelligence, integrity and courage.</p> <p>His instincts were patrician, but not his origins. Runcie grew up in Crosby, now a suburb of Liverpool, the youngest child of an electrical engineer at the local Tate and Lyle sugar factory. He won a scholarship to the local Merchant Taylors' School where he was an ideal pupil: clever, well-mannered and athletic. His parents were not churchgoers. His Scottish Presbyterian father referred to Church of England clergymen as \"black beetles\". Robert's conversion came about by following a girl on whom he had an adolescent crush to confirmation classes. His older sister steered him in the direction of a strongly Anglo-Catholic church, and within a short space of time he was fully involved in the rituals of smells and bells and catholic spirituality.</p> <p>His father became blind and had to retire early, and the family was short of money. But a scholarship took Runcie to Brasenose College, Oxford, to read classics, where his time was interrupted by war service. Out of affection for his Scottish-born father, he volunteered to join a Scottish regiment, and was startled to be recruited as officer material for the Scots Guards. It proved a significant part of his education. As a lower-middle-class boy from Liverpool he at first had a hard time of it, but quickly learned form. His platoon and his fellow-officers - among them names like William Whitelaw - soon discovered that he was good company and an amusing and talented mimic.</p> <p>In later years, Runcie used to say he was probably the first Archbishop of Canterbury since Thomas \u00e0 Becket to have been into battle. The Third Battalion of the Scots Guards landed at Normandy soon after D-Day in June 1944, and fought their way to the Baltic. En route Runcie won the Military Cross for wiping out a German gun emplacement while under heavy fire, though this became something of an embarrassment to him when he was archbishop. He would have preferred it to have been for his action the previous day when, at the risk of his own life, he had pulled one of his platoon out of a burning tank.</p> <p>After returning to Oxford, where he gained a first class degree in Greats and learned a classical liberalism which shaped his thought for the rest of his life, he went to Westcott House, the theological college in Cambridge. There the other ordinands - trained by Kenneth Carey - included Hugh Montefiore, Simon Phipps, Patrick Rodger, Graham Leonard, Stephen Verney and Victor Whitsey. Runcie did not, however, take a degree in theology. It was possibly not a wise decision, for he ever afterwards regarded himself as a theological lightweight, despite the years teaching in theological colleges, and he kept up with theological reading in a way that few other clergy ever do.</p> <p>After two happy years as a curate in Gosforth, Tyneside, he rejoined Carey at Westcott House, as chaplain, later vice-principal. In 1956 he was elected fellow and dean of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. There he married Rosalind and the first of their two children was born. Four years later he was appointed principal of Cuddesdon theological college, near Oxford.</p> <p>During his 10 years at Cuddesdon he not only humanised what had been a repressively monastic establishment, but raised its academic standing and strengthened its links with Oxford University. This was during a period when he was also having to steer his students through the furore caused by the then Bishop of Woolwich John Robinson's 1963 book, Honest To God. Unsurprised by Robinson's theology, Runcie welcomed the debate it produced. In future years as a bishop and archbishop he constantly drew on ex-students from Cuddesdon when making appointments to his staff.</p> <p>In 1970 he became Bishop of St Albans. By this time his workaholic lifestyle was well established, though always hidden behind his easy friendliness. He was a popular bishop in a flourishing diocese. While there he became chairman of the central religious advisory committee, answering to both the BBC and the IBA. He was also appointed chairman of the Anglican-Orthodox joint doctrinal commission, which was to foster his affection for the Orthodox churches.</p> <p>Always finding it hard to take himself seriously, he seems to have been genuinely astonished when, in 1979, after nine years in St Albans, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, asked if she could forward his name to the Queen to succeed Donald Coggan as Archbishop of Canterbury. He was the first archbishop to have been chosen by the church itself under the new crown appointments system, and it took him three weeks to say yes.</p> <p>He brought with him to Lambeth his chaplain, Richard Chartres (now Bishop of London), a considerable support and influence in shaping those early days. Runcie had a gift for strategic planning, organisation and delegation unusual in a Christian leader. He soon recognised that, if a modern Archbishop of Canterbury were to satisfy the huge expectations of his office, he would need the staff and resources of an efficiently run establishment, and must always be properly briefed. The talented team at Lambeth Palace included Terry Waite; but his staff found (and would complain in private) that the more he delegated, the more extra work he took on. Among other demands, he promised - and just about managed - to visit every province of the world-wide Anglican communion before the Lambeth Conference of 1988.</p> <p>In his first three years at Lambeth he was scarcely out of the headlines. The saga of Terry Waite as \"the archbishop's special envoy\" extricating three missionaries being held hostage in Iran captured the public imagination during Christmas 1980. It took two months of Waite's negotiating skills to gain their release, which Runcie was able to announce at a dramatic moment in the middle of the 1981 February General Synod.</p> <p>That same year he married the Prince and Princess of Wales, taking centre stage with them in all the international publicity that surrounded that event. He was concerned at the time at the extreme youthfulness of Diana, but hoped she would grow into her role. He later said he had found Prince Charles \"disenchanted\" with the Church of England, and Diana not naturally religious, but he kept in contact with the couple and, at Charles's request, did his best to help Diana.</p> <p>A year later Runcie was instrumental in inviting Pope John Paul II to Britain and was howled down by anti- papists in his native Liverpool for doing so. By this time Runcie had developed a personal friendship with Basil Hume, the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, and together they and their respective staff planned the visit. Runcie held strongly that the Pope should experience Anglican worship while in England. A eucharistic service was ruled out by the Pope, but gradual agreement was reached about a great \"celebration of faith\" to take place in Canterbury Cathedral. This was the time of the Falklands war, and plans for the Pope's visit were complicated by the invasion of the islands by Roman Catholic Argentina. The Vatican declared the visit would have to be cancelled if the crisis continued, and the whole project became uncertain until, with less than a week to go, the British government offered to withdraw from any official participation in the visit. On May 29 1982 the Pope arrived in Canterbury, to be welcomed by Runcie and escorted to the high altar of the cathedral. It was a historic service: an act of reconciliation which marked how far the relationships between the Anglican and Roman churches had eased since the Second Vatican Council. It was probably Runcie's high point in public esteem when he was seen to be guiding the Pope through the unfamiliar English liturgy.</p> <p>Victory in the Falklands followed soon after. At the service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral, Runcie reminded the congregation that war was a terrible thing, and \"people are mourning on both sides in this conflict\". He deeply offended members of the Conservative government, who were expecting triumphalism, and much of the rightwing establishment, political and press, never forgave him for it. In the following months, government and media began to realise that on many issues, particularly those to do with unemployment and deprivation, Runcie and a growing number of other bishops were becoming a political force.</p> <p>When the report of the Archbishops' Commission on Urban Priority Areas, Faith in the City, was published in 1985, it left Mrs Thatcher and her government in no doubt that the concerned leadership of the Church of England could not endorse Conservative policies which did so little to alleviate the misery of poverty and bad housing in the inner cities. It was blown up into a church versus government row, with Runcie receiving most of the opprobrium. But while the report criticised both the state and the church for its record in the inner cities, it was not mere words. In response to its call, the Church of England raised over \u00a318m to support hundreds of local projects to help the urban poor.</p> <p>It was often said at this time that, because the Labour party was in disarray, the Church of England was becoming the real opposition in the country. The archbishop himself was often under criticism for \"not giving a clear lead\" (ie not taking a conservative stand) on a number of moral and theological issues, as well as on the vexed question of the ordination of women.</p> <p>The rightwing campaign against him took a nasty turn when it began to focus on his marriage and his wife. Lindy, from the outset, had made it clear that she was her own woman. She rarely accompanied Runcie on the weekends he spent at the Old Palace in Canterbury, because her interests were in London. She only went with him on his overseas visits when she had been invited to perform as a concert pianist. A tabloid newspaper had splashed privately-taken pictures of her, including one in evening dress draped across a piano, and another in a swimsuit; and the implications were that the marriage was breaking up, and Runcie should resign as archbishop. The persecution, for such it was, surfaced at intervals over the middle years of Runcie's archiepiscopate, until he and Lindy were forced to issue a formal statement that they had been \"a happily married couple for nearly 30 years, and we both look forward to our rewarding partnership continuing for the rest of our lives\".</p> <p>On marriage, as on many issues, Runcie was more liberal than conservatives in church and state really liked. He had long advocated re-marriage in church after divorce in cases where partners really wanted to make a new Christian marriage; but it often looked as though his liberal intellect was in tension with his catholic, conservative and pastoral instincts. He refused to condemn, as many traditionally-minded Christians would have liked him to do, the Bishop of Durham's radical theology, though at the same time he privately deplored Dr Jenkins's pastoral ineptitude in coming out with such views at the great Christian festivals of Easter and Christmas.</p> <p>He showed cautious sympathy for homosexuals. In a church where many good priests were known to be of that orientation, he had homosexual friends and ordained men whom he suspected were gay, but he always preferred a policy of \"don't ask\". Accused by angry evangelicals of contravening the church's teaching, he claimed that he had never \"knowingly ordained anyone who told me they were a practising homosexual and living in a partnership as if it was a marriage\". His refusal to support openly gay clergy drew their animosity, and Runcie admitted that he could never quite trust them not to stab him in the back.</p> <p>In General Synod debates on national and international affairs, he often knew too much of the complexities of the situation from his many contacts in government, the Foreign Office and overseas to be able to endorse some of the simplistic solutions the Synod wanted to offer. And on the subject of ordaining women, many people thought him handicapped by his affection for the deeply conservative Orthodox churches.</p> <p>Only reluctantly did he accept that he must vote in the General Synod for women priests. The church was deeply divided on the issue, and both sides were often frustrated by what they saw as the archbishop's \"nailing his colours to the fence\" and refusing to come clean about his own real views. His traditionalist instincts, his radical sense of justice, and his deep fear of a split church were all in tension. With hindsight it is probable that his long refusal to commit himself helped to limit the damage when the vote for women priests was eventually passed.</p> <p>During all these years he was incessantly travelling throughout the Anglican communion. It should have been Terry Waite who set up and accompanied him on these tours. But increasingly Waite had become involved in his attempts to rescue hostages held in the Middle East. He had been successful in rescuing the three missionaries from Iran, and in negotiating the release of four Britons held in Libya. He then turned his attention to hostages held in the Lebanon, and got out of his depth in Lebanese, Iranian and American politics as he attempted to secure the release of more western hostages in Beirut. Runcie defended his work, but grew increasingly uneasy about it, both for the sake of Waite's personal safety, and because the Lambeth Conference, which Waite should have been organising, was fast approaching.</p> <p>Suspicions surfaced that the Americans were using Waite to cover up an arms deal with Iran, and Waite, in a defiant attempt to clear his name, and against Runcie's advice, went on another expedition to Lebanon, where he was himself taken hostage. Not knowing where he was, or whether he was dead or alive, cast a shadow over the last three years of Runcie's archiepiscopate.</p> <p>A few months later, with criticism of Runcie from the conservative - and anti-women priests - wing of the church running high, an anonymous preface was published in Crockford's Clerical Directory, which accused him with donnish venom of always taking the liberal line of least resistance on all issues, and of appointing a succession of liberal elitist bishops who were theologically unsound. It was quite clearly the work of an academic disappointed at not being offered high office in the church, and Runcie, like many others, quickly guessed that the author was the Rev Dr Gareth Bennett, an Oxford theologian, a closet homosexual and an Anglo-Catholic, whom he had long regarded as a personal friend. Runcie, challenged by a reporter about the preface, delivered one of the most apt aphorisms to fall from the mouth of an archbishop: \"In my father's house are many mansions - and all of them are made of glass.\" The Bennett affair was the second dark shadow to fall across Runcie at Canterbury and was made darker when Bennett, pursued by the media and fearing the inevitable exposure, committed suicide.</p> <p>However, there was genuine acclaim by the assembled bishops of the whole Anglican Communion when Runcie opened the 1988 Lambeth Conference in Canterbury. He had been working towards it from the time he had been made archbishop. Before it took place there had been grave warnings that this would be the last of the 10-yearly conferences, for it was said that the Anglican communion was being torn apart by tensions over doctrine, particularly with regard to the ordination of women, and cultural differences. For Runcie the conference was a great personal triumph, and the climax of his career. His astonishing energy, his warmth and humour, and his skill in handling difficult issues, not only held the huge gathering of bishops together for three weeks, but ensured that they would go away determined to keep the Anglican communion intact, and meet again in 1998.</p> <p>Carefully choosing his moment, he retired at the beginning of 1991. He was given a life peerage, and with Lindy went to live in St Albans. His diary remained full. He was able to resume an occupation he had several times enjoyed before becoming archbishop: sailing as guest lecturer on Swan Hellenic cruises. He was in constant demand for lecture tours in America, for semi-official visits to Eastern Europe and Africa, and for television programmes. The absence of any news of Terry Waite remained a continuing sadness until November 1991, when Runcie was at last able to welcome him home.</p> <p>In retirement he had two health scares. He had to be flown home from Salt Lake City with a recurrence of cellulitis, a serious condition originally caused 30 years before by a crop-sprayed blackberry thorn, and exacerbated by a splinter. During his stay in the American hospital he, for the first time, received the sacrament consecrated by a woman priest and \"wondered why we'd been fussing about it\". Then, in 1994, he had a prostate operation which revealed some cancer, but with a good prognosis.</p> <p>Though he had already been the subject of three biographies, none of the authors of them had been given access to his official papers. For the sake of future historians he accepted there should be a fully authorised biography to take its place with those of his predecessors, and invited Humphrey Carpenter to write it.</p> <p>When the book was almost complete, Runcie was horrified that, far from being the seriously researched history of his episcopate he had expected, much of it, he felt, was simply transcribed conversations and gossip, including a number of old indiscretions Runcie had given off the record about the royal family. He also thought Carpenter had exaggerated the way Runcie had used staff and friends to research and draft most of his addresses as though he had few ideas of his own, and had failed to understand the importance of the archbishop's overseas visits, and his extraordinary personal achievement at the Lambeth Conference. Runcie reluctantly accepted that it was Carpenter's book, and he had made no real stipulations about the form it should take. He did, however, write a postscript for it stating: \"I have done my best to die before this book is published... the writer... who so brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of Oxford in the 1940s does not seem to me to have grasped what it was like to be Archbishop of Canterbury in the 1980s.\"</p> <p>Once again, Runcie was in the tabloids, and under fire from his former critics, particularly about the remarks he had made about Prince Charles and Diana, and his admission that, yes, he had ordained homosexuals. Undoubtedly the book sold well because of it, but it was hard to see it as other than a piece of opportunism on Carpenter's part. Perhaps the task was too great, and the subject too enigmatic, despite Runcie's disarming frankness. But that book will not stop many church members looking back on the Runcie era as one of the most colourful and distinguished periods of recent church history.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, son James and daughter Rebecca.</p> <p>\u0095Rt Rev and Rt Hon Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie, Lord Runcie of Cuddesdon, priest, born October 2 1921; died July 11 2000</p>",

Tall and elegant, urbane and witty, he had the sort of charisma - not always evident on television - that made everyone he spoke to feel special. People loved him for it. Yet there was always that subtle formality that set him apart in church circles from the casual familiarity with which Christian names are almost universally used. Old friends called him Bob, newer friends called him Robert; but those who had no right rarely presumed to refer to him as anything but \"the archbishop\".

It was quite clearly the work of an academic disappointed at not being offered high office in the church, and Runcie, like many others, quickly guessed that the author was the Rev Dr Gareth Bennett, an Oxford theologian, a closet homosexual and an Anglo-Catholic, whom he had long regarded as a personal friend. Runcie, challenged by a reporter about the preface, delivered one of the most apt aphorisms to fall from the mouth of an archbishop: \"In my father's house are many mansions - and all of them are made of glass.\" The Bennett affair was the second dark shadow to fall across Runcie at Canterbury and was made darker when Bennett, pursued by the media and fearing the inevitable exposure, committed suicide. However, there was genuine acclaim by the assembled bishops of the whole Anglican Communion when Runcie opened the 1988 Lambeth Conference in Canterbury. He had been working towards it from the time he had been made archbishop. Before it took place there had been grave warnings that this would be the last of the 10-yearly conferences, for it was said that the Anglican communion was being torn apart by tensions over doctrine, particularly with regard to the ordination of women, and cultural differences. For Runcie the conference was a great personal triumph, and the climax of his career. His astonishing energy, his warmth and humour, and his skill in handling difficult issues, not only held the huge gathering of bishops together for three weeks, but ensured that they would go away determined to keep the Anglican communion intact, and meet again in 1998. Carefully choosing his moment, he retired at the beginning of 1991. He was given a life peerage, and with Lindy went to live in St Albans. His diary remained full. He was able to resume an occupation he had several times enjoyed before becoming archbishop: sailing as guest lecturer on Swan Hellenic cruises. He was in constant demand for lecture tours in America, for semi-official visits to Eastern Europe and Africa, and for television programmes. The absence of any news of Terry Waite remained a continuing sadness until November 1991, when Runcie was at last able to welcome him home. In retirement he had two health scares. He had to be flown home from Salt Lake City with a recurrence of cellulitis, a serious condition originally caused 30 years before by a crop-sprayed blackberry thorn, and exacerbated by a splinter. During his stay in the American hospital he, for the first time, received the sacrament consecrated by a woman priest and \"wondered why we'd been fussing about it\". Then, in 1994, he had a prostate operation which revealed some cancer, but with a good prognosis. Though he had already been the subject of three biographies, none of the authors of them had been given access to his official papers. For the sake of future historians he accepted there should be a fully authorised biography to take its place with those of his predecessors, and invited Humphrey Carpenter to write it. When the book was almost complete, Runcie was horrified that, far from being the seriously researched history of his episcopate he had expected, much of it, he felt, was simply transcribed conversations and gossip, including a number of old indiscretions Runcie had given off the record about the royal family. He also thought Carpenter had exaggerated the way Runcie had used staff and friends to research and draft most of his addresses as though he had few ideas of his own, and had failed to understand the importance of the archbishop's overseas visits, and his extraordinary personal achievement at the Lambeth Conference. Runcie reluctantly accepted that it was Carpenter's book, and he had made no real stipulations about the form it should take. He did, however, write a postscript for it stating: \"I have done my best to die before this book is published... the writer... who so brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of Oxford in the 1940s does not seem to me to have grasped what it was like to be Archbishop of Canterbury in the 1980s.\" Once again, Runcie was in the tabloids, and under fire from his former critics, particularly about the remarks he had made about Prince Charles and Diana, and his admission that, yes, he had ordained homosexuals. Undoubtedly the book sold well because of it, but it was hard to see it as other than a piece of opportunism on Carpenter's part. Perhaps the task was too great, and the subject too enigmatic, despite Runcie's disarming frankness. But that book will not stop many church members looking back on the Runcie era as one of the most colourful and distinguished periods of recent church history. He is survived by his wife, son James and daughter Rebecca. \u0095Rt Rev and Rt Hon Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie, Lord Runcie of Cuddesdon, priest, born October 2 1921; died July 11 2000",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, church leaders from all main denominations, and even old foes including Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, joined to pay tribute to Lord Runcie, former archbishop of Canterbury, who died yesterday, and who in his lifetime suffered more denigration and abuse than perhaps any holder of the office for 300 years. The tributes praised the moral courage and integrity of the former archbishop, who died at the age of 78 following a six-year struggle against prostate cancer. Tony Blair said Lord Runcie had been a man of great faith and moral courage who had carried the Church of England united through momentous and historic times. \"He was also a spiritual man of humility and modesty who will be missed by millions of ordinary people who saw him as their friend,\" he said. Lady Thatcher admitted she had had her differences with the archbishop but added: \"Robert Runcie was a warm, good, brave man... a friend for more than 50 years. I shall miss him.\" George Carey, the present archbishop, spoke of Lord Runcie's deep Christian faith. \"I mourn the passing of a friend and brother bishop whose attitude to death as to life was rooted in a firm conviction of God ever present.\" There were heartfelt words, too, from other Anglican bishops, Catholic leaders, Methodists, the Church of Scotland, and the chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, who praised him as a warm and gentle leader, undervalued in an abrasive age. During Dr Runcie's 11 years as archbishop from 1980 to 1991, he was much criticised by politicians for his pointed and sometimes inconvenient reminder of non-partisan, spiritual values, and sometimes by his fellow churchmen for his determination to represent the whole communion rather than factions within it. There were historic occasions such as the visit to Britain of Pope John Paul II in 1982, when the two men prayed together at Canterbury Cathedral, the first visit ever by a serving pontiff and an event inconceivable only a few years earlier. And there were state occasions, too, such as the wedding of the Prince of Wales to Princess Diana - an event Lord Runcie later said he had known to be an arranged marriage between an ill-matched couple. Military Cross But he is probably likely primarily to be remembered as the leader of the Church of England at a time when it fell out with the Conservative government and ceased to be regarded as the Tory party at prayer. A patrician and avuncular figure, he antagonised Margaret Thatcher by preaching a conciliatory sermon at the service in St. Paul's to celebrate the end of the Falklands war, asking for prayers for the relatives of those who had died on both sides. It was something he could do with some authority, much exacerbating the government's aggravation, having been awarded the Military Cross while a tank commander in the Scots Guards during the second world war. The medal, awarded to him during the invasion of Normandy in 1944 for drawing fire away from other tanks, aptly prefigured his subsequent career, where attacks on the church honed in on him. He was the first modern archbishop to be pilloried in the media - attacks which he generally took with geniality. \"It would be difficult to be an archbishop without people gunning for you,\" he said in 1985. Lord Runcie drew fire when he presided over the Church of England's report Faith in the City in 1985, a report which criticised the government's policies over urban poverty and deprivation, and was denounced by Norman Tebbit and other ministers, even ahead of publication, as a Marxist document. Lord Tebbit said yesterday: \"I found him a very warm and human man, very unstuffy. I never doubted his conviction. But, you know, being an archbishop doesn't necessarily make you any more right than being a cabinet minister.\" Generally Lord Runcie's stature con trasted with the calibre of those who attacked him, like Jeffrey Archer and Neil Hamilton. They did not like it when he urged sympathy for beleaguered mining communities during the miners' strike, or pointed out, in relation to the inner cities: \"We don't have to look as far as Ethiopia to find the darkness of disease, death and disaster. It is here on our doorstep.\" Lord Runcie, whose recreations in Who's Who were given as opera, reading history and novels, and owning Berkshire pigs, was a more substantial figure than his opponents, both in government and within the church, credited. For many he was one of the most distinguished archbishops of the 20th century. An urbane intellectual, with an Oxford first class degree and 10 years as head of a theological college, he succeeded in holding the Anglican communion together, while paving the way for convulsions such as ordination of women, an initiative to which he was initially opposed. Within the Church of England he was renowned for his emollience and ability in conciliation, but also for his irreverent wit and a phenomenal memory which enabled him to remember, even decades later, the identities of those he had met in the past. He was instinctively and intellectually hostile to the fervour, bordering on fanaticism, of some in the church. \"There is a sort of feeling that the religion that counts is one that is definite and uncompromising. We liberals have got to keep our head,\" he said last year. His diplomatic skills led nonetheless to conflict when one of his friends, the embittered Oxford college chaplain Gary Bennett, passed over for a bishopric, committed suicide after being identified as the anonymous author of a vitriolic attack on Lord Runcie in the 1987 Crockford's clerical directory.

The son of an engineer working for Tate and Lyle in Liverpool, he was ordained in 1950, becoming principal of Cuddesdon theological college, near Oxford, 10 years later. Lord Runcie, who received a life peerage after his retirement in 1991, leaves a wife Rosalind (Lindy), and a son and daughter. In retirement controversy continued to dog him after remarks he made for background purposes to his biographer Humphrey Carpenter were quoted verbatim when the book was published in 1996. He was rebuked by Dr Carey for inadvertently letting slip that he thought Princess Diana an actress and schemer. Characteristically, the former archbishop confined himself to a restrained letter of complaint to Carpenter: \"I have done my best to die before this book is published ... it is yet another investigation heavily dependent on the skillfully edited tape recorder.

With few takers willing to undergo the knife, female contraltos and mezzo sopranos were hired to play those key male roles in baroque opera modern listeners found so strange and haunting.</p> <p>Now the sublime voices of counter tenors like the charismatic David Daniels and Andreas Scholl, who can sing the high notes required by Bach and Handel without recourse to drastic surgery, have built a huge international following for a once forgotten oeuvre of early music.</p> <p>Recordings by both men have recently topped the classical music charts, and their performances sell months in advance.</p> <p>Unlike their 18th century counterparts like Farinelli, who were castrated in childhood so their voices would never break, modern counter tenors need not compromise their manhood for their art. Instead the falsetto (false voice) of which most men are capable - and which made Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees rich - can be honed to reach the higher registers.</p> <p>Even so, a little of the prejudice under which the castrati laboured lingers on. Not even the German-born Scholl, who created a sensation last year at Glyndebourne with his Bertarido in Handel's Rode-linda, has been immune from the sniggers. Though well over 6ft, and with the dashing looks which have earned him the soubriquet of Superman, he too has been laughed at. \"I have sung in Nuremberg, and some of the audience laughed because they thought it was funny that a man sings that high - even though they hear it every day on the radio. Male pop singers sing higher than counter tenors, screaming their heads off, and nobody worries about that.\"</p> <p>But that has not put off the hundreds of hopefuls who Daniels claims want to train as counter tenors in the United States.</p> <p>\"When I started no one was interested. Now huge numbers of young men are training. There are hundreds at college auditions.\"</p> <p>Daniels and Scholl are arguably the two greatest male singers in the world, according to Andrew Clements, the Guardian's classical music critic, a happy coincidence which has combined with the new interest in early music to cement the trend.</p> <p>It is Britain which has done most to save the style from slipping into oblivion. The tradition of the counter tenor - or male alto as it was called here - never really died out and it was the post-war singer Alfred Deller who awakened its potential in contemporary composers like Tippett and Britten.</p> <p>Margaret Cable, professor of singing at the Royal College of Music in London, is convinced the new wave of counter tenors will give Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras a run for their money. \"I wouldn't be in the slightest bit surprised if we get three counter tenors doing the same thing. Why not ... they are very, very popular.\"</p>",

Now the sublime voices of counter tenors like the charismatic David Daniels and Andreas Scholl, who can sing the high notes required by Bach and Handel without recourse to drastic surgery, have built a huge international following for a once forgotten oeuvre of early music. Recordings by both men have recently topped the classical music charts, and their performances sell months in advance. Unlike their 18th century counterparts like Farinelli, who were castrated in childhood so their voices would never break, modern counter tenors need not compromise their manhood for their art. Instead the falsetto (false voice) of which most men are capable - and which made Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees rich - can be honed to reach the higher registers. Even so, a little of the prejudice under which the castrati laboured lingers on. Not even the German-born Scholl, who created a sensation last year at Glyndebourne with his Bertarido in Handel's Rode-linda, has been immune from the sniggers. Though well over 6ft, and with the dashing looks which have earned him the soubriquet of Superman, he too has been laughed at. \"I have sung in Nuremberg, and some of the audience laughed because they thought it was funny that a man sings that high - even though they hear it every day on the radio. Male pop singers sing higher than counter tenors, screaming their heads off, and nobody worries about that.\" But that has not put off the hundreds of hopefuls who Daniels claims want to train as counter tenors in the United States. \"When I started no one was interested. Now huge numbers of young men are training. There are hundreds at college auditions.\" Daniels and Scholl are arguably the two greatest male singers in the world, according to Andrew Clements, the Guardian's classical music critic, a happy coincidence which has combined with the new interest in early music to cement the trend. It is Britain which has done most to save the style from slipping into oblivion. The tradition of the counter tenor - or male alto as it was called here - never really died out and it was the post-war singer Alfred Deller who awakened its potential in contemporary composers like Tippett and Britten. Margaret Cable, professor of singing at the Royal College of Music in London, is convinced the new wave of counter tenors will give Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras a run for their money. \"I wouldn't be in the slightest bit surprised if we get three counter tenors doing the same thing. Why not ... they are very, very popular.\"",

Jim Irvin, senior editor of Mojo, said the appearance of pop's teen sensation should not be that surprising. \"It might look odd, but there are a lot of people I know who feel that it's a genius piece of songwriting.\" Top 100 Popular high notes 1 In my life, The Beatles 2 Satisfaction, The Rolling Stones 3 Over the rainbow, Judy Garland 4 Here, there and everywhere, The Beatles 5 Tracks of my tears, The Miracles 6 The times they are a-changin', Bob Dylan 7 Strange Fruit, Billie Holiday 8 I can't make you love me, Bonnie Rait 9 People get ready, Aretha Franklin 10 You've lost that lovin' feelin', The Righteous Brothers 11 Yesterday, The Beatles 12 I say a little prayer, Dionne Warwick 13 God only knows, The Beach Boys 14 Something, Frank Sinatra 15 Every time we say goodbye, Ella Fitzgerald 16 Fire and rain, The Isley Brothers 17 Moon River, Andy Williams 18 Stand by me, Ben E King 19 Eleanor Rigby, The Beatles 20 Ain't no sunshine, Bill Withers 21 I heard it through the grapevine, Marvin Gaye 22 Be my baby, The Ronettes 23 Many rivers to cross, Jimmy Cliff 24 Without you, Harry Nilsson 25 There is a light that never goes out, The Smiths 26 Somewhere, Barbra Streisand 27 Jersey girl, Tom Waits 28 I go to sleep, The Pretenders 29 Hey Jude, The Beatles 30 I think it's going to rain today, Randy Newman 31 Mack the knife, Bobby Darin 32 It's too late, Carole King 33 Tired of being alone, Al Green 34 There she goes, The La's 35 I'm stone in love with you, The Stylistics 36 Just like a woman, Bob Dylan 37 Feel like going home, Charlie Rich 38 Song to the siren, Tim Buckley 39 Live forever, Oasis 40 In the ghetto, Elvis Presley 41 Love letters, Ketty Lester 42 River man, Nick Drake 43 The long &amp; winding road, The Beatles 44 Dark end of the street, James Carr 45 America, Simon and Garfunkel 46 Tower of song, Leonard Cohen 47 First time ever I saw your face, Roberta Flack 48 Sweet Jane, Lou Reed 49 It's all in the game, Tommy Edwards 50 Everybody's talkin', Fred Neill 51 Johnny B Goode, Chuck Berry 52 A case of you, Joni Mitchell 53 Suspicious minds, Elvis Presley 54 Who knows where the time goes, Fairport Convention 55 The weight, The Band 56 Walk away Renee, The Left Banke 57 Someone to watch over me, Frank Sinatra 58 Only love can break your heart, St Etienne 59 If you don't know me by now, Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes 60 Let it be, The Beatles 61 Waterloo sunset, The Kinks 62 Windmills of your mind, Noel Harrison 63 White Christmas, Bing Crosby 64 God bless the child, Billie Holiday 65 Bridge over troubled water, Simon and Garfunkel 66 Baby I need your loving, The Four Tops 67 Killing me softly with his song, Roberta Flack 68 If you go away (ne me quitte pas), Jacques Brel 69 Jealous guy, John Lennon 70 One for my baby, Frank Sinatra 71 To love somebody, The Bee Gees 72 Walking in Memphis, Marc Cohn 73 Blue moon, Elvis Presley 74 Just my imagination, The Temptations 75 What becomes of the brokenhearted, Jimmy Ruffin 76 Superstition, Stevie Wonder 77 Maybe I'm amazed, Paul McCartney 78 Guantanamera, Perez Prado 79 My funny valentine, Chet Baker 80 Different drum, Linda Ronstadt 81 Make it easy on yourself, The Walker Brothers 82 Summertime, Janis Joplin 83 Makin' whoopee, Ray Charles 84 By the time I get to Phoenix, Glen Campbell 85 September song, Walter Huston 86 Proud Mary, Creedence Clearwater Revival 87 What a wonderful world, Louis Armstrong 88 Always on my mind, Willie Nelson 89 Reason to believe, Tim Hardin 90 This land is your land, Woody Guthrie 91 Ode to Billie Joe, Bobby Gentry 92 Losing my mind, Julia McKenzie 93 As time goes by, Dick Haymes 94 Smells like teen spirit, Nirvana 95 Goodnight Irene, Leadbelly 96 The moon's a harsh mistress, Glen Campbell 97 Baby one more time, Britney Spears 98 Ever fallen in love (with someone you shouldn't've), Buzzcocks 99 We shall overcome, Joan Baez 100 Desperado, The Eagles",

They were convicted in July 1995 after a jury heard that officers from the flying squad found a stun gun in Mr Martin's London flat, and had matched his palm print to one found on the glass counter of the shop. The case against the three men began to crumble two years ago when a police complaints inquiry into the flying squad uncovered a web of corruption. Two officers who were instrumental in the jewellery shop investigation, detective constables Terry McGuinness and Kevin Garner, have since been convicted of a series of offences, including aggravated burglary and conspiracy to steal 80kg of cannabis. McGuinness was jailed for nine years. Garner is awaiting sentence. The court of appeal heard Garner was the officer who claimed to have found the stun gun in Mr Martin's flat. McGuinness was also there during the search, which took place nine months after the robbery. Three other officers involved in the investigation are awaiting trial on corruption charges and cannot be named for legal reasons. When Mr Martin was arrested, he insisted officers had planted the stun gun under a cushion on his sofa. Mr Martin said one of the officers turned to him and boasted he \"had stitched up guys like you all day long.\" Quashing the convictions, Lord Justice Henry, Mrs Justice Bracewell and Mr Justice Richards, said: \"It would be curious if so incriminating an item were to be found so ill concealed by a surprise raid nine months after the alleged use of that weapon.\" They noted there was no forensic evidence linking the stun gun to the one used in the robbery. \"In the light of what is now known, the crown prosecution service accepts that the evidence given at the trial, of the search for and discovery of the gun cannot be relied on,\" their judgment said. The justices also referred to the \"surprising\" way detectives managed to match Mr Martin's palm print to one found on the glass counter seven months after the robbery, even though Mr Martin, who lives in south London, had been a suspect for more than six months and his prints were already on police files. McGuinness, 42, is also alleged to have shown photographs of Mr Taylor, who lives in Hackney, north London, to a witness shortly before an identity parade in April, 1994. The defendants had a first appeal dismissed in June 1996. But their case was referred back to justices in October last year by the criminal cases review commission following revelations about widespread corruption in the flying squad uncovered in a secret Scotland Yard investigation, codenamed Operation Spain. McGuinness confessed to a series of charges after a \"sting\" set up by the Met's anti-corruption branch, CIB3, in December 1997.

The first two occasions the prints were sent for analysis the result was negative - it did not match Martin's. \"No one, not the criminal cases review commission, not the court of appeal, has ever been given a satisfactory answer as to why that print finally matched,\" said Martin. There was no identification evidence against him. He was never put on an identity parade. In prison, Martin immediately made a complaint about the police and the following month was visited in Belmarsh, south-east London, by an investigating officer. \"He said to me, 'No judge or jury will ever believe that those officers fitted you up. You've just got to serve your sentence'.\" Seven months into Martin's sentence, his younger brother, Jason, committed suicide. The brothers had been close, and Jason had had a breakdown after Kevin's conviction. In August last year, an officer from CIB3, the anti-corruption branch, told Martin his case was being reinvestigated as part of an inquiry into allegations against the flying squad. He was released on bail, pending appeal, in November last year. \"There's a lot of other guys in prison going through all this who have been fitted up, and no one's listening. I just want this to give all those people hope.\"",

As the search for the eight-year-old entered its 12th day, the investigation team of around 300 officers was stretched to the limit as it sifted through the mass of information which flooded into its headquarters in Littlehampton, West Sussex. Nigel Yeo, assistant chief constable of Sussex, said around 10,000 calls had been received since Sarah vanished from a country lane near her grandparents' house in Kingston, West Sussex, on July 1 - the biggest public response he had seen in his career. He said 1,500 calls had been received between 7.45am and 9.45am yesterday after a television appearance by the youngster's parents, Sarah and Michael. By the end of the day, more than 4,000 calls had been made. Mrs Payne, 31, told GMTV the family was trying to cope with the strain by sticking together and holding on to normality as best they could. The mother of four said: \"If any good can come out of something so devastating, it has made us an even stronger family for Sarah to come back to.\" Mr and Mrs Payne also appealed to the man seen with a girl at a motorway service station in Cheshire nine hours after their child vanished to come forward. An e-fit of the man who was seen at the Knutsford service station at 5am on July 2, with a girl called Sarah who fitted the missing youngster's description, prompted hundreds of calls after its release on Tuesday. Mr Yeo confirmed that 2,864 calls had come in during the 12 hours after distribution of the picture which was described as 90% accurate by the witness involved. But he added that despite a deluge of calls, double the amount received in the equivalent 12-hour period last week, police had come no further in their endeavours to track down the mystery man. He said: \"At the moment the Knutsford sighting remains the best, the most significant, and that's why we are still working on it. \"The hope has always been, and remains, that if that person is completely coincidental and if that sighting at the motorway service station is not related to this, the person can come forward.\" But he added: \"The fact that this has not yet happened leads one to draw inferences, but they are only inferences, not concrete evidence.\" He made a further appeal for help in tracing the white van seen by Sarah's brother, Lee, 13, just after she disappeared.",

Through binoculars I saw the disc was a gigantic smoke ring more than 100 metres in diameter. Etna has been known to emit 50 of them a day from a crater called Bocca Nuova, forming what physicists call a vortex ring. They occur in many places in nature and have some curious properties, which scientists are finding ways to exploit. </p> <p>The principle of a vortex ring is simple enough. A vortex is a swirling motion, like a tornado or a whirlpool. Curve it around so that the top and bottom meet in a doughnut shape and you have a vortex ring. They can be formed by turbulent flow in liquids and gases. Miniature vortex rings occur in blood in the chambers of the pumping heart; huge ones occur in the atmosphere as thermals, where masses of warm air rise and cooler air is sucked in below. Baby dolphins project vortex rings from their blowholes for fun, nudging them around like toy haloes. </p> <p>The rings of gas and steam of Mount Etna last for up to 10 minutes, rising thousands of feet into the air. This stability is partly because of momentum (once something starts spinning, it tends to continue), and partly because of density. Centrifugal force will tend to pull the ring apart, but a ring which is less dense than its surroundings, such as a ring of warm smoke in air, will stay together. A vortex ring will even survive an impact with a hard surface, bouncing off like a rubber ball and keeping its coherence. This stability has attracted researchers at the Naval Air Station, Point Mugu, in California, who have patented some ingenious inventions for civilian life. </p> <p>One of the simplest ideas is for an inhaler. Instead of spraying the vaporised medicine into the mouth, where there is the risk that it will get no further than the trachea, a dispenser will blow a series of tiny vapour rings. These ricochet down through the airways and find their way into the lungs where they deliver the medicated vapour to where it is most effective. </p> <p>A similar principle is applied in the patent for a device for firefighting in confined spaces. A large projector will fire rings of carbon dioxide or halon gas through air ducts to douse the fire. </p> <p>A more imaginative, though perhaps less plausible, vortex ring projector is intended for law enforcement. The device would be mounted on a police helicopter which would swoop down on cars in high speed chases. The projector launches rings of carbon dioxide at the fleeing car, upsetting the air/fuel mixture ratio in the engine, causing it to lose power and come to a gradual halt. Whether this could be made to work in practice has yet to be proved. </p> <p>Vortex rings have other aerodynamic quirks. A faster smoke ring will overtake a slower one by going through the middle, leaving both intact. If several vortex rings are moving one after the other at the same speed, they interact, moving together as a train faster than one ring alone. Under normal conditions this is hardly noticeable, but at high speeds it can make a big difference. The exhaust from a jet engine will be faster if it takes the form of a series of vortex rings; and a faster exhaust means greater thrust. </p> <p>There are signs that a top-secret, supersonic aircraft using this technology may already be flying. Residents of different parts of the US have reported hearing a series of pulsing booms from an aircraft which left a distinctive contrail described as \"doughnuts on a rope\". </p> <p>In the 1940s there were toy \"air ray pistols\" which could launch an air ring to knock over a paper target at a range of several feet.

Hence the evolution of species. </p> <p>On the boat we debated the mechanisms and processes involved, informed by modern studies of the changing distribution of beak sizes as finch populations responded to years of drought or downpour. </p> <p>Yet superb as such microevolutionary studies of Darwin's finches are, we chewed over how far they could cast light on major evolutionary transitions. The gap between evidence and theory on geological time scales is hard to bridge. Could the study of three decades of finch beaks inevitably lead to a theory of evolution as gradualist and continuous? </p> <p>How different such meticulous research was, we reflected, from the speculations of those self-styled Darwinians who have grouped themselves under the banner of evolutionary psychology (EP) and whose claims our book is intended to counter. </p> <p>EP's central thesis, stated in a score of popular books, newspaper articles and television spectaculars is that there is a \"universal human nature\" which \"we\" all recognise when \"we\" see it. That there is immense diversity as well as commonality in what another \"we\" sees is brushed to one side. This \"nature\", they argue, was established by evolution and natural selection during the Pleistocene epoch and has remained unchanged ever since, despite dramatic changes in the organisation of human society and lives - to say nothing of climate. </p> <p>But if birds' beaks can change within 30 years across a few generations, why not humans over the 100-600,000 years since the Pleistocene? Evolutionary psychology persists in misreading Darwin's central project, that was to explain the transmutation of species, and hence change over time. Its followers are preoccupied with stasis. </p> <p>There are, they say, universal mental \"modules\" for cheat detection, recognition and the sexual preferences of older men for younger women and young women for rich old men which persist as adaptations to the Pleistocene ecological niche - their so- called Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation. The fact that even their own texts report contradictory evidence - for example, research indicating that where women have independent access to resources, they no longer go for rich old men - does not dismay them. </p> <p>Here EP is much closer to Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism - the insistence on the natural \"struggle red in tooth and claw\" as providing an explanation of the social hierarchy of the Victorian Empire. Neither Spencer nor the EPers have change over time at the core of their theory. This omission ensures that EP fails to address the important task it sets itself. </p> <p>Take the claims that the expression of the emotions - of anger, happiness or misery - are the same the world over. Darwin's original evidence in his book The Expressions Of The Emotions In Animal And Man was based on his finding that photographs of ham actors expressing these emotions were accurately identified by many people in different countries. </p> <p>EPers build this speculation into a case of biologically fixed human universals. Potential facial manoeuvres are constrained by muscle, bone and nerve. So a smile is a smile is a smile - or is it merely an actor's rictus? What exactly is expressed by those photos in Hello! magazine of society beauties with their fixed smiles showing flawless teeth - but often ice-cold eyes? Genuine happiness? Posing for the photographer? The power of wealth? </p> <p>And what are the many meanings read into those smiles by us, the knowing viewers? These are not innocent expressions of pure biology, but the contruction of meaning out of the complexity of our biosocial existence. </p> <p>How about the poker faces of those who will not smile, or the sycophantic smiles of inferiors at superiors' jokes? And of course social scientists have been telling us for years about smiling as compulsory gender performance - notably by air stewardesses. </p> <p>Bringing gender analyses from the social sciences together with meticulous biological observation and experimentation is mutually enriching. Each discourse challenges and informs the other. </p> <p>As a sociologist and biologist living and working together we have enjoyed many hours of such debate. Yet this truly interdisciplinary research is precisely what EP denies in its insistence on the subordinate and colonised status of the social sciences. Both evolutionary theory and human psychology have been hijacked. </p> <p>Alas, Poor Darwin, the product of discussions between 15 philosophers, cultural critics, social scientists, ethologists and molecular biologists, is a step towards rescuing this interdisciplinary goal from the populist claims of biology as destiny. It will not get an easy ride, for EP is vociferous and well entrenched, and its claims are glib and attractive. Ultimately the only way to drive out bad theory is to replace it with better. This is the task we have set ourselves. </p> <p>\u0095 Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology, ed. Hilary &amp; Steven Rose, is published by Cape.</p>",

Yet superb as such microevolutionary studies of Darwin's finches are, we chewed over how far they could cast light on major evolutionary transitions. The gap between evidence and theory on geological time scales is hard to bridge. Could the study of three decades of finch beaks inevitably lead to a theory of evolution as gradualist and continuous? How different such meticulous research was, we reflected, from the speculations of those self-styled Darwinians who have grouped themselves under the banner of evolutionary psychology (EP) and whose claims our book is intended to counter. EP's central thesis, stated in a score of popular books, newspaper articles and television spectaculars is that there is a \"universal human nature\" which \"we\" all recognise when \"we\" see it. That there is immense diversity as well as commonality in what another \"we\" sees is brushed to one side. This \"nature\", they argue, was established by evolution and natural selection during the Pleistocene epoch and has remained unchanged ever since, despite dramatic changes in the organisation of human society and lives - to say nothing of climate. But if birds' beaks can change within 30 years across a few generations, why not humans over the 100-600,000 years since the Pleistocene? Evolutionary psychology persists in misreading Darwin's central project, that was to explain the transmutation of species, and hence change over time. Its followers are preoccupied with stasis. There are, they say, universal mental \"modules\" for cheat detection, recognition and the sexual preferences of older men for younger women and young women for rich old men which persist as adaptations to the Pleistocene ecological niche - their so- called Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation. The fact that even their own texts report contradictory evidence - for example, research indicating that where women have independent access to resources, they no longer go for rich old men - does not dismay them. Here EP is much closer to Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism - the insistence on the natural \"struggle red in tooth and claw\" as providing an explanation of the social hierarchy of the Victorian Empire. Neither Spencer nor the EPers have change over time at the core of their theory. This omission ensures that EP fails to address the important task it sets itself. Take the claims that the expression of the emotions - of anger, happiness or misery - are the same the world over. Darwin's original evidence in his book The Expressions Of The Emotions In Animal And Man was based on his finding that photographs of ham actors expressing these emotions were accurately identified by many people in different countries. EPers build this speculation into a case of biologically fixed human universals. Potential facial manoeuvres are constrained by muscle, bone and nerve. So a smile is a smile is a smile - or is it merely an actor's rictus? What exactly is expressed by those photos in Hello! magazine of society beauties with their fixed smiles showing flawless teeth - but often ice-cold eyes? Genuine happiness? Posing for the photographer? The power of wealth? And what are the many meanings read into those smiles by us, the knowing viewers? These are not innocent expressions of pure biology, but the contruction of meaning out of the complexity of our biosocial existence. How about the poker faces of those who will not smile, or the sycophantic smiles of inferiors at superiors' jokes? And of course social scientists have been telling us for years about smiling as compulsory gender performance - notably by air stewardesses. Bringing gender analyses from the social sciences together with meticulous biological observation and experimentation is mutually enriching. Each discourse challenges and informs the other. As a sociologist and biologist living and working together we have enjoyed many hours of such debate. Yet this truly interdisciplinary research is precisely what EP denies in its insistence on the subordinate and colonised status of the social sciences. Both evolutionary theory and human psychology have been hijacked. Alas, Poor Darwin, the product of discussions between 15 philosophers, cultural critics, social scientists, ethologists and molecular biologists, is a step towards rescuing this interdisciplinary goal from the populist claims of biology as destiny. It will not get an easy ride, for EP is vociferous and well entrenched, and its claims are glib and attractive. Ultimately the only way to drive out bad theory is to replace it with better. This is the task we have set ourselves. \u0095 Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology, ed. Hilary &amp; Steven Rose, is published by Cape.",

Working out the interactions between each of the approximately 50,000 human genes is an unfeasibly large problem.

To make matters worse, almost nothing is known about these biochemical nuances. </p> <p>To sidestep this problem, the researchers asked a simple question: what range of parameter values, real-life or not, creates a pattern that looks plausibly like segmentation? Intuition told them that the segmentation module was a delicate structure, and that each parameter (strength of diffusion, binding, and so on for each protein) would work only within a very narrow range. </p> <p>What they did not expect was that the model would not work at all. </p> <p>Picking themselves up from this setback, they looked critically at the network and found that it was simply not capable of generating segmentation, by virtue of the way it was connected. </p> <p>To make the network function at all, at least two more connections were logically required, representing biological interactions of which experimenters were only dimly aware. (One example was a link in which the protein product of the wingless gene regulated the action of the wingless gene itself, in a feedback loop.) </p> <p>Von Dassow and colleagues added the necessary fudges, and - kerpow! - the network produced segmentation all over the place. Segmentation just fell out of the network, even if parameters were varied over many orders of magnitude. It was as if the network couldn't help itself. Almost irrespective of the behaviour of any one of its members, the network produced segmentation as a consequence of being connected. </p> <p>This result has three implications. The first is predictive power. Looked at positively, the fudge factors that the researchers introduced were necessary to get the network to behave in a realistic, lifelike way. In an important sense, the model predicted the existence of these necessary interactions, in the same way that particle physicists use theory to predict the existence of particles. This will force an entirely new way of thinking in molecular biology. </p> <p>The second is robustness. Almost irrespective of individual parameter values, the module as a whole produced segments. This explains why the segmentation module can be recognised as a distinct and discrete entity in animals as diverse as flies and people, which have otherwise very different developmental \"logic circuits\". </p> <p>The third is emergence. From the raw sequence of wingless, patched and so on, you could never tell that the outcome of their interaction would be a robust module whose almost inevitable product was segmentation. This confirms the Kauffman view of life: that the whole is very much greater than the sum of the parts. </p> <p>The human genome project may seem like a milestone, but it barely counts as the warm-up.

Intuition told them that the segmentation module was a delicate structure, and that each parameter (strength of diffusion, binding, and so on for each protein) would work only within a very narrow range. What they did not expect was that the model would not work at all. Picking themselves up from this setback, they looked critically at the network and found that it was simply not capable of generating segmentation, by virtue of the way it was connected. To make the network function at all, at least two more connections were logically required, representing biological interactions of which experimenters were only dimly aware. (One example was a link in which the protein product of the wingless gene regulated the action of the wingless gene itself, in a feedback loop.) Von Dassow and colleagues added the necessary fudges, and - kerpow! - the network produced segmentation all over the place. Segmentation just fell out of the network, even if parameters were varied over many orders of magnitude. It was as if the network couldn't help itself. Almost irrespective of the behaviour of any one of its members, the network produced segmentation as a consequence of being connected. This result has three implications. The first is predictive power. Looked at positively, the fudge factors that the researchers introduced were necessary to get the network to behave in a realistic, lifelike way. In an important sense, the model predicted the existence of these necessary interactions, in the same way that particle physicists use theory to predict the existence of particles. This will force an entirely new way of thinking in molecular biology. The second is robustness. Almost irrespective of individual parameter values, the module as a whole produced segments. This explains why the segmentation module can be recognised as a distinct and discrete entity in animals as diverse as flies and people, which have otherwise very different developmental \"logic circuits\". The third is emergence. From the raw sequence of wingless, patched and so on, you could never tell that the outcome of their interaction would be a robust module whose almost inevitable product was segmentation. This confirms the Kauffman view of life: that the whole is very much greater than the sum of the parts. The human genome project may seem like a milestone, but it barely counts as the warm-up. Game on. \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature magazine. His book, Deep Time: Cladistics, the Revolution in Evolution, is published by Fourth Estate.",

Their worries echo the dogged criticism of government arts policy from the theatre director Sir Peter Hall, who formed a shadow arts council two years ago to monitor New Labour's \"hollow anti-elitism for the sake of it\". Although this has since petered out, the resentment in some quarters which it represented has not. Only this week there was disquiet about the composition of London mayor Ken Livingstone's new cultural strategy group, which although it contains a magician, had no room for a representative of \"serious music and opera\". The arts minister, Alan Howarth, strongly rejected the claims of philistinism and said both Lessing and Naipaul were confused about the nature of the government's anti-elitism. \"It is surprising that such a distinguished man of letters as VS Naipaul should fall into that trap. This government is unapologetically elitist in the sense of supporting cultural excellence. Equally, we are unapologetically anti-elitist in our commitment to create opportunities, to widen access to the widest range of people to enjoy cultural excellence.\" He claimed there was an \"element of ritual\" in Hall's denunciations. \"We usually get this sometime around the time of the summer solstice.\" He said the arts had got their best-ever funding settlement in the last spending review.",

The drummers stand swinging to their beats, drums slung around their waists. The atmosphere is intoxicating, the sound awesome - and this is only a rehearsal. There's a party spirit that erupts when the judges announce the winner - who sees his victory as an opportunity to sing his song again and again. </p> <p>Santos shrugs and commiserates with Marao.

Hostessing in Japan is an accepted part of the culture. It is a way of life for businessmen, who don't relax in pubs or bars, but go to hostess clubs where they entertain business associates.

      "body": "<p>Uh, oh! Here we go again. One woman in seven has felt suicidal due to the stress of modern life, according to a survey carried out for Good Housekeeping magazine. Two thousand interviewees were found to have poor diets and insufficient time to exercise or visit their GP (which, frankly, doesn't say much for their good housekeeping); 40% of women who stay at home and 46% of women who go out to work said they turned to alcohol and comfort food to help them cope with increasing demands on their time.</p> <p>Add this to other research published recently that suggests three-quarters of women would quit their jobs if they could, mix in the endlessly familiar headlines that tell us so-and-so who runs a major drinks company is going home to spend more time with her family or such-and-such a city trader is leaving her high-profile job, stir in the contention that housework is the new rock'n'roll and the strongest signal of affluence in a family is a mum who's there to bake cakes at teatime, and you could assume that women really can't stand the heat and were far better off in a perfectly formed kitchen, cooking up this month's exciting recipes, all, no doubt, with the GH seal of approval.</p> <p>Why do newspapers and magazines never survey men? When is the last time you saw a sociological or scientific report that bemoans the fact that men eat junk food? But they do. Have a look in your works canteen or glimpse any transport caf\u00e9 and watch them piling on the cholesterol.</p> <p>Where are the headlines that scream anxiety at male smoking and drinking habits? But if you nip down the local of an evening, you'll be hard pressed to so much as see the number of pints consumed through the grey haze of the smoke-filled room. Who is worried that so many of them are overweight? Except, maybe, for the wives and girlfriends who watch them crawl into their cars every morning, doing their best to position the paunch between the seat and steering wheel.</p> <p>Does anybody care that they are too knackered to stagger to the squash court after work in the evening? Do we worry that they can spend two hours a night watching the Simpsons or that the beer-guzzling, doughnut-scoffing Homer has become a male superhero, a model for the energetically challenged?</p> <p>Is there a national outcry because they have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the doctor's surgery, even when faced with incontrovertible evidence of impending cardiac arrest, and why is it not public knowledge that they'd all pack up work tomorrow if they could find some other sucker to pay the bills? We don't know because nobody bothers to ask. Because it's in no one's interests to lay guilt on the male population for wanting to have it all. But women? We've been here once or twice before. We used to call it The Backlash.</p> <p>So what of this suicide question? The claim that an extraordinary one in seven women is so exhausted by her lifestyle, she's thinking of topping herself? Are we such poor little things that we can't hack it? Are hundreds and thousands of us driving ourselves to a self-inflicted early grave? Of course we're not. Sure, we get up in the morning, make big decisions in front of the wardrobe, stuff a bit of toast into anyone who'll have it, school run, work, shopping - and heavens, it's hard to choose between 15 different soap powders and 57 varieties of breakfast cereal.</p> <p>You meet a pal over coffee (or, if the survey is to be believed, several bottles of dry white wine) and she asks: \"How was your day?\"</p> <p>\"God, I'm so depressed, so exhausted, if I don't get a break, I'll kill myself.\"</p> <p>Depression, suicide, they've become the common currency of everyday discourse and, maybe just occasionally, standing in a slow-moving queue at the supermarket with screaming toddlers riffling through the sweet stands, you do feel, for a few ghastly moments, that death would be a welcome release. But you don't mean it.</p> <p>Sarah Kane meant it when, after years of psychiatric treatment for debilitating depression, she finally wrote a chilling play called 4.48 Psychosis - that time of the morning when depression really kicks in and the risk of suicide is greatest. Kane managed to kill herself, even though she was in hospital. The doctor husband of a friend of mine meant it when he injected himself with what he knew would be a lethal cocktail and lay down to die. A young father in Glasgow meant it when, at the weekend, he slashed his own throat, leaving his baby son unharmed. Friends say he was afraid the boy's mother was seeing someone else.</p> <p>The Samaritans published figures in May that showed the suicide rate among young males is five times as high as it is for young females. There is no doubt that the stress of modern life impinges on both sexes. Women can suffer from depression when they're postnatal, when they're menopausal or when, like Kane, they are clinically ill, but it is still relatively rare for us to take the ultimate step. A woman who suffers from MS interviewed last week said that she had thought of suicide but was stopped by the thought of her mother and the intense pain it would cause her. Maybe she gives a clue to the lower figures for females. Maybe women just think more about the devastation they'll create in other people's lives.</p> <p>Those of us who glibly answer with a yes magazine questionnaires that ask whether stress makes us feel suicidal, diminish the anguish of those who have taken their own lives and those who have faced the abyss, but stepped back for the sake of someone close to them. As a cry for a bit of help with the housework, it's totally over the top.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Uh, oh! Here we go again. One woman in seven has felt suicidal due to the stress of modern life, according to a survey carried out for Good Housekeeping magazine. Two thousand interviewees were found to have poor diets and insufficient time to exercise or visit their GP (which, frankly, doesn't say much for their good housekeeping); 40% of women who stay at home and 46% of women who go out to work said they turned to alcohol and comfort food to help them cope with increasing demands on their time. Add this to other research published recently that suggests three-quarters of women would quit their jobs if they could, mix in the endlessly familiar headlines that tell us so-and-so who runs a major drinks company is going home to spend more time with her family or such-and-such a city trader is leaving her high-profile job, stir in the contention that housework is the new rock'n'roll and the strongest signal of affluence in a family is a mum who's there to bake cakes at teatime, and you could assume that women really can't stand the heat and were far better off in a perfectly formed kitchen, cooking up this month's exciting recipes, all, no doubt, with the GH seal of approval. Why do newspapers and magazines never survey men? When is the last time you saw a sociological or scientific report that bemoans the fact that men eat junk food? But they do. Have a look in your works canteen or glimpse any transport caf\u00e9 and watch them piling on the cholesterol. Where are the headlines that scream anxiety at male smoking and drinking habits? But if you nip down the local of an evening, you'll be hard pressed to so much as see the number of pints consumed through the grey haze of the smoke-filled room. Who is worried that so many of them are overweight? Except, maybe, for the wives and girlfriends who watch them crawl into their cars every morning, doing their best to position the paunch between the seat and steering wheel. Does anybody care that they are too knackered to stagger to the squash court after work in the evening? Do we worry that they can spend two hours a night watching the Simpsons or that the beer-guzzling, doughnut-scoffing Homer has become a male superhero, a model for the energetically challenged? Is there a national outcry because they have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the doctor's surgery, even when faced with incontrovertible evidence of impending cardiac arrest, and why is it not public knowledge that they'd all pack up work tomorrow if they could find some other sucker to pay the bills? We don't know because nobody bothers to ask. Because it's in no one's interests to lay guilt on the male population for wanting to have it all. But women? We've been here once or twice before. We used to call it The Backlash. So what of this suicide question? The claim that an extraordinary one in seven women is so exhausted by her lifestyle, she's thinking of topping herself? Are we such poor little things that we can't hack it? Are hundreds and thousands of us driving ourselves to a self-inflicted early grave? Of course we're not. Sure, we get up in the morning, make big decisions in front of the wardrobe, stuff a bit of toast into anyone who'll have it, school run, work, shopping - and heavens, it's hard to choose between 15 different soap powders and 57 varieties of breakfast cereal. You meet a pal over coffee (or, if the survey is to be believed, several bottles of dry white wine) and she asks: \"How was your day?\" \"God, I'm so depressed, so exhausted, if I don't get a break, I'll kill myself.\" Depression, suicide, they've become the common currency of everyday discourse and, maybe just occasionally, standing in a slow-moving queue at the supermarket with screaming toddlers riffling through the sweet stands, you do feel, for a few ghastly moments, that death would be a welcome release. But you don't mean it. Sarah Kane meant it when, after years of psychiatric treatment for debilitating depression, she finally wrote a chilling play called 4.48 Psychosis - that time of the morning when depression really kicks in and the risk of suicide is greatest. Kane managed to kill herself, even though she was in hospital. The doctor husband of a friend of mine meant it when he injected himself with what he knew would be a lethal cocktail and lay down to die. A young father in Glasgow meant it when, at the weekend, he slashed his own throat, leaving his baby son unharmed. Friends say he was afraid the boy's mother was seeing someone else. The Samaritans published figures in May that showed the suicide rate among young males is five times as high as it is for young females. There is no doubt that the stress of modern life impinges on both sexes. Women can suffer from depression when they're postnatal, when they're menopausal or when, like Kane, they are clinically ill, but it is still relatively rare for us to take the ultimate step. A woman who suffers from MS interviewed last week said that she had thought of suicide but was stopped by the thought of her mother and the intense pain it would cause her. Maybe she gives a clue to the lower figures for females. Maybe women just think more about the devastation they'll create in other people's lives. Those of us who glibly answer with a yes magazine questionnaires that ask whether stress makes us feel suicidal, diminish the anguish of those who have taken their own lives and those who have faced the abyss, but stepped back for the sake of someone close to them. As a cry for a bit of help with the housework, it's totally over the top.",

      "body": "<p>Over the past month, persistent speculation about an imminent profit warning has undermined the performance of software accountancy specialist <strong> Sage </strong> . </p> <p>Its shares have underperformed the FTSE All-Share index by 11.9% in that time, on fears that it would follow smaller US rival Great Plains Software and warn that it could not meet its full-year profit forecasts (the consensus is for pre-tax profits of \u00a3109m). </p> <p>However, it seems the fears have been overplayed. After meeting Paul Walker, Sage's chief executive, on Tuesday, analysts at Deutsche Bank reckon that in the short term at least there will be no warning. </p> <p>News of Deutsche's comments helped push Sage's shares up 22p to 553p, even though the broker sounded a note of caution. While pre dicting short-term progress for the stock, Deutsche sees better value in <strong> Misys </strong> , which closed up 25p at 546p. </p> <p>\"This would not be our preferred pick in the sector. We would rather have exposure to Misys,\" the broker said. </p> <p>Leading shares on the whole recorded an impressive performance thanks to a strong <strong> Vodafone AirTouch </strong> (up 8.5p at 312.5p) and weak earnings figures which helped fuel speculation that domestic interest rates might have peaked. The FTSE 100 closed 42.7 points stronger at 6,518.5, with Vodafone - which makes up around 13% of the blue-chip index - delivering 23 points of the upside. </p> <p> <strong> British Telecom</strong> had a tough day. As its chairman was explaining to angry investors the reasons behind the 39% plunge in the company's value this year, its shares fell 18p to 900p. While some blamed the decline on fears that BT will face legal action over delays to the unbundling of the local loop, the real reason was a downgrade from heavyweight broker Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>Ahead of BT's first-quarter results on July 27, Merrill slashed its full-year pre-tax profit forecast by 26% and re duced its price target to \u00a311.50. </p> <p> <strong> HSBC </strong> , up 43p at 848p, was the outstanding feature in the banking sector.

      "bodyText": "Over the past month, persistent speculation about an imminent profit warning has undermined the performance of software accountancy specialist Sage . Its shares have underperformed the FTSE All-Share index by 11.9% in that time, on fears that it would follow smaller US rival Great Plains Software and warn that it could not meet its full-year profit forecasts (the consensus is for pre-tax profits of \u00a3109m). However, it seems the fears have been overplayed. After meeting Paul Walker, Sage's chief executive, on Tuesday, analysts at Deutsche Bank reckon that in the short term at least there will be no warning. News of Deutsche's comments helped push Sage's shares up 22p to 553p, even though the broker sounded a note of caution. While pre dicting short-term progress for the stock, Deutsche sees better value in Misys , which closed up 25p at 546p. \"This would not be our preferred pick in the sector. We would rather have exposure to Misys,\" the broker said. Leading shares on the whole recorded an impressive performance thanks to a strong Vodafone AirTouch (up 8.5p at 312.5p) and weak earnings figures which helped fuel speculation that domestic interest rates might have peaked. The FTSE 100 closed 42.7 points stronger at 6,518.5, with Vodafone - which makes up around 13% of the blue-chip index - delivering 23 points of the upside. British Telecom had a tough day. As its chairman was explaining to angry investors the reasons behind the 39% plunge in the company's value this year, its shares fell 18p to 900p. While some blamed the decline on fears that BT will face legal action over delays to the unbundling of the local loop, the real reason was a downgrade from heavyweight broker Merrill Lynch. Ahead of BT's first-quarter results on July 27, Merrill slashed its full-year pre-tax profit forecast by 26% and re duced its price target to \u00a311.50. HSBC , up 43p at 848p, was the outstanding feature in the banking sector. Analysts at Fox-Pitt Kelton said the rise was related to the closure of its \u00a36.6bn acquisition of French bank CCF yesterday. This forced arbitrageurs to cover their short positions in HSBC by buying more stock. Royal Bank of Scotland advanced a little more than 30p to \u00a310.08 after Goldman Sachs upgraded its stance. Goldman also upgraded Barclays , 19p better at \u00a315.19, but lowered its ratings on Bank of Scotland and Woolwich , which fell 7.5p to 565p and 3.25p to 259.25. Mining stocks were back in fashion, helped by results from US aluminium producer Alcoa. Billiton rose 13.5p to 287p while Lonmin advanced 37p to 795p. ICI was in demand, up 25p to 510p after German rival Bayer posted strong sales figures, and Railtrack firmed 32.5p to \u00a310.88 as Deutsche Bank issued \"strong buy\" advice.

      "body": "<p>Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, yesterday gave his clearest signal to date that he views the sanctions imposed on Austria for allowing the far-right Freedom party to join its coalition government were an error of judgment and should be swiftly lifted.</p> <p>Mr Prodi's comments, which are likely to embarrass hardcore proponents of the sanctions such as France and Belgium, came after the Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, gave a firm pledge that his country would not retaliate by sabotaging EU business out of spite.</p> <p>It was a good day for Mr Sch\u00fcssel, who was on his first visit to the commission's Brussels headquarters since the row erupted in February.</p> <p>The European court of human rights yesterday named a three-man panel to pronounce whether the sanctions should be rescinded or left in place.</p> <p>The so-called \"wise men\" will now produce a report which is seen as a face-saving strategy giving the 14 EU member states a pretext to declare that the measures are no longer needed. Several EU countries, including Italy, Ireland, Finland and Greece, have made it clear behind the scenes that they want the sanctions lifted.</p> <p>The panel, named by the Strasbourg court as the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, the former Spanish foreign minister Marcelino Oreja, and the German lawyer Jochen Frowein, will now begin investigating the way that Austria deals with ethnic minorities, immigrants and refugees. Diplomats said yesterday that most EU governments believe it is only a matter of time before the sanctions are lifted.</p> <p>In his most frank outburst to date Mr Prodi - who was not consulted over the sanctions - made it clear where he stood on the issue.</p> <p>\"I do not think in general that sanctions in such cases give better results than those achieved in a serious in-depth dialogue,\" he stated, adding that he wanted the wise men to finish their report \"as quickly as possible\".</p> <p>In a further sign that he is keen to see the measures annulled, he called on the panel to work through the summer and for the Austrian government to forgo its holidays if it will speed the process up.</p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Sch\u00fcssel was careful to strike a moderate tone and went out of his way to rubbish suggestions from the former Freedom party leader, J\u00f6rg Haider, and members of his own government that Austria will hit back at the EU by holding up enlargement moves and blocking internal reforms.</p> <p>\"The Austrian government was and is very patient and moderate, and words such as threat, veto and blackmail should be deleted from our vocabulary. We're not going to block important processes.\"</p> <p>He argued that Austria in fact supported enlargement and even wanted a date to be named for the first countries to enter the union, something which other member states are loath to do.</p> <p>He admitted, however, that the idea of a panel examining Austrian government policy to ensure it was \"in the European spirit\" was hard to stomach.</p> <p>But Vienna would cooperate with the panel, he stressed, and was hopeful that the sanctions could be lifted by the autumn.</p> <p>In a bizarre riposte reminiscent of the cult 1970s television show The Prisoner, Mr Sch\u00fcssel denied that he was under the influence of Mr Haider. \"I'm not a hostage, I'm a free man. I've come here voluntarily,\" he said.</p> <p>He also mounted a vigorous defence of the way Austria treats its refugees. There was, he claimed, no country which had absorbed more refugees than Austria and only Luxembourg had successfully integrated a higher proportion of foreigners into its society. The only sour note was linked to Austria's move to hold a referendum on the fairness of the sanctions later this year, a development which Mr Prodi openly condemned, and Mr Sch\u00fcssel played down.</p> <p>However, in an interview with German weekly Rheinische Merkur, Mr Sch\u00fcssel suggested that a referendum could be avoided \"very easily\" if the wise men started work immediately.</p> <p>The assumption up to now has been that the sanctions will be lifted in January when Sweden takes over the EU presidency from France. However, the mood in Brussels yesterday suggested a breakthrough may come earlier.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the sanctions are relatively minor and include measures such as bans on cultural and sporting events and secondary military accords, Austria feels humiliated and the row has soured the atmosphere at European Union meetings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, yesterday gave his clearest signal to date that he views the sanctions imposed on Austria for allowing the far-right Freedom party to join its coalition government were an error of judgment and should be swiftly lifted. Mr Prodi's comments, which are likely to embarrass hardcore proponents of the sanctions such as France and Belgium, came after the Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, gave a firm pledge that his country would not retaliate by sabotaging EU business out of spite. It was a good day for Mr Sch\u00fcssel, who was on his first visit to the commission's Brussels headquarters since the row erupted in February. The European court of human rights yesterday named a three-man panel to pronounce whether the sanctions should be rescinded or left in place. The so-called \"wise men\" will now produce a report which is seen as a face-saving strategy giving the 14 EU member states a pretext to declare that the measures are no longer needed. Several EU countries, including Italy, Ireland, Finland and Greece, have made it clear behind the scenes that they want the sanctions lifted. The panel, named by the Strasbourg court as the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, the former Spanish foreign minister Marcelino Oreja, and the German lawyer Jochen Frowein, will now begin investigating the way that Austria deals with ethnic minorities, immigrants and refugees. Diplomats said yesterday that most EU governments believe it is only a matter of time before the sanctions are lifted. In his most frank outburst to date Mr Prodi - who was not consulted over the sanctions - made it clear where he stood on the issue. \"I do not think in general that sanctions in such cases give better results than those achieved in a serious in-depth dialogue,\" he stated, adding that he wanted the wise men to finish their report \"as quickly as possible\". In a further sign that he is keen to see the measures annulled, he called on the panel to work through the summer and for the Austrian government to forgo its holidays if it will speed the process up. Yesterday, Mr Sch\u00fcssel was careful to strike a moderate tone and went out of his way to rubbish suggestions from the former Freedom party leader, J\u00f6rg Haider, and members of his own government that Austria will hit back at the EU by holding up enlargement moves and blocking internal reforms. \"The Austrian government was and is very patient and moderate, and words such as threat, veto and blackmail should be deleted from our vocabulary. We're not going to block important processes.\" He argued that Austria in fact supported enlargement and even wanted a date to be named for the first countries to enter the union, something which other member states are loath to do. He admitted, however, that the idea of a panel examining Austrian government policy to ensure it was \"in the European spirit\" was hard to stomach. But Vienna would cooperate with the panel, he stressed, and was hopeful that the sanctions could be lifted by the autumn. In a bizarre riposte reminiscent of the cult 1970s television show The Prisoner, Mr Sch\u00fcssel denied that he was under the influence of Mr Haider. \"I'm not a hostage, I'm a free man. I've come here voluntarily,\" he said. He also mounted a vigorous defence of the way Austria treats its refugees. There was, he claimed, no country which had absorbed more refugees than Austria and only Luxembourg had successfully integrated a higher proportion of foreigners into its society. The only sour note was linked to Austria's move to hold a referendum on the fairness of the sanctions later this year, a development which Mr Prodi openly condemned, and Mr Sch\u00fcssel played down. However, in an interview with German weekly Rheinische Merkur, Mr Sch\u00fcssel suggested that a referendum could be avoided \"very easily\" if the wise men started work immediately. The assumption up to now has been that the sanctions will be lifted in January when Sweden takes over the EU presidency from France. However, the mood in Brussels yesterday suggested a breakthrough may come earlier. Despite the fact that the sanctions are relatively minor and include measures such as bans on cultural and sporting events and secondary military accords, Austria feels humiliated and the row has soured the atmosphere at European Union meetings.",

      "trailText": "The government is putting liberal values at serious risk as it spends its time trying to assess the public mood",
      "byline": "John Gray",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The government's difficulties over the past few weeks are symptoms of a deepening malaise. It came to power with the project of giving voice to the values of Britain's liberal majority. In office, however, its strategy has been to seek to win favour from what it mistakenly believes is an implacably conservative electorate.</p> <p>The result has been distinctly uninspiring. An undignified scramble to outbid William Hague in populist initiatives has left the government with a reputation for ingrained illiberalism and weakening support among the voters. Its panicky efforts to shore up its radical credentials have only made matters worse. Broadsides against elitism are no substitute for well-focused policies. All they do is reinforce the perception that this is a government that does not know its own mind.</p> <p>There is a contradiction at the heart of the Blair government: on the one hand it aims to heal the split on the centre left that allowed the Tories to be the dominant party for most of the 20th century; on the other it appears to harbour a deep-seated suspicion of liberal values. Tony Blair has argued that Britain's social democratic and liberal traditions have always had much in common. Rightly, the PM has insisted that the future must lie in overcoming their historic division. Yet his government has repeatedly shown a timorous or cavalier disregard for liberal values.</p> <p>Across a wide field, policies have been disappointingly -and, in terms of public opinion, often unnecessarily - illiberal. True, the government has taken a lead in reforming some of the laws which discriminate against gays. But in their treatment of asylum seekers government policies owe more to an opportunistic Tory agenda than to a balanced response to the complex humanitarian and human rights issues that are at stake. Again, the government's largely punitive stance on drug use is out of touch with public attitudes -more so, incredibly, than that which is being advocated in some sections of the right-wing press. And, despite some welcome concessions, its bill to allow monitoring and interception of email traffic has an Orwellian flavour that has attracted criticism from civil liberties groups and from business.</p> <p>All this shows a worrying tendency to pick and mix policies according to the government's assessment - frequently erroneous - of the public mood. The result is not only a continuing leakage of support from Labour's traditional allies in the media and the professions. It is to put at risk the whole future of the government - even, in some measure, that of liberal values in this country.</p> <p>The government's ambivalence about liberal values has enabled William Hague to represent his reactionary prejudices as the beliefs of most voters - and to chip away at Labour's claim to speak for the British majority.</p> <p>The time when the Blair government could claim hegemony - if there ever was one - is over. By itself it cannot hope to achieve the fundamental change it promised the voters in 1997. And on present trends the prospect can no longer be ruled out of Labour returning to office with a majority not much larger than that with which John Major's last government began. In that event, it would probably not be long before the government's control of the political agenda crumbled away entirely.</p> <p>In circumstances like these it is inevitable that the axis of voter support should begin to shift. There are clear signs that this is happening - not in a pendulum swing back to the Tories, but a tilt towards the Liberal Democrats. In a general election the tactical voting that produced their astonishing triumph in Romsey may not be widely repeated. Even so, over the coming years, Charles Kennedy seems set to become the pivotal figure in British politics.

      "bodyText": "The government's difficulties over the past few weeks are symptoms of a deepening malaise. It came to power with the project of giving voice to the values of Britain's liberal majority. In office, however, its strategy has been to seek to win favour from what it mistakenly believes is an implacably conservative electorate. The result has been distinctly uninspiring. An undignified scramble to outbid William Hague in populist initiatives has left the government with a reputation for ingrained illiberalism and weakening support among the voters. Its panicky efforts to shore up its radical credentials have only made matters worse. Broadsides against elitism are no substitute for well-focused policies. All they do is reinforce the perception that this is a government that does not know its own mind. There is a contradiction at the heart of the Blair government: on the one hand it aims to heal the split on the centre left that allowed the Tories to be the dominant party for most of the 20th century; on the other it appears to harbour a deep-seated suspicion of liberal values. Tony Blair has argued that Britain's social democratic and liberal traditions have always had much in common. Rightly, the PM has insisted that the future must lie in overcoming their historic division. Yet his government has repeatedly shown a timorous or cavalier disregard for liberal values. Across a wide field, policies have been disappointingly -and, in terms of public opinion, often unnecessarily - illiberal. True, the government has taken a lead in reforming some of the laws which discriminate against gays. But in their treatment of asylum seekers government policies owe more to an opportunistic Tory agenda than to a balanced response to the complex humanitarian and human rights issues that are at stake. Again, the government's largely punitive stance on drug use is out of touch with public attitudes -more so, incredibly, than that which is being advocated in some sections of the right-wing press. And, despite some welcome concessions, its bill to allow monitoring and interception of email traffic has an Orwellian flavour that has attracted criticism from civil liberties groups and from business. All this shows a worrying tendency to pick and mix policies according to the government's assessment - frequently erroneous - of the public mood. The result is not only a continuing leakage of support from Labour's traditional allies in the media and the professions. It is to put at risk the whole future of the government - even, in some measure, that of liberal values in this country. The government's ambivalence about liberal values has enabled William Hague to represent his reactionary prejudices as the beliefs of most voters - and to chip away at Labour's claim to speak for the British majority. The time when the Blair government could claim hegemony - if there ever was one - is over. By itself it cannot hope to achieve the fundamental change it promised the voters in 1997. And on present trends the prospect can no longer be ruled out of Labour returning to office with a majority not much larger than that with which John Major's last government began. In that event, it would probably not be long before the government's control of the political agenda crumbled away entirely. In circumstances like these it is inevitable that the axis of voter support should begin to shift. There are clear signs that this is happening - not in a pendulum swing back to the Tories, but a tilt towards the Liberal Democrats. In a general election the tactical voting that produced their astonishing triumph in Romsey may not be widely repeated. Even so, over the coming years, Charles Kennedy seems set to become the pivotal figure in British politics. In his low-key, understated way, the Liberal Democrat leader has carved out a highly distinctive position for his party. Where the government has wavered on issues such as civil liberties, the Liberal Democrats have been consistently principled. Perhaps only fleetingly, the circumstances are right for a historic realignment on the left. But it cannot last without a change in the voting system for the Commons. Unfortunately it is precisely on this point that cooperation threatens to come unstuck. If, for many in Labour first-past-the-post is the ark of the covenant, the same is true of PR for many Liberal Democrats. Both groups regard AV - the Australian alternative vote system whereby voters rank candidates in order of preference - as a shabby compromise which is unworthy of serious consideration. In fact, it is AV that is most likely to give voice to Britain's liberal majority. Contrary to some claims, AV does not permanently disadvantage the Tories. What it does do is empower the centre. On reasonable assumptions, AV will enfranchise the Liberal Democrats very substantially.

Either Hague will start to sing from a different hymn sheet, or he will soon be replaced by someone who will. Under AV, only a centrist Tory party has a future. Ending the split on the left was at the core of the project with which the government came to power. It remains so today. That requires closer cooperation between Labour and the Liberal Democrats - including, crucially, a workable agreement on electoral reform - and a much firmer commitment to liberal values on the part of the government.

      "bodyText": "A record rise in the number of complaints - 36% in one year - have been made to Elizabeth France, the data protection registrar, over the misuse of personal files held on computers, the agency revealed yesterday. The 4,570 complaints is the largest number made to the agency. As a result it has overburdened agency staff who say they are facing \"substantial backlogs\" in handling them. The surge has led to 587 visits by compliance staff to companies to check files for criminal offences. Another 11 search warrants were obtained to raid businesses run by private investigators who were illegally obtaining confidential information on people. Some 145 cases went to court, with 130 businesses and organisations found guilty of illegally using or procuring the information. Successful prosecutions detailed in the annual report include the Rugby Football Union, fined \u00a31,500, R and B Consultancy Services in Swaffham, Norfolk, which was fined \u00a34,000 for two offences, and Apex Computer Recruitment of Kingston, Surrey, which was fined \u00a33,000. Many of the cases involve misusing personal information for direct marketing or misusing consumer credit information held on computers. In the report, Ms France warns the home secretary, Jack Straw, against overweening powers to obtain details of people's emails and to force internet providers to hand over encryption codes to fight cybercrime. Mr Straw's plans would only be acceptable \"provided that strict conditions were laid down in a national law in which an order or notice could be issued,\" she says. As regards emails she calls for an amendment to the regulation of investigatory powers bill - now being challenged in the Lords - saying that interception must take place only after a judge or independent authority has ruled that there are grounds for doing so. Ms France also says that membership organisations should make it clear to members how widely their details will be made available and for what purposes.\"",

One of the most monolithic of one-party states in Africa has been weakened by charges of corruption in the oil and diamond industries and by its failure to confront its humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>Previously, decades of threat from Unita, backed by the US and apartheid South Africa, meant the ruling MPLA was unchallenged.</p> <p>But corruption was not an issue there until the latest phase of the war, according to Shawn McCormick, senior policy adviser to BP Amoco, which was the only oil company to throw open its books to an Angolan government monitoring team, according to the IMF.</p> <p>Well before last year's Global Witness report on Angolan oil sales revealed claims of high-level corruption or allegations of kickbacks from the French oil company Elf circulated, groups began campaigning for an anti-corruption candidate to stand against President Eduardo Dos Santos.</p> <p>At a conference sponsored by TI in London this week some of the most egregious cases of corruption were discussed in detail, notably the Lesotho Highland Water Development Project.</p> <p>Currently, 19 corporations and individuals are being prosecuted in the Lesotho courts, accused of bribing an official. Five British companies are involved and the accusation is that \u00a32m was paid in bribes.</p> <p>Dr John Makumbe, from TI's chapter in Zimbabwe, said: \"We have daily corruption, in schools, hospitals, prisons, the private sector, and the public sector, including the army, but our law actually says that nothing can be investigated in the president's office, the army or the police.\"</p> <p>However, he pointed out that most corruption is imported - \"60% imported in our case\".</p> <p>TI's chairman, Laurence Cockcroft, told the conference: \"There is no doubt about the urgency for these countries of rolling back corruption, and the UK has a critical responsibility both to support the efforts of weaker governments _ and to ensure that anti-bribery legislation is brought in in this country to act against companies such as those involved in the Lesotho project.\"</p> <p>\"The fight against corruption is essential for prosperity,\" said Michael Spicer, the executive vice-president of Anglo-American, who is also deputy chairman of South Africa's Business Against Crime agency.</p> <p>\"There's been a lot of concentration on diamonds as a potential resource for corruption, and for wars, but in fact the oil industry brings the largest scale of corruption in Africa - though with the very honorable exception of Global Witness no one has tried to expose it,\" he added.</p> <p>\"The arms trade is similarly key, but European governments turn a blind eye.\"</p>",

The region is prey to drug and crime syndicates and a cynical political class which has come to accept corruption as normal, according to many influential Africans. But suddenly the questions of corruption being raised by many groups in civil society, backed by these outsiders, have become a key part of the motor for change. In Angola, a political sea change has begun. One of the most monolithic of one-party states in Africa has been weakened by charges of corruption in the oil and diamond industries and by its failure to confront its humanitarian crisis. Previously, decades of threat from Unita, backed by the US and apartheid South Africa, meant the ruling MPLA was unchallenged. But corruption was not an issue there until the latest phase of the war, according to Shawn McCormick, senior policy adviser to BP Amoco, which was the only oil company to throw open its books to an Angolan government monitoring team, according to the IMF. Well before last year's Global Witness report on Angolan oil sales revealed claims of high-level corruption or allegations of kickbacks from the French oil company Elf circulated, groups began campaigning for an anti-corruption candidate to stand against President Eduardo Dos Santos. At a conference sponsored by TI in London this week some of the most egregious cases of corruption were discussed in detail, notably the Lesotho Highland Water Development Project. Currently, 19 corporations and individuals are being prosecuted in the Lesotho courts, accused of bribing an official. Five British companies are involved and the accusation is that \u00a32m was paid in bribes. Dr John Makumbe, from TI's chapter in Zimbabwe, said: \"We have daily corruption, in schools, hospitals, prisons, the private sector, and the public sector, including the army, but our law actually says that nothing can be investigated in the president's office, the army or the police.\" However, he pointed out that most corruption is imported - \"60% imported in our case\". TI's chairman, Laurence Cockcroft, told the conference: \"There is no doubt about the urgency for these countries of rolling back corruption, and the UK has a critical responsibility both to support the efforts of weaker governments _ and to ensure that anti-bribery legislation is brought in in this country to act against companies such as those involved in the Lesotho project.\" \"The fight against corruption is essential for prosperity,\" said Michael Spicer, the executive vice-president of Anglo-American, who is also deputy chairman of South Africa's Business Against Crime agency. \"There's been a lot of concentration on diamonds as a potential resource for corruption, and for wars, but in fact the oil industry brings the largest scale of corruption in Africa - though with the very honorable exception of Global Witness no one has tried to expose it,\" he added. \"The arms trade is similarly key, but European governments turn a blind eye.\"",

If you're in New York tomorrow, McKinstry is talking about his forthcoming book, Hacking Consciousness, at the H2K hackers convention. If not, try the site: www.mindpixel.com. It's a secret AT&amp;T researchers have announced Publius, a system that will protect free speech by dispersing encrypted files across the internet and making their authors untraceable. The only limitation on the free service is on the size of a file that can be distributed, which must be less than 100KB. Publius will start a two-month public trial on July 28. See www.cs.nyu.edu/waldman/publius. Digicult Cultivate Interactive, a quarterly pan-European webzine funded by the European Commission, has just gone online at www.cultivate-int.org. Aimed at the Digital Heritage and Cultural Content communities in the EC Fifth Framework Programme, it carries information about Digicult projects. The webzine is produced by the UKOLN group at the University of Bath. UKOLN also runs the EC's Exploit Interactive webzine, which disseminates information about Telematics for Libraries projects. Lofty ambition E-Loft also has a pan-European target: 14 million students. The result of a merger between Germany's Campus2day AG and SOS Student from the UK, the site is being tested in five national versions. The company says it is opening \"large loft-like spaces\" in London, Paris, Milan, Rome, Madrid and Berlin, \"where students can participate and shape the portal's future\". See www.uk.e-loft.com. God book The Goettingen Gutenberg Bible is online in a facsimile version digitised by the Goettingen State and University Library, and also published on CD-rom. The bible is one of only four complete illuminated copies on vellum.

The software was developed at Brown University and MIT, based on the WordNet lexicon developed by researchers at Princeton University. Just Harry The official Harry Potter site wasn't exactly magic when it first featured in Webwatch. However, the arrival last week of the latest in the series was celebrated with a makeover that is almost in the Better Homes class, without Carol Vorderman. Shame about the domain name, www.Bloomsbury.com/harrypotter Stop it Adfilter claims to be \"the most intelligent internet filter available\" and will speed up your web surfing by blocking unwanted ads.

Soundalikes The new Triplehom website provides a list of triple homonyms, from air/ere/heir to ware/wear/where, with pop-up definitions for more obscure words. The homonyms are based on \"standard American\" pronunciation, but that does not detract too much from an entertaining web page. Quids in PriceChallenge aims to show the cheapest UK prices for products sold online and in the shops, though the lowest prices may well be for less desirable brands.

The makers might have taken their design cues from Fisher-Price, but this Psion style handheld PC is so tough it's more than a match for any sand, sea or lager that comes its way. The downside is that it runs Microsoft's clunky Windows CE and its slightly rickety versions of Word and Excel. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Ericsson R310 mobile phone</strong> \u00a3120 </p> <p>So Ericsson's allegedly indestructible R250 PRO mobile phone wasn't tough enough for you. The company now has a new model, the R310, which is also water, shock and dust resistant, yet is significantly smaller and boasts extra facilities like voice control and data/fax capabilities. Outdoor types should also note that it comes with a free adventure kit that includes a thermometer, magnifying glass and a compass. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Samsung Vivace</strong> \u00a3TBA </p> <p>Samsung is billing the Vivace as the first splashproof MP3 player. Whether this pendant style model will deliver Handel's Water Music during a dip in the hotel swimming pool is a moot point, but it will be fun to try. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Aquapac PP10</strong> \u00a317 </p> <p>Palm owners who have been separated from their favourite personal organiser often describe the experience in terms of losing a limb. So they probably already own the Aquapac PP10 waterproof Palm casing, which should ensure that not even the beach and the swimming pool can come between them and their beloved PDA.

The PlayStation sized box teams up a CD player with a 7GBhard disk storage system. The upshot is that it allows you to store up to 150 of your favourite albums in CD-ish quality. For an extra \u00a380 you can also secure the Soul Mate - a small MP3 player that slots into the Music Store for almost instant downloads. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Canon Ixus X-1</strong> \u00a3130 </p> <p>There's no point in swimming with sharks off some idyllic island in the Indian Ocean if you can't prove to the folks back home that you've been hanging out with relatives of Jaws. So don't forget to pack the Canon Ixus X-1, one of the smallest and cheapest waterproof cameras on sale. It should guarantee some great shots of those fearsome-looking fangs. The X-1 uses the APS system, so you can even exaggerate the size of the molars by plumping for panoramic style prints. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Personal Mosquito Control Force Field</strong> \u00a312 </p> <p>If those pesky mosquitoes are threatening to ruin your exotic holiday then you need to imitate their arch-enemy the dragonfly. This entails either frantically waving your arms and emitting strange humming noises or, much better, investing in this little wearable gadget. It uses ultrasonic and sonic technologies to recreate the sound of a dragonfly's wings, sending the mozzies diving for cover. Playing Boyzone CDs may have a similar effect. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Wharfedale LoudMan</strong> \u00a330 </p> <p>It might be a dead ringer for a CD jewel case, but the Wharfedale LoudMan is actually a really neat little speaker system. You connect it to your personal stereo, flip it open and there you go - an instant stereo hi-fi system. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Teksta</strong> \u00a350 </p> <p>Don't worry if you haven't yet sorted out a pet's passport for Rover. You can assuage the guilt caused by consigning your canine chum to the kennels for a week by taking robot dog Teksta with you on your hols. The hi-tech hound can perform almost all the tricks your real-life mutt can - it sings, dances and even breaks wind. However, Teksta doesn't require any Pedigree Chum and is sure to raise a smile on the face of even the grumpiest customs officer. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Sony SRF-M75</strong> \u00a350 </p> <p>The toughest radio in town, this bright yellow Sony tranny is splash proof, dust proof and could quite possibly last more than 40 seconds with Mike Tyson.

      "body": "<p>Louis Olivier Bancoult was four when he left his homeland, a palm-covered island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. He was exiled with the rest of the population of the Chagos archipelago, one of Britain's last colonial outposts. Dumped 1,900km away in Mauritius, Bancoult and his compatriots were left in abject poverty, without shelter, food or jobs. And they have been there now for more than 30 years, largely forgotten.</p> <p>However, the story of the Chagos islands has finally returned to haunt the British government. In the ramshackle district of Cassis, 10 minutes from the polished modern buildings of the Mauritian capital, Port Louis, a historic legal challenge is being mounted. Here the jobless shelter from the heat under a tree or sprawl on the pavement drinking beer. Bancoult's own home is down a dirt path past corrugated shacks that overspill with children. Out in the backyard Creole-speaking Chagossians (known as the Ilois) are in discussion.</p> <p>Last year Bancoult, the community leader, was given leave to contest the ban that prevents his people from setting foot in the place they refer to as \"the motherland\". A judicial review is scheduled for July 17 at London's High Court, and the Ilois are gearing themselves up for the next stage in their battle to go home.</p> <p>Many of the Ilois are elderly now, but they recall the circumstances of their expulsion. With Mauritius, the Chagos islands formed part of a British colony, but in the 60s, when Mauritius was negotiating independence, Britain struck a deal.

      "bodyText": "Louis Olivier Bancoult was four when he left his homeland, a palm-covered island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. He was exiled with the rest of the population of the Chagos archipelago, one of Britain's last colonial outposts. Dumped 1,900km away in Mauritius, Bancoult and his compatriots were left in abject poverty, without shelter, food or jobs. And they have been there now for more than 30 years, largely forgotten. However, the story of the Chagos islands has finally returned to haunt the British government. In the ramshackle district of Cassis, 10 minutes from the polished modern buildings of the Mauritian capital, Port Louis, a historic legal challenge is being mounted. Here the jobless shelter from the heat under a tree or sprawl on the pavement drinking beer. Bancoult's own home is down a dirt path past corrugated shacks that overspill with children. Out in the backyard Creole-speaking Chagossians (known as the Ilois) are in discussion. Last year Bancoult, the community leader, was given leave to contest the ban that prevents his people from setting foot in the place they refer to as \"the motherland\". A judicial review is scheduled for July 17 at London's High Court, and the Ilois are gearing themselves up for the next stage in their battle to go home. Many of the Ilois are elderly now, but they recall the circumstances of their expulsion. With Mauritius, the Chagos islands formed part of a British colony, but in the 60s, when Mauritius was negotiating independence, Britain struck a deal. Mauritius became independent in 1968 with $4.5m in compensation, while Britain kept sovereignty of the archipelago. On a map of the Indian Ocean, the Chagos islands look like a cluster of dots, but their location, between the east coast of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, gave them enormous strategic significance.

      "body": "<p> Why not make computer power a utility, just like water, electricity and gas? Users should simply be able to plug their chosen hardware in to a wall socket to get applications \"on tap\", without having to worry about installing software or backing up their data. </p> <p>Everything could be taken care of by an application service provider (ASP) on a pay-by-use system, or for a fixed monthly rental fee. </p> <p>It is a seductive dream, and one that, thanks to the internet, could become a reality. But it is not yet, as anyone who has spent an hour trying to get email on Hotmail or Excite will testify. </p> <p>The \"apps on tap\" idea is, however, luring thousands of companies into investing billions of dollars in software and infrastructure. Read the hype they put out, and practically every technology supplier is involved. The pack includes phone companies such as AT&amp;T and Nortel, computer companies such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Sun, software suppliers such as IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, software services giants such as EDS and IBM, and dozens of start-up companies. </p> <p>But the firms that are leading the way are the ones whose businesses are already based on the web. Some are ISPs (internet service providers) who see net access turning into a low-value commodity market. They want to become more profitable ASPs. Others are website operators who want to offer extra fea tures to keep users on their sites. If ISPs are already hosting email and e-commerce applications on their servers, it's easy to think about hosting other applications, such as word processing and payroll. </p> <p>Meanwhile, website operators are expanding by adding new applications such as web-based email, calendars, address books, instant messaging, chat rooms, auctions and games. Netscape was the first company to make a play for this market when it upgraded its Netcenter portal in 1998. However, the major players now are <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo!</a> and Microsoft, with its <a href=\"http://www.msn.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Microsoft Network</a>, <a href=\"HTTP://www.hotmail.com\" target=\"_new\">Hotmail</a> and <a href=\"http://bcentral.com\" target=\"_new\">bCentral</a> sites. </p> <p>Last month Yahoo! announced its move into the corporate ASP market based on deals with leading suppliers of enabling software, Citrix and Tibco, and its first independent customer, the state of North Carolina. <a href=\"http://corporate.yahoo.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Corporate Yahoo!</a> enables companies to integrate Yahoo's services with their own applications on in-house intranets. </p> <p>But Microsoft made a bigger splash with the launch of its <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/net/\">Microsoft.net (.net)</a> on June 22. Bill Gates, chief software architect, and Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer, committed the company to supplying software online. Gates said .net would support many different devices, including mobile phones, \"tablet\" computers and TV sets, as well as PCs: the base level for access would be an HTML 3.2 browser. But naturally you will get a \"far richer [experience] if you have a device that actually has the .net code down on it\" - such as the forthcoming Windows.net operating system. </p> <p>Later, Ballmer spelled it out: \"We're open,\" he said. \"We'll talk to people about making .net run on devices that aren't PCs that don't run Windows.\" </p> <p>Microsoft's new system is intended to be a platform for the whole industry, and is based on open standards, mainly the World Wide Web Consortium's XML (extensible markup language). Microsoft will sell programming tools such as Visual Studio.net and BizTalk, and offer software and services online, but so can anybody else. Ballmer said: \"So what is the .net bet? First, we're betting on our selves to do something well. Second, we're betting on the transformation of the software industry...\" </p> <p>The bet is that the industry will move from shipping programs in boxes to selling services online on a rental basis. Users will not have to worry about what goes on in what Gates called \"the cloud\" - the network infrastructure - they'll just plug into it. Gates's theme was endorsed by a .net supporter, Marc Andreessen. The co-founder of Netscape and former AOL technical guru is now chairman of Loudcloud, a start-up company with an ASP hosting service called Smart Cloud. </p> <p>Although the .net strategy represents a dramatic change in direction, it is one that Microsoft has been preparing for some time. For example, Windows users have long been able to go to the Microsoft website to update their operating system, and this could be done automatically, in the background. Microsoft has also been offering Microsoft Office and MS Exchange, its mail server, online. </p> <p>Software suppliers love this idea. At the moment, PC users can buy a program for a one-off payment and use it for as long as they like. Software houses usually have to offer noticeable improvements to get them to pay for an upgrade. Under a rental system, users pay a monthly fee for ever, or they lose the use of the application - and, perhaps, access to their data. And the longer they use a program, the greater the profits that flow to the software provider and to the ASP. </p> <p>Sean O'Reilly, vice-president of marketing for NetStore, which claims its 16,000 users make it Europe's leading ASP, says: \"It's quite a serious adjustment for software houses to move to a recurring revenue model, but they'll find it adds significantly to the valuation of their companies.\" In other words, the City doesn't like companies with lumpy revenues that depend on when they launch new programs, but it loves ones with regular, guaranteed income streams. </p> <p>The idea is also attractive to ASPs such as NetStore, who buy and run the hardware to host applications. Individuals and companies have to buy enough computer power to cope with peak demand, which may be brief, so most of the time it's not used. ASPs save money when lots of users share the same hardware - just as long as they don't all use it at once. </p> <p>O'Reilly says it sounds like splitting hairs, but it's important to distinguish between ASPs and companies that offer applications over the web. \"The idea that someone can simply supply an application is na\u00efve and dangerous,\" he says. \"If you're providing a service, you can't leave users high and dry when things go wrong; people want support.\" </p> <p>Users who take the ASP route need to know that their applications will always be available and will work at a usable speed, which means signing a service level agreement (SLA). Whether SLAs can easily be enforced is another matter, because of the problems of jurisdiction. As Francis Gurry, assistant director general of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo), says: \"The market is global, the technology is global, but legal systems are national.\" </p> <p> So Wipo is now working with Aspic, the <a href=\"http://www.aspindustry.org\">ASP Industry Consortium</a>, to \"establish a globally recognised dispute avoidance and settlement mechanism specifically tailored to meet the needs of the ASP industry\", according to Aspic's chairman, Traver Gruen-Kennedy. Aspic - which was formed a year ago and now has more than 500 members - is also promoting \"best practices\" in the new industry. In May, it launched the ASPire Awards to \"discover, document and highlight\" them. </p> <p>Gruen-Kennedy is, as would be expected, enthusiastic about the ASP business. \"This is simply a great idea whose time has come,\" he says. \"Users are not only hungry, they are starving for information about what ASPs are offering.\" </p> <p>Certainly US analysts are predicting rapid adoption. Late last month, for example, the Giga Information Group said it expected the application server market to grow from $585m in 1999 to $1.64bn this year and $9bn by 2003, although International Data Corporation (IDC) was more conservative, predicting ASP revenues would grow from $296m last year to $7.8bn by 2004. It's a lot of money, but because ASP definitions are loose and variable, it's not clear how much of it is new money. </p> <p>Although the ASP industry is pushing a trendy new idea, it's not much different from some boring old ideas such as \"time sharing\" - a staple of the early computer industry - bureau services and \"out-sourcing\", which have been popular for decades. Companies have always paid other people to take in their dirty washing, or their dirty data processing. </p> <p>Also, it's not clear how much ASP services will cost, and thus how wide a market they will reach. Global Managed Solutions Ltd, based in London, offers a fixed-price ASP service designed for small businesses, for \u00a3120 per month per PC. <a href=\"http://www.showmefreedom.com\">Freedom</a> provides a wide range of services including Microsoft Office 2000, unlimited high-speed net access (without call charges), email, desktop faxing, virus scanning, data backups, disaster recovery and a help desk 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. </p> <p>Paul Perry, president of GMS, says this is much cheaper than the typical cost of running a PC - \u00a39,000 over three years, according to Gartner Group figures. But it's not likely to appeal to web users who pay \u00a3600 for a PC and expect applications and services to be free. </p> <p>Finally, it's clear even from today's web-hosted applications and ISP services that the brave new world of Freedom-style computing simply isn't viable with dial-up modems and telephone call charges. It works only with permanent and reliable broadband connections where users don't have to wait for several minutes while their applications and data dribble down from the net, when they could be loaded in seconds from a PC's hard drive. </p> <p>And for most people, affordable and reliable broadband internet access is still years away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why not make computer power a utility, just like water, electricity and gas? Users should simply be able to plug their chosen hardware in to a wall socket to get applications \"on tap\", without having to worry about installing software or backing up their data. Everything could be taken care of by an application service provider (ASP) on a pay-by-use system, or for a fixed monthly rental fee. It is a seductive dream, and one that, thanks to the internet, could become a reality. But it is not yet, as anyone who has spent an hour trying to get email on Hotmail or Excite will testify. The \"apps on tap\" idea is, however, luring thousands of companies into investing billions of dollars in software and infrastructure. Read the hype they put out, and practically every technology supplier is involved. The pack includes phone companies such as AT&amp;T and Nortel, computer companies such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Sun, software suppliers such as IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, software services giants such as EDS and IBM, and dozens of start-up companies. But the firms that are leading the way are the ones whose businesses are already based on the web. Some are ISPs (internet service providers) who see net access turning into a low-value commodity market. They want to become more profitable ASPs. Others are website operators who want to offer extra fea tures to keep users on their sites. If ISPs are already hosting email and e-commerce applications on their servers, it's easy to think about hosting other applications, such as word processing and payroll. Meanwhile, website operators are expanding by adding new applications such as web-based email, calendars, address books, instant messaging, chat rooms, auctions and games. Netscape was the first company to make a play for this market when it upgraded its Netcenter portal in 1998. However, the major players now are Yahoo! and Microsoft, with its Microsoft Network, Hotmail and bCentral sites. Last month Yahoo! announced its move into the corporate ASP market based on deals with leading suppliers of enabling software, Citrix and Tibco, and its first independent customer, the state of North Carolina. Corporate Yahoo! enables companies to integrate Yahoo's services with their own applications on in-house intranets. But Microsoft made a bigger splash with the launch of its Microsoft.net (.net) on June 22. Bill Gates, chief software architect, and Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer, committed the company to supplying software online. Gates said .net would support many different devices, including mobile phones, \"tablet\" computers and TV sets, as well as PCs: the base level for access would be an HTML 3.2 browser. But naturally you will get a \"far richer [experience] if you have a device that actually has the .net code down on it\" - such as the forthcoming Windows.net operating system. Later, Ballmer spelled it out: \"We're open,\" he said. \"We'll talk to people about making .net run on devices that aren't PCs that don't run Windows.\" Microsoft's new system is intended to be a platform for the whole industry, and is based on open standards, mainly the World Wide Web Consortium's XML (extensible markup language). Microsoft will sell programming tools such as Visual Studio.net and BizTalk, and offer software and services online, but so can anybody else. Ballmer said: \"So what is the .net bet? First, we're betting on our selves to do something well. Second, we're betting on the transformation of the software industry...\" The bet is that the industry will move from shipping programs in boxes to selling services online on a rental basis. Users will not have to worry about what goes on in what Gates called \"the cloud\" - the network infrastructure - they'll just plug into it. Gates's theme was endorsed by a .net supporter, Marc Andreessen. The co-founder of Netscape and former AOL technical guru is now chairman of Loudcloud, a start-up company with an ASP hosting service called Smart Cloud. Although the .net strategy represents a dramatic change in direction, it is one that Microsoft has been preparing for some time. For example, Windows users have long been able to go to the Microsoft website to update their operating system, and this could be done automatically, in the background. Microsoft has also been offering Microsoft Office and MS Exchange, its mail server, online. Software suppliers love this idea. At the moment, PC users can buy a program for a one-off payment and use it for as long as they like. Software houses usually have to offer noticeable improvements to get them to pay for an upgrade. Under a rental system, users pay a monthly fee for ever, or they lose the use of the application - and, perhaps, access to their data. And the longer they use a program, the greater the profits that flow to the software provider and to the ASP. Sean O'Reilly, vice-president of marketing for NetStore, which claims its 16,000 users make it Europe's leading ASP, says: \"It's quite a serious adjustment for software houses to move to a recurring revenue model, but they'll find it adds significantly to the valuation of their companies.\" In other words, the City doesn't like companies with lumpy revenues that depend on when they launch new programs, but it loves ones with regular, guaranteed income streams. The idea is also attractive to ASPs such as NetStore, who buy and run the hardware to host applications. Individuals and companies have to buy enough computer power to cope with peak demand, which may be brief, so most of the time it's not used. ASPs save money when lots of users share the same hardware - just as long as they don't all use it at once. O'Reilly says it sounds like splitting hairs, but it's important to distinguish between ASPs and companies that offer applications over the web. \"The idea that someone can simply supply an application is na\u00efve and dangerous,\" he says. \"If you're providing a service, you can't leave users high and dry when things go wrong; people want support.\" Users who take the ASP route need to know that their applications will always be available and will work at a usable speed, which means signing a service level agreement (SLA). Whether SLAs can easily be enforced is another matter, because of the problems of jurisdiction. As Francis Gurry, assistant director general of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo), says: \"The market is global, the technology is global, but legal systems are national.\" So Wipo is now working with Aspic, the ASP Industry Consortium, to \"establish a globally recognised dispute avoidance and settlement mechanism specifically tailored to meet the needs of the ASP industry\", according to Aspic's chairman, Traver Gruen-Kennedy. Aspic - which was formed a year ago and now has more than 500 members - is also promoting \"best practices\" in the new industry. In May, it launched the ASPire Awards to \"discover, document and highlight\" them. Gruen-Kennedy is, as would be expected, enthusiastic about the ASP business. \"This is simply a great idea whose time has come,\" he says. \"Users are not only hungry, they are starving for information about what ASPs are offering.\" Certainly US analysts are predicting rapid adoption. Late last month, for example, the Giga Information Group said it expected the application server market to grow from $585m in 1999 to $1.64bn this year and $9bn by 2003, although International Data Corporation (IDC) was more conservative, predicting ASP revenues would grow from $296m last year to $7.8bn by 2004. It's a lot of money, but because ASP definitions are loose and variable, it's not clear how much of it is new money. Although the ASP industry is pushing a trendy new idea, it's not much different from some boring old ideas such as \"time sharing\" - a staple of the early computer industry - bureau services and \"out-sourcing\", which have been popular for decades. Companies have always paid other people to take in their dirty washing, or their dirty data processing. Also, it's not clear how much ASP services will cost, and thus how wide a market they will reach. Global Managed Solutions Ltd, based in London, offers a fixed-price ASP service designed for small businesses, for \u00a3120 per month per PC. Freedom provides a wide range of services including Microsoft Office 2000, unlimited high-speed net access (without call charges), email, desktop faxing, virus scanning, data backups, disaster recovery and a help desk 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Paul Perry, president of GMS, says this is much cheaper than the typical cost of running a PC - \u00a39,000 over three years, according to Gartner Group figures. But it's not likely to appeal to web users who pay \u00a3600 for a PC and expect applications and services to be free. Finally, it's clear even from today's web-hosted applications and ISP services that the brave new world of Freedom-style computing simply isn't viable with dial-up modems and telephone call charges. It works only with permanent and reliable broadband connections where users don't have to wait for several minutes while their applications and data dribble down from the net, when they could be loaded in seconds from a PC's hard drive. And for most people, affordable and reliable broadband internet access is still years away.",
