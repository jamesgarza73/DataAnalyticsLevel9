The new Virt-X, which is expected to boost Tradepoint by bringing in the new Swiss trading system and the investors who trade through the Swiss exchange, is expected to be ready for trading early next year and may beat its rivals off the starting blocks. Mr Kilsby, who said Tradepoint had a record day yesterday surpassing its previous record of \u00a372m worth of trade in a day, said he felt sympathy for the executives trying to push through the German and London alliance, which is expected to cost its members \u00a375m to implement. The London stock exchange refused to comment on Virt-X yesterday. One market expert commented though that one concern inside the exchange might be that Virt-X, or even Tradepoint, will start to grab market share in the way that the German futures exchange stole business from under the nose of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange last year. Mr Kilsby cited figures yesterday which showed that for two hours on the first day of its \"pan-European\" market, 53,000 Deutsche Telekom shares had traded through Tradepoint at the same time that 59,000 had traded in Frankfurt. \"That's more than reasonable,\" he said. Already overcoming some of the problems faced by the London-Frankfurt alliance, Virt-X will be regulated from London by the financial services authority and integrate not only its trading systems but its settlement and clearing systems for shares too.",

He has done a computer course; during association time his cell is always full of fellow inmates in need of advice, but his overwhelming feeling is one of apathy. </p> <p>Tomorrow, their case comes before the lord chief justice and two other judges in the court of appeal. Wyner and Brock are seeking leave to appeal against conviction. They've been told to take all their clothes with them to court, but they are not reading anything into that. They feel their world has turned into a Kafkaesque nightmare in which anything can happen. </p> <p>Wyner and Brock were arrested after police mounted a surveillance operation at the shelter, which crouches next to the River Cam across the meadow from Jesus College in a smart part of Cambridge. A spy camera, which collected 300 hours of taped evidence, was trained on the courtyard belonging to the shelter from a neighbouring building. Two undercover officers posing as drop-outs, Ed and Swampy, began to drop in. They visited the Bus (it was actually once a bus) 12 times and were able to buy heroin on eight of those occasions. Eight dealers were also jailed following the operation - their sentences were, for the most part far, lighter than those dished out to Wyner and Brock. </p> <p>The judge in the case, judge Jonathan Haworth, accused Wyner and Brock of creating \"a haven for drug dealers\". At the heart of the prosecution's case was Wintercomfort's confidentiality policy, designed to protect staff and build trust with vulnerable people. It prevented them from passing names of those suspected of drug-related activity to the police - as a result they opened themselves up to the charge that they were not doing enough to help remove dealers. </p> <p>It is an extraordinary case which has sparked outrage among homelessness and drugs charities, among MPs and academics who believe there has been a gross miscarriage of justice. Even those who are critical of Wyner were horrifed by the draconian sentences - people convicted of stabbings, muggings and sexually abusing children go away for less. Wyner and Brock's fate sent shockwaves through the charity and homeless sector with reports that staff at other hostels and day centres were starting to turn away drug addicts, because they did not want to put themselves at risk of prosecution. </p> <p>If these two could be convicted, they felt, anyone working with the homeless could. There is a high level of drug addiction among the homeless - up to 70% according to some estimates - and where there are addicts, there will be dealers, even if they're only trying to make enough money for their next hit. </p> <p>A well-organised campaign to free \"The Cambridge Two\" has swung into action, with support from the great and good of the city. There have been vigils, gigs, demonstrations, marches; there's a newsletter and a website, badges, T-shirts and a CD featuring two songs written by Ruth and performed by a band called Not Guilty. A support fund has raised between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000 to help pay Wyner and Brock's mortgages - they have had to resign their posts at Wintercomfort - and the fighting fund has raised and spent a further \u00a320,000 to highlight their plight. </p> <p>Letters of support have appeared in the national press, signed by everyone from Julie Christie and Tom Stoppard to Roger Scruton and Michael Winner. Joan Baez dedicated a song to Ruth and John every night of her US tour. </p> <p>The campaign has not, however, gone unchallenged. On the letters pages of national newspapers there have been angry exchanges between Wyner and Dr Don Keiller, a Cambridge resident and a vociferous and long-term critic of Wyner and Wintercomfort. He claims that drug-dealers were given \"carte blanche\" to peddle drugs to the extent that the shelter became a \"supermarket for heroin\". He says addicts came from miles around to score from dealers who turned up in BMWs to sell their wares and claims Wyner did nothing to contain the situation. Wyner denies this is what happened. </p> <p>Dr Keiller also noted Wyner was \"no stranger to controversy\". In 1993 she was sacked from her job as manager of the St Martin's Homeless Trust in Norwich for allegedly allowing the use of drugs on the premises. The allegation, according to Wyner, was that she had allowed one resident to smoke cannabis in her room. She always denied it; there was never any police charge. She took her case to an industrial tribunal and lost. Nick Williams, who was a trustee at St Martin's at the time and is now chairman of the trustees confirmed: \"She was sacked for gross misconduct. That misconduct was that she condoned the use of drugs.\" </p> <p> And so, there it was - another drug allegation. This time cannabis, not heroin. There were no charges, but it was enough to suggest a pattern of behaviour to those who wanted to see it. \"What is very clear is there is a history there,\" says one housing shelter manager. \"There seems to be quite a lot of smoke and a good reason for fire. I manage an organisation which is presented with all the same problems as Wintercomfort and I don't see we're about to be raided by the police.\" </p> <p>Wyner is a small, wiry, tenacious-looking woman. She has a deep, chesty laugh which reduces her to phlegmy coughing fits. We meet in the segregation unit at Highpoint prison, Suffolk. She seems self-possessed, undaunted. When she first arrived she says she scurried around, her shoulders hunched up, her hands deep in her pockets, cursing and swearing. It was defensive - she was frightened. Six months on she looks like she's handling it like a pro. Her companions are drug importers from Colombia and Jamaica - most of them inadequate, vulnerable people, just like those she worked with at Wintercomfort. </p> <p>She is adamant that she and John Brock were unaware of the scale of the dealing going on at Wintercomfort. \"The heroin problem in Cambridge was very, very bad. There was quite a lot of unusually pure stuff around. There were more overdoses happening, which was causing us a lot of worry. </p> <p>\"It was happening at the hostels as well. We were all seeing a rise in heroin use. Sometimes at the day centre we would see people keel over from overdoses and we would have to send for an ambulance.\" </p> <p>There was one death on site; at hostels elsewhere in the city there were others. Staff at the Bus suspected one or two people were doing exchanges in the shelter, but nothing of the scale revealed by police surveillance. Wyner, bound by the charity's confidentiality policy, thought she was nevertheless liaising well with the police. Instead, she says, she found herself targeted by them. Smack dealers picked up by the police were asked specifically about Wyner's involvement; one of them was asked whether she was taking backhanders. </p> <p>Conspiracy theories abound as to why Wintercomfort and Wyner, a mother of two, became the focus of Cambridge police's anti-drugs drive. Her critics maintain it was because all the police drugs intelligence led in some way to Wintercomfort. Others point to her recent success in winning a planning application and a \u00a3400,000 lottery grant to build a permanent shelter for 25 homeless people at Elizabeth Way, a road bridge facing Midsummer Common. </p> <p>The plans were deeply unpopular with some local residents, who, according to Wyner, mounted a vigorous campaign to fight the planned development. \"I was the driving force behind Elizabeth Way,\" says Wyner. \"I can't help but think there's some sort of link.\" </p> <p>On events at St Martin's, Wyner says her dismissal was about political differences over the role of the shelter. The cannabis charge, she says, was trumped up as an excuse to get rid of her. \"After I got sacked I went for a job as co-ordinator of the Herring House Trust in Great Yarmouth. They went and spoke with one of the trustees of St Martin's and they still took me on with open arms in full knowledge of what had happened. I feel vindicated by that. </p> <p>\"I have never, ever condoned cannabis - never at all, on any project,\" she insists. \"There was a saying in St Martin's at the time - if anybody came in with a joint, you would tell them to go feed the ducks, which meant go and have a smoke by the river. Don't bring it into the project. </p> <p>\"That kind of attitude fitted in with the whole of the sector. What it really meant was - keep it out of my sight, otherwise I'm going to have to ban you. You would not do that with heroin. You know it's very harmful and damaging. When it comes to heroin, we had very firm policies laid down. Anything we saw we dealt with in terms of those policies. The trouble is we didn't see everything.\" </p> <p>Wyner and Brock say they had procedures in place and were following them; part of the prosecution case was that they did not. On one occasion they let a woman back into Wintercomfort despite banning her indefinitely on suspicion of drug dealing. \"She pleaded with us to come back on the project. We were worried because we knew she was injecting in her neck, which meant she could kill herself with any injection. You are in a life-and-death situation. It's terribly, terribly difficult.\" </p> <p>When she was appointed director of Wintercomfort in 1995, the trustees were not made aware of what had happened at St Martin's. She told them after her arrest. \"We did take quite careful references at the time,\" says Sarah Jones, chair of the trustees. \"On the one hand you think, 'Oh I wish she had told me before'. If you look at it carefully and objectively, I don't see a problem. It did not affect Ruth's judgment. The rest of the trustees agree with that.\" </p> <p>At the Bus drop-in shelter one recent blustery Thursday afternoon, business is slow. The number of people visiting the project has almost halved since Operation Wythall, as the police called it. At one stage it looked as though the whole project might go under; there was a drop in donations and funders became very jittery. Organisers feel they've finally turned a corner; they're advertising Wyner and Brock's old jobs and they're confident there will be a lot of interest. </p> <p>Things have changed a bit. There's a new closed-door policy - a camera peers down at you as you ring the bell to get in. There is careful monitoring of who is allowed entry and record keeping has been tightened up. The staff are cheery, fiercely supportive of their former bosses. </p> <p>In the TV room, a small group of young men slump in front of an early episode of ER; one man weaves a friendship bracelet, another is shaving. In the cafe, fish and chips is on the menu for \u00a31, with semolina and jam for an extra 30p. A man sits reading the paper with his face very, very close to the words; others sit listlessly - grubby, emotionless, their features shaded under baseball caps. </p> <p>\"I don't think it did anything to tackle drugs in Cambridge,\" says Val Oliver, assistant manager at the Bus. \"It just moved the activity elsewhere. The clientele we see have substance misuse problems. I can't say I'm 100% sure dealing is not going on here now. But I am confident any suspicion of dealing will be dealt with by asking the person to leave and banning them.\" </p> <p>There are those who believe the level of dealing going on at Wintercomfort was far higher than at other comparable day centres and that management procedures were lax, which put them at particular risk of being prosecuted under Section 8 of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. On the other hand, a survey by the national drugs helpline, Release, of 600 workers in the sector revealed half would be guilty of some offence under this law. Many believe the act should be amended. A recent inquiry funded by the Police Foundation recommended that it should be amended, partly to acknowledge the importance of confidentiality policies. </p> <p>Over the past two decades, the climate has changed radically in the homelessness sector. When Wyner, once a classmate of Harriet Harman at St Paul's School in London, first began working in the area, it was far more ad hoc. It was led by strong personalities who used their initiative to carry out work no one else was prepared to do. In recent years, however, the whole sector has had to become much more professional and co-ordinated. </p> <p>Wyner's passion for working with the homeless, the outcast and dispossessed, stems from early experiences with her brother, Rickie, who was mentally ill. After 10 attempts, he finally killed himself by throwing himself out of a hostel window. Some suggest at times her passion may affect her judgment and she has made enemies along the way. \"There's no doubt she's a very intelligent person,\" says one former colleague. \"She's highly committed to working with homeless people. She does not feel the way society deals with these people is appropriate. She does not like authority. She has her own particular code.\" </p> <p>Eamonn Burgess, a city councillor in Norwich, worked for Wyner at St Martin's. He left after a disagreement over shift patterns - she says he bears a grudge against her. \"I know how hard-working Ruth is. She's a brilliant lobbyist, she's almost fanatical. There's no question she taught me good stuff. </p> <p>\"But she was suspended and dismissed from St Martin's following her nonsensical drugs policy. She was found to be unfit to do her job.\" </p> <p>Wyner insists her conscience is clear. \"I feel terribly angry. It feels like my life has been picked up and thrown away. I feel I've worked very hard in a difficult area of work. I've given my life to homelessness really, and to find myself incarcerated like this is very painful. </p> <p>\"As far as I'm concerned I've done nothing criminal. You can always improve the management of somewhere. I did my best with the resources we had. I feel I've suffered a huge injustice and John Brock has as well.\" </p> <p>Attention has understandably focused on Wyner because of her outspoken and high-profile role in the homeless world - she trained as a journalist and has used her skills to get considerable media coverage. Brock, on the other hand, a mild-mannered family man who was employed as a printer and signwriter before working with the homeless, has remained in the background throughout. </p> <p>His wife, Louise, who has two sons, says John was apprehensive about the appeal. \"My main feelings are those of anger and disbelief that the police did not tell anyone about the problem. If any one of the policemen Ruth and John had been liaising with had said, 'Look here, this is getting out of hand, we need to do something', they would have done something. It's like they were trapped. </p> <p>\"John says he will fight till he dies to clear his name. He feels it's just such an injustice. If we fail at this appeal, we'll take it to the House of Lords and then on to Europe.\" </p> <p>Hero or villain? Martyr or traitor? Life is rarely that clear-cut. What is clear is that even Ruth Wyner's worst enemies agree she was passionate about her work; she was devoted to the homeless cause, and she and John Brock did a great deal of good for many desperate people. The appeal judges will have to decide whether it is right that such people are charged, convicted and sentenced to serve time - such a long, long time - behind bars.</p>",

When they were, everyone told them it would never get to court. When it did, their lawyers reassured them they would not be found guilty. When they were, no one expected they would go to prison. Wyner, director of the Wintercomfort charity, was jailed for five years for knowingly permitting heroin dealing; Brock, a manager at the charity's day centre, the Bus, was jailed for four. They have been in prison for more than six months. They spent Christmas in prison, they saw in the new millennium in prison, and they both celebrated their 50th birthdays behind bars. Ruth is a prison gardener, planting dahlias in the unlovely grounds at Highpoint prison in Suffolk, and spends the rest of her time bashing out angry letters and articles on her uncle's old manual typewriter, which she has been allowed in her cell.

Mr Barak's confidence is backed by an opinion poll for the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper which indicates that a majority of Israelis do favour making compromises for peace with the Palestinians.

      "body": "<p>One good thing about spitting is that it helps to pass the time. It's morning, about nine o'clock, and on the streets of south London the school buses have dumped their loads and the playgrounds have gone quiet. Up here, on the top floor of the tower block, the day has started, as it always does, with Karen and Philly and Annie May and the others sitting slouched on the black tile floor by the liftshaft, smoking and watching the minutes go by and practising their spitting.</p> <p>In the past they've tried hanging out in the shopping malls, but the old Bill hassled them. It's the same on the streets, really.</p> <p>Sometimes they go round Philly's house - his mum doesn't mind, she's in bed all day. But mostly, each morning they sit here in the block and, if it gets too cold with the wind blowing in from the open walkways, they go down on to the estate and, in among the dog crap and the flower tubs filled with fag ends, they find some litter and bring it back up here and light a fire on the landing, and then they sit and watch the smoke. A day in the life of a truant.</p> <p>It's better than school and, as the morning passes, they sit and sometimes talk, but not too much. When they first started coming up here they used to play in the lift. It was not much of a game: push the button, wait for the lift to arrive, get in, go mental - jump up and down as hard as you can and batter its walls and floor with your feet and your fists - then wait for someone else on another floor to call the lift and hope it does not work.</p> <p>Up here on the block, with half a dozen subdued children, it is easy to imagine that this is a small problem. At first sight, the official statistics confirm this. The audit commission says some 12,000 children a year are permanently excluded from school and a further 150,000 are excluded temporarily. It is not ideal but it is a tiny fraction of the whole pupil population. The commission also says that each year a million of the 8m children in our schools will be absent without authorisation. But many of those absences are for only one day.</p> <p>The numbers conceal as much as they reveal. They say nothing about the children who are 'cleansed' - pushed out of schools by headteachers who avoid officially recording them as exclusions. They say nothing about the children who turn up at school to be registered and then walk straight out. Most of all they ignore all the children who are out of school but who do not qualify to be counted.</p> <p>There is an apparently vast reservoir of students whose absence from school is authorised by parents who want them at home as carers for siblings or who just cannot be bothered to send them. And there are untold thousands who are not registered to any school at all because they have fallen through the system, usually because of their families' unstable lives: their parents are homeless and stay away from the authorities for fear of having their kids taken into care; they move and cannot cope with the bureaucracy of a new LEA; they stumble from one disastrous estate to another, and the education authorities simply lose track of them; they are among the 2,500 children of refugee families who, according to the Refugee Council, are being illegally denied an education; they are the children of travellers; they are in jail.</p> <p>But this is not about numbers. You really begin to see the scale of the problem only when you first catch a glimpse of what lies beneath it. There are two central truths: first, that this has far less to do with discipline than it has to do with an epidemic of emotional damage, particularly among the 30% of British children who live in poverty; second, that these children are the most visible part of the central problems of our schools, how to teach disaffected children who see no point in learning, how to give reality to the once-vibrant idea that education is the natural escape route from poverty.</p> <p>Come back to the block. By noon, a few of the faces have pushed off to play on the buses. That is not much of a game either. You get on the bus without a ticket, see how far you can travel before you get thrown off, then you walk home or maybe catch another bus, if you can be bothered.</p> <p>Other faces have arrived now. They all have the same kind of faces, with the shine rubbed off, and the same kind of stories.</p> <p>Listen to Karen, sitting with her back to the liftshaft wall, listless, aimless, hopeless, the kind of truant who gives David Blunkett nightmares - she has not been to school regularly since she was 11, and she is now 14. When she was seven her father started using heroin and crack cocaine and he got her mother on to it, too. Until then, life had been OK. They had a nice house, there was food in the kitchen, she was going to school. But the mother and father slid downhill fast, taking Karen and her three younger sisters with them.</p> <p>Her dad used to take her out thieving. She used to knock on the door, a little girl with gaps in her teeth, and if there was someone in, she would ask for a glass of water and run along; if not, her dad would smash a window and they'd get inside and take whatever they could. She got arrested for that eventually, when she was 11, and spent 36 hours in a cell. By that time she had long lost sight of normal life. She says there was no food in the house, and to feed her sisters as well as herself she would go and borrow money off friends or eat at someone else's house or steal things from shops or scavenge in rubbish bins. They had no light or heat in the house. Her mum and dad just did drugs and watched the time go by.</p> <p>She became the stand-in mother, feeding and caring for the three younger ones. At first, when she stopped going to school, she still took the others, but then it got too much and so they all stopped. From time to time the welfare officer used to come round and bang on the door, and Karen says her mum just told them to keep quiet and then the welfare officer would go away. If there were letters about it, they just ignored them. Eventually, her dad got sent to jail - four years for robbery - and her mum was left on her own with four children and a heroin habit. And that's the way it still is now.</p> <p>So why does she not want to sit in school? Because she is too sure there is no point, too scared to be caught out failing, too determined to advertise her indifference, too angry and too cynical - too emotionally damaged.</p> <p>When they are not up here in the block, Karen and the others spend most of their time in some old railway arches which have been converted into a kind of refuge for young people. They are run by a psychotherapist called Camila Batmanghelidjh who was taken to court by her building society because she stopped paying her mortgage and used the money to set up this day club for the kids under the arches.</p> <p>Batmanghelidjh reckons that one in three children in the inner cities have some form of emotional or behavioural difficulty. Several hundred children a day find their way to her arches. Most of them are more or less out of school. They live, she says, in a state of \"emotional coldness\". This is the hidden core of what politicians dismiss as mere truancy and exclusion.</p> <p>Last year the office for national statistics reported that 10% of Britain's children suffer from mental disorders - anxiety, depression, obsessions, clinically significant behaviour disorders and hyperactivity - but that figure masked the concentration of mental disorders among the children of the poor.</p> <p>The ONS found, for example, that among the children of families where both parents are unemployed, some 20% have a mental health problem. They also found that children with this kind of illness were four times more likely to truant than others. They were also three times more likely to have specific learning difficulties, three times more likely to have special educational needs and 10 times more likely to be in trouble with the police, all of which are linked to the kind of behaviour which leads to children being excluded.</p> <p>Unhappiness always has its reason. One of the 14-year-old girls who moves between the block and Batmanghelidjh's arches has started working as a street prostitute. It seems she is doing so at the behest of her mother, who needs the money. There is an 11-year-old boy who lives with his ageing gran because neither of his parents want anything to do with him; a 15-year-old girl whose mother died of cancer years ago, whose father is preoccupied with selling drugs, who has been in and out of care and who had her first abortion at 13; another 13-year-old girl who is given money for sex by an elderly man; two brothers, aged 17 and 11, both of them drug runners; a 12-year-old girl who recently found her father after he had overdosed and who has now been sent to live with her mother, who makes no secret of not wanting her.</p> <p>The strategy of the education secretary, David Blunkett, is all about \"inclusivity\". He has introduced a complex package of sticks and carrots to persuade schools and LEAs to divert truants and the excluded back into the classroom. By 2002 he wants a reduction of 30% in both statistics; every secondary school and every LEA has been given a target. He is paying new pupil support grants so that a thousand schools can set up learning support units to help them to reach the targets. If they miss the targets, he will withdraw their grants. Some schools will also receive money to pay for learning mentors to help disaffected children. He has given LEAs new powers to join appeals against exclusion and made it their responsibility to pick up the bill for the education of those who nevertheless are excluded. Finally, the Home Office has introduced fines for parents who fail to send their children to school and powers for police to pick up truants on the streets.</p> <p><b> Tactics</b><br></p> <p>This strategy has its merits. Mr Blunkett is targeting extra resources on some of the poorest areas. Funding for learning mentors, for example, is being delivered through the excellence in cities programme focused on six metropolitan areas. Behind all the rhetoric about discipline, the reality is that many schools are now are attempting to tackle the underlying problems of the most disaffected children.</p> <p>However, there are two problems. First, the tactics of the new school units and also the DFEE's particular version of mentoring are, at best, untested and, at worst, proven failures. If these schemes fail to change the way in which these children are behaving, we will have locked into our schools a group of the most delinquent and difficult children and we will start to see the kind of violence which has become part of the currency of daily life in some inner city schools in the United States.</p> <p>The second problem is that Mr Blunkett has, on the one hand, made moves to persuade schools to deal with disaffected children, and then with the other hand, launched political initiatives which undermine those moves. Beyond that, the strategy suffers from the political decision to leave in place the whole package of reforms introduced by the former education secretary, Kenneth Baker, in the late 1980s.</p> <p>As this series has previously shown, this structure penalises the most disaffected children: they perform badly in exams; their schools tumble down the league tables; middle-class families use their professional skills and their strength in the property market to take their motivated children away to schools with a less disaffected intake; when they do that, they take funds away with them, the struggling school is left with even fewer motivated children and even less money to educate them and so it spirals downwards. In short, the children of the poor get the schools with the poorest budgets, an imbalance that is not corrected by the available subsidies for needy children which notoriously are rationed, inefficiently distributed and inadequate in the first place.</p> <p>Furthermore, these schools have had a direct financial incentive to exclude the most difficult children in order to improve their position in the league tables. As the Baker reforms took hold, exclusions rose fivefold in five years. Leaving Kenneth Baker's system in place, Mr Blunkett has introduced counter-measures to try to give schools a financial interest in not excluding children. The problem is that neither structure provides a neutral framework in which a school can decide a child's future purely on grounds of education and behaviour.</p> <p>Come back to the block and to Camila Batmanghelidjh's arches. The morning is past, the afternoon is wearing on and, up in the block, where Batmanghelidjh is not in charge, finally they have found something to do. They are smoking hash. Batmanghelidjh knows they do it. She knows it is part of the daily routine, for as long as they can afford the hash. And worse. She has one 12-year-old who had rocks of crack cocaine found in his pocket. She has urged them not do it, but she is not about to hammer them for it, because she knows why it is happening: \"They use cannabis to control their moods.\" And why do they do that? Because just about nobody else is doing anything to help them with those moods. The ONS can tell the world that 20% of poor children are mentally ill. Nobody quarrels with the finding (which has been replicated by other studies). But this country's strange and terrible reaction has been to shake its head and then to offer virtually no care at all.</p> <p>The audit commission last year found that less than half the health authorities in the country even had a policy for child mental health and that, among those who did, there were all kinds of gaps and overlaps where different agencies were failing to work together. The ONS similarly, having recorded the scale of mental illness among children, found that 30% of these children had not been seen even once by a specialist, or even by a GP. At Young Minds, a national charity working to promote the mental health of children and young people, Deb Loeb told us: \"The waiting lists and lack of resources are just desperate.\"</p> <p>There is a national shortage of child psychiatrists. Four years ago the NHS executive was recording increasing concern about \"the fragmentation and reduction in child and adolescent mental health services around the country\". This month, the Department of Health told us it has only 180 child psychiatrists in the whole country and that most of those are in the south-east.</p> <p>There is a national network of educational psychologists, 1,820 of them, but everyone who works in the field says they have become overwhelmed with assessing children for \"statements\" which entitle schools to extra money to help them. Brian Harrison Jennings, secretary of the Association of Educational Psychologists, said: \"We are so busy seeing the next child being referred to us that we don't have time to implement the very course of action that we recognise they would benefit from. All we can do is to refer them to someone else and, for the most part, that someone else may not be able to see them either.\"</p> <p>The \"statementing\" of children has itself become part of the problem, subverted by spending cuts and overwhelmed by demand. The audit commission last year found that only 48% of draft statements are prepared within the statutory timescale of 18 weeks; one in 10 trusts could not offer an appointment within six months of referral, and in five areas the average wait for an assessment was more than a year. Even if the child is assessed, its appeal for money goes to the local special needs panel, whose funds have been so rationed that frequently they will cover only a minimal number of hours support in the school.</p> <p>Baroness Warnock, whose 1978 inquiry introduced statementing, now regards the system as a disaster. Last month the government withdrew plans for a new bill which was intended to re-organise the whole area of special educational needs.</p> <p>The only other specialist support for disaffected children comes from educational welfare officers. Like the educational psychologists, they have become overwhelmed, each of them responsible for an average of 3,000 children, according to the National Foundation for Educational Research, who found welfare officers were frequently too busy with the paperwork of truancy even to begin to deal with its causes.</p> <p>For the most part the damaged children are left with their parents, who often are part of the problem, and with their teachers, who have very little time and even less specialist training.</p> <p>It is easy to imagine that there is a safety net somewhere else, that the children outside the liftshaft in the block are unusual. They are not. Elsewhere we found children out of school whose lives were grossly disfigured and who were receiving no effective help: an 11-year-old girl in Kent who was spending her evenings in a van while her mother, a prostitute, serviced punters in the back; a 14-year-old girl in Hammersmith, west London, who had been living in a car with her homeless parents; an 11-year-old boy, also in Hammersmith, who was found abandoned at Heathrow airport; a diaspora of Somalian children, some of whom have seen their parents killed. The government's strategy for truancy and exclusion rests on the effectiveness of in-school projects which will attempt to cope with these damaged children. If they fail, the whole thing collapses in disarray and disorder. The biggest scheme - and the only one which is being nationally co-ordinated - is the introduction of mentors as guides and role models for difficult children.</p> <p>The idea comes from the United States where researchers have found that the Big Brothers Big Sisters movement has had real success, but the same researchers warned that \"these findings do not mean that the benefits of mentoring occur automatically\". Although the DFEE has quoted this research in support of its scheme, it has failed so far to introduce the kind of rigorous screening of volunteers, training, supervision and support on which the American scheme relies. When the DFEE commissioned its own research from the Centre for Social Action, the result was a loud alarm bell.</p> <p>Echoing the warning from the United States, the CSA warned that the DFEE needed to invest heavily. When it looked at one project in detail, it found signs that the DFEE had failed to create effective schemes on the American model: \"The mentoring relationships created are too shallow to make a difference and only have value to the young person as a means of avoiding lessons and the opportunity of a free trip.\" The CSA concluded: \"What is regrettable is seeing the potential of this form of practice wasted through insufficient planning, lack of money, lack of communication and lack of a philosophical base that values young people's participation.\"</p> <p>And yet the schools minister, Estelle Morris, said in May that there was already evidence that the DFEE mentoring was having \"a positive impact on pupils' behaviour, attendance at school and attitudes to learning\". Her department made no mention of the CSA findings but said that the minister was referring to evidence which had been produced by the National Foundation for Educational Research. In fact, the NFER report produced no statistical evidence whatsoever of any improvement in attendance or any other aspect of pupil behaviour.</p> <p><b> Harsh</b><br></p> <p>Oddly, the NFER researchers decided not to interview any of the children involved nor to use questionnaires which some of them completed. Instead, they quoted positive anecdotal comments from some of the organisers and then revealed that the average time which children spent with their mentors was only one hour a fortnight during the academic year, ie 21 hours in a calendar year. Set this beside the conclusion of the US researchers who studied schemes where children were spending 120 hours over 15 months with their mentors and concluded: \"The time together does not seem sufficient to offset poor school performance, negative influences on self-esteem and 14 or more years of living in poverty. While mentors can teach responsibility and values, discuss the importance of education and trying one's best, they cannot be expected to completely neutralise the harsh conditions in which many of these adolescents live.\" So far as the myriad different in-school projects are concerned, there is no evidence of whether they will succeed or fail. Clearly, they are well intentioned, and although some are simply exercises in policing to catch truants and bring them back to school, others are imaginative efforts to tackle children's problems: Circles of Friends, where schools use the peer pressure of successful students; behaviour support teams, which pass behaviour-management techniques on to teachers, support staff and parents; nurture groups, which separate difficult children and attempt to teach them how to be students. Some schools are reporting encouraging signs of progress.</p> <p>However, almost all of these schemes suffer from a potentially devastating weakness. They rely on the same overstretched network of specialists who are already struggling to find time to work effectively and so they attempt to delegate skills to teachers and parents and others, none of whom has any specialist training at all. As a result, they cannot be and do not claim to be therapeutic in any meaningful sense. Teachers are not therapists.</p> <p>There are a few genuinely therapeutic schemes in schools. The Place To Be, for example, sends trained counsellors into 28 schools in the London area and is supported by the DFEE. And there are private schemes, such as Camila Batmanghelidjh's arches, which struggle to survive without any statutory funding from the DFEE or anyone else.</p> <p>If the approach to disaffected children is frail, the approach to disaffected parents is even weaker. Jenny Price of the Association for Education Welfare Managers, said: \"Fewer truant in the traditional sense, ie absenteeism without people knowing. What is more common is parents who don't care if they go to school or not, or allow them to stay at home to look after the house or after the kids. There is more of that, and it is more difficult to deal with.\"</p> <p>In a sweep on the streets of Sheffield last month officials found 200 children who should have been in school, 75% of whom were absent with \"flimsy excuses\" from parents. Welfare officers say that where once any absence at all would have been investigated, now a parent who writes letters can keep their child off school without much fear of being investigated. If they do get a visit, we were told, all they need to do is hide behind the door.</p> <p>To deal with this, the DFEE is relying on heavier fines and the new home-school contracts, introduced last year at a cost of \u00a31.6m with clear political benefits but without any obvious impact on the problem parents. We met the parents of truants who had been sleeping with their children in a playground, who had fled their homes under siege from violent neighbours, who were addicted to drugs or alcohol or crushed by depression or who complained bitterly that their children were too terrified of gang bullying to go anywhere near their school. When we asked them about the effect of the new fines and the home-school contracts, they just shrugged.</p> <p>This profoundly fragile structure has then been undermined by decisions which appear to be political rather than educational. The social exclusion unit and the audit commission both studied truancy and exclusion and both stressed that government strategy must be \"joined up\", involving all of the different local agencies who might be able to help.</p> <p>In October 1998 David Blunkett adopted this view and asked LEAs to prepare three-year plans involving all their agencies, to take effect in April 1999. However, in July 1999, just as his officials had finished approving all the plans, he changed his mind and, as part of his political drive to divert power and money away from the LEAs, he announced that schools would have to take over the job; he gave them only six weeks over the summer holidays to comment on his change of direction.</p> <p>This devolution not only caused short-term chaos but posed a long-term threat to the idea of a \"joined-up\" approach by putting all of the other agencies in a secondary position, relying on schools to come to them with money, instead of being a directly-funded part of an LEA plan. The local government association has warned education ministers that their inclusion strategy has been \"seriously jeopardised by compulsory devolution\".</p> <p>Mr Blunkett launched a further political initiative which also threatens to dam age the chances of success for in-school units - performance-related pay for teachers. The object of these units is to work with difficult children and reintegrate them back into the classroom as soon as possible and, at the very latest, within two terms.</p> <p>The new deal on performance-related pay will give experienced teachers a bonus of \u00a32,000, but only if, among other things, their results improve. This adds a new financial incentive to reject the reintegration of a student who is likely to perform badly and to disrupt the class. The result is that at the same time as he is trying to negate the school's incentive to exclude difficult children, Mr Blunkett has introduced a new incentive for teachers to do the opposite of what he wants.</p> <p>The DFEE's new investment disguises a simultaneous cut in the education of disaffected children. For years, truants and the excluded have been offered a safety net of 320 LEA pupil referral units outside schools. This network is notoriously inadequate, catering for only a fraction of the needy children with some 8,000 places for the tens of thousands who might need them. There has been nothing unusual in a child waiting a year between a permanent exclusion and a place in a PRU. When finally it comes, it often involves only a few hours of teaching each week, usually in an inadequate building and without any kind of specialist resources to tackle the child's problems. Now, this safety net is to be cut.</p> <p>In Mr Blunkett's plan, LEAs no longer have a statutory responsibility for truants outside school. Pregnant schoolgirls and young mothers similarly will be dropped by the PRUS. If they chose to, LEAs are now free to make substantial savings by simply closing any out-of-school unit that was helping truants or schoolgirl mothers. They must continue to provide for any student who is excluded for more than three weeks - but many are cutting back even these units on the assumption that all of their schools will succeed in hitting their targets for retaining these pupils within school walls.</p> <p>According to LEA documents, Sheffield, for example, will now provide only \"the minimum necessary for compliance with statutory duties\". This means: getting rid of 16% of its PRU teachers; completely closing the two units which deal with truants; closing the unit for pregnant girls; then reducing the time available in units for the excluded. The remaining out-of-school units will provide limited short-term help for excluded secondary children and nothing for excluded primary children.</p> <p>Alongside these reduced PRUs, Sheffield is providing learning mentors in every secondary school, new learning support units in nine of them and a pupil inclusion team to track pupils and offer advice to schools. This is an improvement in one sense: in-school places are cheaper and they are being subsidised by the DFEE, and so the in-school units can cater for more children than the old PRUs. But the whole strategy relies on one thing - that the schools will hit their targets and succeed in keeping the children within their walls. The LEA documents admit that this will be tough: \"It will be difficult to foresee exactly what remaining central needs will be, as the task of inclusion is extremely challenging.\" <br> <a href=\"http://www.educationunlimited.co.uk/specialreports/educationincrisis/story/0,5500,341715,00.html\">Truants continued</a></p>",

Come back to the block. By noon, a few of the faces have pushed off to play on the buses. That is not much of a game either. You get on the bus without a ticket, see how far you can travel before you get thrown off, then you walk home or maybe catch another bus, if you can be bothered. Other faces have arrived now. They all have the same kind of faces, with the shine rubbed off, and the same kind of stories. Listen to Karen, sitting with her back to the liftshaft wall, listless, aimless, hopeless, the kind of truant who gives David Blunkett nightmares - she has not been to school regularly since she was 11, and she is now 14.

At first, when she stopped going to school, she still took the others, but then it got too much and so they all stopped. From time to time the welfare officer used to come round and bang on the door, and Karen says her mum just told them to keep quiet and then the welfare officer would go away. If there were letters about it, they just ignored them. Eventually, her dad got sent to jail - four years for robbery - and her mum was left on her own with four children and a heroin habit. And that's the way it still is now. So why does she not want to sit in school? Because she is too sure there is no point, too scared to be caught out failing, too determined to advertise her indifference, too angry and too cynical - too emotionally damaged. When they are not up here in the block, Karen and the others spend most of their time in some old railway arches which have been converted into a kind of refuge for young people. They are run by a psychotherapist called Camila Batmanghelidjh who was taken to court by her building society because she stopped paying her mortgage and used the money to set up this day club for the kids under the arches. Batmanghelidjh reckons that one in three children in the inner cities have some form of emotional or behavioural difficulty. Several hundred children a day find their way to her arches. Most of them are more or less out of school. They live, she says, in a state of \"emotional coldness\". This is the hidden core of what politicians dismiss as mere truancy and exclusion. Last year the office for national statistics reported that 10% of Britain's children suffer from mental disorders - anxiety, depression, obsessions, clinically significant behaviour disorders and hyperactivity - but that figure masked the concentration of mental disorders among the children of the poor. The ONS found, for example, that among the children of families where both parents are unemployed, some 20% have a mental health problem. They also found that children with this kind of illness were four times more likely to truant than others. They were also three times more likely to have specific learning difficulties, three times more likely to have special educational needs and 10 times more likely to be in trouble with the police, all of which are linked to the kind of behaviour which leads to children being excluded. Unhappiness always has its reason. One of the 14-year-old girls who moves between the block and Batmanghelidjh's arches has started working as a street prostitute. It seems she is doing so at the behest of her mother, who needs the money. There is an 11-year-old boy who lives with his ageing gran because neither of his parents want anything to do with him; a 15-year-old girl whose mother died of cancer years ago, whose father is preoccupied with selling drugs, who has been in and out of care and who had her first abortion at 13; another 13-year-old girl who is given money for sex by an elderly man; two brothers, aged 17 and 11, both of them drug runners; a 12-year-old girl who recently found her father after he had overdosed and who has now been sent to live with her mother, who makes no secret of not wanting her. The strategy of the education secretary, David Blunkett, is all about \"inclusivity\". He has introduced a complex package of sticks and carrots to persuade schools and LEAs to divert truants and the excluded back into the classroom. By 2002 he wants a reduction of 30% in both statistics; every secondary school and every LEA has been given a target. He is paying new pupil support grants so that a thousand schools can set up learning support units to help them to reach the targets. If they miss the targets, he will withdraw their grants. Some schools will also receive money to pay for learning mentors to help disaffected children. He has given LEAs new powers to join appeals against exclusion and made it their responsibility to pick up the bill for the education of those who nevertheless are excluded. Finally, the Home Office has introduced fines for parents who fail to send their children to school and powers for police to pick up truants on the streets. Tactics This strategy has its merits. Mr Blunkett is targeting extra resources on some of the poorest areas. Funding for learning mentors, for example, is being delivered through the excellence in cities programme focused on six metropolitan areas. Behind all the rhetoric about discipline, the reality is that many schools are now are attempting to tackle the underlying problems of the most disaffected children. However, there are two problems. First, the tactics of the new school units and also the DFEE's particular version of mentoring are, at best, untested and, at worst, proven failures. If these schemes fail to change the way in which these children are behaving, we will have locked into our schools a group of the most delinquent and difficult children and we will start to see the kind of violence which has become part of the currency of daily life in some inner city schools in the United States. The second problem is that Mr Blunkett has, on the one hand, made moves to persuade schools to deal with disaffected children, and then with the other hand, launched political initiatives which undermine those moves. Beyond that, the strategy suffers from the political decision to leave in place the whole package of reforms introduced by the former education secretary, Kenneth Baker, in the late 1980s. As this series has previously shown, this structure penalises the most disaffected children: they perform badly in exams; their schools tumble down the league tables; middle-class families use their professional skills and their strength in the property market to take their motivated children away to schools with a less disaffected intake; when they do that, they take funds away with them, the struggling school is left with even fewer motivated children and even less money to educate them and so it spirals downwards. In short, the children of the poor get the schools with the poorest budgets, an imbalance that is not corrected by the available subsidies for needy children which notoriously are rationed, inefficiently distributed and inadequate in the first place. Furthermore, these schools have had a direct financial incentive to exclude the most difficult children in order to improve their position in the league tables. As the Baker reforms took hold, exclusions rose fivefold in five years. Leaving Kenneth Baker's system in place, Mr Blunkett has introduced counter-measures to try to give schools a financial interest in not excluding children. The problem is that neither structure provides a neutral framework in which a school can decide a child's future purely on grounds of education and behaviour. Come back to the block and to Camila Batmanghelidjh's arches. The morning is past, the afternoon is wearing on and, up in the block, where Batmanghelidjh is not in charge, finally they have found something to do. They are smoking hash. Batmanghelidjh knows they do it. She knows it is part of the daily routine, for as long as they can afford the hash. And worse. She has one 12-year-old who had rocks of crack cocaine found in his pocket. She has urged them not do it, but she is not about to hammer them for it, because she knows why it is happening: \"They use cannabis to control their moods.\" And why do they do that? Because just about nobody else is doing anything to help them with those moods. The ONS can tell the world that 20% of poor children are mentally ill. Nobody quarrels with the finding (which has been replicated by other studies). But this country's strange and terrible reaction has been to shake its head and then to offer virtually no care at all. The audit commission last year found that less than half the health authorities in the country even had a policy for child mental health and that, among those who did, there were all kinds of gaps and overlaps where different agencies were failing to work together. The ONS similarly, having recorded the scale of mental illness among children, found that 30% of these children had not been seen even once by a specialist, or even by a GP. At Young Minds, a national charity working to promote the mental health of children and young people, Deb Loeb told us: \"The waiting lists and lack of resources are just desperate.\" There is a national shortage of child psychiatrists. Four years ago the NHS executive was recording increasing concern about \"the fragmentation and reduction in child and adolescent mental health services around the country\". This month, the Department of Health told us it has only 180 child psychiatrists in the whole country and that most of those are in the south-east. There is a national network of educational psychologists, 1,820 of them, but everyone who works in the field says they have become overwhelmed with assessing children for \"statements\" which entitle schools to extra money to help them. Brian Harrison Jennings, secretary of the Association of Educational Psychologists, said: \"We are so busy seeing the next child being referred to us that we don't have time to implement the very course of action that we recognise they would benefit from. All we can do is to refer them to someone else and, for the most part, that someone else may not be able to see them either.\" The \"statementing\" of children has itself become part of the problem, subverted by spending cuts and overwhelmed by demand. The audit commission last year found that only 48% of draft statements are prepared within the statutory timescale of 18 weeks; one in 10 trusts could not offer an appointment within six months of referral, and in five areas the average wait for an assessment was more than a year. Even if the child is assessed, its appeal for money goes to the local special needs panel, whose funds have been so rationed that frequently they will cover only a minimal number of hours support in the school. Baroness Warnock, whose 1978 inquiry introduced statementing, now regards the system as a disaster. Last month the government withdrew plans for a new bill which was intended to re-organise the whole area of special educational needs. The only other specialist support for disaffected children comes from educational welfare officers. Like the educational psychologists, they have become overwhelmed, each of them responsible for an average of 3,000 children, according to the National Foundation for Educational Research, who found welfare officers were frequently too busy with the paperwork of truancy even to begin to deal with its causes. For the most part the damaged children are left with their parents, who often are part of the problem, and with their teachers, who have very little time and even less specialist training. It is easy to imagine that there is a safety net somewhere else, that the children outside the liftshaft in the block are unusual. They are not. Elsewhere we found children out of school whose lives were grossly disfigured and who were receiving no effective help: an 11-year-old girl in Kent who was spending her evenings in a van while her mother, a prostitute, serviced punters in the back; a 14-year-old girl in Hammersmith, west London, who had been living in a car with her homeless parents; an 11-year-old boy, also in Hammersmith, who was found abandoned at Heathrow airport; a diaspora of Somalian children, some of whom have seen their parents killed. The government's strategy for truancy and exclusion rests on the effectiveness of in-school projects which will attempt to cope with these damaged children. If they fail, the whole thing collapses in disarray and disorder. The biggest scheme - and the only one which is being nationally co-ordinated - is the introduction of mentors as guides and role models for difficult children. The idea comes from the United States where researchers have found that the Big Brothers Big Sisters movement has had real success, but the same researchers warned that \"these findings do not mean that the benefits of mentoring occur automatically\". Although the DFEE has quoted this research in support of its scheme, it has failed so far to introduce the kind of rigorous screening of volunteers, training, supervision and support on which the American scheme relies. When the DFEE commissioned its own research from the Centre for Social Action, the result was a loud alarm bell. Echoing the warning from the United States, the CSA warned that the DFEE needed to invest heavily. When it looked at one project in detail, it found signs that the DFEE had failed to create effective schemes on the American model: \"The mentoring relationships created are too shallow to make a difference and only have value to the young person as a means of avoiding lessons and the opportunity of a free trip.\" The CSA concluded: \"What is regrettable is seeing the potential of this form of practice wasted through insufficient planning, lack of money, lack of communication and lack of a philosophical base that values young people's participation.\" And yet the schools minister, Estelle Morris, said in May that there was already evidence that the DFEE mentoring was having \"a positive impact on pupils' behaviour, attendance at school and attitudes to learning\". Her department made no mention of the CSA findings but said that the minister was referring to evidence which had been produced by the National Foundation for Educational Research. In fact, the NFER report produced no statistical evidence whatsoever of any improvement in attendance or any other aspect of pupil behaviour. Harsh Oddly, the NFER researchers decided not to interview any of the children involved nor to use questionnaires which some of them completed. Instead, they quoted positive anecdotal comments from some of the organisers and then revealed that the average time which children spent with their mentors was only one hour a fortnight during the academic year, ie 21 hours in a calendar year. Set this beside the conclusion of the US researchers who studied schemes where children were spending 120 hours over 15 months with their mentors and concluded: \"The time together does not seem sufficient to offset poor school performance, negative influences on self-esteem and 14 or more years of living in poverty. While mentors can teach responsibility and values, discuss the importance of education and trying one's best, they cannot be expected to completely neutralise the harsh conditions in which many of these adolescents live.\" So far as the myriad different in-school projects are concerned, there is no evidence of whether they will succeed or fail. Clearly, they are well intentioned, and although some are simply exercises in policing to catch truants and bring them back to school, others are imaginative efforts to tackle children's problems: Circles of Friends, where schools use the peer pressure of successful students; behaviour support teams, which pass behaviour-management techniques on to teachers, support staff and parents; nurture groups, which separate difficult children and attempt to teach them how to be students. Some schools are reporting encouraging signs of progress. However, almost all of these schemes suffer from a potentially devastating weakness. They rely on the same overstretched network of specialists who are already struggling to find time to work effectively and so they attempt to delegate skills to teachers and parents and others, none of whom has any specialist training at all. As a result, they cannot be and do not claim to be therapeutic in any meaningful sense. Teachers are not therapists. There are a few genuinely therapeutic schemes in schools. The Place To Be, for example, sends trained counsellors into 28 schools in the London area and is supported by the DFEE. And there are private schemes, such as Camila Batmanghelidjh's arches, which struggle to survive without any statutory funding from the DFEE or anyone else. If the approach to disaffected children is frail, the approach to disaffected parents is even weaker. Jenny Price of the Association for Education Welfare Managers, said: \"Fewer truant in the traditional sense, ie absenteeism without people knowing. What is more common is parents who don't care if they go to school or not, or allow them to stay at home to look after the house or after the kids. There is more of that, and it is more difficult to deal with.\" In a sweep on the streets of Sheffield last month officials found 200 children who should have been in school, 75% of whom were absent with \"flimsy excuses\" from parents. Welfare officers say that where once any absence at all would have been investigated, now a parent who writes letters can keep their child off school without much fear of being investigated. If they do get a visit, we were told, all they need to do is hide behind the door. To deal with this, the DFEE is relying on heavier fines and the new home-school contracts, introduced last year at a cost of \u00a31.6m with clear political benefits but without any obvious impact on the problem parents. We met the parents of truants who had been sleeping with their children in a playground, who had fled their homes under siege from violent neighbours, who were addicted to drugs or alcohol or crushed by depression or who complained bitterly that their children were too terrified of gang bullying to go anywhere near their school. When we asked them about the effect of the new fines and the home-school contracts, they just shrugged. This profoundly fragile structure has then been undermined by decisions which appear to be political rather than educational. The social exclusion unit and the audit commission both studied truancy and exclusion and both stressed that government strategy must be \"joined up\", involving all of the different local agencies who might be able to help. In October 1998 David Blunkett adopted this view and asked LEAs to prepare three-year plans involving all their agencies, to take effect in April 1999. However, in July 1999, just as his officials had finished approving all the plans, he changed his mind and, as part of his political drive to divert power and money away from the LEAs, he announced that schools would have to take over the job; he gave them only six weeks over the summer holidays to comment on his change of direction. This devolution not only caused short-term chaos but posed a long-term threat to the idea of a \"joined-up\" approach by putting all of the other agencies in a secondary position, relying on schools to come to them with money, instead of being a directly-funded part of an LEA plan. The local government association has warned education ministers that their inclusion strategy has been \"seriously jeopardised by compulsory devolution\". Mr Blunkett launched a further political initiative which also threatens to dam age the chances of success for in-school units - performance-related pay for teachers. The object of these units is to work with difficult children and reintegrate them back into the classroom as soon as possible and, at the very latest, within two terms. The new deal on performance-related pay will give experienced teachers a bonus of \u00a32,000, but only if, among other things, their results improve. This adds a new financial incentive to reject the reintegration of a student who is likely to perform badly and to disrupt the class. The result is that at the same time as he is trying to negate the school's incentive to exclude difficult children, Mr Blunkett has introduced a new incentive for teachers to do the opposite of what he wants. The DFEE's new investment disguises a simultaneous cut in the education of disaffected children. For years, truants and the excluded have been offered a safety net of 320 LEA pupil referral units outside schools. This network is notoriously inadequate, catering for only a fraction of the needy children with some 8,000 places for the tens of thousands who might need them. There has been nothing unusual in a child waiting a year between a permanent exclusion and a place in a PRU. When finally it comes, it often involves only a few hours of teaching each week, usually in an inadequate building and without any kind of specialist resources to tackle the child's problems. Now, this safety net is to be cut. In Mr Blunkett's plan, LEAs no longer have a statutory responsibility for truants outside school. Pregnant schoolgirls and young mothers similarly will be dropped by the PRUS. If they chose to, LEAs are now free to make substantial savings by simply closing any out-of-school unit that was helping truants or schoolgirl mothers. They must continue to provide for any student who is excluded for more than three weeks - but many are cutting back even these units on the assumption that all of their schools will succeed in hitting their targets for retaining these pupils within school walls. According to LEA documents, Sheffield, for example, will now provide only \"the minimum necessary for compliance with statutory duties\". This means: getting rid of 16% of its PRU teachers; completely closing the two units which deal with truants; closing the unit for pregnant girls; then reducing the time available in units for the excluded. The remaining out-of-school units will provide limited short-term help for excluded secondary children and nothing for excluded primary children. Alongside these reduced PRUs, Sheffield is providing learning mentors in every secondary school, new learning support units in nine of them and a pupil inclusion team to track pupils and offer advice to schools. This is an improvement in one sense: in-school places are cheaper and they are being subsidised by the DFEE, and so the in-school units can cater for more children than the old PRUs. But the whole strategy relies on one thing - that the schools will hit their targets and succeed in keeping the children within their walls. The LEA documents admit that this will be tough: \"It will be difficult to foresee exactly what remaining central needs will be, as the task of inclusion is extremely challenging.\" Truants continued",

      "body": "<p> <strong>dfic1999</strong> <br> Though I've not read the novel yet (it's in the queue on my shelves), I do want to ask: Is it possible to write a psychologically convincing novel of male masochism, without the cliches of pornography? Also, why a dancer?</p> <p><strong> RupertThomson</strong> <br> Obviously I think so, but I had to trust in my unconscious to do it. The cliches of pornography were actually quite useful - especially in the white room when the three women are trying to think of things that might excite the dancer: I could have them think of things like red underwear, and then have it *not* work. Why a dancer? Because I needed someone who was a) physically beautiful and b) to some extent a public figure. He could then become an object of desire.</p> <p><strong>Shirleygirl</strong> <br> I've always wondered, the mountain near Shepherd's Bush in Soft - was that real? I always mean to look when I'm going past, but not sure where it would be if indeed it exists!</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson</strong> <br> shirleygirl - if you look for the mountain now, all you'll see are rows and rows of black taxis. What happens in the novel was what happened in real life. One day the mountain was there, in the waste ground behind Paddington Station ( and yes, I did climb it), the next day it was gone. An as yet unsolved mystery.</p> <p><strong>RRL30</strong><br> I met you at a programme called Booked a few years ago.You had a lovely suit on with a bright blue lining and we talked about bereavment. I enjoyed Soft but loved The Insult. Have you read Corpsing by Toby Litt? I've just finshed that and it had a similar feel all the way through (although I have to say the style did not come close to The Insult) but in the end there was no mystery or confusion. The Insult is one of my favourite books of all time. Thank you.</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson</strong> <br> rrl30 - no, I haven't read Corpsing, so there's really nothing I can say about it (though I have the feeling I met him once). I'm so glad you liked Soft and The Insult. I'm especially glad you liked my suit. </p> <p><strong>shem32 </strong><br> I also loved The Insult, and - not to annoy you with endless comparisons with other writers - found it reminded me in feel of Paul Auster's New York Trilogy. <br> Do you like Auster? Do you see any similarity? Thanks</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson</strong> <br> shem32 - I like the *idea* of Auster, but I've never read anything he's written. Since I'll be meeting him on a desert island in October, I think now's probably a good time to start. </p> <p><strong>Betsy2 </strong><br> Hello, I've just finished The Book of Revelation and found it utterly compelling - I think I was up until 3 am the night I started reading it because I was just sucked in, couldn't put it down 'til I'd finished. I have a few questions: First, how/why did you choose a dancer for the main character? Also - this is awfully book-discussion-y but I have to ask - why did you call it the Book of Revelation? Are there any comparisons (ironic, literal, snide, whatever) to the Biblical Book of Revelation? I've never read the Bible, but the day after I finished your book I got on the web and looked up this particular chapter--wierd!!! Do you have any comments on it?</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson</strong> <br> betsy2 - Thanks very much for being so compelled. I arrived at the title by a very circuitous route. For a long time the novel was called The Book of Nakedness. Then I noticed that the word 'reveal' appeared pretty frequently... The Book of Revelation had a weight to it that I liked. It also lets you know that the book is a secret that has been kept for many years and is only now being told. So the book is a revelation in that very literal sense. Nothing particularly biblical, though.</p> <p><strong>Betsy2 </strong><br> Thanks! You might be interested to know there are some strange coincidences (but maybe you only see them if you are too excited after staying up till 3 am the night before!). Thanks for a great book, and I'll certainly read your other ones</p> <p><strong>tamara </strong><br> I first noticed 'Soft' in the book shop because of its cover - it was the snazzy orange hardback edition. I went straight to it, read the blurb, and bought it. I had never heard of you... and then I read it (enjoyed it) and ironically enough, it was partly about the power (abuse) of marketing. I didn't know whether to laugh or be annoyed at my own attraction to bright colours and lush-looking book covers. Was I a victim?</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson</strong><br> tamara - There was something deliciously paradoxical about the idea of actively marketing a book that was so scathing about marketing. Also the publishers decided that it was the right time to give one of my books a push (The Insult had sold well with no hype at all - amazingly). If you were a victim, at least you were a satisfied victim. A word about that orange edition - don't leave it in the sun. It turns yellow.</p> <p><strong> nsalt </strong><br> Reading the extract of your new book reminded me of certain themes in The Insult, a greatly enjoyed read. How far is your writing informed by an exploration of the fallibility of perception? How close do you consider the link between reality and experience?</p> <p> <strong>RupertThomson</strong> <br> nsalt - I think the insult derived a lot of its power by attempting to inhabit and explore the gap between what a character perceives and some kind of fixed, objective reality. In that sense, it was a schizophrenic book to write: underneath every sentence there was a second invisible sentence. I'm interested in anything that gives me a new angle on 'everyday experience.' To put it another way, I'll quote Flannery O' Connor, one of my favourite writers: \"The task of a writer is to be concerned not with issues, not with problems, but with all those concrete details of life that make actual the mystery of our position on earth.\"</p> <p> <strong>larry1000 </strong><br> I met a man who did the marketing for Sunny Delight - apparently the launch co-incided with publication of Soft (which I loved) and caused a massive corporate nightmare - a case of life imitating art?! </p> <p><strong>RupertThomson </strong><br> larry1000 - The short answer is yes - and it's not the first time it's happened. Some time after finishing The Five Gates of Hell (a book that takes a surreal look at the death industry ) I read about two brothers in France who had recently opened a chain of death supermarkets. Perhaps I'm in the wrong business.</p> <p><strong>kudra </strong><br> Really enjoyed Revelation - thank you. A couple of questions: The description of the dancer's changing emotions while he is being held hostage, and the psychological strategies he uses to help him cope with the situation, are very vivid - did you do any research to try and get into his mind? Did you read books by/talk to people who have been in hostage/kidnap situations? <br> Also, why did you decide to set it in Amsterdam? <br> Thanks</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson </strong><br> kudra - When I'm writing fiction, I have to have a kind of blind faith in myself, especially when it comes to the psychology of my characters. I often have the feeling that I'm writing about something I know, even if I don't know how I know what I know. Louise Bourgeois said something interesting on this subject: \"I trust the unconscious. The unconscious is my friend.\" So no, no research on the Stockholm syndrome, or anything like that. A lot of research on dancers and dancing, Amsterdam etc. Why Amsterdam? The book was set there from the very beginning. It could have been set in Los Angeles, I suppose, or Paris - many cities have that hidden seam of perversity, that sense of an underworld - but Amsterdam worked perfectly. Also I'd lived there once for a year.</p> <p><strong>naomi2</strong><br> Dear Rupert, I'm intrigued. Why will you be on a desert island with Paul Auster in October? Can I come and rescue you both?</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson </strong><br> naomi2 - I've been invited to the Brisbane literary festival, along with Paul Auster, Patrick McGrath, Peter Carey (among others). If you've flown a long way, they send you on what they call a 'retreat', supposedly so you can get over your jet lag. The retreat is this case is Fraser Island, just south of the great barrier reef. It has fresh-water lakes, petrified forests. The whales are going to be breeding (or whatever they do in october). I'm not sure I'm going to need rescuing. It sounds too idyllic.</p> <p><strong>blackbird21</strong> <br> I'm half way through The Book of Revelation and like everyone else find it unputdownable. Is there anything you've read recently that has had that effect? <br> Also can you divulge anything about your next book? </p> <p><strong>RupertThomson </strong><br> blackbird 21 - I found it pretty hard to put down the last book I read - Bastard out of Carolina by Dorothy Allison. I tend not to say too much about what I'm working on. I did think of a way of describing it the other day, though: Philip K. Dick meets Voltaire.</p> <p><strong>furness</strong> <br> Who, or what, was the inspiration behind Loots? The image of Martin \"seeing\" Loots cycling home from work through deserted streets doing a variety of circus tricks is one of the most memorable and inspiring scenes I've ever read. The Insult is an absolutely wonderful book. I salute you. </p> <p><strong>RupertThomson</strong> <br> furness - I'm sorry but I have no idea where Loots came from. He just magically appeared (as he would, of course). I'm so glad you enjoyed the book.</p> <p><strong>derek03 </strong><br> Did the sexual domination and mutilation which featured in the book of revelation stem from a particular fantasy of yours? </p> <p><strong>RupertThomson </strong><br> derek03 - The scenes of sexual domination and mutilation came as a complete surprise to me, and were extremely difficult to write (I often think I write either to challenge or to surprise myself), so no, not a fantasy. A nightmare? Maybe.</p> <p><strong>kudra </strong><br> Revelation is a very visual book - the image of the white room, the meal and the performance of Swan Lake have really stayed with me. Have you been approached by any film-makers who are interested in adapting it? Do you think it's filmable? If so, who would be your first choice of director and leads? Thanks!</p> <p><strong>RupertThomson </strong><br> kudra - Following a very enthusiastic review in the New York Times I received about twenty faxes from producers, directors, etc. from all over the world, everyone from the people who made The Matrix to the director of The Exorcist. I am now in the process of selling the film rights, but it has to remain a secret for the time being.

      "bodyText": "dfic1999 Though I've not read the novel yet (it's in the queue on my shelves), I do want to ask: Is it possible to write a psychologically convincing novel of male masochism, without the cliches of pornography? Also, why a dancer? RupertThomson Obviously I think so, but I had to trust in my unconscious to do it. The cliches of pornography were actually quite useful - especially in the white room when the three women are trying to think of things that might excite the dancer: I could have them think of things like red underwear, and then have it *not* work. Why a dancer? Because I needed someone who was a) physically beautiful and b) to some extent a public figure. He could then become an object of desire. Shirleygirl I've always wondered, the mountain near Shepherd's Bush in Soft - was that real? I always mean to look when I'm going past, but not sure where it would be if indeed it exists! RupertThomson shirleygirl - if you look for the mountain now, all you'll see are rows and rows of black taxis. What happens in the novel was what happened in real life. One day the mountain was there, in the waste ground behind Paddington Station ( and yes, I did climb it), the next day it was gone. An as yet unsolved mystery. RRL30 I met you at a programme called Booked a few years ago.You had a lovely suit on with a bright blue lining and we talked about bereavment. I enjoyed Soft but loved The Insult. Have you read Corpsing by Toby Litt? I've just finshed that and it had a similar feel all the way through (although I have to say the style did not come close to The Insult) but in the end there was no mystery or confusion. The Insult is one of my favourite books of all time. Thank you. RupertThomson rrl30 - no, I haven't read Corpsing, so there's really nothing I can say about it (though I have the feeling I met him once). I'm so glad you liked Soft and The Insult. I'm especially glad you liked my suit. shem32 I also loved The Insult, and - not to annoy you with endless comparisons with other writers - found it reminded me in feel of Paul Auster's New York Trilogy. Do you like Auster? Do you see any similarity? Thanks RupertThomson shem32 - I like the *idea* of Auster, but I've never read anything he's written. Since I'll be meeting him on a desert island in October, I think now's probably a good time to start. Betsy2 Hello, I've just finished The Book of Revelation and found it utterly compelling - I think I was up until 3 am the night I started reading it because I was just sucked in, couldn't put it down 'til I'd finished. I have a few questions: First, how/why did you choose a dancer for the main character? Also - this is awfully book-discussion-y but I have to ask - why did you call it the Book of Revelation? Are there any comparisons (ironic, literal, snide, whatever) to the Biblical Book of Revelation? I've never read the Bible, but the day after I finished your book I got on the web and looked up this particular chapter--wierd!!! Do you have any comments on it? RupertThomson betsy2 - Thanks very much for being so compelled. I arrived at the title by a very circuitous route. For a long time the novel was called The Book of Nakedness. Then I noticed that the word 'reveal' appeared pretty frequently... The Book of Revelation had a weight to it that I liked. It also lets you know that the book is a secret that has been kept for many years and is only now being told. So the book is a revelation in that very literal sense. Nothing particularly biblical, though. Betsy2 Thanks! You might be interested to know there are some strange coincidences (but maybe you only see them if you are too excited after staying up till 3 am the night before!). Thanks for a great book, and I'll certainly read your other ones tamara I first noticed 'Soft' in the book shop because of its cover - it was the snazzy orange hardback edition. I went straight to it, read the blurb, and bought it. I had never heard of you... and then I read it (enjoyed it) and ironically enough, it was partly about the power (abuse) of marketing. I didn't know whether to laugh or be annoyed at my own attraction to bright colours and lush-looking book covers. Was I a victim? RupertThomson tamara - There was something deliciously paradoxical about the idea of actively marketing a book that was so scathing about marketing. Also the publishers decided that it was the right time to give one of my books a push (The Insult had sold well with no hype at all - amazingly). If you were a victim, at least you were a satisfied victim. A word about that orange edition - don't leave it in the sun. It turns yellow. nsalt Reading the extract of your new book reminded me of certain themes in The Insult, a greatly enjoyed read. How far is your writing informed by an exploration of the fallibility of perception? How close do you consider the link between reality and experience? RupertThomson nsalt - I think the insult derived a lot of its power by attempting to inhabit and explore the gap between what a character perceives and some kind of fixed, objective reality. In that sense, it was a schizophrenic book to write: underneath every sentence there was a second invisible sentence. I'm interested in anything that gives me a new angle on 'everyday experience.' To put it another way, I'll quote Flannery O' Connor, one of my favourite writers: \"The task of a writer is to be concerned not with issues, not with problems, but with all those concrete details of life that make actual the mystery of our position on earth.\" larry1000 I met a man who did the marketing for Sunny Delight - apparently the launch co-incided with publication of Soft (which I loved) and caused a massive corporate nightmare - a case of life imitating art?! RupertThomson larry1000 - The short answer is yes - and it's not the first time it's happened. Some time after finishing The Five Gates of Hell (a book that takes a surreal look at the death industry ) I read about two brothers in France who had recently opened a chain of death supermarkets. Perhaps I'm in the wrong business. kudra Really enjoyed Revelation - thank you. A couple of questions: The description of the dancer's changing emotions while he is being held hostage, and the psychological strategies he uses to help him cope with the situation, are very vivid - did you do any research to try and get into his mind? Did you read books by/talk to people who have been in hostage/kidnap situations? Also, why did you decide to set it in Amsterdam? Thanks RupertThomson kudra - When I'm writing fiction, I have to have a kind of blind faith in myself, especially when it comes to the psychology of my characters. I often have the feeling that I'm writing about something I know, even if I don't know how I know what I know. Louise Bourgeois said something interesting on this subject: \"I trust the unconscious. The unconscious is my friend.\" So no, no research on the Stockholm syndrome, or anything like that. A lot of research on dancers and dancing, Amsterdam etc. Why Amsterdam? The book was set there from the very beginning. It could have been set in Los Angeles, I suppose, or Paris - many cities have that hidden seam of perversity, that sense of an underworld - but Amsterdam worked perfectly. Also I'd lived there once for a year. naomi2 Dear Rupert, I'm intrigued. Why will you be on a desert island with Paul Auster in October? Can I come and rescue you both? RupertThomson naomi2 - I've been invited to the Brisbane literary festival, along with Paul Auster, Patrick McGrath, Peter Carey (among others). If you've flown a long way, they send you on what they call a 'retreat', supposedly so you can get over your jet lag. The retreat is this case is Fraser Island, just south of the great barrier reef. It has fresh-water lakes, petrified forests. The whales are going to be breeding (or whatever they do in october). I'm not sure I'm going to need rescuing. It sounds too idyllic. blackbird21 I'm half way through The Book of Revelation and like everyone else find it unputdownable. Is there anything you've read recently that has had that effect? Also can you divulge anything about your next book? RupertThomson blackbird 21 - I found it pretty hard to put down the last book I read - Bastard out of Carolina by Dorothy Allison. I tend not to say too much about what I'm working on. I did think of a way of describing it the other day, though: Philip K. Dick meets Voltaire. furness Who, or what, was the inspiration behind Loots? The image of Martin \"seeing\" Loots cycling home from work through deserted streets doing a variety of circus tricks is one of the most memorable and inspiring scenes I've ever read. The Insult is an absolutely wonderful book. I salute you. RupertThomson furness - I'm sorry but I have no idea where Loots came from. He just magically appeared (as he would, of course). I'm so glad you enjoyed the book. derek03 Did the sexual domination and mutilation which featured in the book of revelation stem from a particular fantasy of yours? RupertThomson derek03 - The scenes of sexual domination and mutilation came as a complete surprise to me, and were extremely difficult to write (I often think I write either to challenge or to surprise myself), so no, not a fantasy. A nightmare? Maybe. kudra Revelation is a very visual book - the image of the white room, the meal and the performance of Swan Lake have really stayed with me. Have you been approached by any film-makers who are interested in adapting it? Do you think it's filmable? If so, who would be your first choice of director and leads? Thanks! RupertThomson kudra - Following a very enthusiastic review in the New York Times I received about twenty faxes from producers, directors, etc. from all over the world, everyone from the people who made The Matrix to the director of The Exorcist. I am now in the process of selling the film rights, but it has to remain a secret for the time being. All I can reveal at this stage is, I said a big no to hollywood. mmreed Did you think the Book of Revelation would be perceived as shocking - or is that, in itself, marketing? RupertThomson mmreed - the Book of Revelation shocked me when I first started it, but, as Truman Capote says, \"writing is re-writing,\" so by the time I had gone through six or seven complete drafts of the book, it became quite literally everyday. Did Bloomsbury market it as a shocking book? That wasn't really my impression. fiveonions I agree about the Auster (do you?). Who would you cite as your literary influences? Do you read (and/or like) 'the classics'? RupertThomson fiveonions - My literary influences? Paul Bowles, William Faulkner, Flannery O' Connor, Jean Rhys, Patrick Modiano, Vladimir Nabokov. I know there are more, but I've gone blank. as for the classics, Dostoyevky, Conrad (does he count?), and there are certain books I often return to - Jane Eyre, for instance. Ccole What do you reckon to all this internet business? RupertThomson ccole - This is my first time. I keep my computer sealed off from the outside world. It would be too tempting otherwise. blackbird21 Any advice for wannabe novel writers out there? RupertThomson blackbird21 - Three pieces of advice for people trying to write fiction (two cribbed from John Cage, the composer): experiment endlessly, work hard and stay humble. Ccole Another question: have you ever considered writing under a pseudonym? What would you choose? and what kind of book do you fancy writing anonymously? RupertThomson ccole - I don't think I'm ever going to write anonymously. I'm not sure what the point would be. You usually get found out anyway (look at Joe Klein, the 'anonymous' behind Primary Colours). Having said that, there is a book I want to write which cannot be published during my lifetime. It concerns a member of my family who I have not seen for many years. Publishing the book anonymously would not provide me with sufficient distance. It will have to wait until after I'm dead. on that somewhat sombre note, goodbye.",

Although imagine how happy I'd be sitting at a computer, tapping out an article about Charlton, who have agreed a \u00a32.5m fee with Everton for Don Hutchison - the ex-Hammer is also being tracked by Coventry and Sunderland, but is thought to favour a return to London. Ah, but it's all just a pipe dream... look, are you going to buy that or not? This isn't a bloody library, you know. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I want to play for Graeme Souness. It sounds corny but he was my idol at Liverpool\" - Craig Hignett induces mass projectile vomiting upon joining Blackburn today for \u00a32.25m. HUNTING FOR A STORY If the shrill blast of the final whistle on the last day of the season is the traditional signal for Newcastle's finest to decamp to Agia Napia and get so drunk they can't remember how many young ladies they've defiled, the opposite is true, alas, for the hardened hack. Because that last whistle blow is like a hunter's horn, sounding the start of the traditional pre-season race to find to the biggest, most astonishing world-exclusive football rumour. Ever. Obviously, the Fiver plays its part - who can forget our \"Tony Yeboah has bought a luxury pad in Docklands\" or \"Southgate to Southampton\" scoops? But usually the hare we're all chasing is the Mirror's never-very-happy Harry Harris. Sadly, he's been slowing up this pre-season, and he'd better watch out, because which hound is leading the chasing pack? Why, none other than the Sun's Brian Bouffant. Scamper, scamper, scamper! With Woolnough and his pals disclosing that Liverpool's Titi Camara is probably off to Bradford for \u00a32.5m, and that Paul Merson is sure to be leaving Villa after having another pop at the hapless John Gregory, Harry the Hare needs to catch a second wind. And in the nick of time, by revealing Internazionale have made an \"astonishing\" \u00a331m bid for Paul Scholes, he managed it. His tale - the United board are apparently tempted to take the money, although Sir Alex Ferguson does not want to sell - certainly convinces us. But there's a spiked trap ahead, in the form of United chairman Martin Edwards: \"I have not spoken to anybody from Inter and no bid has been made.\" Jump as high as you can, Harry, and you just might make it! THE RUMOUR MILL Manchester United are lining up an \u00a311m bid for Internazionale's Javier Zanetti - but they face competition from Barcelona and Real Madrid. Everton are expected to move for \u00a36m-rated Neil Lennon to counter the expected departures of Don Hutchinson, John Collins and Nick Barmby. Cambridge's 21 year-old striker Trevor Benjamin is poised to complete a \u00a31.5m move to Leicester. NEWS IN BRIEF South African officials have laid the blame for the Zimbabwe stadium tragedy on police over-reaction. Policemen fired tear gas into the 60,000 crowd at the National Stadium in Harare which caused a stampede in which at least 13 people were killed. \"It was not crowd violence, but rather the response from the police forced them to try and get out from under the tear gas canisters fired into the crowd,\" claimed Danny Jordaan, chairman of South Africa's failed bid for the 2006 World Cup. Bolton have been charged by the FA with failing to control their players in their Division One play-off match against Ipswich. Bolton had Robbie Elliott and Mike Whitlow sent off and eight other players booked by referee Barry Knight, who also awarded Ipswich three controversial penalties. The club have been given a suspended fine of \u00a325,000. Leeds are to appeal after the Department for Education and Employment rejected their application for a work permit for Mark Viduka. The DfEE claim the \u00a36m signing from Celtic does not meet their set criteria because he has not played enough internationals for Australia in the last two years. Birmingham have signed Fulham striker Geoff Horsfield for a club record \u00a32.25m. The 26-year-old has agreed a five-year deal. Leeds have been handed a major boost with the news that South Africa will not force skipper Lucas Radebe to play in the Sydney Olympics. Luton have appointed their former England midfielder Ricky Hill as manager to succeed Lennie Lawrence, who was sacked a week ago following a change in the ownership of the club. Hill, 41, played for Luton for 14 years. Steve Bull is to become a coach at Hereford.

      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland shut down early this afternoon in anticipation of widespread protests linked to the Orange Order's controversial Drumcree march. In Portadown, where the local Orange Order has called for street protests after its parade was banned from the Garvaghy Road, shops closed early and roads were filled by the cars of people trying to get home before the expected demonstrations. Orangemen from Portadown, Co Armagh, have called on supporters throughout Ulster to turn out between 4pm and 8pm today for demonstrations over their annual parade. They were yesterday prevented from returning from Drumcree Parish Church via the predominantly Catholic Garvaghy Road for the third year in succession. The Orange Order issued a statement from its Belfast headquarters calling for the demonstrations to remain peaceful. \"The protests called for this afternoon must be peaceful and it is the responsibility of the local organisers to ensure this is the case,\" the statement issued from the House of Orange said. \"It is essential that protests are not used by malcontents, who have no real interest in the Orange institution, as a cover for violence. \"To those who have or would engage in violence we can only say STOP. You are not acting on our behalf. Your actions damage an honourable cause.\" Over the past eight nights Drumcree and other parts of the province have erupted in disturbances linked to the dispute. Last night missiles were hurled at police and troops behind the large steel barrier and rolls of barbed wire blocking their path at Drumcree. Earlier Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson issued a firm warning that loyalists were \"very, very mistaken\" if they believed violence and bullying would overturn the ban. His words were echoed by first minister David Trimble, himself an Orangeman, who said dialogue was the only way the Portadown Orangemen could achieve their aims. \"I hope very much that people today and on succeeding days will be calm, will be peaceful, that there will be no violence whatsoever.\" \"I have to say to anyone who does resort to violence that they serve no cause at all, and will only bring dishonour and disgrace on the cause they profess to support,\" Mr Trimble said. Their warnings came after a hoax bomb alert at the home of a member of the government-appointed parades commission, the body which ruled against the Orangemen's march. Army bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion on the object outside Billy Martin's house in Greyabbey, Co Down.",

And it's taken an equally envious look at the sales figures of the Rover MGF, whose price it undercuts. (You can still buy an MGF for a couple of hundred pounds less than a Toyota, but it will have a less powerful engine.) </p> <p>As a rule of thumb, the closer the back of your neck is to the tarmac, the more authentic the sports car you are driving. In the Toyota, one sits pretty much upright, as in a slightly go-ahead estate car. In fact, I reckon you could just about walk into the MR2 without breaking stride.

Toyota say their engineers thought hard about the MR2's weight and they are able to boast that the car has the best power-to-weight ratio in its class. It does indeed slip neatly around corners, but it does so quietly and politely. If you stamp down on the pedals you can get something approximating to a boisterous roar out of it, but you have the impression that the 1.8-litre engine would rather, on the whole, that you didn't. Again, some will find this a drawback - or even a sell-out - while others, who don't necessarily wish to drive in a permanent state of white-knuckled frenzy, will respond more warmly. </p> <p>In the English climate, even more than engine performance, ease of opening and closing your sports car's roof is the key consideration. It's something you're going to be doing a lot of, so you don't want to end up with some laughably optimistic mechanism that leaves you looking like someone haplessly trying to crush an umbrella into a waste basket. (Incidentally, like using a hand-held mobile phone, or eating Chinese food, roof removal is not something one ought to practice while actually in motion. And especially not on motorways, or on the slip-roads leading on to motorways.) </p> <p>The Mercedes SLK has a fully-automatic roof that smoothly does its stuff above your head at the touch of a button. It's impossible to top this for a Bond-style roof removal experience (and working on an appropriately aloof facial expression to hold while the Mercedes' roof mechanism was in business remains one of the most enjoyable projects I have ever got involved with in a car). But the SLK also costs about three times as much as the MR2 and beggars can't be choosers, so with the Toyota you'll have to do the heavy work yourself. </p> <p>To be fair, they've gone a long way towards lightening the burden. Blessedly, there are no poppers involved at any stage of the process. (Anything involving poppers and a piece of slightly rain-shrunken canvas is route one to hell. Go to a rally of Caterham owners: none of them has a full set of fingernails.) You spring the two mildly resistant clips above the windscreen and then hoist the roof behind you.

What was Toyota thinking of? At least closing the roof can be achieved entirely from within the vehicle, though, as I reached behind me for the handles and heaved, I tended to find myself assuming the less than dignified position of someone failing to perform a bench press, and MR2 owners on first dates might like to bear that possibility in mind. </p> <p>After removing the roof it would have been nice to have been able to remove a couple of things from the MR2's interior, in particular the ugly Sony hi-fi that comes as standard and the inside door handles, which are tubular and intended to have a sporty aluminium appearance, but actually look like devices from an elderly person's bathroom. Even with those out of the way, there would be, of course, no room in the car for much other than you and a friend. </p> <p>Dispense with the friend, though, and the car does hint at some practical applications. As part of my commitment to testing the vehicle in a broad variety of extreme urban settings, I took it to Sainsbury's, where I learned that actually the Toyota MR2 does function as a family shopping car, as long as you don't buy anything large and unpliable, such as boxes of cereal. Better, of course, to abandon such considerations, push the roof down and find some open road.

After removing the roof it would have been nice to have been able to remove a couple of things from the MR2's interior, in particular the ugly Sony hi-fi that comes as standard and the inside door handles, which are tubular and intended to have a sporty aluminium appearance, but actually look like devices from an elderly person's bathroom. Even with those out of the way, there would be, of course, no room in the car for much other than you and a friend. Dispense with the friend, though, and the car does hint at some practical applications. As part of my commitment to testing the vehicle in a broad variety of extreme urban settings, I took it to Sainsbury's, where I learned that actually the Toyota MR2 does function as a family shopping car, as long as you don't buy anything large and unpliable, such as boxes of cereal. Better, of course, to abandon such considerations, push the roof down and find some open road. But - with the MR2 - not too open.

Ibrahim had apparently been named by intel-ligence sources as fixing a game against England at Sharjah in 1999 - England's only win on that trip. </p> <p><strong>Thursday June 1</strong><br> India's Central Bureau of Investigation reveals plans to quiz <strong>Ajit Wadekar</strong> and ex-Test opener <strong>Navjot Sidhu</strong>. <strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> had claimed that Sidhu witnessed an alleged bribe offered by <strong>Kapil Dev</strong>, and that Wadekar, team manager at the time, was informed. </p> <p><strong>Friday June 2</strong><br> <strong>Hansie Cronje</strong> hands a confession to the King Commission: \"In a moment of stupidity and weakness, I allowed Satan and the world to dictate terms to me. The moment I took my eyes off Jesus, my whole world turned dark.\" India's tax department says it is preparing to look at the tax returns of those whose names have cropped up in investigations. </p> <p><strong>Saturday June 3</strong><br> Ex-Indian player <strong>Ajay Sharma</strong> denies allegations about his part in match-fixing. <strong>Wasim Akram</strong> leaves Channel 4's TV commentary team by mutual agreement. He goes on Pakistan's tour of Sri Lanka instead. </p> <p> <strong>Sunday June 4</strong><br> <strong>Bacher</strong> confirms that mobile phones have been banned from the SA dressing-room. The CBI begins examination of Prabhakar's 40 hours of video. </p> <p><strong>Monday June 5</strong><br>Australia's <strong>Dean Jones</strong> says he would fear for his life were he to identify the Indian player who introduced him to a bookmaker seeking forecasts in 1992. \"All the players thought it was a bit funny,\" he says of the $50,000 offer made to him. \"It is not funny now.\" </p> <p> <strong>Tuesday June 6</strong><br> <strong>Kapil Dev's</strong> counsel says he will file a suit against <strong>IS Bindra</strong>, the ex-Indian Board president, who said Kapil offered <strong>Prabhakar</strong> money to play badly in a 1994 one-dayer. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday June 7</strong><br> Play finally gets under way at the King Commission. Former SA offspinner <strong>Pat Symcox</strong> says that on the eve of a home one-dayer against Pakistan in Jan 1995, he was called to Cronje's hotel room to discuss an offer to throw the match. He told Cronje to reject it. Symcox claims he was approached by \"a current international\", whom he declines to name, to throw a match. He again rejected the offer. Referring to the $250,000 the South Africans were offered [to throw the <strong>Mohinder Amarnath</strong> benefit one-dayer in 1996], Symcox says the team debated the offer, but were persuaded, chiefly by <strong>Andrew Hudson</strong>, <strong>Daryll Cullinan</strong> and <strong>Derek Crookes</strong>, to turn it down. </p> <p><strong>Thursday June 8</strong><br> <strong>Herschelle Gibbs</strong> admits that he accepted $15,000 from Cronje to be out for less than 20 in the 5th ODI v India at Nagpur in March. He says <strong>Henry Williams</strong>, his room-mate, agreed a similar sum to concede 50 runs in his 10 overs. In fact, Gibbs hit 74 off 53 balls and Williams did not complete his spell because of injury. Gibbs hit his first two balls for four, then \"batted like a steam train\", and never got the money. He said his parents were divorcing and he needed to look after his mother. He admitted to lying about it eight times. He had come clean after <strong>Mark Boucher</strong> told him he could go to jail if he didn't tell the truth. </p> <p>Offspinner <strong>Derek Crookes</strong> broadly confirms Symcox's account of the $250,000 offer. He also relates his surprise at being asked to open the bowling by Cronje in an ODI in India this year. </p> <p><strong>Daryll Cullinan</strong> calls the Mumbai offer \"a stroke of genius\" from Cronje - a moral test for the team at the end of a hard tour. </p> <p> <strong>Friday June 9</strong><br> The <strong>UCB</strong> drops <strong>Gibbs</strong> from SA's imminent tour of Sri Lanka. He will be subject to a disciplinary hearing. </p> <p><strong>Saturday June 10</strong><br> <strong>Ali Bacher</strong>, who has claimed that some World Cup '99 matches were fixed, and that an umpire has been on the bookies' payroll, names his sources: former Pakistan Board chief executive <strong>Majid Khan</strong>, ex-PCB president <strong>Javed Burki</strong>, and an Indian bookmaker, <strong> \"Mr R\" </strong>, whom he does not name for safety reasons. Bacher says Majid mentioned Pakistan's World Cup defeats by India and Bangladesh. </p> <p>The 1998 Headingley Test is discussed. <strong>Bacher</strong> says ten lbw decisions were given - nine by Pakistan's <strong>Javed Akhtar</strong>, eight against SA. Bacher phoned Mr R to ask if the umpire could have been bought. Mr R's answer was \"possibly\", but later he confirmed \"the umpire was on the payroll\". <strong>Hansie Cronje</strong> is offered immunity from prosecution in South Africa - if he is \"absolutely honest\". The UCB says the offer does not preclude disciplinary action. </p> <p><strong>Monday June 12</strong><br> <strong>Lance Klusener</strong> and <strong>Mark Boucher</strong> confirm that they, with <strong>Jacques Kallis</strong>, were approached by Cronje before the second Test against India in March. <strong>Cronje</strong> told them they could make money, but they took it as a joke. <strong>Klusener</strong> says \"whoever received the [Mumbai] call should have said we would have nothing to do with it\". In Colombo, Sri Lanka's newly elected Board says it is setting up an independent match-fixing panel. <strong>Majid Khan</strong> backs Ali Bacher's World Cup claims: \"Whatever Bacher has stated about me is correct and I stand by his statement that those matches were fixed.\" <strong>Aunshuman Gaekwad</strong>, India's World Cup coach, denies that their win over Pakistan was fixed, saying: \"I went to the Pakistan dressing-room and the players were very depressed by the defeat.\" </p> <p><strong>Tuesday June 13</strong><br>Former SA wicketkeeper <strong>Dave Richardson</strong> tells the Commission that a current international player made a bribery offer to Pat Symcox in India in 1996. Fearing death threats, Richardson refuses to name the player until Symcox does. <strong>Jacques Kallis</strong> corroborates Boucher and Klusener. He says most of the team, including him, were opposed to Cronje's declaration against England at Centurion. Attorney <strong>Peter Soller</strong> alleges that Ali Bacher was involved in pay-ments to a rebel West Indian team for losing to a South African XI at Jo'burg in the '80s. The tourists had refused to resume play after a pay dispute. Bacher, it is alleged, agreed a further payment should they lose. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday June 14</strong><br> <strong>Bacher</strong> denies it: \"This is ... the gravest possible imputation against my character.\" Former PCB secretary <strong>Arif Abbasi</strong> accuses Bacher of implicating Pakistanis to \"divert the world's attention\". </p> <p><strong>Thursday June 15</strong><br> <strong>Cronje</strong> submits a 6300-word statement to the King Commission. He admits to taking four bribes, and announces that his career \"at representative level\" is over. He admits to pressurising Gibbs and Williams to keep quiet, and urges the UCB not to ban them. He received $80,000 in 1996 and 1997 from <strong>Mukesh Gupta</strong>, who was introduced to him by <strong>Mohammad Azharuddin</strong>. He took $30,000 to give wickets away in a decisive Test at Kanpur, 1996-97. He says they did not do so, but lost heavily anyway. \"I had effectively received money for doing nothing and I rationalised to myself that this was somehow acceptable.\" </p> <p> <strong>Cronje</strong> says he was offered \"an unspecified gift\" by bookmaker <strong>Marlon Aronstam</strong> for ensuring a positive result at Centurion. <strong>Nasser Hussain</strong> agreed to Cronje's offer of a double forfeiture, although Cronje stresses that none of the England party knew of any bribes. After England won, Aronstam gave Cronje a leather jacket and 50,000 rand. </p> <p> Cronje admits giving information to a man believed to be <strong>Sanjeev Chawla</strong> (\"Sanjay\") during the 1999-2000 one-day series involving Zimbabwe and England, in exchange for $10-15,000. Finally, Cronje says he has received death threats. In Sydney, <strong>Mark Taylor</strong> says no Australians took any form of bribe while he was captain. </p> <p> <strong>Friday June 16</strong><br> In Delhi, <strong>Azharuddin</strong> refutes Cronje's allegations. \"They [the SA authorities] want revenge since it was the Delhi police which first caught Cronje on tape talking to bookies about match-fixing.\" Azhar also denies knowing Gupta. </p> <p><strong>Saturday June 17</strong><br> An affidavit signed by a Cape Town businessman claims that <strong>Brian Lara</strong> was given \u00a34500 in cash during a 1993 one-day tournament in South Africa. It is alleged that Lara was betting, not match-fixing. Lara issues a swift denial. </p> <p>Scotland Yard says it is seeking to establish links between the Asian syndicate that allegedly approached <strong>Chris Lewis</strong> and the one that dealt with Cronje in India. </p> <p><strong>Sunday June 18</strong><br> <strong>Mike Atherton</strong> writes: \"Looking back it is easy to see that Cronje's bowling changes and field placings [at Centurion]... were designed to prevent the draw.\" <strong>Nasser Hussain</strong> says it \"will always be remembered as a Test that was fixed for a few quid\". </p> <p><strong>Monday June 19</strong><br> Pakistan's <strong>Rashid Latif</strong> offers to go to India to help the police. \"I have a lot to tell,\" he says. ECB boss <strong>Lord MacLaurin</strong> says he expects ICC to ban players found to have been involved in match-fixing, raising doubts about England's 2000-01 tour of Pakistan. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday June 20</strong><br> <strong>Ajit Wadekar</strong>, quizzed by the CBI, denies that Manoj Prabhakar told him of Kapil Dev's alleged offer. <strong>Imran Khan</strong> says Bacher is \"two-faced\" and \"vindictive to Pakistan and India\". PCB chairman <strong>Lt-Gen Tauqir Zia</strong> demands \"strong action\" against Bacher. Rashid <strong>Latif</strong> says Cronje's statement is incomplete, and he \"should have named Australians who are also involved\". </p> <p><strong>Wednesday June 21</strong><br> Cross-examined at last, <strong>Cronje</strong> admits to \"an unfortunate love of money\". He discloses a further payment of $35,000, from an unknown source in Jan 1997. <strong>Dr Ian Lewis</strong> says Cronje is suffering from clinical depression and has been on medication since May. </p> <p><strong>Thursday June 22</strong><br><strong>Azharuddin</strong> is quizzed for five hours about Cronje by investigators in Delhi. <strong>Cronje</strong> says that Azhar did not know of his transactions with Gupta. Cronje says of the Indian transcripts: \"95% of the time, I was stringing Sanjay along.\" </p> <p><strong>Friday June 23</strong><br>After 10 hours of testimony, <strong>Cronje</strong> cracks and is led, sobbing, from the witness box. He admits that the $10-15,000 paid to him by <strong>Sanjay Chawla</strong> had been a deposit for a match in the triangular series which he was to fix if SA were sure of a place in the final. <strong>Shamila Batohi</strong>, the lead advocate, confirms that Cronje may be recalled if fresh evidence emerges. </p> <p> Bookmaker <strong>Marlon Aronstam</strong> testifies that Cronje offered to throw a one-day match if it was meaningless. \"He said he had Pieter Strydom, Gibbs and Nicky Boje on side,\" says Aronstam. \"I was shocked. We hadn't even known each other for an hour.\" Boje and Strydom deny any involvement. </p> <p><strong>Saturday June 24</strong><br> <strong>Lord MacLaurin</strong> calls for toughness as ICC meets: \"We must deal with this in a strong way.\" </p> <p><strong>Sunday June 25</strong><br> The Sunday Telegraph unmasks <strong>Sir Paul Condon</strong>, ex-Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, as the ICC's first anti-corruption investigator. <strong>Ewie Cronje</strong>, Hansie's father, says his son wants to give back all the money he received from bookmakers and start a new life. </p> <p><strong>Monday June 26</strong><br> The King Commission takes a break as planned. <strong>Hamid \"Banjo\" Cassim</strong>, the man who introduced Sanjay Chawla to Cronje, denies helping to bribe him - but admits to receiving many telephone calls from Chawla, who was keen to locate Cronje in India. <strong>Lord MacLaurin</strong> says England's tour of Pakistan will go ahead. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday June 28</strong><br> <strong>Sri Lankan police</strong> deny that <strong>Nicky Boje</strong> will be arrested when he arrives with the SA tour party. <strong>WI's Board</strong> clears Brian Lara of allegations about betting in SA in '93. <strong>Mukesh Gupta</strong> emerges from a grilling by the CBI to say that although he enjoys a \"special relationship\" with Azharuddin, they never engaged in match-fixing. <strong>Bishan Bedi</strong>, the former Indian captain, calls for a King-style open enquiry to clean up cricket in India: \"We need to be more upright. We need people of integrity.\" The Cape Times receives erroneous reports suggesting that Cronje has committed suicide. </p> <p><strong>Thursday June 29</strong><br> <strong>Justice King</strong>, due to submit his initial findings today, gets an extension to Aug 11. He has 1143 pages of transcripts to study - and, ominously, some \"new evidence\". </p> <p><strong>Friday June 30</strong><br> Indian Sports Minister <strong>Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa</strong> encourages players to help the CBI in their probe into match-fixing, hinting at a possible amnesty: \"The government will be lenient to cricketers who will come forward to help the agencies.\" </p> <p><strong>Ram Jethmalani</strong>, Indian Law Minister, backs up Dhindsa's promise. He says that \"if there is genuine repentance and remorse, then the fact that the cricketers are suffering public humiliation should be considered enough punishment and we should forgive and forget.\" </p> <p>The King Commission is continuing to attempt to obtain copies of the tapes containing alleged conversations between Hansie Cronje and Sanjay Chawla. \"We are pursuing the matter through diplomatic channels and hope that we would be able to receive them so that we can complete our work,\" says the Commission's prosecutor Sharmila Bahoti. </p>",

Their lives will be screened 24-hours a day and seven days a week on the web, and every weekday on Channel 4, with a finale each Friday where one participant will be ceremoniously ejected. Their lives and personal (one can no longer say \"private\") moments will be the property of the audience. The audience is worldwide. </p> <p>But Big Brother also represents the adventure of independent television moving into interactivity and of web design into the world of television. These two fields are represented by production company GMG Endemol and web developers Victoria Real. </p> <p>For an independent like GMG Endemol, which first began the Big Brother project last year in Holland, worldwide marketing via the web is a gift to be grabbed quickly, particularly as the door may not be open forever. </p> <p>The set of Big Brother is at the Three Mills film studios in east London.

      "bodyText": "Big Brother is a new Channel 4 series in which 10 volunteers will spend more than two months locked in a house, deprived of any contact with the outside world, in an environment where every single activity is followed by camera. Their activities will be documented, commented upon, scrutinised. Their lives will be screened 24-hours a day and seven days a week on the web, and every weekday on Channel 4, with a finale each Friday where one participant will be ceremoniously ejected. Their lives and personal (one can no longer say \"private\") moments will be the property of the audience. The audience is worldwide. But Big Brother also represents the adventure of independent television moving into interactivity and of web design into the world of television. These two fields are represented by production company GMG Endemol and web developers Victoria Real. For an independent like GMG Endemol, which first began the Big Brother project last year in Holland, worldwide marketing via the web is a gift to be grabbed quickly, particularly as the door may not be open forever. The set of Big Brother is at the Three Mills film studios in east London. The house where the participants will live has been built from scratch on an island, its cameras and microphones and remote controls connected via massive cables that run across a moat to the studio gallery where the video splits into two. One for the web, the other for a television audience. The Big Brother website, like a newspaper with video, has six live video feeds, some running round the clock, that are watched by an editorial team of 18 whose job is to monitor, log, and report on the participants. The slightest change in environment, such as person X touching person Y, or person Z having a quiet time alone, is logged on the television crew's computer network. On the cyber side, adding editorial pages to a site which is read by 5m people each day is no mean feat.

      "body": "<p>Television news matters. It is not just that evening bulletins, even with the demise of News at Ten, command a combined audience of nearly 20m viewers every day; nor that more than two-thirds of viewers themselves consistently say that television is their main source of national and international news. It matters because it is one of the most vital guarantors of an informed and aware electorate. </p> <p>If a healthy democracy relies on having citizens who can make informed political choices about who should represent them, and who can then contribute to the debates being conducted by their political representatives, then television remains the most powerful means of enhancing political awareness and democratic participation. </p> <p>This is why the continuing controversy about moving News at Ten is more than just an arcane debate about the art of scheduling. We may be in an era of 24-hour news channels, interactive websites and news on the move via Wap phones, but for the vast majority of us it is still the mass audience evening bulletins that keep us in touch with the world. </p> <p>What is happening to the content of those bulletins is therefore of more than academic interest. And the conventional view, being repeated with increasing vigour around dinner tables and in opinion columns, is that television news is dumbing down. </p> <p>Some of the most prestigious names from the BBC and ITN have been adding their considerable weight to the depressing message that a growing emphasis on the sensational, the shallow and the parochial has been driving out the complex, serious and outward-looking: that British television news, once the backbone of an informed British electorate, has been heading inexorably downmarket. </p> <p>In one of the most comprehensive long-term studies of British television news content, we set out to test that hypothesis. We analysed more than 700 evening news bulletins on the four mass audience television channels, taking one year in five over a period of 24 years fom 1975 to 1999. We covered all four evening bulletins on the BBC and ITV as well as Channel 4 News (which launched in 1982) and Channel 5 News (now three years old). </p> <p>Each story in selected bulletins was timed and coded into one of 31 categories for domestic news, while foreign news was separately coded by country. For ease of comparison, we then grouped all categories together under three broad headings: broadsheet, tabloid and foreign. The last of these is uncontentious, but we should stress that the broadsheet and tabloid labels were descriptive terms designed to contrast political, economic or social affairs coverage with items on consumer issues, crime, sport and so on. We were not attempting to pass judgment on whether some items were \"better\" or \"worse\" than others. Our aim was simply to track changes over time. </p> <p>We believe the results defy many - though not all - of the doom-merchants' worst fears. The BBC Nine O'Clock News and Channel 4 News, in particular, have sustained consistently high levels of broadsheet and foreign coverage over the whole measurement period (starting in Channel 4's case in 1985). The level of tabloid news on the Nine, from a low starting point of 16% of bulletin time in 1975, has actually declined to 13% in 1999. The highest level it reached was 23% in 1985. </p> <p>The balance of coverage on the Nine has fluctuated between broadsheet domestic and foreign stories, depending on the issues of the moment: in 1975, for example, industrial relations turmoil and high political tension meant that broadsheet news dominated and foreign news was only 24% of bulletin time; by 1999, with extensive coverage of Kosovo and its ramifications, foreign coverage had nearly doubled to 43%. Channel 4 News has been even more consistent, with tabloid coverage never rising above 12% of bulletin time and foreign coverage always around 40% regardless of the nature of dominant stories. </p> <p>A different pattern emerges in the early-evening bulletins, where tabloid content has increased over the past 10 years - but still represents only a third of ITV's news and less than 30% of the BBC's. In both cases, tabloid coverage fell to a low in 1990, when the news was dominated by the political machinations which culminated in Margaret Thatcher's resignation, by the Gulf war and by the continuing collapse of communism. In both cases, while the 1999 level of tabloid coverage was the highest over the measurement period, the proportion of foreign coverage was higher than in 1975. </p> <p>To some extent, the changes in the 1990s can be attributed to real fluctuations in hard political news on the domestic front. It is also, we believe, attributable to a deliberate editorial policy, in the BBC's case including a fundamental news review in the early 1990s. On both channels, there has been a greater emphasis on covering issues that are more suited to a early evening bulletins while at the same time doing justice to the major domestic and foreign stories of the day. </p> <p>ITN's News at Ten has also been consistent in its foreign coverage, which has never fallen below 25%. In the late 1990s, however, there does seem to have been a tangible and sudden shift in the balance of domestic news where tabloid coverage rose from 26% in 1995 to 42% in 1999. Although the 1999 figure is based on only four bulletins before the schedules changed, the trend has continued (to a slightly lesser extent) with the ITV Evening News and Nightly News: tabloid coverage for each is around a third of bulletin time. </p> <p>Do we take this as evidence that, in the words of ITN's former political editor Michael Brunson, \"There is a growing reluctance to confront viewers with items that are intellectually demanding\"? Or do we go with Nigel Dacre, ITN's editor of ITV news, who responded that trends towards a greater diversity of issues reflect a wider societal shift rather than a dumbed down editorial agenda? </p> <p>At the moment, we tend towards Dacre's view. Taken as a whole, we have today a diverse array of news programmes which contrast starkly with the dull and unstimulating uniformity of news bulletins 25 years ago, when editorial agendas on the four evening bulletins were almost indistinguishable. From the more highbrow Nine O'Clock News to the overtly more populist Channel 5 News, bulletins are more likely to be tailored to a specific audience and more consciously branded - but not a single one comprises, on average, a majority of tabloid content. </p> <p>Compared to news output in some of the competitive broadcasting systems on the continent or in America, where crime, showbiz and human interest stories consistently dominate the agenda, Britain has maintained a healthy balance of serious, light and foreign coverage. </p> <p>This study does not, of course, take into account some of the more subjective issues of news coverage, such as presentation, language or treatment of stories. It could not distinguish between two completely different approaches to the same story, and it is possible that a different study might find a serious decline in the real informational content of some approaches to news presentation. If, for example, the public learns nothing more about the debate over Britain's role in Europe than that Tony Blair has clashed with Lionel Jospin or that Peter Mandelson can barely speak to Gordon Brown, public understanding of this complex issue will hardly be enhanced. </p> <p>The most difficult question about treatment, however, is over the vexed question of \"accessibility\" or how a story is framed. We saw with the floods in Mozambique that some bulletins chose understandably to focus on the human tragedy while the BBC Nine O'Clock News analysed the complex socio-economic and political context of the disaster. </p> <p>This is not a question of right or wrong. But there is a fine balance between making issues accessible and relying on the controversial or sensational to maintain the interest of the audience. And despite our broadly positive conclusion about the diversity and vitality of television news, there are indications that this notion of \"accessibility\" may be starting to invade the editorial agenda - illustrated in particular by the decline in coverage of politics and the rise in time devoted to consumer stories and sport. </p> <p>By 1999, coverage of political affairs had fallen to its lowest level in the 24-year period on all channels, a decline which is even greater if coverage of industrial disputes in the earlier years is included. By contrast, consumer news had risen significantly on the ITV bulletins and on the BBC early-evening bulletin, while sport had increased every where except the Nine O'Clock News and Channel 4 News. On the other hand, crime stories, which are often seen as a major indicator of \"dumbing down\", consistently represented less than 10% of bulletin time on all channels except Channel 5, where it stood at 11%. </p> <p>Our concern is that this may represent the beginning of a trend rather than a blip. To date, the combination of a strong public broadcaster and a firm regulatory framework has ensured that television can move with the times but still maintain a broadly serious approach to news coverage. As the pressure grows on all broadcasters to cut budgets while servicing more news outlets and maintaining audience share in a crowded marketplace, arguments for more \"accessible\" and \"consumer-friendly\" news can quickly become arguments for bigger audiences, boosting stories about crime, Hollywood and the royal family. </p> <p>British broadcasters across the board should be proud of the contribution their news bulletins make to expanding our horizons and creating a healthier democracy. The great test is whether, in the face of intense market pressures and challenges from other news sources, they can maintain today's diversified approach. </p> <p>\u0095 From Callaghan to Kosovo: Changing Trends in British Television News 1975-1999, by Steven Barnett, Emily Seymour and Ivor Gaber is available from the University of Westminster, tel 020 7911 5981 or email <a href=\"mailto:S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk\">S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk</a> The study was funded jointly by the ITC and the BBC.</p>",

The great test is whether, in the face of intense market pressures and challenges from other news sources, they can maintain today's diversified approach. \u0095 From Callaghan to Kosovo: Changing Trends in British Television News 1975-1999, by Steven Barnett, Emily Seymour and Ivor Gaber is available from the University of Westminster, tel 020 7911 5981 or email S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk The study was funded jointly by the ITC and the BBC.",

      "body": "<p>Question: When is an advert a commercial message and when is it a distraction? Answer: It depends on the recipient's mood. </p> <p>Which is why the same expensively crafted message sent to the same person at different times can have very different effects depending on how that consumer is feeling. Small wonder, then, that with all the opportunities for round-the-clock advertising that the 24-hour society and new technology provide, adland is shifting its focus - away from pigeonholing consumers into different age or social groups and towards a better understanding of its audiences' state of mind. </p> <p>According to new research out next week, consumers have never been more set on individualism and self-expression. And never have they been more set against pigeonholing and rigid classification - long-standing tools integral to the adman's trade. \"There is a mood of aggressive self-determination,\" says Caroline Chandy, director of the trends group at Publicis, the advertising agency which is behind the report. \"It's a mood shaped by the growing realisation since the late 80s that 'you're on your own'.\" </p> <p>The demise of job security and high-profile food scares are just two factors which have rocked the stability of established institutions and trust in them. The result? A nation of increasingly opinionated individuals (for proof, look no further than our increased willingness to complain) who expect the companies they deal with to have as discerning an outlook on the world as they do and to demonstrate a clearly identifiable set of values through how they behave. </p> <p>\"Consumers are no longer prepared to be pigeonholed - and it's becoming increasingly difficult to do so,\" Chandy says. \"Instead, advertisers must now target attitudes and aspirations rather than lifestyle - associating their products with a viewpoint or feeling rather than identifying themselves with a particular age or social group.\" Where once we used brands to help define ourselves, more and more now we are using brands that fit ideas about ourselves that we already have, she adds: \"Increasingly we're using brands to suit different needs at different times.\" </p> <p>This, of course, is making the advertisers' job increasingly difficult. Which is why a growing number of ad agencies are starting to ask the previously un-askable in an attempt to understand better what we want and how we feel. Not so long ago it was enough for them simply to shout their messages at us. Now they are working hard to understand when to catch us in the right state of mind. </p> <p>Obviously many different factors can affect our mood. Economic conditions and national events play their part and can sometimes have a significant effect. In 1997, studies show, the death of the Princess of Wales was followed by a nose-dive in consumer recall and awareness of many familiar ad campaigns. Less dramatic triggers, however, should also be taken into account, according to psychologist Dr Aric Sigman who has analysed how more everyday occurrences can impact on people's moods and how these can make them more or less responsive to ads. </p> <p>\"For obvious reasons, advertising food when people aren't hungry isn't so good an idea, and the same principle can be applied to many other situations,\" he says. One area under-exploited by advertisers is our desire for sensory stimulation - which is particularly acute after we've been without access to media for some time, such as after a long drive. This is why advertising in public toilets can be effective: \"It's one of the few times in life when an advertiser can be guaranteed a captive audience, and [an audience] that is so used to being bombarded with messages that when it is not it actively seeks them out,\" he says. </p> <p>Until now there has been little attention paid to how we feel and how that shapes our receptiveness to advertising. While many studies track the bigger, social trends, few have attempted to understand how moods shift according to when an audience sees an ad, what they are doing and their state of mind at the time. This is set to change, however, with ad agency McCann Erickson among the first to take the mood of its consumers very seriously indeed. In an attempt to ensure its advertising matches recipients' states of mind more closely, a rolling study is logging consumers' mood fluctuations throughout the day. </p> <p>\"We call it Truman Show research - where people tell us half-hourly for a week exactly what they've done when, with whom, for how long and exposed to which media,\" explains Jim Kite, director of global research for the agency's media and planning arm, Universal McCann. From this data you can tell the different moods that different consumers are likely to be in at different times of the day. This knowledge is primarily used for deciding which ads will run in which media and when. \"If an ad contains a lot of information we can avoid scheduling it at times when consumers are feeling stressed,\" he says. </p> <p>So, an advertiser targeting younger consumers should avoid communication between 3-4pm when this audience is likely to feel most stressed and least in the mood for receiving and responding to an ad, McCann's study suggests. Home-based mothers, meanwhile, have highest attention levels around 10am, lunchtime and after 7.30pm each night - three points in the day when they are most likely to feel positive and relaxed. </p> <p>Already, one alcohol brand is targeting its advertising on Friday and Saturday nights according to its audience's mood. Increasingly, however, Kite expects such insights to be fed into the creative process to help shape the type of advertisements being devised. \"I envisage a time when we have a number of different ads for one advertiser which will be used at different times of the day or week to best match consumers' particular state of mind,\" he says. \"We are now exploring the potential for just this with a major coffee brand.\" </p> <p>One factor increasingly guaranteed to put today's consumers into a bad mood, however, is being bombarded with commercial messages when they least want them. Historically, certain locations - such as the office - were ad-free zones. Not so now, however, with more workplaces allowing radios and even TVs to play during office hours, and with growing workplace access to the internet. All of which presents not so much a new opportunity for advertisers, but a considerable risk. </p> <p>\"We can't target ads at people any time, any place, anywhere just because technology allows us to or we will end up alienating everyone,\" says Rick Sareen, a director of new-media agency Media 21 which is exploring the potential for advertising to people on the move using the new generation of Wap mobile phones. \"The right timing and the most appropriate content will be critical - far more so than when all an advertiser had to care about was running their new campaign on TV.\" </p> <p>Adland's new Holy Grail, he adds, will be to create advertising to elicit the same type of response that MG owners have on receiving any information about their cars. \"They don't see this information as advertising but content. The goal must be to create messages so in tune with the consumer at the time and point they receive them that they suck the messages from us.\" </p> <p>Perhaps for some products, but it's hard to imagine getting so enthusiastic over the latest information about a tin of beans. But until that golden day one thing's clear: advertisers overlook how we are feeling at their peril. And while cost will inevitably limit the extent to which they can respond to our changing moods day by day, technology may soon provide one answer. When broadcasting becomes truly interactive, consumers could be asked by advertisers how they are feeling today - whether happy, sad or in a mood to indulge - and if they would prefer to be moved, informed or entertained? Assuming they have their TVs switched on, of course. </p> <p><strong>Touchy, feely:</strong> the secret of a good ad</p> <p><strong> In tune</strong><br> </p> <p>Woolwich's current campaign includes an ad featuring a customer closing his bank account because he's not had the service he wanted. The ad's focus? A (readily identifiable) point of view rather than a picture of a Woolwich type of person, and a depiction of a consumer in control.</p> <p>\u0095 QXL.com recently placed thousands of posters in service station toilets to encourage consumers to sign up with the internet site. Hardly the time or the place, one might have thought, but research suggests that because we suffer sensory deprivation in public toilets we actively seek stimuli.</p> <p>\u0095 Barclaycard's ad featuring the love-lorn girl who consoles herself by splashing out on a new pair of red spangly shoes was perfectly in tune with consumers' current \"I deserve it\" mentality, which accepts rather than attempts to conceal our desires for indulgence.</p> <p><strong> Misjudged</strong><br> </p> <p>\u0095 Barclays missed the mark with its recent \"big is best\" campaign - a good old-fashioned TV-driven mass-marketing push that demanded attention. Unfortunately it coincided with a programme of branch closures, pitching it into the role of corporate bully. Too loud, and not enough emphasis on \"what's in it for me?\".</p> <p>\u0095 For many years Levi's has sold itself on the promise of the Levi's lifestyle. The past 18 months, however, have seen its sales and profile slip. Self-confident consumers don't passively buy into the \"join our lifestyle\" message, preferring, instead, a hint of how that product will help them stand out in a crowd.</p> <p>\u0095 Nike, meanwhile, is also a brand perceived by some in the industry to have weakened in recent years. Its emphasis on winning - typified by its \"Just do it\" slogan - is now so ubiquitous amongst other firms that it's losing the edge and its advertising risks becoming faceless.</p>",

Two-thirds of viewers use it, according to Dart's survey, rather than, say, a listings magazine, to choose the next programme to watch. </p> <p>More than two-thirds admit to surfing, but they are also able to surf with precision, and are likely to look within genres for the things they like. This boosts the audience share of adjacent channels and others with appealing programmes. One example is given of a man who only watched sport on TV, but started using the History Channel because it had profiles of great sports heroes. </p> <p>Almost one in two say the EPG has become the main way they plan their viewing. Six out of ten say that since they subscribed to digital they have become more selective, leading to a higher overall level of satisfaction with TV viewing. </p> <p>This suggests, says the BBC, that the EPG almost replaces printed programme guides (Radio Times please note) within digital homes. However, some people criticise the EPG for giving too little information, says Dart. This suggests that written previews, if trusted, could still guide people to things they might miss. </p> <p>The BBC 's research says that men use the EPG as a fun gadget and try to exploit it to the full. While women use it as need dictates, to find what they want. </p> <p>The implication is that women are less adept at using new technology and less adventurous. But it may be temporary: Dart says its latest findings for the first time show slightly more women using the EPG than men. It also finds that Sky Digital subscribers are much happier with its EPG than ONdigital's - suggesting the digital terrestrial service is not as easy to use. </p> <p>Other research shows that there is a big gap between the popularity of pay-per-view movies and other services. Internet access and home banking have a fairly minor appeal at present - only 15% of viewers actually use the interactive services. But this is a fast-moving market with the lure of home shopping and pay-per-view sport also on the horizon. And while the over-55s are slower to adopt digital, there are the signs that they, too, are taking advantage of films with 15-minute staggered starts in ever greater numbers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The electronic programme guide, the on-screen guide that lets you select programmes by genre via a handheld device, is clearly having a big impact in digital homes. Two-thirds of viewers use it, according to Dart's survey, rather than, say, a listings magazine, to choose the next programme to watch. More than two-thirds admit to surfing, but they are also able to surf with precision, and are likely to look within genres for the things they like. This boosts the audience share of adjacent channels and others with appealing programmes. One example is given of a man who only watched sport on TV, but started using the History Channel because it had profiles of great sports heroes. Almost one in two say the EPG has become the main way they plan their viewing. Six out of ten say that since they subscribed to digital they have become more selective, leading to a higher overall level of satisfaction with TV viewing. This suggests, says the BBC, that the EPG almost replaces printed programme guides (Radio Times please note) within digital homes. However, some people criticise the EPG for giving too little information, says Dart. This suggests that written previews, if trusted, could still guide people to things they might miss. The BBC 's research says that men use the EPG as a fun gadget and try to exploit it to the full. While women use it as need dictates, to find what they want. The implication is that women are less adept at using new technology and less adventurous. But it may be temporary: Dart says its latest findings for the first time show slightly more women using the EPG than men. It also finds that Sky Digital subscribers are much happier with its EPG than ONdigital's - suggesting the digital terrestrial service is not as easy to use. Other research shows that there is a big gap between the popularity of pay-per-view movies and other services. Internet access and home banking have a fairly minor appeal at present - only 15% of viewers actually use the interactive services. But this is a fast-moving market with the lure of home shopping and pay-per-view sport also on the horizon. And while the over-55s are slower to adopt digital, there are the signs that they, too, are taking advantage of films with 15-minute staggered starts in ever greater numbers.",

The meeting takes place every year, but has attracted particular attention this time, partly because of its location - it's the first time the conference has been held in Africa, a continent in the grip of an Aids pandemic, where 5,500 people die from Aids-related illnesses every day. But mostly because of South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who opened the conference by restating his belief that Aids in Africa is caused by poverty and not, as almost all doctors believe, by the HIV virus. As he spoke, hundreds of people walked out. <p><b>What does Mbeki think causes Aids?</b><br> He appears to have been inspired by the views of a handful of dissident scientists, led by Peter Duesberg, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of California. Duesberg believes that Africans are dying from Aids-related illnesses such as tuberculosis, not because they have been infected by HIV but because their immune systems have been weakened by poverty and malnutrition. If Duesberg is right, Africa is suffering from the normal diseases of poverty, rather than a full-scale medical emergency.</p> <p><b>Why does Mbeki back this controversial view?</b><br> Mbeki finds this idea attractive because it fits with his belief that Africa should not depend on expensive technology imported from the developed world. If Aids is a disease of poverty, it can be solved by work on issues such as third-world debt, rather than by complex - and costly - scientific innovation that might be far too expensive for most Africans to afford. </p> <p><b>How have scientists reacted?</b> <br> With horror. Almost all Aids researchers agree there is overwhelming evidence that the disease is caused by the HIV virus and fear claims to the contrary could mislead governments and individuals into delaying action against it. For instance, if people are told HIV does not cause Aids, they will continue sexual practices that encourage HIV infection - and this may kill them. Ahead of the Durban conference, five thousand Aids researchers signed a letter to the influential magazine, Nature, reiterating their belief that Aids is caused by HIV. Scientists attending the conference were particularly angry with Mbeki's heavyweight backing for the dissident view because his opinions are listened to across the continent. They had hoped that he would take the opportunity to announce a change of mind. </p> <p><b>How does the future of Aids look?</b> <br> Bleak, unfortunately. In the developed world the Aids crisis is far from over - estimates suggest 34,000 adults in the UK have been infected with HIV and 10,000 of them are unaware they've been infected. In the west, expensive treatments such as the drug AZT have enabled doctors to control Aids-related illnesses, keeping many people alive. Few people in Africa can afford such drugs, however, and even basic medical care is often unavailable. As a result, African Aids sufferers are dying in much greater numbers than in other parts of the world, causing a social and economic crisis throughout the continent. One company that manufactures an effective treatment has offered to give it free to developing countries for five years. But Mbeki's hostility to the consensus about the best way to treat Aids is hindering programmes aimed at encouraging people with the disease to seek help. Until and unless an affordable vaccine is invented to combat HIV, Africa's suffering will continue. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://gbgm-umc.org/programs/aidsafrica/\" target=\"_new\">Aids in Africa </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/publications/documents/epidemiology/determinants/saepap98.html\" target=\"_new\">UNAids </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.aidslink.org.za/\" target=\"_new\">Aidslink in South Africa</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Pope yesterday launched a blistering attack on last week's World Gay Pride festival in Rome, calling it an offence to Christian values and reiterating the Roman Catholic church's condemnation of homosexuality as a moral disorder. It was the first time the Pope had commented in person on the week-long event, which culminated in a colourful parade attended by around 200,000 people on Saturday. The virulence of his speech, coming so close to the end of the festival, shocked even Vatican radio insiders. \"I cannot but express bitterness for the affront to the great jubilee of the year 2,000 and for the offence to the Christian values of a city that is so dear to the heart of the Catholics of the whole world,\" he told pilgrims in St Peter's Square. The Vatican fought a seven-month battle to get the festival banned or at least postponed until the end of celebrations marking the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Christ. Until now the Pope had left criticism of the event to senior curia officials and his unusually strong attack comes as a surprise after Saturday's parade passed off without incident and with minimal offence to Catholic sensibilities. The Vatican had feared dramatic anti-Catholic protests against the backdrop of St Peter's Basilica. In the end, the \"provocation\" amounted to little more than two men dressed as priests kissing for the cameras and a fellow marcher wearing a bishop's mitre with the slogan: \"God loves me too.\" The irritation of the church hierarchy may have been compounded by the participation in the march of a handful of priests and by the public admission of one that he had celebrated \"gay weddings\". But many observers felt the Vatican's vocal opposition to the event had only magnified its media echo. While reminding his audience that homosexuals should be treated with respect and compassion, the Pope repeated traditional teaching that homosexuality was \"objectively disordered\" and that homosexual acts were \"contrary to natural law\". The only answer for the homosexual Christian was chastity, he said. Saturday's Gay Pride rally was attended by prominent supporters of the governing centre-left coalition, including Katia Bellillo, the minister for equal opportunities. Centre-right politicians were quick to turn the Pope's words against their opponents. Pierferdinando Casini, leader of the Christian Democrat Centre party, described the sight of a minister in the front row of the march as a \"depressing spectacle\", while Francesco Storace, of the far right National Alliance, said the Pope's words vindicated his own opposition to the march. Homosexuality has never been banned in Italy, but the gay community has not enjoyed the same visibility as its counterpart in Britain. Imma Battaglia, a Gay Pride organiser, yesterday accused the Pope of helping to create the climate of hostility that led to a homosexual couple being attacked by rightwing youths after the Rome march. \"The responsibility belongs to the Vatican hierarchy and the intolerant and fascist right,\" Ms Battaglia said. The debate over the festival has focused attention on Italy's gay community and brought unwelcome scrutiny of the church's approach to the issue, highlighting the existence of a significant number of closet homosexuals within the Vatican itself.",

It is fantastic bowling with Gus - he's done it all, hasn't he? You can always rely on him doing his job. You couldn't ask for a more consistent bowler and he certainly makes life easier for you.</p> <p>\"The pitch seamed about a bit, and it was a bit muggy so the ball swung when we bowled, which it hadn't done a huge amount the day before [rain meant the game was played over two days]. Funnily enough, when we'd been out practising on the first day of the match and we'd had a bowl the ball swung, but then when they went out into the middle and had a bowl it didn't.</p> <p>\"My first wicket was Marcus Trescothick, driving at a ball outside offstump. He was caught by [Paul] Weekes at second slip. It was a regulation catch. Trescothick is a left-hander and the ball just went across him a little bit. I didn't really think about the fact that he'd just been called up by England. There are players who you play against that you know are good, but I try not to let it worry me too much. I'm certainly not quaking in my boots.</p> <p>\"My next wicket was Peter Bowler - an away-swinger wide of offstump which again was caught by Weekes at second slip. That one swung late. I'm more of a swing bowler than a seamer.</p> <p>\"Michael Burns went to the first ball of my next over. It was another ball on offstump, he pushed forward and was caught behind. Then there was [Keith] Parsons in my second spell. He was lbw to a ball that didn't swing but seamed back into him. At this stage I was hoping for five wickets and I had nearly two overs at Nos. 10 and 11 to do it, but I couldn't get them out. Never mind - it would have been nice, but it was more important that we won the game. </p> <p>\"I got my first Man of the Match award at the end.

Another company - a leading pan-European online auctioneer - initially used just one person to build its entire auction system. However, what each party did have in common was a tight grip on the process of systems development. We have outsourced our technical development to a leading British IT company. They have a strong team and the individuals involved have extensive experience in building transaction systems for banks and insurers. However, they could improve on the project and client management element of the work. Thankfully, project management is something the Rools team knows a fair bit about as a number of people come from management consulting backgrounds. We identified this skills gap early on and quickly hired an experienced and tough project manager to add the discipline that we need to deliver the service on time. We have the feeling that our project manager has come as a bit of a culture shock to the technical team. He has an almost religious passion for delivering the project on time. He does not suffer excuses. It is at times like watching a rerun of Jeremy Paxman facing down Michael Howard. He simply refuses to counter bluster and evasion and will persist with \"when are we going to get it?\" until he succeeds in obtaining a direct answer. It would be unfair to say he enjoys it, but sometimes you wonder. So far he has been doing a great job and has enhanced our confidence and perhaps more important, that of our investors, in the ability of the technical team to deliver. We are on course to deliver a pretty good product but a bit of luck still would not go amiss. \u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are the co-founders of Rools.com, a service that lets teenagers buy securely online without a credit card",

</p> <p>250-299 (2); </p> <p>300-349 (3); </p> <p>350-399 (4); </p> <p>400 or over (5) </p> <p><strong> Bowling: now only 3 points available </strong> (4) </p> <p>three-five wickets (1); </p> <p>six-eight wickets (2); </p> <p>nine-ten (3). </p> <p>The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. </p> <p>A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. </p> <p>A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. </p> <p>*Note: in a <strong> draw where the scores finish level</strong> , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points. </p> <p><strong> OTHER MATCHES</strong> <strong> FCC Select v New Zealand A</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Campbell Park: </strong> The FCC Select XI trail New Zealand A by 101 runs at the start of their second innings. </p> <p><strong> NEW ZEALAND A:</strong> First innings 132 (M H W Papps 63;

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

      "body": "<p>All this harking back to the good old days can become a bit tiresome, but do you recall only a week ago? Dominic Cork was eyeballing the world in triumph after pulling off an extraordinary test victory, English cricket was beside itself with joy, and the first NatWest triangular one-day series offered a diverting opportunity for a spot of midsummer derring-do. </p> <p>That was last week, this is this week: England's one-day plans are entirely amiss, the public is shaking its head at two inadequate batting performances, and there is mounting scepticism within the England hierarchy over the commitment of Andrew Flintoff, a player who a few months ago was deemed worthy of a central contract. Life with England is anything but monotonous. </p> <p>The conditions in which England had limped to 158 for eight yesterday, with 37 balls remaining, were far from straightforward, but even allowing for a modicum of swing and a mediocre surface, the likelihood was that rain spared England a second successive defeat. </p> <p>After last week's test win, jubilant spectators lingered around Lord's in pale evening sunshine as if reluctant to abandon the moment. Yesterday, as the PA announcer dropped increasingly heavy hints that the match was bound to be abandoned, stopping just short of issuing a warning of a tidal wave heading down St John's Wood High Street, they ploughed homewards through the rain, heads bowed in dissatisfaction. </p> <p>Marcus Trescothick had more reason than most for satisfaction. His first two one-day internationals have brought 79 and 49, and whereas Saturday's innings was compiled in a position of comfort, his confidence remained unimpaired yesterday by the failures of more experienced men around him. He should have fallen for 14 when he was dropped at short extra off Corey Collymore, but he did look like a batsman confident in his method. </p> <p>Matthew Maynard, the second of England's emergency call-ups, has not been so lucky. Collymore, the most subtle of the West Indian pace quartet, had swung the ball in enough to suggest that to leave the ball was a dangerous proposition, but he did so anyway and lost his off-stump before he had scored. </p> <p>Maynard's selection ahead of Vikram Solanki, who was preferred in the original squad, smacks of indecision. Solanki's recent one-day record has been dreadful, but for all that he was named in preference to Maynard in the original squad and nothing whatsoever has changed. </p> <p>Duncan Fletcher, England's taciturn coach, sought justification in Maynard's \"experience\", and suggested that to field two young players in the top five would be overdoing it. Fletcher coached Maynard at Glamorgan and, for all his Zimbabwean credentials, he has taken refuge during stressful times in the English remedy of choosing someone old and someone you know. </p> <p>Nixon McLean made the early breaches. If overloading Alec Stewart with the three roles of captain, wicketkeeper and opening batsman has been deemed as unwise in the long-term, then it is equally misguided even in an emergency. McLean had him caught at second slip and then cut one back at Graeme Hick, who was caught off the under-edge, cutting. </p> <p>Craig White's entire England career has been one of selectorial inconsistency.

      "bodyText": "All this harking back to the good old days can become a bit tiresome, but do you recall only a week ago? Dominic Cork was eyeballing the world in triumph after pulling off an extraordinary test victory, English cricket was beside itself with joy, and the first NatWest triangular one-day series offered a diverting opportunity for a spot of midsummer derring-do. That was last week, this is this week: England's one-day plans are entirely amiss, the public is shaking its head at two inadequate batting performances, and there is mounting scepticism within the England hierarchy over the commitment of Andrew Flintoff, a player who a few months ago was deemed worthy of a central contract. Life with England is anything but monotonous. The conditions in which England had limped to 158 for eight yesterday, with 37 balls remaining, were far from straightforward, but even allowing for a modicum of swing and a mediocre surface, the likelihood was that rain spared England a second successive defeat. After last week's test win, jubilant spectators lingered around Lord's in pale evening sunshine as if reluctant to abandon the moment. Yesterday, as the PA announcer dropped increasingly heavy hints that the match was bound to be abandoned, stopping just short of issuing a warning of a tidal wave heading down St John's Wood High Street, they ploughed homewards through the rain, heads bowed in dissatisfaction. Marcus Trescothick had more reason than most for satisfaction. His first two one-day internationals have brought 79 and 49, and whereas Saturday's innings was compiled in a position of comfort, his confidence remained unimpaired yesterday by the failures of more experienced men around him. He should have fallen for 14 when he was dropped at short extra off Corey Collymore, but he did look like a batsman confident in his method. Matthew Maynard, the second of England's emergency call-ups, has not been so lucky. Collymore, the most subtle of the West Indian pace quartet, had swung the ball in enough to suggest that to leave the ball was a dangerous proposition, but he did so anyway and lost his off-stump before he had scored. Maynard's selection ahead of Vikram Solanki, who was preferred in the original squad, smacks of indecision. Solanki's recent one-day record has been dreadful, but for all that he was named in preference to Maynard in the original squad and nothing whatsoever has changed. Duncan Fletcher, England's taciturn coach, sought justification in Maynard's \"experience\", and suggested that to field two young players in the top five would be overdoing it. Fletcher coached Maynard at Glamorgan and, for all his Zimbabwean credentials, he has taken refuge during stressful times in the English remedy of choosing someone old and someone you know. Nixon McLean made the early breaches. If overloading Alec Stewart with the three roles of captain, wicketkeeper and opening batsman has been deemed as unwise in the long-term, then it is equally misguided even in an emergency. McLean had him caught at second slip and then cut one back at Graeme Hick, who was caught off the under-edge, cutting. Craig White's entire England career has been one of selectorial inconsistency. Nothing has changed. He won a central contract on the back of a fine one-day series in South Africa, yet was omitted from the opening game at The Oval. Yesterday, Flintoff's absence allowed him to bat at No 6, a place too high, as England managed to reverse accepted practice by fielding a one-day side with less batting depth than their test XI. White was unconvincing, re vealing the same technical deficiency as Chris Schofield earlier in the summer, although not to the same extent, in which his back foot edges towards square leg before the ball is bowled. He survived through sneaked singles before becoming the first of three victims for Franklyn Rose. England even floundered against the off-spin of Chris Gayle. Trescothick lobbed back a return catch, Mark Ealham played inside a straight ball, and he did not concede a boundary in his 10 overs. At least Graham Thorpe, with 42 off 76 balls, might have begun to lay the foundations of an England return. \"We haven't played spin bowling well for 12 months, we don't nurdle the spinners around,\" said Nasser Hussain, who put that persistent frailty down to the lack of slow bowlers in a championship largely fought out by seam bowlers on duff pitches. Hussain also reflected upon the stressful demands likely to become apparent in an extended summer of seven tests and 10 one-day internationals which, as England are roughly halfway through the programme, makes one wonder what treats are still in store. What is needed more than anything is for the sun to come out. And who knows, it might even stop raining.",

A patient with a violent history was able to tape the staff meeting and smuggle in several forbidden items into the Berkshire-based hospital which houses some of Britain's most dangerous criminals. The BBC reports that the forbidden items included a mobile telephone, a disposable camera and audio tapes. There were also allegations that another patient took out a contract to kill the patient who had the contraband. The BBC said the hospital claims there were no weapons found in the searches and investigators were now probing the murder contract allegation. Former Broadmoor nurse Ray Rowden told BBC Breakfast News he wondered what lessons had been learned from the public inquiry into Ashworth Hospital, in Maghull, Liverpool. He added: \"My second reaction is how quickly was the intelligence from this incident shared appropriately with Ashworth, the sister hospital, where as I understand it, some of the patients at the centre of this breakdown came from originally.\" The inquiry was instigated into Ashworth psychiatric hospital in 1997 following allegations from a former patient about the misuse of drugs and alcohol, the free availability of pornographic material and paedophile activity. It discovered that a young girl, being brought to the unit by a member of her family, was being groomed for paedophile purposes and was permitted, often unsupervised, to associate with men with appalling criminal records.",

      "bodyText": "Charles Dempsey, the Fifa delegate whose abstention in the election to decide the venue for the 2006 World Cup caused international uproar, announced his retirement yesterday as anger continued to grow over his actions. Mr Dempsey, 78, said after a meeting of officials of Oceania, the football confederation which he represents, that he would step down as president in September. He added that he had explained his reasons for not voting in last Thursday's election in Zurich to officials in New Zealand. The executive committee of Oceania met for almost five hours in private in Auckland yesterday and expressed anger at Mr Dempsey's abstention in the election organised by Fifa, world football's governing body. It was widely believed that had Mr Dempsey not announced his resignation he would have been forced to step down. Germany beat South Africa by 12 votes to 11 in last week's election, with Mr Dempsey's abstention proving crucial. It caused outrage around the world among politicians, football fans and administrators. Had Mr Dempsey voted as he was told to by Oceania, the contest would have been tied with Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who backed South Africa, holding the final casting vote. Mr Dempsey said after yesterday's meeting of Oceania officials in Auckland: \"Behind closed doors the executive met and discussed - I wasn't present - and gave approval to the explanations that I gave for what took place in Zurich. \"But after all this consideration and the [media] harassment, I will retire at the end of September because I cannot accept what has taken place over the last three days.\" Mr Dempsey claimed after the vote that he had decided to abstain because of the \"intolerable pressure\" he had been placed under by the supporters of the competing bids. He was due to step down as Oceania president in 2002. Johnny Tinsley Lulu, the Oceania vice-president, said Mr Dempsey was retiring because executive members had made it clear that they were unhappy with his explanation of events in Zurich. Shau Khan, Fiji's representative to Oceania, said: \"The call definitely would have been made to step down if he had not announced his retirement. My view is that when an executive directive is given it should be compiled with.\" Mr Dempsey had been mandated by Oceania at a meeting in May to vote for South Africa once England was eliminated from the competition. England fell out of the reckoning in the second round with only two votes but Mr Dempsey then handed a lawyer's letter to Fifa officials outlining his reasons for abstaining. Mr Dempsey, who was born in Scotland, claimed that he had been inundated with telephone calls hours before the vote urging him to back South Africa and that he had also been offered bribes. It later emerged that letters offering cash and gifts sent to Fifa delegates prior to Thursday's vote were a hoax organised by a German satirical magazine. A special meeting of Oceania officials will be held in Sydney at the end of September to decide Mr Dempsey's replacement. It also emerged yesterday that Mr Dempsey had sought the permission of Oceania officials hours before last week's vote for a free hand over which candidate he could back for the 2006 venue. Fifa has said it will hold an internal investigation into the events surrounding last Thursday's vote but has ruled out a new vote on the choice of host for 2006. Andreas Herren, Fifa's spokesman, said: \"The vote itself stands. That is not part of the discussion.\"",

      "body": "<p>I had to rub my eyes. A Daily Mail leading article 10 days ago made an impassioned plea for a \"debate\" on the single currency. Soon after, the London Evening Standard - same owner, same hymn sheet, same tune, different organist - looked forward to a \"prolonged debate\". Both calls followed in the wake of the Sun demanding \"a full, honest public debate\" around the question Tony Blair intends to ask in the forthcoming, but unscheduled, referendum. </p> <p>Can they be serious? The Daily Mail and the Sun, having run hysterical, xenophobic, myth-making campaigns against the euro for years, now want an informed debate! This must surely rank as one of the most perfect definitions of chutzpah. </p> <p>The Sun, hostile to European integration since at least 1981, has the gall to \"demand\" rational discussion on the subject. Remember first its 1990 \"Up Yours Delors!\" article in which it called on its \"patriotic family of readers to tell the feelthy French to FROG OFF!\". </p> <p>Recall also its 1994 story headlined \"Now they've really gone bananas: Euro bosses ban 'too bendy' ones\". Perhaps the paper never meant its 10m-plus readers to take this seriously, imagining that they knew that the European commission wasn't actually insisting on straight bananas. Then there was that \"honest\" 1997 claim that socialism was due to enter Britain by the back door through the introduction of the social chapter, encouraging trade unions to call European-wide strikes to enforce a four-day week. The following year, the Sun, under new editor David Yelland, asked whether prime minister Tony Blair was \"the most dangerous man in Britain\" because of his Euro sympathies. </p> <p>Moreover, this is a paper owned by a company, News International, which last year refused permission for two academics, Peter J Anderson and Anthony Weymouth, to quote directly from the Sun and the Times when writing their excellent book - Insulting the Public? - on the scandalous way in which the British press has misreported events in the EU. Imagine the Wapping reaction if this bizarre act of censorship had been perpetrated by the European Commission! It is a poor advertisement for the concept of free speech by papers which squeal at the slightest encroachment on their rights to express themselves freely. </p> <p>Anyway, on to that other tabloid fighter against Europe, the Daily Mail. Its anti-Euro propaganda has been less crude than the Sun's, though doubtless more effective. Note, for instance, the underlying message in its report of Blair's speech in Paris in March 1998, headlined \"Blair Hands Off Warning to EU\". This story, yes a \"news\" story, casts the EU as an alien enemy trying to gets its hands on Britain's taxes. </p> <p>The paper has also helped to perpetrate many of the Euro-myths so beloved by opponents. At this point I ought to say that a number of the fears raised by the Mail about the possible effects of integration have been perfectly reasonable. It is the context in which it places them that is objectionable, narrowing the debate at every turn, using war-like language and playing to the irrational, but deep-seated, xenophobia of its audience. </p> <p>Lest anyone get the idea I might be a Europhile, I speak as a 1975 referendum \"no\" voter and as a continuing sceptic, concerned about the loss of sovereignty and the threat to democracy caused by a supra-national tier of government far too remote from the people. (Isn't Westminster remote enough already?) My fears echo Tony Benn's in the 1970s, when he was marginalised and demonised by an almost unanimous pro-Common Market press. Then, just as now, the newspaper \"debate\" lacked any subtlety. It was black and white, them and us, yes or no. </p> <p>The dissonance between economic unity and political unity - in which people often feel sanguine about the former and genuinely worried about the latter - certainly demands a lengthy public discussion, free from distortion. Instead, what clearly frustrates Blair and his press secretary Alastair Campbell (as it should every sensible politician) is the fact that the reporting of European affairs is so obviously infected by the prejudices of press owners and editors that there is little chance of an honest debate. </p> <p>Seen from that perspective, Campbell's tirade against six papers on the No 10 website after Blair's speech in T\u00fcbingen was totally understandable. Showing how papers such as the Sun, Mail and Telegraph used the speech to push their own agenda, he accused them of \"distortion and misrepresentation\" which happens \"on an almost daily basis\". </p> <p>Then again, the Campbell critique can also be seen as misguided for the simple reason that he was the messenger. His credit with the papers he seeks to influence has expired, so the substance of his argument, which certainly merits serious attention, was ignored. Campbell is now Press Enemy No 1, having replaced Peter Mandelson, who also chose last week to attack journalistic spin doctoring. \"I certainly do not deny the right of the press to take positions on Europe,\" he wrote. \"But the British people and the democratic debate are starting to lose out from the nature of the coverage.\" </p> <p>Any impartial review of newspaper coverage - and I commend the work of the authors mentioned above and of Dominic Wring from Loughborough University - supports Mandelson's argument. Again, though, papers now ignore all his substantive criticisms. This is how the journalism of political personality works. Once the man/woman is demonised, their genuine views can be safely ignored. Yet the decision about greater European integration is surely too momentous to allow this to happen. </p> <p>Incidentally, there appears also to be a huge amount of naivety in Downing Street about winning the nation around in order to secure a referendum victory. In the current atmosphere of increasingly virulent anti-Blair, anti-Campbell press hysteria, the very notion of this government being able to \"ratchet up\" a successful, populist pro-Euro campaign is laughable. </p> <p>The editors of the Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph are not for turning. Whether their hostility to the EU is born of genuine ideological concerns or more commercial worries about \"losing\" their audience in an integrated Europe, they will not change their minds. Having made the concept of \"government spin\" into the enduring leitmotif of Blair's administration, they will scupper any moves to spin the Euro.</p>",

Perhaps the paper never meant its 10m-plus readers to take this seriously, imagining that they knew that the European commission wasn't actually insisting on straight bananas. Then there was that \"honest\" 1997 claim that socialism was due to enter Britain by the back door through the introduction of the social chapter, encouraging trade unions to call European-wide strikes to enforce a four-day week. The following year, the Sun, under new editor David Yelland, asked whether prime minister Tony Blair was \"the most dangerous man in Britain\" because of his Euro sympathies. Moreover, this is a paper owned by a company, News International, which last year refused permission for two academics, Peter J Anderson and Anthony Weymouth, to quote directly from the Sun and the Times when writing their excellent book - Insulting the Public? - on the scandalous way in which the British press has misreported events in the EU. Imagine the Wapping reaction if this bizarre act of censorship had been perpetrated by the European Commission! It is a poor advertisement for the concept of free speech by papers which squeal at the slightest encroachment on their rights to express themselves freely. Anyway, on to that other tabloid fighter against Europe, the Daily Mail. Its anti-Euro propaganda has been less crude than the Sun's, though doubtless more effective. Note, for instance, the underlying message in its report of Blair's speech in Paris in March 1998, headlined \"Blair Hands Off Warning to EU\". This story, yes a \"news\" story, casts the EU as an alien enemy trying to gets its hands on Britain's taxes. The paper has also helped to perpetrate many of the Euro-myths so beloved by opponents. At this point I ought to say that a number of the fears raised by the Mail about the possible effects of integration have been perfectly reasonable. It is the context in which it places them that is objectionable, narrowing the debate at every turn, using war-like language and playing to the irrational, but deep-seated, xenophobia of its audience. Lest anyone get the idea I might be a Europhile, I speak as a 1975 referendum \"no\" voter and as a continuing sceptic, concerned about the loss of sovereignty and the threat to democracy caused by a supra-national tier of government far too remote from the people. (Isn't Westminster remote enough already?) My fears echo Tony Benn's in the 1970s, when he was marginalised and demonised by an almost unanimous pro-Common Market press. Then, just as now, the newspaper \"debate\" lacked any subtlety. It was black and white, them and us, yes or no. The dissonance between economic unity and political unity - in which people often feel sanguine about the former and genuinely worried about the latter - certainly demands a lengthy public discussion, free from distortion. Instead, what clearly frustrates Blair and his press secretary Alastair Campbell (as it should every sensible politician) is the fact that the reporting of European affairs is so obviously infected by the prejudices of press owners and editors that there is little chance of an honest debate. Seen from that perspective, Campbell's tirade against six papers on the No 10 website after Blair's speech in T\u00fcbingen was totally understandable. Showing how papers such as the Sun, Mail and Telegraph used the speech to push their own agenda, he accused them of \"distortion and misrepresentation\" which happens \"on an almost daily basis\". Then again, the Campbell critique can also be seen as misguided for the simple reason that he was the messenger. His credit with the papers he seeks to influence has expired, so the substance of his argument, which certainly merits serious attention, was ignored. Campbell is now Press Enemy No 1, having replaced Peter Mandelson, who also chose last week to attack journalistic spin doctoring. \"I certainly do not deny the right of the press to take positions on Europe,\" he wrote. \"But the British people and the democratic debate are starting to lose out from the nature of the coverage.\" Any impartial review of newspaper coverage - and I commend the work of the authors mentioned above and of Dominic Wring from Loughborough University - supports Mandelson's argument. Again, though, papers now ignore all his substantive criticisms. This is how the journalism of political personality works. Once the man/woman is demonised, their genuine views can be safely ignored. Yet the decision about greater European integration is surely too momentous to allow this to happen. Incidentally, there appears also to be a huge amount of naivety in Downing Street about winning the nation around in order to secure a referendum victory. In the current atmosphere of increasingly virulent anti-Blair, anti-Campbell press hysteria, the very notion of this government being able to \"ratchet up\" a successful, populist pro-Euro campaign is laughable. The editors of the Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph are not for turning. Whether their hostility to the EU is born of genuine ideological concerns or more commercial worries about \"losing\" their audience in an integrated Europe, they will not change their minds. Having made the concept of \"government spin\" into the enduring leitmotif of Blair's administration, they will scupper any moves to spin the Euro.",

The ITC plans to study the behaviour of 40 \"digital virgin\" families, paying for them to be linked up - but this research project has yet to start. The independent academic centres that monitor TV should get their skates on: they seem to have sleep-walked through a year which is arguably the most significant in UK television history. The BBC does possess a body of research which is informing policy-making. But only the main \"bullet points\" have been made available. </p> <p>So in what follows I'm piecing together what is known, from a variety of sources including Zenith Media, Sky, Flextech, and, most usefully, the Dart (digital audience research tracker) survey carried out by the research company Ipsos-RSL. It's not definitive. But this represents a good stab. </p> <p>The most obvious question is, what happens in digital homes? The answer seems to be that people do probably watch more. According to the Barb figures for May, digital homes watched an average of 25 hours, 33 minutes per week, compared with an average in all homes of 23 hours, 38 minutes. However, as Zenith's head of research, Simon Bolus, warns, this gap should be treated with caution. It is possible that digital homes are disproportionately occupied by the UK's heaviest viewers, telly addicts whose weekly viewing was well above average before digital arrived. </p> <p>The Dart research is interesting on this point. A year ago, digital viewers were largely early adopters, from AB social groups and often single. But now, with the spread of free equipment, the audience is far more mainstream, skewed towards CDE social groups and families with young children. </p> <p>But the really key finding is that in Sky digital homes, viewing of terrestrial channels slumps to just over half of all viewing. In other words, the extra choice is pushing their share down worryingly, to around 52% in May this year. In two weeks in June, digital channels netted more than 50% of viewing in digital satellite homes. </p> <p>Among children under 16, the terrestrials' slump is even greater. Sky's own tracking research shows them spending 61% of their viewing with digital channels. This is a marked shift from the trend in old-fashioned analogue satellite homes, using the technology on which the 1990s multi-channel thrust was based, where the split for adults is around 35% to 65% in favour of terrestrial. The big flight has been disguised until recently, because multi-channel homes were all lumped together and digital was too small to separate out. </p> <p>Most pundits, and not just Sky, think the share won by digital channels is poised to go even higher. BBC1, which has a 27% overall share in all UK homes, is down to 20% in analogue satellite/cable homes - but gets only 17% where there is digital satellite. Uncomfortable. Uncomfortable for all five terrestrial channels, actually. </p> <p>Also, what the raw data doesn't show is a trend that is much discussed within Sky. There is a sharp rise in viewing to its Premier and MovieMax channels, because of their staggered start times every 15 minutes. As watching a movie involves a big commitment of time, the movie channels' audience share has almost doubled thanks to the convenience of staggered starts, by up to four percentage points to between 7% and 8% in digital homes. Around 60% are calling up extra pay-per-view movies once a month or so, says Dart, with the youngest adults the most frequent purchasers. Movies are at last displaying the same ability as sport to drive digital take-up. </p> <p>The viewing data makes it clear why Sky One is investing more in its programme budget - because the EPG makes it a good investment. Zoning by genre, the EPG increases competition and creates more of a level playing field, putting Sky's entertainment offerings alongside those of BBC1, BBC2, Channel 4 and Channel 5. </p> <p>So programmes that were hard to find on analogue satellite are now openly displayed. Everyone involved in starting niche channels knows how hard it is to make an impact with new programmes because they flash by unnoticed as part of the glut of multi-channel choice, watched only by tiny audiences. But for the more important and established networks this is changing. </p> <p>The research does find differences between the sexes. Men are deserting BBC1 and BBC2 for digital networks faster than women. The BBC's own research suggests this may be because men and women view the EPG differently. For men it is a gadget, to be experimented with. For women it is a practical means to an end. A significant number don't really know how to use it, or how to exploit its potential to the full. </p> <p>But, interestingly, there are sound reasons for the BBC and ITV not to panic. For example, although audience share plummets with the arrival of digital, the effect on reach - how many access terrestrial networks each week - is not so drastic. 87% still watch BBC1, 80.6% ITV (ITV has unwisely kept its service off digital satellite). </p> <p>This suggests that people still value traditional programming.

The problem it has is that even when it premieres top drama with stars (Fish, starring Paul McGann, is a good recent example) it is not hitting the popular button. Either the wrong series are commissioned, or there is not enough attention to script quality and production values. BBC1 will really be in danger if Sky One manages to forge fruitful links with the likes of Harry Enfield and top writing and production talent. </p> <p>But the viewing trends in digital homes underscore the big dilemma faced by all established networks. If you fail to respond, the erosion of share will continue relentlessly. But change too fast and you run the risk of alienating viewers - both those content with what they've got, and those who, spoilt for choice, still plump for tried-and-tested favourites.</p>",

But Lazio has lots of Republican cash. He has spent some of it giving the press a special bus fitted out for them with a fax machine, captain's swivel chairs, couches, a microwave oven, coffeemaker, well-stocked fridge, satellite phones and colour television. A cunning move, that TV set. From their captain's chairs, reporters have been watching Wimbledon all week, which is a safer use of their time than trying to disentangle where Lazio stands on abortion. His position has been that he is pro-choice provided nobody chooses. Now the supreme court has removed his wriggle room in a judgment weighted in favour of women's rights, which is Hillary's position. But her press crowd have been no help: they've been too busy grumbling about her plain old press bus and the nanny notice that the campaign \"Cannot be responsible for any electrical items plugged into this socket. (Use at your own risk.)\"</p> <p>This weekend the enemy forces were already gathering. Outside the Village Cafe there was parked a racy blue convertible with a fancy plaque welded to the boot: \"Go Back Home Hillary\", which was rich, because the vehicle's licence plate was from the Sunshine State, suggesting someone had the nerve to drive all the way from Florida to protest carpet-bagging in our politics up here. I did a double take when a slim blonde emerged from the cafe, a Hillary lookalike, but it's symptomatic of what is going on. Hillary has a problem with women, just the kind of women you would think she would attract. She has slipped from a 50% approval rate among women in 1998, during the Monica affair, to 44%. The trouble is the suburbs where the vowel is ahead 54% to 32%. Suburban women could give Rick the Senate seat. It is puzzling. So many of them look and talk like Hillary and think more like her than Lazio on abortion and guns and education.</p> <p>The polls afford little clue to the contradiction, but she may be resented for being too poised, too perfect, too self-righteous, too forgiving, even - the wife who has fixed her hair and manicure and is in the hammock reading Foreign Affairs while you're still wrestling with the kids' breakfast. Call it the queen bee syndrome. My conclusion is she needs the sympathy vote again. Maybe she could borrow a skeleton or two from Giuliani's cupboard.</p> <p>\u0095 Harold Evans is the author of The American Century.<br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Rudy came to fame getting 100 years jail apiece for the heads of five mafia families and I think he would have got a huge sympathy vote if he had stayed the course. Rudy's place, alas, has been taken by another vowel, a handsome young New York congressman, Rick Lazio, with a thin skin and an erratic left-right-left voting record. But Lazio has lots of Republican cash. He has spent some of it giving the press a special bus fitted out for them with a fax machine, captain's swivel chairs, couches, a microwave oven, coffeemaker, well-stocked fridge, satellite phones and colour television. A cunning move, that TV set. From their captain's chairs, reporters have been watching Wimbledon all week, which is a safer use of their time than trying to disentangle where Lazio stands on abortion. His position has been that he is pro-choice provided nobody chooses. Now the supreme court has removed his wriggle room in a judgment weighted in favour of women's rights, which is Hillary's position. But her press crowd have been no help: they've been too busy grumbling about her plain old press bus and the nanny notice that the campaign \"Cannot be responsible for any electrical items plugged into this socket. (Use at your own risk.)\" This weekend the enemy forces were already gathering. Outside the Village Cafe there was parked a racy blue convertible with a fancy plaque welded to the boot: \"Go Back Home Hillary\", which was rich, because the vehicle's licence plate was from the Sunshine State, suggesting someone had the nerve to drive all the way from Florida to protest carpet-bagging in our politics up here. I did a double take when a slim blonde emerged from the cafe, a Hillary lookalike, but it's symptomatic of what is going on. Hillary has a problem with women, just the kind of women you would think she would attract. She has slipped from a 50% approval rate among women in 1998, during the Monica affair, to 44%. The trouble is the suburbs where the vowel is ahead 54% to 32%. Suburban women could give Rick the Senate seat. It is puzzling. So many of them look and talk like Hillary and think more like her than Lazio on abortion and guns and education. The polls afford little clue to the contradiction, but she may be resented for being too poised, too perfect, too self-righteous, too forgiving, even - the wife who has fixed her hair and manicure and is in the hammock reading Foreign Affairs while you're still wrestling with the kids' breakfast. Call it the queen bee syndrome. My conclusion is she needs the sympathy vote again. Maybe she could borrow a skeleton or two from Giuliani's cupboard. \u0095 Harold Evans is the author of The American Century. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Up and down the country, more than 15,000 examiners for the Oxford and Cambridge and RSA Examinations board (OCR) are busily marking exam papers taken by students earlier this summer. August 17 is the day of reckoning for the 220,000 awaiting A-level results; a further 1.1m GCSE results will be issued a week later. Whatever a student's grades, exams - and the long wait for the results - can be traumatic. </p> <p>It was curiosity that made Dawn Sargent, 27, apply for her job as PA to the general assessment director of OCR, David Barrett. She was keen to take a peek behind the doors of an institution that most of us would rather forget. </p> <p>\"I thought, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to see what goes on behind the scenes of the exam process?' As a student, all you know is that an exam paper arrives on your desk, and then some time later you get the results,\" she says. Sargent sat her A-levels more than nine years ago and decided to take time out to dabble in the world of work before taking a degree. \"I worked as a receptionist for a year - I hadn't had any formal secretarial training - and everything I've learnt, I've done myself. I've been keen to develop my organisational skills.\" </p> <p>A degree in English from Anglia Polytechnic University gave her the space to be flexible in her career - the rigidity of a profession, she says, is not for her. She spent several years working in the telecommunications industry until one day she spotted a particularly interesting job advert. \"I enjoyed the blue-chip companies because they were moving onwards and upwards, but I wanted to get my teeth into something, to specialise, rather than just work in a huge call centre,\" she explains. </p> <p>Originally from Reading, Sargent lives in and loves Cambridge. \"I like the character and the academia here. Cambridge has a slower pace of life than Reading, which is very cosmopolitan, and I enjoy the sense of tradition,\" she says. Fortunately for her, she is based in an open-plan office with 70 other colleagues in the heart of Cambridge, next to the famous expanse of green known as Parker's Piece. A year and a half into the job, she is beginning to find a rhythm. \"It is an immense job, so for the first year it was all a learning curve. No two weeks were ever the same, but now things are beginning to settle down,\" she says. </p> <p>The assessment department is responsible for setting exam questions and papers, and is currently experiencing its busiest period. OCR must conform to the standards set by the Qualification and Curriculum Authority, which means that all sorts of issues have to be looked into - confidentiality in the marking process being a hugely important one. \"Examiners are currently marking papers at home. As soon as the exams have been taken, the papers are put into special envelopes that are sealed and can only be opened with a pair of scissors,\" explains Sargent. \"All deliveries are carefully monitored and have to be signed for - if there is any sign of tampering, or any kind of breach of confidentiality, it would be investigated immediately.\" </p> <p>And what if an examiner finds that they happen to be marking the papers of a friend's child? \"That would not happen - examiners have to inform us if they know of anyone sitting our exams. The same applies to staff. If I had children who were doing the exams, I would have to disclose that,\" she insists. </p> <p>So does all hell break loose once the results are published? \"We do get schools and individuals ringing up to say that they didn't get the results they expected and we have a team that investigates the post-exams process. So far, any difficulties have been resolved, or procedures have been put in place to deal with the complaint,\" she says. </p> <p>With more than a month before the results are published, you might think Sargent would suggest students take some time to relax before they're plunged into the world of clearing and career choices, but no. \"I think students should be busy looking into every eventuality,\" she says. \"They shouldn't panic, but there's no point in doing everything at the last minute. We are doing our utmost, but a person will only get the grades for how they performed on the day.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair will attempt to bury details of an alarming rise in violent crime across the country by publishing a series of embarrassing Home Office statistics on the same day as Gordon Brown unveils his headline-grabbing spending review. In a sign of the growing panic in Downing Street that ministers are losing the initiative on law and order, the annual crime figures will be slipped out on July 18 at virtually the same moment as the chancellor announces a massive hike in government spending on health and education. Ministers are said to be deeply alarmed at the Home Office figures which are expected to show that recorded crime in England and Wales has risen by about 3% in the past year and is accelerating, with violent crime rising by more than 10%. Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, last night accused the government of a cynical attempt to manipulate the news. \"Ministers are so transparent,\" Ms Widdecombe said. \"This is yet another pathetic attempt at spin, but the difference now is that people are wised up to the ways of this government.\" Her criticism came as the government underlined its concerns over crime by appointing the former BBC director general Lord Birt as a special unpaid adviser on crime. At the personal invitation of the prime minister, Lord Birt will work unpaid for the government one day a week to tackle \"deep-seated issues\". Downing Street said that Lord Birt, who will continue to sit in the Lords as a crossbencher, had been chosen because he could bring an outsiders' view to crime. His appointment was criticised yesterday by the Tories and Liberal Democrats as a poor response to rising crime. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"After 18 years in opposition and three years in government and the huge amount of facts, figures and research already available, what has Labour been doing? Soundbites and supremos are not enough.\" John Prescott defended the appointment, saying that Lord Birt would help the government to continue to be tough on crime. However, the appointment, which comes hard on the heels of the prime minister's ill-fated \"cashpoint initiative\" to tackle drunken yobs, indicates a growing worry among ministers that they are losing the initiative on crime. Ministers will attempt to play down the crime increases by focusing on the continuing fall in domestic burglaries which have dropped by 28% over the past five years to their lowest level for a decade. The prime minister, who believes that Labour's \"tough on crime tough on the causes of crime\" message was a crucial factor in his landslide election victory, attempted to regain the initiative at the end of last month by floating the idea of marching drunken yobs to cashpoints to pay on-the-spot fines. Within days this was shot down as unworkable by police. Whitehall sources were surprised when Mr Blair continued to talk about law and order initiatives after his embarrassing climbdown. The sources expected that the prime minister would move on to other issues in the immediate aftermath of his son's arrest and reprimand last week for being drunk and incapable. The panic over law and order comes amid signs that senior ministers fear that the government is failing to communicate effectively with voters.

For the code to be clearly understood, the Queen Mother would need to (a) only discuss politics while drinking port, or (b) drink port most of the time. But if it's the latter, then her parliamentary insight would inevitably be limited to a few slurred starts at remembering the prime minister's name. </p> <p>Also, to avoid misunderstanding, her glass of port would need to be held steadily at about chest level throughout the meal. And there must be a risk that, beginning a refreshing sip just as a diner mentions William Hague, she misleads the gathering about her political affiliation. In such circumstances, does she then clarify \"that was thirst, darlings, not Conservatism\"? But this revelation about the politics of snifters perfectly illustrates the difficulties of the royal documentary. Because those who really know the royals don't talk, such films are forced to give absurd weight to anecdotes gathered from hangers-on and downstairs gossip. </p> <p>Even so, The Real Queen Mother is to be welcomed for its relative irreverence. Most genres of television differ according to the broadcaster - ITV sitcoms are often written and even lit differently from BBC ones; an ITN news running order may reverse the emphasis given to stories by the BBC - but, until the 1990s, all royal broadcasting was the same: a televisual bending of the knee. </p> <p>This particularly applied to the Queen Mother, who was viewed even by the tougher executives as untouchable. There are still disturbing rumours from the BBC that, when the Queen Mum has no more birthdays left to come, comedy and entertainment shows will be removed from the schedules until the state funeral, thereby giving record ratings to the channels run by the republican Rupert Murdoch. </p> <p>When at the BBC, Michael Jackson, now chief executive of Channel 4, was bravest in questioning this Ruritanian belief that obsequies need to be obsequious. And The Real Queen Mother is by some way the toughest programme ever made about this touchy subject. If I were to resort to the glass-of-port method of television reviewing, I would have raised my arm several times during the documentary. </p> <p>Because the third-hand reminiscences are so flimsy, David Batty's film is most impressive in the sequences of free comment. Whereas the average Queen Mum doc has merely simpered about the ceaseless millinery of her widowed years, this one makes the clever point that the hat became a pseudo-crown, a surrogate for the regal head-gear she had had to concede to her daughter. It also shows how Hartnell's outfits and Beaton's photos (retouched to make her look slimmer) remade her image. This proto-Diana even once claimed for herself the title Queen Of Hearts. </p> <p>You can tell how far we are from the conventional monarcho-doc because when a single contributor strikes the old Alistair Burnet tone - a royal chaplain describes her at prayer as \"beatific she has one foot in heaven\" - it seems gigglingly anachronistic. There's rather too much insistence on the Queen Mum as a ruthless driving force - you sometimes think you're hearing about a matriarch in The Sopranos - but this is a rare example of a British film about the royals which is reflective rather than genuflecting. </p> <p>Even the BBC, traditionally cringing in these matters, has recently risked throwing a few stones at the glass coach, sensibly refusing to transmit a charity pageant for the Queen Mum's birthday which even the Queen was not attending. </p> <p>And now we have Counterblast: Dear William, in which another 18-year-old, Barry Hale from a Liverpool comprehensive, harangues the second heir to the throne for being out of touch with modern Britain.

      "bodyText": "Israel's ruling coalition fell apart at sickening speed yesterday, weakening the prime minister, Ehud Barak, as he sets off for a high-stake peace summit with the Palestinians. After months spent pandering to rightwing and religious members of his fractious coalition, Mr Barak's government collapsed within hours when three parties announced their escape, robbing him of his parliamentary majority on the eve of his departure to tomorrow's Camp David summit with Yasser Arafat. And in a further humiliation, Mr Barak was abandoned by his foreign minister, David Levy, who is boycotting the summit because he believes it is destined to fail. Despite the disaster unfolding around him, Mr Barak tried to brazen it out yesterday, declaring he would march on to the summit, and that he still enjoyed a popular mandate to make peace. \"None of these rejectionists will teach me how to defend Israel and its future,\" he said in a televised address. \"No one will teach me what security is. I must distance myself from all the political controversies and party considerations to find the way to peace that will end the conflict of blood between ourselves and our neighbours.\" But it was clear that he has been seriously bled by the defections, and can no longer take the bold steps needed to produce an agreement that will be palatable with the Palestinians. In his address, he pledged to \"sign only an agreement that will ensure security for the people of Israel and maintain the red lines of the governments of Israel which are known to all\". For Israelis, the implication is clear: Mr Barak is determined to hang on to a sizeable portion of the West Bank - regarded by hawkish Israelis as a biblical birthright and a vital security buffer - despite accusations from the departing rightwing and religious members of his coalition that he is contemplating surrender. The message is equally clear for Mr Arafat: Mr Barak is too weak to deliver the minimum the Palestinians have demanded: return of all lands occupied by Israel since 1967, and Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state. That increases the chances that this summit, billed as a make-or-break affair by the Palestinians, Israelis and Americans alike, will fail. If that happens, there are widespread predictions of bloodshed. \"The alternative is so horrible that a failure of Camp David is inconceivable,\" Efraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defence minister, told CNN. The potential for violence was underscored yesterday when Israeli soldiers opened fire on a Palestinian car in Gaza, killing a woman and wounding five people. Mr Levy's walkout, partly the result of pique that Mr Barak has not kept him informed of secret negotiations, comes after the Shas party, which merges ethnic pride with ultra-orthodox theology, bolted from the coalition, also accusing Mr Barak of unilaterally deciding to make dangerous concessions to the Palestinians. The firestorm in the Israeli right, with settlers' groups announcing a series of mass rallies, has been fuelled by press reports that Mr Barak is ready to hand over 90% of the West Bank to the Palestinians, evacuating 50,000 Jewish settlers, and to grant Mr Arafat a toehold in Arab east Jerusalem. He is also reportedly considering the return of the Jordan valley, and a formula to allow thousands of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel proper. Shas had demanded that the prime minister outline the limits of his willingness to compromise. \"The process is very important to us and we expect to be genuine partners on the way,\" said Eli Yishai, Shas leader. \"But we don't know the way.\" The resignations do not take effect for 48 hours, leaving time for the haggling that has become a feature of Israeli politics.

      "body": "<p>Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, is fond of insisting that he is no politician, and that was never more apparent than yesterday when, as his government fell apart around him, he prepared to depart for Camp David.</p> <p>With three parties having announced they are to exit his coalition, Israeli commentators say Mr Barak is heading for disaster, no matter what the outcome of talks that begin tomorrow.</p> <p>The analysts may disagree on whether his predicament is due to political inexperience, his uncompromising and secretive style of governance, or the political system. But they concur on a few things: Israel is heading towards early elections, and may also be heading for a violent confrontation with the Palestinians.</p> <p>If the summit produces a deal, Mr Barak may gamble on elections, combined with a referendum on the peace agreement, calculating that voters will once again reward him with a generous mandate.</p> <p>If the talks fail, Mr Barak may be forced into a national unity government with the rightwing Likud party. While that may buy peace at home, he may then face a violent conflict with the Palestinians.</p> <p>Within the territories ruled by the Palestinian Authority, frustration is spreading. On Friday, a Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, told Israeli television he was exhausted by seven years of talks, and called Israel a society of \"fascists and racists\". He went on: \"I am sick and tired of you in your uniforms. I am sick and tired of Israelis with their guns.\"</p> <p>The fear is that that sentiment would translate into large-scale violence if a Palestinian state were declared later this year, and Israel responded, as Mr Barak has threatened, by annexing large chunks of the West Bank.</p> <p>The scale of Mr Barak's crisis must be seen against the enormous expectations that accompanied his rise to power. One year on, and the sense of impending doom is so strong that Israelis are becoming nostalgic about their disgraced former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu.

      "bodyText": "Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, is fond of insisting that he is no politician, and that was never more apparent than yesterday when, as his government fell apart around him, he prepared to depart for Camp David. With three parties having announced they are to exit his coalition, Israeli commentators say Mr Barak is heading for disaster, no matter what the outcome of talks that begin tomorrow. The analysts may disagree on whether his predicament is due to political inexperience, his uncompromising and secretive style of governance, or the political system. But they concur on a few things: Israel is heading towards early elections, and may also be heading for a violent confrontation with the Palestinians. If the summit produces a deal, Mr Barak may gamble on elections, combined with a referendum on the peace agreement, calculating that voters will once again reward him with a generous mandate. If the talks fail, Mr Barak may be forced into a national unity government with the rightwing Likud party. While that may buy peace at home, he may then face a violent conflict with the Palestinians. Within the territories ruled by the Palestinian Authority, frustration is spreading. On Friday, a Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, told Israeli television he was exhausted by seven years of talks, and called Israel a society of \"fascists and racists\". He went on: \"I am sick and tired of you in your uniforms. I am sick and tired of Israelis with their guns.\" The fear is that that sentiment would translate into large-scale violence if a Palestinian state were declared later this year, and Israel responded, as Mr Barak has threatened, by annexing large chunks of the West Bank. The scale of Mr Barak's crisis must be seen against the enormous expectations that accompanied his rise to power. One year on, and the sense of impending doom is so strong that Israelis are becoming nostalgic about their disgraced former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. Written off following last year's election defeat and his investigation on charges of squirrelling away state gifts, Mr Netanyahu is now moving ahead of Mr Barak in opinion polls. With officials admitting that the case against him may collapse because of thin evidence, he is poised for a political return. As during previous crises, Mr Barak never lets on that he is troubled by the prospect of political meltdown - and that may be part of the problem. During the past year, he has plodded on, neglecting his coalition partners, the economy, and deepening social divisions to pursue peace. His singlemindedness served him well when he pulled Israeli forces out of south Lebanon in May. But his failure to build consensus among his coalition partners has proved fatal - to the viability of his government, and perhaps to the peace process. For 11 months he ignored the wrangling between his second largest coalition partner, Shas, which fuses ethnic pride with ultra-orthodox theology, and the secular Meretz party. Then, with Shas poised to walk out and torpedo his parliamentary majority, he made such desperate attempts at appease ment that he sacrificed his credibility, and his natural allies in the peace camp. And in the end, it was to no avail. Only days after returning to the stable, Shas threatened to leave the coalition again yesterday, because Mr Barak would not give them veto power over his ground positions in the summit. As before, Mr Barak went into last-minute overdrive, pleading for the survival of his government. Shas notables were unmoved by the display.",

It was, as ever, a peaceful occasion, as were all but nine of 3,300 Orange marches during last year's marching season.</p> <p>Patricia Robinson, 25, also a Catholic mother of two, said: \"A young Protestant lad, Gareth Faulkner, was killed in a car crash recently. His funeral was last Sunday, and the whole town turned out to show their respects. There have never been religious differences here.\"</p> <p>Drumcree might as well have been a million miles away, rather than a short hop down the M1. In Stewartstown there was universal regret yesterday, but both sides of the community were pulling together. At Portadown, they would have been at each other's throats yesterday, if the RUC had given them the remotest opportunity.</p> <p>Close to 2,000 Orangemen and 1,000 supporters braved driving rain to take part in the parade. The weather was enough to persuade all but a couple of hundred to go home after the march from Portadown town centre, past the Garvaghy Road, to Drumcree Hill where a church service and speeches took place.</p> <p>The Portadown Orange Order's annual service is to commemorate 300 of its members fallen on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, most from a single machine gun. It is also to celebrate King William of Orange's victory over the Catholic forces of James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 and they first marched down what is now the Garvaghy Road in 1807.</p> <p>Drumcree Six, the latest episode in a saga dating back to 1995, was different from its predecessors. The Portadown district, in calling another march last week, achieved its aim of stretching the RUC and army in province-wide protests. Trouble had previously only followed the parade, rerouted away from the Garvaghy Road yesterday for the third successive year.</p> <p>The Orangemen called for four hours of protests today. They said they wanted them to be peaceful, but the RUC is in little doubt that its officers will again be facing petrol bombs and burning barricades as disaffected loyalists, as much using Drumcree as a vent for hooliganism as to support the civil liberties of Portadown Orangemen, lay waste to their own deprived areas.</p> <p>Yesterday they marched from Carleton Orange Hall past the loyalist Corcrain estate, where Ulster Freedom Fighter Johnny Adair had applauded masked Loyalist Volunteer Force gunman firing a volley of shots last week. A sign there read: \"It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees.\"</p> <p>But there was humiliation for the Orangemen after the Rev John Pickering's hour-long service at the once picturesque Church of Ascension.</p> <p>For the first time in the 104 weeks since the 1998 ban, no RUC officer came forward at the steel barricade to accept the Orangemen's letter of complaint. It was because of shame, suggested Nigel Dawson, district secretary.</p> <p>The main attraction at the barrier was Harold Gracey, blamed for fostering last week's violence with his demands for loyalists to take to the streets. He said he felt like a pop star, and, although he was singing the same old tune again yesterday, his 4,000-strong audience roared its approval.</p> <p>He denied that he was to blame for last week's violence, which left 37 police officers injured, and tourism and inward investment wrecked. Others were at fault, he claimed, and he listed the BBC, the Northern Ireland Office, the SDLP member Brid Rodgers, her leader, John Hume, and even the ecumenicals in the Church of Ireland.</p> <p>Mr Gracey said: \"I asked last last week for people to get off their bellies. I think they are back on their knees now, and very soon, they will be back on their feet.\"</p> <p>He refused to condemn violence, again pointing out that the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, never did. But he did ask protesters to respect the Sabbath, if only for the rector's sake.</p> <p>But a stark indication of how far Orangemen feel the balance in Northern Ireland has swung against them came from Robert Shaw, 40, who railed against the RUC.</p> <p>Mr Shaw said: \"They are a republican force. They are the military wing of Sinn Fein. After 30 years, they have deserted us. I don't agree with violence, but violence put the RUC in power.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.orangenet.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.orangenet.org</a> Orange Order site links <a href=\"http://www.garvaghyroad.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.garvaghyroad.org</a> Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition <a href=\"http://www.paradescommission.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.paradescommission.org</a> Parades Commission</p>",

Patricia Robinson, 25, also a Catholic mother of two, said: \"A young Protestant lad, Gareth Faulkner, was killed in a car crash recently. His funeral was last Sunday, and the whole town turned out to show their respects. There have never been religious differences here.\" Drumcree might as well have been a million miles away, rather than a short hop down the M1. In Stewartstown there was universal regret yesterday, but both sides of the community were pulling together. At Portadown, they would have been at each other's throats yesterday, if the RUC had given them the remotest opportunity. Close to 2,000 Orangemen and 1,000 supporters braved driving rain to take part in the parade. The weather was enough to persuade all but a couple of hundred to go home after the march from Portadown town centre, past the Garvaghy Road, to Drumcree Hill where a church service and speeches took place. The Portadown Orange Order's annual service is to commemorate 300 of its members fallen on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, most from a single machine gun. It is also to celebrate King William of Orange's victory over the Catholic forces of James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 and they first marched down what is now the Garvaghy Road in 1807. Drumcree Six, the latest episode in a saga dating back to 1995, was different from its predecessors. The Portadown district, in calling another march last week, achieved its aim of stretching the RUC and army in province-wide protests. Trouble had previously only followed the parade, rerouted away from the Garvaghy Road yesterday for the third successive year. The Orangemen called for four hours of protests today. They said they wanted them to be peaceful, but the RUC is in little doubt that its officers will again be facing petrol bombs and burning barricades as disaffected loyalists, as much using Drumcree as a vent for hooliganism as to support the civil liberties of Portadown Orangemen, lay waste to their own deprived areas. Yesterday they marched from Carleton Orange Hall past the loyalist Corcrain estate, where Ulster Freedom Fighter Johnny Adair had applauded masked Loyalist Volunteer Force gunman firing a volley of shots last week. A sign there read: \"It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees.\" But there was humiliation for the Orangemen after the Rev John Pickering's hour-long service at the once picturesque Church of Ascension. For the first time in the 104 weeks since the 1998 ban, no RUC officer came forward at the steel barricade to accept the Orangemen's letter of complaint. It was because of shame, suggested Nigel Dawson, district secretary. The main attraction at the barrier was Harold Gracey, blamed for fostering last week's violence with his demands for loyalists to take to the streets. He said he felt like a pop star, and, although he was singing the same old tune again yesterday, his 4,000-strong audience roared its approval. He denied that he was to blame for last week's violence, which left 37 police officers injured, and tourism and inward investment wrecked. Others were at fault, he claimed, and he listed the BBC, the Northern Ireland Office, the SDLP member Brid Rodgers, her leader, John Hume, and even the ecumenicals in the Church of Ireland. Mr Gracey said: \"I asked last last week for people to get off their bellies. I think they are back on their knees now, and very soon, they will be back on their feet.\" He refused to condemn violence, again pointing out that the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, never did. But he did ask protesters to respect the Sabbath, if only for the rector's sake. But a stark indication of how far Orangemen feel the balance in Northern Ireland has swung against them came from Robert Shaw, 40, who railed against the RUC. Mr Shaw said: \"They are a republican force. They are the military wing of Sinn Fein. After 30 years, they have deserted us. I don't agree with violence, but violence put the RUC in power.\" www.orangenet.org Orange Order site links www.garvaghyroad.org Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition www.paradescommission.org Parades Commission",

      "bodyText": "The Church of England last night took the next step in its tortuous 25-year-old debate over the ordination of women by agreeing to set in motion moves which could eventually - probably in another 10 years - see them being appointed as bishops. The General Synod meeting in York passed a motion to begin a theological study on the implications of promoting women to the Church of England's highest offices - but only after a formal vote was demanded by opponents of the move in order to gauge the strength of opinion among bishops, clergy and lay members. The motion was designed to maximise support, and succeeded as the bishops voted 36 to 1 in favour of the study, clergy members by 154 to 39 and laity by 165 to 49. More radical moves to speed up the appointment of women bishops were thrown out. Women were first ordained into the priesthood six years ago, but any further moves will require not only the eventual approval of the synod but also parliamentary legislation. Afterwards the proposer, the Venerable Judith Rose, Archdeacon of Tonbridge, Kent, one of the most senior ordained women in the church, said: \"The debate needs to continue and I hope this will give a positive incentive to push forward.\" Mrs Rose, herself one of the first women to be ordained, will be long retired before female bishops are appointed. \"Because of my age I am never going to be a potential candidate, although the colour purple suits me quite well,\" she said. Even though yesterday's proposal was limited, it caused opponents of women priests to claim that promoting women further would split the church and further complicate ecumenical discussions with the Catholic Church, which does not recognise the ability of women to be priests in any form. One opponent, the Rev Angus MacLeay of Houghton in Carlisle diocese told the Synod: \"The important fact is that Jesus did not allow female oversight. The witness of the New Testament is clear.\" There are fears that the 1,000 Anglican churches in England which at the moment still do not accept the authority of women priests may harden their opposition by refusing to recognise even male clergy if they are ordained by women bishops. More than 450 clergy left the ministry following women's ordination - some of them to become Roman Catholics - a move which has so far cost the Church of England \u00a315.6m in compensation payouts to them for the cost to their consciences. Sister churches in the United States, New Zealand and Canada already have women bishops and the Scottish Episcopal Church is likely to appoint them soon. The Methodists, with whom the Church of England holds periodic discussions on unity, has many women ministers and is currently considering introducing bishops.",

And these are the lucky ones who are scheduled to receive debt relief; other countries such as Haiti and Nigeria, burdened with huge debt, are not even in the queue. Second, because a tone of panic has crept in; knowing there are only a few months left, Jubilee 2000 has made emotive (and unsubstantiated) statements such as: \"by stopping the collection of debt payments now, the G8... would start making a difference - and saving lives - immediately\". The frustration is understandable. If you can't achieve debt relief in the millennium year with millions of campaigners, when can you?</p> <p>To say that Jubilee 2000 has failed is a bit of a volte face for this newspaper which did more than most (with the arguable exception of the Financial Times) to cover the campaign and to record its triumph in a) mobilising an army of activists contrary to all the doom-mongering of compassion fatigue; and b) getting results such as the G8's promises in Cologne a year ago and Gordon Brown and Bill Clinton's competing offers to cancel bilateral debt. But these achievements have never looked so fragile; Cafod (the Christian charity) published a survey last week reporting that more than half the population believe the debt problem has been solved.</p> <p>The fear is that the momentum to resolve the issue will simply ebb away. Mr Brown is aware of these anxieties; his initiative yesterday to hold out debt relief as a carrot to entice countries at war, such as Ethiopia, to make peace is a bid for campaigners to keep faith that he will deliver. There are two critical issues: why is debt relief happening so slowly? And why does it matter so much? The first question has got buried in two conflicting views: either the creditors don't really want to give debt relief, so they pile up criteria which ensure that nobody qualifies for it. Or the villains are held to be the debtor countries themselves: they get involved in wars, or jack up the pay of their teachers and nurses and fail to balance their budgets. The truth lies somewhere between them. It also draws in wider, linked questions of the reasons for Africa's political instability, to which Clare Short sensibly proposed this weekend some \"joined-up government\" between the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and her own department for international development.</p> <p>But before Mr Blair, who often talks of globalisation, tucks into his sushi, perhaps he should consider this: debt relief is critical to ensuring that a whole swath of the world isn't permanently trapped in a cycle of poverty, interest payments and underdevelopment. This is not just leftie rhetoric, it is widely accepted. What is at stake here is whether globalisation really means the continuing enrichment of a small proportion of the world's population at the expense of the deepening poverty and instability of large tranches of the rest. Is globalisation for the few or for the many, prime minister?</p> <p>But there is another answer to the question of why it matters. The debt relief campaign throws into stark relief the central contradiction of globalisation: it is to do with time. Money, information and trade are moving faster around the world than ever before, but as they are speeding up, so the political system to manage and regulate them is slowing, getting bogged down in international negotiations and the turf wars of multilateral institutions. The economic and the political are out of kilter; to use a homely metaphor, it is like bike gears crunching. And it frustrates even some politicians, wearing down the reserves of perseverance of the genuinely committed such as Gordon Brown, as the process moves at the speed of the lowest common denominator. Debt relief is developing into a major test of the global political elite and its institutions - the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - to manage globalisation. Can they? Do they want to? The questions are about both their capacity and their political will. Disturbingly, it looks as if they put most effort into managing (through manipulation, bureaucratic inertia or indifference) the challenges to global capitalism, rather than the beast itself.</p> <p>As, for example, the retreat to Okinawa where they will escape from the possibility of demos, tear gas and awkward questions, to contemplate the soothing rhythm of the Pacific's waves breaking on the shore.</p> <p>\u0095 Island Mentality is available from Jubilee 2000 Coalition, 1 Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DT.<br><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

To say that Jubilee 2000 has failed is a bit of a volte face for this newspaper which did more than most (with the arguable exception of the Financial Times) to cover the campaign and to record its triumph in a) mobilising an army of activists contrary to all the doom-mongering of compassion fatigue; and b) getting results such as the G8's promises in Cologne a year ago and Gordon Brown and Bill Clinton's competing offers to cancel bilateral debt. But these achievements have never looked so fragile; Cafod (the Christian charity) published a survey last week reporting that more than half the population believe the debt problem has been solved. The fear is that the momentum to resolve the issue will simply ebb away. Mr Brown is aware of these anxieties; his initiative yesterday to hold out debt relief as a carrot to entice countries at war, such as Ethiopia, to make peace is a bid for campaigners to keep faith that he will deliver. There are two critical issues: why is debt relief happening so slowly? And why does it matter so much? The first question has got buried in two conflicting views: either the creditors don't really want to give debt relief, so they pile up criteria which ensure that nobody qualifies for it. Or the villains are held to be the debtor countries themselves: they get involved in wars, or jack up the pay of their teachers and nurses and fail to balance their budgets. The truth lies somewhere between them. It also draws in wider, linked questions of the reasons for Africa's political instability, to which Clare Short sensibly proposed this weekend some \"joined-up government\" between the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and her own department for international development. But before Mr Blair, who often talks of globalisation, tucks into his sushi, perhaps he should consider this: debt relief is critical to ensuring that a whole swath of the world isn't permanently trapped in a cycle of poverty, interest payments and underdevelopment. This is not just leftie rhetoric, it is widely accepted. What is at stake here is whether globalisation really means the continuing enrichment of a small proportion of the world's population at the expense of the deepening poverty and instability of large tranches of the rest. Is globalisation for the few or for the many, prime minister? But there is another answer to the question of why it matters. The debt relief campaign throws into stark relief the central contradiction of globalisation: it is to do with time. Money, information and trade are moving faster around the world than ever before, but as they are speeding up, so the political system to manage and regulate them is slowing, getting bogged down in international negotiations and the turf wars of multilateral institutions. The economic and the political are out of kilter; to use a homely metaphor, it is like bike gears crunching. And it frustrates even some politicians, wearing down the reserves of perseverance of the genuinely committed such as Gordon Brown, as the process moves at the speed of the lowest common denominator. Debt relief is developing into a major test of the global political elite and its institutions - the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - to manage globalisation. Can they? Do they want to? The questions are about both their capacity and their political will. Disturbingly, it looks as if they put most effort into managing (through manipulation, bureaucratic inertia or indifference) the challenges to global capitalism, rather than the beast itself. As, for example, the retreat to Okinawa where they will escape from the possibility of demos, tear gas and awkward questions, to contemplate the soothing rhythm of the Pacific's waves breaking on the shore. \u0095 Island Mentality is available from Jubilee 2000 Coalition, 1 Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DT. madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com",

What is practical is the (once-off) $20 cost of drugs to cure the tuberculosis which will lead to an early death. London has experienced an 80% increase in TB cases in a decade, mainly due to migration from Africa where TB/Aids has risen nearly tenfold over the same period. Inaction is affecting (infecting) us now. Peter Davies Secretary, TB Alert pdd3044@liverpool.ac.uk \u0095Maggie O'Kane's article brings out the real horror of HIV and Aids - not just the diseases themselves but the abject and heart-wrenching suffering of those without money or power. Other august newspapers run campaigns on such essential issues as the price of CDs. Now is the time to lobby for something real: ways to alleviate the poverty which is the real enemy in all natural disasters. People want to do something. In the face of the grim statistics, we feel so powerless. Barbara Jones London \u0095As Sarah Boseley reports (The disease 10 times as deadly as war, July 8), the popular UK perception is that HIV is no longer a problem - although recent health reports show an increase in UK cases, most dramatically in the heterosexual population. Why is the British government not increasing public awareness through advertising and other means? I know this is being addressed in schools, but what about the high risk groups, especially the 18-30-year-olds who have become very complacent concerning safe sexual practices. HIV isn't only a problem for Africa. Ewan Watson Dundee ewanw@madasafish.com",

      "bodyText": "French examine 'mass murder' A French prosecutor ordered an investigation yesterday into the possible mass murder of between 25 and 40 elderly and seriously ill patients at a private care centre 15 miles south of Paris. The state prosecutor for Evry, Laurent Davenas, said medical examinations will determine the causes of death of some patients at the La Martiniere clinic near Saclay. Police are said to suspect that the patients were killed with a powerful cocktail of sedatives, administered by the clinic's personnel. AP, Paris Blasts kill seven in south Russia Seven people died in two separate bomb blasts in southern Russia yesterday, raising fears that Chechen separatists were extending their guerrilla war beyond the rebel province. Five people were killed and 17 wounded in a blast at the central market in Vladikavkaz, in North Ossetia, the scene of an explosion in March 1999 that killed more than 50 people. Two others were killed in a blast outside a shop in Rostov-on-Don, further north, near the Sea of Azov. Reuters Moscow Bus crashes in China kill 80 More than 80 people were killed in China at the weekend when two buses plunged into rivers swollen by heavy rains, according to the country's state news agency. At Liuzhou, in southern province of Guangxi, 65 died on Friday night after their bus plunged 30 metres into the Liujiang river. Seventeen others were reported killed when a bus crashed into the Yellow river in the northern province of Shanxi. Reuters, Beijing Jolo rebels grab French TV team Three members of French television crew were reported missing yesterday on Jolo island in the southern Philippines where Islamic rebels have been holding 20 mostly foreign hostages for 10 weeks. A provincial police chief said the reporters, from the France 2 television network, had been working close to rebel-held areas in Mindanao province and had not returned by late evening. Reuters, Jolo Injuries mount in Pamplona Forty people were injured yesterday, one seriously, on the third day of Pamplona's running of the bulls, the Spanish festival in which men run alongside a stampeding herd through the town's narrow streets. Seven of the injured required hospital treatment. Reuters, Pamplona Haitians to vote for Aristide Haitians appeared set to grant former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party control of parliament yesterday in second-round elections despite a poll indicating that 43% of respondents felt there was \"massive fraud\" in the first round. Most voters said there was no viable alternative to Mr Aristide's rule. AP, St Marc, Haiti",

The attempt, with the Durban Declaration, published in the respected Nature magazine, to put a line under the controversy and get on with the business of saving lives, as scientists see it, seems to have gone badly wrong.",

      "body": "<p>At 2.30 in the afternoon, in the lobby of a trashy hotel with a good address and vulgar postcards of London in spiny racks by reception, a mismatched collection of women gathers. They shuffle around self-consciously, reapply their lipstick, wonder where the loo is, eye each other guardedly. Some of them are beautiful, some aren't, one is 70 if she's a day. But they are all palpably nervy for within moments they will meet Ginie Sayles, professional Texan, self-styled relationship fairy godmother, Best Selling Author, Popular Speaker and Consultant - even to Celebrities. And Ginie Sayles will teach them How To Marry Rich.</p> <p>Sayles' press release reads: \"Financial independence? Screw that. Who needs to earn their own living when you can freeload off a passing aged billionaire? He'll buy you diamonds, take you to the upmarket equivalent of Sandals Resorts and pay for your Botox injections! Fun, fun, fun!\"</p> <p>That's a lie, of course. It actually invites you to hear how Ginie married rich (and bonus! you get to meet the billionaire chump who married her) and get an in on her tried and tested 12-point plan. The promise of this, her first UK seminar, had the phones ringing off the hook and ladies hitching up their skirts and beating back the opposition in their eagerness to secure a place. A mere 35 made it.</p> <p>There is something simultaneously appalling and yet unsurprising about the Ginie Sayles phenomenon. About the mega book sales and the sell-out seminars, the fan mail and the iconic status; 21st century spiritual and yoga literate though we are, have we ever been so materially aspiring, so covetous? So Sayles is merely flogging us another way to get us some. Or maybe there's a political agenda bubbling under the surface: is she in fact peddling a twisted form of feminism, reclaiming the idea of the gold-digger?</p> <p>Back in the hotel lobby, the tension erupts. \"Oh!\" gasps a late thirtyish type with a rigid French pleat. \"We're not going to have to role-play, are we?\"</p> <p>Too late. Resplendent in a red logo T-shirt, belted tightly into her beige tapered chinos, Ginie Sayle (Southern belle petite, Krystle Carrington blonde, snub nose-pretty) flings open the door. \"Hello, hello, thank you so much for coming, oh, we're going to have fun, I can tell it!\" Behind her, the leaden figure of Reid, her sixty- something, millionaire husband of 15 years, looms ineffectually. He is also wearing the belted-in T-shirt and chinos combo, but somehow it doesn't work so well on his large, slope-shouldered, inherently grey person.</p> <p>\"I would like to congratulate you all,\" Ginie begins, \"on knowing you deserve the best. That is why you are here and why I am going to teach you it is A-OK to marry money.\"</p> <p>Ginie's seminar manner is pure evangelical preacher. She paces, she thrusts a finger skyward, she punches her fist into her hand. Sometimes she cries, mostly she smiles the wide smile of the converted. \"The value of a human being cannot be measured in money. Lifestyle, however, can. I want you to love a rich man, and win.\"</p> <p>On the flip chart behind her, in not particularly pretty handwriting, is her legendary 12-point plan. It's a curious combination of pop psychology and practical advice on hijacking rich men. Highlights include: 3) Four Types, as in identifying rich mates (RM) who are most likely to marry out of their financial class. They are: your Novelty Seeking RM junior (Donald Trump type), your Guilty RM junior (who doesn't think he deserves his wealth but can't bring himself to hand it all to the drought- ridden, so looks for a struggling woman to rescue - a single mother, say), your Outcast RM junior (never accepted by the family, so marries to shock) and your self-made RM.</p> <p>Also 4) Changes To Make. Move to an expensive postcode, even if you wind up starving in an attic. Your mind is like boiling water, the rich neighbourhood is like expensive tea. Get a professional make-over every two years. \"Bipperty Bopperty Boo! See, I am your fairy godmother.\" Then there's 8) Sex. Make it safe, hold out till the fifth date, \"don't be too exotica erotica\". Plus 9) Money. \"If someone says they love you, but they won't spend money on you, they're lying.\"</p> <p>Each pointer is illustrated with extravagant anecdotes, in which all the women are Lucky Santangelo beautiful and feisty, all the men are loaded and independent legal advice is sought on prenups. The audience takes notes, nods, laughs. There is a scary consistency in the skewed logic of these ramblings. Sometimes Ginie ambles happily into the offensive (\"You let an RM know an ex beat you and you are inviting your RM to do the same\") but sometimes, weirdly, she makes sense: \"It's not about matching like Ken and Barbie, it's about knowing your flaws are compatible.\"</p> <p>After two hours' bulldozing of every principle known to the women's movement, Ginie has a break. Her ladies are buzzing. Elizabeth (Danish, cohabiting with a man who doesn't know she is here) loves the stuff about understanding your worth. Cleo (exotic single mother) thinks Ginie may be selling false expectations. \"How can a frumpy little thing expect ... \"</p> <p>The impossibly vain, beautiful, seventyish Maria is spellbound. \"I have read all Ginie's books. I have plenty of men wanting to marry me, but none can share my lifestyle. I have already left one millionaire husband. I thrive on excitement, you see.\" And coral lipstick-wearing Clare is incandescently optimistic. \"I could be on a yacht in the Bahamas by September! If this doesn't help me marry someone rich, maybe it will just help me marry someone .\"</p> <p>After 15 minutes, a recharged Ginie reprises her machiavellian discourse. Keep dating other men until the day you marry your RM. Don't cohabit for longer than three months. Leave a man who hasn't married you within three years. Buy her books and learn how to enter and leave a limousine.</p> <p>Every once in a while, you get chinks of insight into the small-town Texan roots that made Ginie this way. She talks about a fateful trip to a posh country club as a teenager: \"It was there I realised I could learn a lot from the rich.\" She stole Reid off her best friend and they haven't spoken since. Which is sad, but you can't snuggle up to a best friend at night, can you? She is mercenary and proud. \"When people say: 'Why not make money yourself?' I reply, once you've married rich, you have made it yourself!\"</p> <p>She finishes to riotous applause. Maria wants a private consultation. Coral Lips wants to know what you do if your RM is tight. Ginie Sayles shakes hands, pinches cheeks, makes free with the \"sweethearts\" and the \"cuties\". And in the corner, Reid shuffles papers and looks distant. Does he mind hearing his woman talk like this? Not at all. She loves to give seminars and he just loves to be near her. How did he feel about falling for her 12-point plan? \"At the time, I had no idea.\" He slumps down in his chair and seems to go slightly more grey at the edges. \"The rich are going to marry someone,\" trills Ginie Sayles after her departing protegees, from the far corner of the room. \"Why not you?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "At 2.30 in the afternoon, in the lobby of a trashy hotel with a good address and vulgar postcards of London in spiny racks by reception, a mismatched collection of women gathers. They shuffle around self-consciously, reapply their lipstick, wonder where the loo is, eye each other guardedly. Some of them are beautiful, some aren't, one is 70 if she's a day. But they are all palpably nervy for within moments they will meet Ginie Sayles, professional Texan, self-styled relationship fairy godmother, Best Selling Author, Popular Speaker and Consultant - even to Celebrities. And Ginie Sayles will teach them How To Marry Rich. Sayles' press release reads: \"Financial independence? Screw that. Who needs to earn their own living when you can freeload off a passing aged billionaire? He'll buy you diamonds, take you to the upmarket equivalent of Sandals Resorts and pay for your Botox injections! Fun, fun, fun!\" That's a lie, of course. It actually invites you to hear how Ginie married rich (and bonus! you get to meet the billionaire chump who married her) and get an in on her tried and tested 12-point plan. The promise of this, her first UK seminar, had the phones ringing off the hook and ladies hitching up their skirts and beating back the opposition in their eagerness to secure a place. A mere 35 made it. There is something simultaneously appalling and yet unsurprising about the Ginie Sayles phenomenon. About the mega book sales and the sell-out seminars, the fan mail and the iconic status; 21st century spiritual and yoga literate though we are, have we ever been so materially aspiring, so covetous? So Sayles is merely flogging us another way to get us some. Or maybe there's a political agenda bubbling under the surface: is she in fact peddling a twisted form of feminism, reclaiming the idea of the gold-digger? Back in the hotel lobby, the tension erupts. \"Oh!\" gasps a late thirtyish type with a rigid French pleat. \"We're not going to have to role-play, are we?\" Too late. Resplendent in a red logo T-shirt, belted tightly into her beige tapered chinos, Ginie Sayle (Southern belle petite, Krystle Carrington blonde, snub nose-pretty) flings open the door. \"Hello, hello, thank you so much for coming, oh, we're going to have fun, I can tell it!\" Behind her, the leaden figure of Reid, her sixty- something, millionaire husband of 15 years, looms ineffectually. He is also wearing the belted-in T-shirt and chinos combo, but somehow it doesn't work so well on his large, slope-shouldered, inherently grey person. \"I would like to congratulate you all,\" Ginie begins, \"on knowing you deserve the best. That is why you are here and why I am going to teach you it is A-OK to marry money.\" Ginie's seminar manner is pure evangelical preacher. She paces, she thrusts a finger skyward, she punches her fist into her hand. Sometimes she cries, mostly she smiles the wide smile of the converted. \"The value of a human being cannot be measured in money. Lifestyle, however, can. I want you to love a rich man, and win.\" On the flip chart behind her, in not particularly pretty handwriting, is her legendary 12-point plan. It's a curious combination of pop psychology and practical advice on hijacking rich men. Highlights include: 3) Four Types, as in identifying rich mates (RM) who are most likely to marry out of their financial class. They are: your Novelty Seeking RM junior (Donald Trump type), your Guilty RM junior (who doesn't think he deserves his wealth but can't bring himself to hand it all to the drought- ridden, so looks for a struggling woman to rescue - a single mother, say), your Outcast RM junior (never accepted by the family, so marries to shock) and your self-made RM. Also 4) Changes To Make. Move to an expensive postcode, even if you wind up starving in an attic. Your mind is like boiling water, the rich neighbourhood is like expensive tea. Get a professional make-over every two years. \"Bipperty Bopperty Boo! See, I am your fairy godmother.\" Then there's 8) Sex. Make it safe, hold out till the fifth date, \"don't be too exotica erotica\". Plus 9) Money. \"If someone says they love you, but they won't spend money on you, they're lying.\" Each pointer is illustrated with extravagant anecdotes, in which all the women are Lucky Santangelo beautiful and feisty, all the men are loaded and independent legal advice is sought on prenups. The audience takes notes, nods, laughs. There is a scary consistency in the skewed logic of these ramblings. Sometimes Ginie ambles happily into the offensive (\"You let an RM know an ex beat you and you are inviting your RM to do the same\") but sometimes, weirdly, she makes sense: \"It's not about matching like Ken and Barbie, it's about knowing your flaws are compatible.\" After two hours' bulldozing of every principle known to the women's movement, Ginie has a break. Her ladies are buzzing. Elizabeth (Danish, cohabiting with a man who doesn't know she is here) loves the stuff about understanding your worth. Cleo (exotic single mother) thinks Ginie may be selling false expectations. \"How can a frumpy little thing expect ... \" The impossibly vain, beautiful, seventyish Maria is spellbound. \"I have read all Ginie's books. I have plenty of men wanting to marry me, but none can share my lifestyle. I have already left one millionaire husband. I thrive on excitement, you see.\" And coral lipstick-wearing Clare is incandescently optimistic. \"I could be on a yacht in the Bahamas by September! If this doesn't help me marry someone rich, maybe it will just help me marry someone .\" After 15 minutes, a recharged Ginie reprises her machiavellian discourse. Keep dating other men until the day you marry your RM. Don't cohabit for longer than three months. Leave a man who hasn't married you within three years. Buy her books and learn how to enter and leave a limousine. Every once in a while, you get chinks of insight into the small-town Texan roots that made Ginie this way. She talks about a fateful trip to a posh country club as a teenager: \"It was there I realised I could learn a lot from the rich.\" She stole Reid off her best friend and they haven't spoken since. Which is sad, but you can't snuggle up to a best friend at night, can you? She is mercenary and proud. \"When people say: 'Why not make money yourself?' I reply, once you've married rich, you have made it yourself!\" She finishes to riotous applause. Maria wants a private consultation. Coral Lips wants to know what you do if your RM is tight. Ginie Sayles shakes hands, pinches cheeks, makes free with the \"sweethearts\" and the \"cuties\". And in the corner, Reid shuffles papers and looks distant. Does he mind hearing his woman talk like this? Not at all. She loves to give seminars and he just loves to be near her. How did he feel about falling for her 12-point plan? \"At the time, I had no idea.\" He slumps down in his chair and seems to go slightly more grey at the edges. \"The rich are going to marry someone,\" trills Ginie Sayles after her departing protegees, from the far corner of the room. \"Why not you?\"",

Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of, 'Have you read a work of Shakespeare's?' \" </p> <p>That was CP Snow, the scientist turned novelist, speaking in his famous lecture The Two Cultures, delivered in 1959. Snow's two cultures were, of course, those of science and art. Today the gap has been reduced in some measure. What, for example, would this controversialist from the age of Blue Streak missiles, Vulcan H-bombers and the pioneering jump jet (British Boy's Own-style achievements all) have made of the two inspired new galleries that opened last week at the Science Museum in London? </p> <p>For in both - the Making of the Modern World and the Wellcome Wing - art and science are woven together. The Science Museum has always been a magical place, even if that magic has sometimes been as wobbly as Tommy Cooper's. This is where generations of children and their charges have come not so much to gawp at Puffing Billy (Bessamer's epoch-changing iron-to-steel converter) or early mass-production tool-making machinery by Marc Brunel, but to pull levers, press buttons, turn handles, and put their sticky fingers into anything that looks like a Van de Graaff generator. </p> <p>The museum's two latest galleries, one a conversion from a penny-plain wing dating from 1961, the other a Lottery and charitable trust-fuelled phantasmagoria, follow in this populist tradition. Yet neither for a moment talks down to its audience. Both make science as enjoyable and fascinating as it wasn't in the days when anyone who wanted to do art at school was denied science, even if they loved the Science Museum. There should never have been \"two cultures\" in British education and intellectual capital. Yet where, outside genuinely child-friendly institutions like the Science Museum, could children enjoy the laws of thermodynamics, motion and what have you? </p> <p>The latest design and architecture at the Science Museum are striking and enjoyable, if ultimately quite simple behind the theatrical lighting, dramatic colour schemes and bravura displays of the Wellcome Wing. What the museum has done over the past few years is rejig the main processional walkway from its Exhibition Road entrance through to the immense blue glass rear wall of the Wellcome Wing. Now the visitor moves past an introductory display of mighty old machines, through the revamped Space gallery, into the Making of the Modern World and then the \u00a350m Wellcome Wing. </p> <p>The new wing - designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, architects of such refined and imaginative new buildings as Southwark station on the London Underground and the Ruskin Library at the University of Lancaster - is signed clearly in mesmerising blue and orange light seen from the far end of the much cooler and more stately Making of the Modern World. Children seem to make a crocodile rush into this enticing realm, while adults are just as likely to linger in a well thought-out gallery designed by the architects Wilkinson Eyre, which brings together 250 years of scientific invention in what Andrew Nahum, its creator and curator, describes as \"100 steps\". </p> <p>Here's Puffing Billy, a model of the Forth Railway Bridge and a catalogue of marvels and wonders that leads up to a curatorial climax with a beautiful, polished-aluminium Lockheed Electra plane hanging at a jaunty angle from the high ceiling. This was the type of aircraft that featured in the last reel of Casablanca, and flew Neville Chamberlain back to Croydon airport from Berlin with his worthless piece of paper in 1938. </p> <p>Here the addition of films and newsreels on small monitors would be a help. It is all too easy for children - and adults - to wander past such important monuments to modern design and technology without giving them a second glance: a bit of Bogart and Bergman, or Chamberlain announcing \"peace in our time\" would bring this silent precursor to modern flight to vibrant life. There are, in fact, several such small films and animations in the gallery, including remarkable colour footage of Werner Von Braun's V2 missiles being launched from their pads on the Baltic coast. And a black and white still of a street in Hornsey, London, blown apart by one of Braun's rockets, brings home the salutary, if obvious, truth that science brings tragedy as well as the promise of brave new worlds. </p> <p>Beyond the Electra is the Wellcome Wing with its blue lighting and latest whizz-bang interactive technology carried off with style, wit and even grace. Essentially nothing more than a giant shoebox, the Wellcome Wing is kitted out with four can tilevered steel galleries hanging from massive concrete columns. The clarity of the building makes it a delight when it could so easily have been a madhouse, given the flow of people through its cavernous interior. </p> <p>From the lobby of the Imax cinema, you can look down and across to the goings-on in the four hanging galleries. Each of these has been given a distinct theme: the impact of digital technology (Digitopolis); the question of human identity (Who Am I?); what's next (In Future); and the latest news (Antenna, which boasts a clever display on the 33m-letter human genome, rushed up in about 48 hours). The exhibition design is by Casson Mann and is both imaginative and enjoyable. Exhibition lighting throughout, by DHA, is playful and, for a museum, remarkably restful despite the sheer volume of activity contained here. </p> <p>The effect is like some giant, ultra-modern film set, more Total Recall than Casablanca, but never overbearing and with more content in a few square feet than some famous \u00a31bn exhibitions have in hundreds. There's a funny, Star Wars-like cafe on the ground floor with visitors looking filmically ghoulish courtesy of illuminated table tops. There are views up and through the various displays and no sense of claustrophobia despite the (delightfully) dim lighting. </p> <p>These two new galleries deserve their instant popularity: they are a complementary pair and do much to inject new blood into this august institution. The Science Museum plans to keep changing over the coming years. Julian Powell-Tuck has been commissioned to design a new Energy gallery, while the 50-strong Wellcome team aim to keep their special contribution up to the minute. </p> <p>All this is timely, given Gordon Brown's promise last week: the government is to spend \u00a31bn on scientific research in a partnership with the Wellcome Trust, without which the Wellcome Wing would, of course, have been impossible. Science, we will no doubt soon be told, is the new rock'n'roll. Now, how does that Second Law of Thermodynamics go again?</p>",

      "body": "<p>The underworld has changed a great deal since the moonlit night in 1963 when Bruce Reynolds, the most erudite of the great train robbers, lit a Montecristo No 2 cigar and waited to spring one of the most audacious and carefully planned heists in history.</p> <p>Reynolds, nicknamed \"Napoleon\", undoubtedly earned his place in the higher echelons of the criminal premier league, and his escapades in the 50s and 60s helped enhance robbery's perversely romantic image.</p> <p>It's an image that has taken a hammering over the years, and a new book, Commercial Robbery, by Martin Gill, director of the Scarman Centre at the University of Leicester, will probably consign it to history once and for all.</p> <p>Today's robber is unlikely to have been inspired by Reynolds and his ilk, but may well have been encouraged by the TV show Crimewatch. Over the years, the programme has shown grainy footage of numerous successful raids, and thus convinced a generation of villains that robbery is really very easy.</p> <p>Planning a \"job\" on a building society, bank or post office can involve, DR Gill found, no more than a few minutes' preparation, and CCTV cameras, sophisticated alarms and quick-closing screens at the counter are unlikely to act as a deterrent.</p> <p>Money is obviously a key motive, but one of the 341 robbers who was interviewed for the book explained that excitement was an important factor too. \"When you do coke you get a rush out of it, but when you've got a gun in your hands, people are listening to you, they're doing as they're told, you're in full control. It's just brilliant, you're just there, you are the man, you're like God.\"</p> <p>Sixty-one per cent of the bank robbers who contributed to the book thought it was very unlikely they would be caught, and most were entirely dismissive, not to say scornful, of detectives, who were regarded as hopelessly incompetent. These beliefs seemed particularly bizarre considering every one of the robbers interviewed had been convicted and was already in jail.</p> <p>Most of the offenders admitted they hadn't give a second thought to the tough prison terms judges can hand down for robbery - the maximum is life - because \"they view the threat of prison as, at best, a remote one\".</p> <p>With each fresh insight, Dr Gill paints an ever more baffling picture of the thought processes driving a typical robber, leaving the reader feeling that most villains who pull on a balaclava and pull out a gun are far from criminal masterminds. The author highlights the contradiction. \"It is slightly ironic that these robbers were being interviewed in prison and yet claimed to have found their offence relatively easy to carry out.\"</p> <p>The book does, however, elicit interesting crime-prevention tips, especially to floor designers hoping to make buildings raid-proof. To most robbers, both amateurs and professionals, ease of escape, rather than the potential reward, is the most pressing concern. If a bank is on a street corner, it is likely to be a favoured target. \"I had five directions to go. It was perfect,\" explained one villain.</p> <p>Revolving doors, queueing rails and an L-shaped layout - meaning the robber cannot see what's creeping up behind - are just as likely to deter a robber as hi-tech security measures. Piped music is also off-putting because it affects concentration.</p> <p>CCTV cameras might help detection, but they don't frighten villains. This response was typical. \"I don't care if there's cameras. You can always change your appearance.\"</p> <p>Robbers are sometimes trapped on the wrong side of rising screens (on the staff side of the counter), increasing the likelihood of violence. One prisoner recalled: \"I was filling the bag with money all of a sudden, there's this terrible noise, bang, and I thought a weapon went off.</p> <p>\"I shouted to one of the girls, 'Look, you silly cow, get me out of here, otherwise there will be trouble.'\"</p> <p>This sample of robbers thought Thursdays and Fridays were the best days to strike. And almost a fifth admitted they had robbed the same place twice. \"It was easy, so I went back 10 days later.\" Another added: \"If you get a good result, you go back a second time.\"</p> <p>The weapon of choice was a gun, but the robbers admitted using a whole range of other arms, including golf clubs, hammers, screwdrivers and baseball bats. Some simply cocked their fingers inside a jacket. Most insisted they didn't like being violent and even showed remorse and sympathy for bank staff, particularly women. \"I feel hurt inside, [I worry that they might think] I'm going to come and get them or I'm going to blow them away or something.\"</p> <p>\"Have-a-go heroes\", meanwhile, deserve everything they get, crooks believe. Dr Gill found that robbers viewed them \"with resentment and even disbelief\".</p> <p>One of the most startling findings was that offenders did not seem to be discouraged by the prospect of a long prison sentence. The way prisoners deluded themselves about whether they could \"go straight\" when they were released was also disturbing. A mere 11.7% of the sample thought they would rob again, yet two-thirds of them had been in prison before.</p> <p>The reality is that most villains regard robbery as such an easy crime, and the likelihood of being caught so low, that reoffending is worth the risk, especially when serial offenders have little prospect of getting a job once they are back in the community.</p> <p>Somehow, awareness of the likelihood of capture and the inevitability of stiff sentencing needs to be raised. Some of the more professional armed robbers have cottoned on, but the vast majority have not. \"Robbers are no longer the cream of the underworld and they are much more likely to be desperate people who risk long terms in prison for relatively low rewards,\" concludes Dr Gill. He suggests the advantages of Crimewatch must be weighed carefully. \"There is no doubt that the programme has helped solve crimes, but at the same time it gives people ideas.\"</p> <p>As one of the robbers put it: \"They actually show people robbing banks and building societies and it just goes to show how easy it is if you've got a bit of nerve.

He stole from the age of five and became involved in gangs, graduating from theft, vehicle offences and burglary to commit his first robbery at 22.</p> <p>He had joined the army but was drawn into burglary by a friend. His first burglary was a major turning point because it netted the two men nearly \u00a31,000. \"I lost interest in any kind of work at all. This was easy money for me. All of a sudden I could get all the things I want and I could get them now.\"</p> <p>After six months during which he committed a burglary every night, he was caught, and served his first sentence of six months. He was thrown out of the army but managed to rejoin. He carried out a large number of commercial robberies while still in the army but eventually left.</p> <p>Many robberies later, he was arrested, convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. After he came out he went straight for nearly three years and had established a successful career in the tyre business when he was arrested for a robbery he says he hadn't committed. He escaped while in custody awaiting trial and committed three robberies. He was caught and sentenced to 14 years. He has severed all links with his family, and says: \"I've got no goals any more.

He was first convicted at the age of 10 and taken into care. He was expelled from school at the same age and never went back, living in a series of local authority homes and detention centres. He started to commit more and more burglaries, up to eight houses a day.</p> <p>At 17, in prison for burglary, he decided to move into armed robbery. \"The only way we can get to the top is through crime, so we do armed robberies because we know that's where the money is for us guys, and not the white-collar guys.\" He became the leader of a gang of armed robbers, using the money from one job to finance a cannabis deal which doubled his money. When he was charged after a police raid, he \"grassed\" his ex-associates because he felt they had let him down.</p> <p>He feels the system has failed to help him. \"Some people say you could have got a job here or there but that's bollocks.

In a clear sign that Downing Street is heeding calls from heartland supporters, the party leadership offered concessions on workers' rights and a debate on pensions at the party conference in the autumn. The leadership also threw its weight behind a compromise on electoral reform which kicks the issue into the long grass for up to five years. Trade union leaders last night welcomed the outcome of the national policy forum in Exeter, saying that it allowed Labour to turn its fire on the Tories. Sir Ken Jackson, the engineering union (AEEU) leader, said: \"From now on we can focus our attention on the alternative - William Hague and his extremist policies that would ruin Britain.\" His upbeat remarks came after a weekend of intense bargaining between senior ministers, trade union leaders and constituency activists on a raft of policy areas.

The children, who had requested the visit, were the last to have seen Sarah before she vanished from a country lane on July 1 in Kingston, West Sussex.</p> <p>Detectives heading the investigation fear the girl was abducted as she made the short walk to her grandparents' house from a field in which she and her siblings had been playing.</p> <p>Assistant Chief Constable Nigel Yeo said the boys had asked for the meeting as they wanted to understand the investigation better. He said: \"It helps my officers to understand it is a family tragedy, a living tragedy.\"</p> <p>As the search entered its second week and police continued to insist Operation Maple remained a \"missing persons investigation\", the Payne family refused to give up hope of their \"little princess\" being found.</p> <p>A Sussex police spokesman, David Edwards, said: \"There is a distinct lack of developments here. We are still getting a good response from the public but we are just missing that vital bit of information that will help us find Sarah. There may well be a nugget of information on one of the thousands of calls we are getting.\"</p> <p>Mrs Payne, 31, praised officers and said the family was overwhelmed by the size of the operation: \"You're doing everything we would do, that's the best compliment I can give you.\"</p> <p>She later added: \"We've got every confidence that it is just a matter of time. There's somebody out there, please just pick up the phone.\"</p> <p>Sarah's grandfather, Terry Payne, made a similar appeal at a press conference on Saturday. He said: \"It's tearing our family apart. Somebody's got Sarah and we want her back.\"</p> <p>As cards and letters of hope flooded in from around the world, villagers gathered at the church in East Preston to pray for the Payne family and the safe return of their missing child.</p> <p>Meanwhile police were deluged by calls after a reconstruction of the crime on Friday and road checks over the weekend. DNA test results were also arriving on a daily basis.</p> <p>Police confirmed there had been more than 4,500 calls, including leads on two new witnesses, and more than 600 separate tasks had been given to officers.</p> <p>New posters and leaflets about Sarah's case were distributed to revellers at the Littlehampton carnival on Saturday and police reiterated an appeal for help in tracing the drivers of a white van and a grey Ford Mondeo car, both seen close to where the youngster went missing.</p> <p>A family photo taken by Sarah's brother, Luke, showing Sarah and her sister Charlotte hugging, was also released.</p> <p>Mrs Payne was expected to return to Littlehampton police station today for a news conference at which she plans to read from the thousands of letters of support.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The brothers and sister of Sarah Payne yesterday visited the nerve centre of the police investigation into the eight-year-old's disappearance. Lee, 13, Luke, 11, and Charlotte, four, barely uttered a word as they met overall-clad search officers involved in the nine-day hunt for their sister. Their parents, Sara and Michael Payne, gave constant reassurance as the family toured Littlehampton police station. The children, who had requested the visit, were the last to have seen Sarah before she vanished from a country lane on July 1 in Kingston, West Sussex. Detectives heading the investigation fear the girl was abducted as she made the short walk to her grandparents' house from a field in which she and her siblings had been playing. Assistant Chief Constable Nigel Yeo said the boys had asked for the meeting as they wanted to understand the investigation better. He said: \"It helps my officers to understand it is a family tragedy, a living tragedy.\" As the search entered its second week and police continued to insist Operation Maple remained a \"missing persons investigation\", the Payne family refused to give up hope of their \"little princess\" being found. A Sussex police spokesman, David Edwards, said: \"There is a distinct lack of developments here. We are still getting a good response from the public but we are just missing that vital bit of information that will help us find Sarah. There may well be a nugget of information on one of the thousands of calls we are getting.\" Mrs Payne, 31, praised officers and said the family was overwhelmed by the size of the operation: \"You're doing everything we would do, that's the best compliment I can give you.\" She later added: \"We've got every confidence that it is just a matter of time. There's somebody out there, please just pick up the phone.\" Sarah's grandfather, Terry Payne, made a similar appeal at a press conference on Saturday. He said: \"It's tearing our family apart. Somebody's got Sarah and we want her back.\" As cards and letters of hope flooded in from around the world, villagers gathered at the church in East Preston to pray for the Payne family and the safe return of their missing child. Meanwhile police were deluged by calls after a reconstruction of the crime on Friday and road checks over the weekend. DNA test results were also arriving on a daily basis. Police confirmed there had been more than 4,500 calls, including leads on two new witnesses, and more than 600 separate tasks had been given to officers. New posters and leaflets about Sarah's case were distributed to revellers at the Littlehampton carnival on Saturday and police reiterated an appeal for help in tracing the drivers of a white van and a grey Ford Mondeo car, both seen close to where the youngster went missing. A family photo taken by Sarah's brother, Luke, showing Sarah and her sister Charlotte hugging, was also released. Mrs Payne was expected to return to Littlehampton police station today for a news conference at which she plans to read from the thousands of letters of support.",

      "body": "<p>A walk-on part in the Beatles' rise to fame brought \"Lord Woodbine\", who has died in a house fire aged 72, to a wider public than his talents might ordinarily have warranted. There were fleeting mentions of him in biographies of the group, and, in 1995, Paul McCartney spoke of him with affection in the Anthology television series. The previous year, Woodbine had been represented in Backbeat, a biopic of the Beatles' Hamburg period, by actor Charlie Caine, resplendent in sharkskin suit and snap-brim hat.</p> <p>As plain Harold Phillips, he arrived in Liverpool from Trinidad in 1948. Ennobling himself as \"Lord Woodbine\" - after the cheap cigarettes he chain-smoked - he quickly established himself as one of the city's characters. As a builder and decorator, and a calypso singer and barman in Toxteth's rougher shebeens (where he defused unrest by brandishing a cutlass), he formed the All-Steel Caribbean Band, who were resident in his own New Colony Club. He also booked the Beatles, then a scruffy bunch who often turned up with only half their equipment or a member short.</p> <p>The All-Steel band also played evening sessions in the basement of the Jaca-randa, a coffee-bar venture run by Allan Williams. After Woodbine left, it remained there, as the Royal Caribbean Steel Band, until 1960, when they were noticed by a German sailor and poached by a Hamburg club agent.</p> <p>The band reported the recreational delights of their new-found home to Woodbine back in Liverpool. Sniffing a business opportunity, he and Williams decamped to the Reeperbahn, where they were soon negotiating with local promoters to bring over more accomplished Liverpool groups. This new enterprise began with a season by Derry Wilkie and the Seniors at Bruno Koschmider's Kaiserkeller.</p> <p>Back on Merseyside, the Beatles were, twice nightly, accompanying a Mancunian stripper at Williams's and Woodbine's New Cabaret Artists Club. Because they had so gamely gone through this tasteless assignment, their employers were convinced that the group was no longer, as George Harrison would say, \"hopefully messing about.\"</p> <p>When Koschmider requested a group for another of his Hamberg clubs, Woodbine drove the then five Beatles - drummer Pete Best, bass player Stuart Sutcliffe and guitarists Harrison, McCartney and John Lennon - to Germany in an overloaded minibus. Conditions were dire; the musicians' accommodation was in pokey rooms adjoining a cinema toilet, and, initially, there was an onstage mutiny by the band. But the necessity of keeping up the equivalent of an all-night party atmosphere for their audience began the transformation of the Beatles from clumsy provincials to a peerless live act and a potential chart proposition.</p> <p>Woodbine, however, was all but lost to the archives of oblivion, though his daughter, Barbara, was to surface as a playwright whose work includes episodes for Brookside. Well placed to grow fat on Beatlemania, her father instead chose to continue living on his wits around Toxteth. He never guested at any of the Beatles conventions, and, unlike others less qualified, resisted the chance to cash in on the group's fame.</p> <p>His wife, Helen, died with him in the fire.</p> <p>\u0095 Harold Phillips, 'Lord Woodbine', entrepreneur, born 1928; died July 5 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "A walk-on part in the Beatles' rise to fame brought \"Lord Woodbine\", who has died in a house fire aged 72, to a wider public than his talents might ordinarily have warranted. There were fleeting mentions of him in biographies of the group, and, in 1995, Paul McCartney spoke of him with affection in the Anthology television series. The previous year, Woodbine had been represented in Backbeat, a biopic of the Beatles' Hamburg period, by actor Charlie Caine, resplendent in sharkskin suit and snap-brim hat. As plain Harold Phillips, he arrived in Liverpool from Trinidad in 1948. Ennobling himself as \"Lord Woodbine\" - after the cheap cigarettes he chain-smoked - he quickly established himself as one of the city's characters. As a builder and decorator, and a calypso singer and barman in Toxteth's rougher shebeens (where he defused unrest by brandishing a cutlass), he formed the All-Steel Caribbean Band, who were resident in his own New Colony Club. He also booked the Beatles, then a scruffy bunch who often turned up with only half their equipment or a member short. The All-Steel band also played evening sessions in the basement of the Jaca-randa, a coffee-bar venture run by Allan Williams. After Woodbine left, it remained there, as the Royal Caribbean Steel Band, until 1960, when they were noticed by a German sailor and poached by a Hamburg club agent. The band reported the recreational delights of their new-found home to Woodbine back in Liverpool. Sniffing a business opportunity, he and Williams decamped to the Reeperbahn, where they were soon negotiating with local promoters to bring over more accomplished Liverpool groups. This new enterprise began with a season by Derry Wilkie and the Seniors at Bruno Koschmider's Kaiserkeller. Back on Merseyside, the Beatles were, twice nightly, accompanying a Mancunian stripper at Williams's and Woodbine's New Cabaret Artists Club. Because they had so gamely gone through this tasteless assignment, their employers were convinced that the group was no longer, as George Harrison would say, \"hopefully messing about.\" When Koschmider requested a group for another of his Hamberg clubs, Woodbine drove the then five Beatles - drummer Pete Best, bass player Stuart Sutcliffe and guitarists Harrison, McCartney and John Lennon - to Germany in an overloaded minibus. Conditions were dire; the musicians' accommodation was in pokey rooms adjoining a cinema toilet, and, initially, there was an onstage mutiny by the band. But the necessity of keeping up the equivalent of an all-night party atmosphere for their audience began the transformation of the Beatles from clumsy provincials to a peerless live act and a potential chart proposition. Woodbine, however, was all but lost to the archives of oblivion, though his daughter, Barbara, was to surface as a playwright whose work includes episodes for Brookside. Well placed to grow fat on Beatlemania, her father instead chose to continue living on his wits around Toxteth. He never guested at any of the Beatles conventions, and, unlike others less qualified, resisted the chance to cash in on the group's fame. His wife, Helen, died with him in the fire. \u0095 Harold Phillips, 'Lord Woodbine', entrepreneur, born 1928; died July 5 2000",

In later years, Coppock's involvement led to the first GIS master's degree programme in the world, at Edinburgh university, and he became founding editor of the first journal in the field, the international Journal Of Geographical Information Science.</p> <p>Known as \"Terry\" to everyone who knew him, Coppock was born and went to school in Penarth, south Wales. He became a civil servant in the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Ministry of Works and the Customs and Excise. Commissioned in 1941 in the Welsh Regiment, he counted himself immensely fortunate to go to Queens' College, Cambridge in 1947, at the age of 26. This opened his eyes to the challenge and excitement of scholarship and he pursued his new vocation as a junior member of staff at University College, London, in 1950. Soon after the production of the agricultural atlas, he was made Ogilvie professor of geography at the University of Edinburgh, where he remained from 1965 to 1986.</p> <p>His life's work was essentially concerned with man's use and abuse of the landscape. In all his academic work, he demonstrated an impressive ability to operate either at the micro scale, delving into great detail, or at the broad synoptic scale. Much of the latter stemmed from his recognition, during the 1960s, of the increasing potential conflict between maintaining a viable agricultural economy and providing space for rural recreation to meet the demands of the fast-growing numbers of car-owning families. His foundation of the tourism and recreation research unit at Edinburgh produced important research results and trained many staff who have gone on to illustrious careers.</p> <p>Coppock was always clear that there was much to be learned and discussed with fellow geographers around the world, a belief that occasionally led to difficulties. One of his colleagues was once asked to confirm whether he had held a tutorial at Edinburgh airport between two flights. In fact, the answer was in the negative; the tutorial took place at Edinburgh Waverley station.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his pragmatic, yet research-based, approach, and his understanding of government, Coppock served on many official inquiries, including being special adviser to the select committee on Scottish affairs, a member of the Ordnance Survey review committee and the Sports Council. He also represented the British Academy and Royal Society. When he retired in 1986, he became secretary and treasurer of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland.</p> <p>Coppock received many honours for his distinguished service, notably the CBE in 1987. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow universities awarded him honorary doctorates in 1999. He was one of the first geographers elected as a fellow of the British Academy.</p> <p>My memories of him are as much about comradeship as business. He was a man wholly without malice and deviousness, someone who helped many others to fulfil their potential. In his chosen area he made major contributions to scholarship, policy and practice at national and international level. He was also good company - my abiding memory of him remains, as a septuagenarian, joyously flying kites with my two young daughters.</p> <p>Coppock's wife, Sheila Mary Burnett, died in 1990. He is survived by a son and a daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 John Terence 'Terry' Coppock, geographer, born June 2 1921; died June 28 2000</p>",

He became a civil servant in the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Ministry of Works and the Customs and Excise. Commissioned in 1941 in the Welsh Regiment, he counted himself immensely fortunate to go to Queens' College, Cambridge in 1947, at the age of 26. This opened his eyes to the challenge and excitement of scholarship and he pursued his new vocation as a junior member of staff at University College, London, in 1950. Soon after the production of the agricultural atlas, he was made Ogilvie professor of geography at the University of Edinburgh, where he remained from 1965 to 1986. His life's work was essentially concerned with man's use and abuse of the landscape. In all his academic work, he demonstrated an impressive ability to operate either at the micro scale, delving into great detail, or at the broad synoptic scale. Much of the latter stemmed from his recognition, during the 1960s, of the increasing potential conflict between maintaining a viable agricultural economy and providing space for rural recreation to meet the demands of the fast-growing numbers of car-owning families. His foundation of the tourism and recreation research unit at Edinburgh produced important research results and trained many staff who have gone on to illustrious careers. Coppock was always clear that there was much to be learned and discussed with fellow geographers around the world, a belief that occasionally led to difficulties. One of his colleagues was once asked to confirm whether he had held a tutorial at Edinburgh airport between two flights. In fact, the answer was in the negative; the tutorial took place at Edinburgh Waverley station. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his pragmatic, yet research-based, approach, and his understanding of government, Coppock served on many official inquiries, including being special adviser to the select committee on Scottish affairs, a member of the Ordnance Survey review committee and the Sports Council. He also represented the British Academy and Royal Society. When he retired in 1986, he became secretary and treasurer of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland. Coppock received many honours for his distinguished service, notably the CBE in 1987. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow universities awarded him honorary doctorates in 1999. He was one of the first geographers elected as a fellow of the British Academy. My memories of him are as much about comradeship as business. He was a man wholly without malice and deviousness, someone who helped many others to fulfil their potential. In his chosen area he made major contributions to scholarship, policy and practice at national and international level. He was also good company - my abiding memory of him remains, as a septuagenarian, joyously flying kites with my two young daughters. Coppock's wife, Sheila Mary Burnett, died in 1990. He is survived by a son and a daughter. \u0095 John Terence 'Terry' Coppock, geographer, born June 2 1921; died June 28 2000",

Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the military head of state, looked morose as he bowed to George Speight's demands to disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indian minority. Mr Speight acknowledged that Fiji would be shunned abroad, but was unrepentant. \"It is a path that has begun in a manner which to the world at large ... they do not condone or accept,\" Mr Speight said. \"I totally understand that.\" The military, which took control of Fiji 10 days after Mr Speight and six other gunmen stormed parliament, agreed to scrap the country's multiracial constitution, depose its first prime minister of ethnic Indian descent and grant Mr Speight and his men immunity from prosecution. Mr Speight said he would release his 27 hostages - including the deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry - and turn in his rebels' arms. The hostages will be freed on Thursday, before tribal chiefs meet to choose a new president and to name an interim government to guide Fiji to elections under a new constitution curtailing ethnic Indian political rights. Fiji will almost certainly be hit with sanctions from countries including the US as well as the European Union, which buys Fijian sugar, the country's cash crop, at inflated prices.

      "body": "<p>A new challenge to President Mohammed Khatami's government has emerged in the wake of demonstrations at the weekend in central Tehran, where thousands of Iran's poor joined university students in a bloody battle with Islamic extremists.</p> <p>The spontaneous coalition on Saturday night of students and ordinary Iranians demanding improved social conditions marked a turning point in the struggle to redefine the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>A year ago, it was primarily students who demanded more freedom and political reform, as they spilled their blood on the nation's campuses and city streets. Now, the cries for profound change are coming from mainstream society.</p> <p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, summoned President Khatami and senior government officials to his residence yesterday to discuss the crisis. State radio said the ayatollah blamed the demonstration on foreign \"enemies\" and called on the nation and the government to remain on high alert.</p> <p>President Khatami flies to Berlin today, where he is expected to face more protests from as many as 25,000 members of emigre groups who have been exiled from Iran.</p> <p>The visit will be the first to Germany by an Iranian leader since 1967 and, to stem the possibility of public unrest, one official said 6,000 dissidents had already been stopped from travelling to Berlin, where security will be even tighter than during President Clinton's visit last month.</p> <p>Even before Saturday's protest in Tehran, which left dozens seriously injured after Islamic vigilantes used clubs to beat back the protesters, sporadic demonstrations against electricity shortages and sub-standard drinking water had erupted in a number of Iranian cities, including in the oil centre, Abadan, near the Iraqi border.</p> <p>The demonstrations were planned to mark the first anniversary of pro-democracy rallies on July 8 last year, which sparked six days of the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p> <p>The leading student group, the Office to Consolidate Unity, had organised the rally to honour the hundreds of students injured when the police, aided by Islamic vigilantes, broke into dormitories at Tehran University and beat the residents, some as they slept.</p> <p>President Khatami and his allies had tried to head off public protest, predicting that the peaceful rallies could turn bloody. In a prophetic speech last week, Mr Khatami warned his conservative rivals that Iranians were dissatisfied and this discontent could no longer be contained by force.</p> <p>\"We must not expect the people to behave as we would like, and [threaten] to suppress them if they don't,\" he said.</p> <p>\"People must be allowed to speak freely and criticise their government. If people are left unsatisfied, this will one day lead to an explosion.\"</p> <p>The explosion on Saturday was directed not only at the hardline clerical establishment but also at President Khatami, who was criticised for failing to make profound changes to the system.</p> <p>\"The clerics live like kings, while the people are reduced to poverty,\" shouted the crowd. Other chants followed: \"Khatami, Khatami, show your power or resign,\" and \"Khatami, Khatami, this is the final notice\".</p> <p>The president's weakness was on public display, as hundreds of Islamic vigilantes from the Ansar-e Hizbullah and the basij, an Islamic militia, took over Revolution Square, where the demonstrators had gathered. They beat the protesters with clubs and threatened them with lengths of electrical cable and wooden staves, weapons delivered to the scene in state-owned vehicles, including ambulances.</p> <p>Once again, it was evident that President Khatami's policy of \"rule of law\" had taken a back seat to the hardliners' brute force. The president does not control the armed forces; that power lies with Ayatollah Khamenei, who is closely aligned with the conservatives.</p> <p>Masoud Dehnamaki, a leader in the Ansar-e Hizbullah, said last week that the extremists have not even begun to confront the reformist movement, despite numerous violent acts for which they have claimed responsibility.</p> <p>\"The leader of the Islamic revolution has invited all to respect the bounds of morality,\" he said, justifying the extremists' activities.</p>",

The spontaneous coalition on Saturday night of students and ordinary Iranians demanding improved social conditions marked a turning point in the struggle to redefine the Islamic Republic. A year ago, it was primarily students who demanded more freedom and political reform, as they spilled their blood on the nation's campuses and city streets. Now, the cries for profound change are coming from mainstream society. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, summoned President Khatami and senior government officials to his residence yesterday to discuss the crisis. State radio said the ayatollah blamed the demonstration on foreign \"enemies\" and called on the nation and the government to remain on high alert. President Khatami flies to Berlin today, where he is expected to face more protests from as many as 25,000 members of emigre groups who have been exiled from Iran. The visit will be the first to Germany by an Iranian leader since 1967 and, to stem the possibility of public unrest, one official said 6,000 dissidents had already been stopped from travelling to Berlin, where security will be even tighter than during President Clinton's visit last month. Even before Saturday's protest in Tehran, which left dozens seriously injured after Islamic vigilantes used clubs to beat back the protesters, sporadic demonstrations against electricity shortages and sub-standard drinking water had erupted in a number of Iranian cities, including in the oil centre, Abadan, near the Iraqi border. The demonstrations were planned to mark the first anniversary of pro-democracy rallies on July 8 last year, which sparked six days of the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The leading student group, the Office to Consolidate Unity, had organised the rally to honour the hundreds of students injured when the police, aided by Islamic vigilantes, broke into dormitories at Tehran University and beat the residents, some as they slept. President Khatami and his allies had tried to head off public protest, predicting that the peaceful rallies could turn bloody. In a prophetic speech last week, Mr Khatami warned his conservative rivals that Iranians were dissatisfied and this discontent could no longer be contained by force. \"We must not expect the people to behave as we would like, and [threaten] to suppress them if they don't,\" he said. \"People must be allowed to speak freely and criticise their government. If people are left unsatisfied, this will one day lead to an explosion.\" The explosion on Saturday was directed not only at the hardline clerical establishment but also at President Khatami, who was criticised for failing to make profound changes to the system. \"The clerics live like kings, while the people are reduced to poverty,\" shouted the crowd. Other chants followed: \"Khatami, Khatami, show your power or resign,\" and \"Khatami, Khatami, this is the final notice\". The president's weakness was on public display, as hundreds of Islamic vigilantes from the Ansar-e Hizbullah and the basij, an Islamic militia, took over Revolution Square, where the demonstrators had gathered. They beat the protesters with clubs and threatened them with lengths of electrical cable and wooden staves, weapons delivered to the scene in state-owned vehicles, including ambulances. Once again, it was evident that President Khatami's policy of \"rule of law\" had taken a back seat to the hardliners' brute force. The president does not control the armed forces; that power lies with Ayatollah Khamenei, who is closely aligned with the conservatives. Masoud Dehnamaki, a leader in the Ansar-e Hizbullah, said last week that the extremists have not even begun to confront the reformist movement, despite numerous violent acts for which they have claimed responsibility. \"The leader of the Islamic revolution has invited all to respect the bounds of morality,\" he said, justifying the extremists' activities.",
