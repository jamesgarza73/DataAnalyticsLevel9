She had fallen madly in love with the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. She sent a torrent of letters, each signed off with 'big juicy hugs', to his secure ward in Broadmoor Hospital. Sutcliffe replied with equal enthusiasm, detailing what he would love to do if only he and Belinda could be alone together.</p> <p>Following the trial of London nail bomber David Copeland, another Broadmoor love story has emerged. The Old Bailey heard how Copeland fell in love with lonely secretary Patsy Scanlon who began writing to him shortly after his arrest. The letters continued for a year, slowly becoming more intimate. Copeland wrote that he dreamed about her wearing sexy clothing and could not wait for her to visit him in Broadmoor hospital. 'You're the only girl I write to so you have no need to be jealous.'</p> <p>Copeland and Sutcliffe were, in fact, writing to the same person - a burly nightclub bouncer known as Bernard O'Mahoney who has been described as the 'Judas of Fleet Street'. Since the late Eighties when he struck up a friendship with Ronnie Kray, O'Mahoney has written to people involved in high profile criminal cases - sometimes posing as a woman, sometimes not - in order to sell stories to tabloid newspapers.</p> <p>Copeland's replies filled two pages of yesterday's Mirror and earned O'Mahoney tens of thousands of pounds. They were also a key element in the bomber's court case as the prosecution used them as evidence of his state of mind.</p> <p>In the case of Sutcliffe, O'Mahoney was less fortunate. He sent a woman friend, posing as Belinda, to the Sunday People with copies of the letters and a demand for \u00a334,000. She broke down and confessed that the whole thing was a scam.</p> <p>Undeterred, O'Mahoney began writing letters, using the alias of Patrick, to Richard Blenkey who was awaiting trial for the murder of a seven-year-old boy. In the course of a year, Blenkey wrote back 36 times, eventually confessing to the murder.

      "bodyText": "Lovely Belinda Cannon, a curvy blonde with 'shining blue eyes', a 'perfect' wide smile and a bright, bubbly personality, couldn't help it. She had fallen madly in love with the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. She sent a torrent of letters, each signed off with 'big juicy hugs', to his secure ward in Broadmoor Hospital. Sutcliffe replied with equal enthusiasm, detailing what he would love to do if only he and Belinda could be alone together. Following the trial of London nail bomber David Copeland, another Broadmoor love story has emerged. The Old Bailey heard how Copeland fell in love with lonely secretary Patsy Scanlon who began writing to him shortly after his arrest. The letters continued for a year, slowly becoming more intimate. Copeland wrote that he dreamed about her wearing sexy clothing and could not wait for her to visit him in Broadmoor hospital. 'You're the only girl I write to so you have no need to be jealous.' Copeland and Sutcliffe were, in fact, writing to the same person - a burly nightclub bouncer known as Bernard O'Mahoney who has been described as the 'Judas of Fleet Street'. Since the late Eighties when he struck up a friendship with Ronnie Kray, O'Mahoney has written to people involved in high profile criminal cases - sometimes posing as a woman, sometimes not - in order to sell stories to tabloid newspapers. Copeland's replies filled two pages of yesterday's Mirror and earned O'Mahoney tens of thousands of pounds. They were also a key element in the bomber's court case as the prosecution used them as evidence of his state of mind. In the case of Sutcliffe, O'Mahoney was less fortunate. He sent a woman friend, posing as Belinda, to the Sunday People with copies of the letters and a demand for \u00a334,000. She broke down and confessed that the whole thing was a scam. Undeterred, O'Mahoney began writing letters, using the alias of Patrick, to Richard Blenkey who was awaiting trial for the murder of a seven-year-old boy. In the course of a year, Blenkey wrote back 36 times, eventually confessing to the murder. O'Mahoney took the letter straight to the News of the World where once more it proved to be a key element in the subsequent conviction. But O'Mahoney's trade is less concerned with guilt or innocence than with the amount of money he can make from a story. His biggest scoop came soon after the opening of the perfect tabloid murder trial. Michelle Taylor was said to have been consumed with jealousy when her boyfriend, John Shaughnessy, married a 21-year-old bank clerk named Alison.

The breakthrough by the company leading the trials, GW Pharmaceuticals, has been in finding varieties that would not make sufferers high - and so would not be attractive on the black market. Meanwhile, Hellawell will produce a revamped drugs strategy at the end of this month, focusing on disrupting traffic in hard drugs such as heroin or cocaine by cutting off supply lines to international drug barons. He has already established a secret intelligence unit based at the Cabinet Office, to trace the flow of money back from dealers and money launderers in Britain to suppliers abroad. It will also try to curb black market trading in so-called 'precursor chemicals' - ingredients produced legitimately by Western factories, but used by illicit drugs labs to process raw materials such as the coca leaf or opium into street drugs. gaby.hinsliff@observer.co.uk",

He worked hard, was always the last to leave the office and lived his life with a passion for news and for this paper.'</p> <p>In fact, Macklin was set to lose his cherished London job within two weeks. A reorganisation of the paper meant that the job of UK correspondent would no longer exist. He had chosen to remain in Britain and find a new job rather than return to Hong Kong.</p> <p>'We had told him two months ago and his job was due to end in mid-July,' said Keatley. 'He did not seem depressed about it at all. He was a very good writer and I don't think he would have had any difficulty finding another job.'</p> <p>With no note left behind and no evidence of previous depression, his family believe that Macklin's death was simply an the result of an accident, a theory which they trust will be borne out by the forthcoming inquest.</p> <p>Friends said that he often read papers and magazines with his feet dangling out of the window. Somehow or other, they think, he may have slipped.</p> <p>Others are less sure.</p>",

Despite the fact that the main door to his flat could only be opened by those inside the block 'buzzing' people, security-conscious Macklin locked his front door and attached the chain. Nothing more was heard until his body was found at 1am. Police first suspected he had committed suicide, although the Post's editor, Robert Keatley, said there was no evidence of depression in the star reporter. 'If anything, colleagues have said that he was happier, even more up, than he had been for some time. He even had a new girlfriend.' Colin Kerr, deputy editor of the Post at the time when Macklin joined the paper, was equally dismissive of the idea that Macklin had taken his own life: \"He was a dedicated journo in the old style. He worked hard, was always the last to leave the office and lived his life with a passion for news and for this paper.' In fact, Macklin was set to lose his cherished London job within two weeks. A reorganisation of the paper meant that the job of UK correspondent would no longer exist. He had chosen to remain in Britain and find a new job rather than return to Hong Kong. 'We had told him two months ago and his job was due to end in mid-July,' said Keatley. 'He did not seem depressed about it at all. He was a very good writer and I don't think he would have had any difficulty finding another job.' With no note left behind and no evidence of previous depression, his family believe that Macklin's death was simply an the result of an accident, a theory which they trust will be borne out by the forthcoming inquest. Friends said that he often read papers and magazines with his feet dangling out of the window. Somehow or other, they think, he may have slipped. Others are less sure.",

This time, he is on a hectic and relentless campaign trail (using commercial airlines) and set to bring in $5 million to pay for it.</p> <p>Of course Nader is not going to win the presidency, but that is not the issue.

The prospect that he will now have to do battle with Nader for the industrial blue collar vote is a terrifying one for Gore, who had to fight hard to win the AFL-CIO (America's TUC) nomination last autumn in his primary scuffle against Bill Bradley.</p> <p>Nader can be many things to many people - and in an America that is increasingly fragmented this is his strength more than ever before.</p> <p>The mathematics of the Nader campaign are complex, but starkly alarming for Gore. So much so that workers on the Bush campaign tell The Observer that they are actively working behind Nader in some areas.</p> <p>One plan - with Nader unlikely to make the 15 per cent needed to star in the final television debates - is to force Gore into a four-candidate TV debate comprising Nader and right-winger Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party, knowing that the brilliance of Nader's debating would be targeted at Gore, and disastrous to him.</p> <p>Nader's strong showing in California, the Democrats' Convention state this year, is the main concern.</p> <p>Another worry is Oregon, where Nader is picking up 8 per cent - thereby giving him the chance of converting the entire Pacific coastline from part of the safe Democratic base into a fierce battlefield.</p> <p>In the Midwest, Nader will also upset the cart. In Minnesota, where his activists are targeting supporters of the maverick governor Jesse 'The Body' Ventura, no Republican candidate has won the presidential votes since 1982. Bush and Gore are now neck-and-neck, with Nader cruising at a balance-holding 7 per cent.</p> <p>The percentages do not, however, tell the whole story. In measuring the floating voter, pollsters also count the 'favourable' and 'unfavourable' figures for each candidate.</p> <p>In Ohio, for instance, 43 per cent have a favourable view of Nader, while only 19 per cent have an unfavourable one. Gore, who needs to win there, is favoured by 42 per cent, but has an 'unfavoured' rating of 45 per cent.</p> <p>Nader is liked, admired and popular even among those who may not vote for him.</p> <p>The politics of the candidacy are more mercurial than the maths. They have certainly changed.</p> <p>Mop-headed but smartly dressed, Nader arrived with his gawkish walk at a bean feast of hi-tech and new-tech dotcommery in New York recently - the place in which he would seem entirely out of place.</p> <p>But no, as his audience of adoring geeks made clear. In his long career as troublesome priest to corporate America, none of his campaigns bore such dramatic fruit as that against the Microsoft monopoly. It was not the US Department of Justice who began the siege laid against Bill Gates, it was Nader who insisted that the government sanction Gates.</p> <p>His most celebrated previous success was against the car industry - when he led a tireless consumer campaign against scant attention to the safety of cars, markedly at General Motors in Flint and Detroit - with startling results, including the recalling of tens of thousands of cars and a tightening of safety specifications.</p> <p>Taking a break to talk to The Observer - from working the conference floor urging computer users to boycott Microsoft - Nader explained that his political objectives are not about the environment, but about corporate power, universal medical care, income inequality, and campaign finance reform.</p> <p>Nader had never been a revolutionary against, rather a watchdog on, the capitalist system.</p> <p>In the Sixties, while the radicals wanted to tear the system down, Nader was one of the Junior Chamber of Commerce's outstanding young men of 1966, lobbying Congress to pass the Wholesale Meat Act and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act.</p> <p>His hallmarks were environmental pollution, health and safety at work and product safety.</p> <p>Now he is more radical. The core of the new pitch is not to regard corporate power as something to be checked and balanced, but as a 'monster' which is going to take over our political government in Washington'.</p> <p>'More and more corporations are raising our kids,' he says; 'companies are marketing to children from the age of two. What's wrong with a society that allows its most precious resource to be exploited?</p> <p>'If there was a child molester in the neighbourhood, would it be enough to tell parents to lock the doors?'</p> <p>On corporate power, he says, the only difference between Gore and Bush is 'the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when the corporations come knocking on the door... Both parties are subordinating themselves to global corporations which are without any allegiance to this country'. Gore, he says, is 'a coward'. The goal is to 'build a new progressive party that says to the Democratic party, if you don't shape up, you're going to ship out'.</p> <p>Nader's strategy is, as he says, to 'bring thousands of people into the progressive political community' that already exists around him - 'that's a win,' says Nader, and a popular viewpoint too.</p>",

The prospect that he will now have to do battle with Nader for the industrial blue collar vote is a terrifying one for Gore, who had to fight hard to win the AFL-CIO (America's TUC) nomination last autumn in his primary scuffle against Bill Bradley. Nader can be many things to many people - and in an America that is increasingly fragmented this is his strength more than ever before. The mathematics of the Nader campaign are complex, but starkly alarming for Gore. So much so that workers on the Bush campaign tell The Observer that they are actively working behind Nader in some areas. One plan - with Nader unlikely to make the 15 per cent needed to star in the final television debates - is to force Gore into a four-candidate TV debate comprising Nader and right-winger Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party, knowing that the brilliance of Nader's debating would be targeted at Gore, and disastrous to him. Nader's strong showing in California, the Democrats' Convention state this year, is the main concern. Another worry is Oregon, where Nader is picking up 8 per cent - thereby giving him the chance of converting the entire Pacific coastline from part of the safe Democratic base into a fierce battlefield. In the Midwest, Nader will also upset the cart. In Minnesota, where his activists are targeting supporters of the maverick governor Jesse 'The Body' Ventura, no Republican candidate has won the presidential votes since 1982. Bush and Gore are now neck-and-neck, with Nader cruising at a balance-holding 7 per cent. The percentages do not, however, tell the whole story. In measuring the floating voter, pollsters also count the 'favourable' and 'unfavourable' figures for each candidate. In Ohio, for instance, 43 per cent have a favourable view of Nader, while only 19 per cent have an unfavourable one. Gore, who needs to win there, is favoured by 42 per cent, but has an 'unfavoured' rating of 45 per cent. Nader is liked, admired and popular even among those who may not vote for him. The politics of the candidacy are more mercurial than the maths. They have certainly changed. Mop-headed but smartly dressed, Nader arrived with his gawkish walk at a bean feast of hi-tech and new-tech dotcommery in New York recently - the place in which he would seem entirely out of place. But no, as his audience of adoring geeks made clear. In his long career as troublesome priest to corporate America, none of his campaigns bore such dramatic fruit as that against the Microsoft monopoly. It was not the US Department of Justice who began the siege laid against Bill Gates, it was Nader who insisted that the government sanction Gates. His most celebrated previous success was against the car industry - when he led a tireless consumer campaign against scant attention to the safety of cars, markedly at General Motors in Flint and Detroit - with startling results, including the recalling of tens of thousands of cars and a tightening of safety specifications. Taking a break to talk to The Observer - from working the conference floor urging computer users to boycott Microsoft - Nader explained that his political objectives are not about the environment, but about corporate power, universal medical care, income inequality, and campaign finance reform. Nader had never been a revolutionary against, rather a watchdog on, the capitalist system. In the Sixties, while the radicals wanted to tear the system down, Nader was one of the Junior Chamber of Commerce's outstanding young men of 1966, lobbying Congress to pass the Wholesale Meat Act and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. His hallmarks were environmental pollution, health and safety at work and product safety. Now he is more radical. The core of the new pitch is not to regard corporate power as something to be checked and balanced, but as a 'monster' which is going to take over our political government in Washington'. 'More and more corporations are raising our kids,' he says; 'companies are marketing to children from the age of two. What's wrong with a society that allows its most precious resource to be exploited? 'If there was a child molester in the neighbourhood, would it be enough to tell parents to lock the doors?' On corporate power, he says, the only difference between Gore and Bush is 'the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when the corporations come knocking on the door... Both parties are subordinating themselves to global corporations which are without any allegiance to this country'. Gore, he says, is 'a coward'. The goal is to 'build a new progressive party that says to the Democratic party, if you don't shape up, you're going to ship out'. Nader's strategy is, as he says, to 'bring thousands of people into the progressive political community' that already exists around him - 'that's a win,' says Nader, and a popular viewpoint too.",

The rise in crime has almost certainly nothing to do with lenient sentencing. The 'prison works' doctrine adopted by Michael 'Something of the Night' Howard and then continued by Jack 'Something of the Right' Straw has encouraged judges to mete out longer stretches for crimes of violence. Crime is mainly going up because of a rise in the number of those most likely to commit it - young men between the ages of 14 and 25.</p> <p>What the best research has always shown is that it is not ever-longer sentences that most deters criminals, but the prospect of getting nicked.

Every over-crowded jail, apart from being a powder keg waiting to blow up under the Home Secretary, is a prison where there is less prospect of civilising its inmates. Every new prison leaves less money available for more police officers.</p> <p>The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, both intelligent and decent men, know this.

This is not just a bad way of governing, it's a lousy form of politics. How on earth does it assist the popularity of the Government to feed the fear that Britain is plunging into a dark age of lawlessness?</p> <p>I thought they might have learnt a lesson from inflaming the scare that Britain was being swamped with asylum-seekers. Whenever New Labour lurches to the right, the Conservatives will lunge even further. This an auction they can never win. Anything that Tough Tony and Hard Jack do, Vigilante Hague and Leg-Irons Widdecombe can do even worse.</p>",

Between them, they sound as if they will not be happy until half the country is in jail and the remainder of the population is employed as warders. Messrs Blair and Straw, being lawyers by training, should know a bit about evidence. The rise in crime has almost certainly nothing to do with lenient sentencing. The 'prison works' doctrine adopted by Michael 'Something of the Night' Howard and then continued by Jack 'Something of the Right' Straw has encouraged judges to mete out longer stretches for crimes of violence. Crime is mainly going up because of a rise in the number of those most likely to commit it - young men between the ages of 14 and 25. What the best research has always shown is that it is not ever-longer sentences that most deters criminals, but the prospect of getting nicked. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have surely also seen all the evidence that says the best way to prevent re-offending is not the length of sentencing but the use of prison for educating and rehabilitating criminals. Every over-crowded jail, apart from being a powder keg waiting to blow up under the Home Secretary, is a prison where there is less prospect of civilising its inmates. Every new prison leaves less money available for more police officers. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, both intelligent and decent men, know this. On the quiet, when they think the right-wing tabloids aren't watching, the Government has even been doing some sensible things. But they have become imprisoned by inane get-toughery and self-defeating crackdownism. I doubt it has any effect on young thugs. What it surely does do is wind up public terror about crime. This is not just a bad way of governing, it's a lousy form of politics. How on earth does it assist the popularity of the Government to feed the fear that Britain is plunging into a dark age of lawlessness? I thought they might have learnt a lesson from inflaming the scare that Britain was being swamped with asylum-seekers. Whenever New Labour lurches to the right, the Conservatives will lunge even further. This an auction they can never win. Anything that Tough Tony and Hard Jack do, Vigilante Hague and Leg-Irons Widdecombe can do even worse.",

It could be thug children from peripheral estates who smashed your car open. It could be militant white supremacists or people with black skins. It doesn't matter - just any group you can't stand. And the question is: suppose you could blink right now and obliterate them forever, wipe them off the human chart from July 2000 onwards, would you blink? </p> <p>Now let us move on. The world changed last month. It was a curious triumph, because scientists in rival teams have only mapped 97 per cent of the human genome, fully sequenced some 85 per cent of it and finished less than a fifth. But because of a deal between the Human Genome Project, funded by taxpayers in the United States and Britain, and the buccaneer Craig Venter, hoping to sequence the human genome with private money and patent some of the results, the great event was declared to have happened. </p> <p>Why quibble? The public scientists and their political masters, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, were not upstaged by Mr Venter, who is widely expected to win part of a Nobel Prize; the analysis of the genome will be over soon enough. </p> <p>What everyone agreed was that this cracking of the human code was Big. It was bigger than the invention of the wheel. (And the wheel, you may recall, was Big. At the time, it was pretty much the biggest thing going.) This, though, was the recipe for all of us. Clinton called it 'the most wondrous map ever produced by mankind'. Even the cool heads at New Scientist concluded that: 'Monday, 26 June, will be remembered as the day when humankind learned, in a sense, what it is to be human.' </p> <p>It is certainly a moment to take stock. The genome achievement can be compared with other, infinitely slower advances, such as books, several thousand years old, and electric-driven computers, several decades old, without which the reading of the code could not have happened. Now we have the massive information stack of the genome, the secrets of our hundred trillion cells turned inside out, it's interesting that we react by making these older achievements into metaphors; so the genome is the 'book' of human life, the 'computer programme' for humanity. </p> <p>A book is the best of the metaphors. In his book, Genome, science writer Matt Ridley argues that it is more than a metaphor, it's literally true: 'A book is a piece of digital information, written in linear, one-dimensional and one-directional form and defined by a code that transliterates a small alphabet of signs into a large lexicon of meanings through the order of their groupings. So is a genome.' This one, he says, has 23 chapters, called chromosomes, each of them containing several thousand stories, called genes, and so on. </p> <p>But, ingenious and passionate though this is, common sense insists that 'book', like recipe or computer programme, is a metaphor. A book has an outside intelligence as reader, whereas the genome is read, or has been, only by itself, endlessly reproducing, making tiny alterations. If it's a book, it is a auto-book, the ultimate, solipsistic autobiography. If it's a recipe, please imagine the cook. What strange being, with this coded information to hand, in which steaming environmental kitchen, could produce a human as we know we are humans? Come on. </p> <p>Nor does it follow that this is a time when humankind has learned, in any sense, what it is to be human. We have spent millennia developing that, through ethics, art, philosophy, religion, music, politics and none of that is cancelled by the reading out of the mind-dazingly huge and complex sequence of our chemical bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine, combined a billion times). </p> <p>To be human is to be the inheritor and transmitter of a biological, political, cultural and literary fate of endless beauty, danger and subtlety. To say that reading the genome changes one's view of this is as if I turned to my five-year-old daughter, congratulated her on her recent grasp of the alphabet and asked her to explain some puzzles in the emotional register of Shakespeare's late romances. In fact, it's worse than that. Since the sequencing is far from over, it would be like asking her the question while she was still confused about the shapes of b, q, u and p. </p> <p>What has changed is not the alphabet, or a confusing new 'book'. It is the arrival of the manipulator-reader, us, the constant explorer now in new territory, navigating deep inside our own system. Exactly, say the critics; it is like the arrival of the Spanish in America, bringing their lust for gold, their diseases and their crude firepower. Watch out, diversity. Beware, people with genetic abnor malities. And the rest of us, prepare for the disastrous victories of the law of unintended consequences. </p> <p>I think the political story of humanity offers more scope for optimism. The racist and totalitarian ideas driven out with such violence in the last century, and the greater squeamishness that has come with a more informed, educated and democratic culture, suggest that we may be able to cope with this increase in understanding and dexterity without disaster. We may, instead, be on the edge of a new and greener economy, in which wealth is created by extraordinary nimbleness in life sciences and less by moving lumps of metal around on the Earth's surface, burning carbon and exploiting crude Newtonian laws. The age of physics gives way to the age of biochemistry. </p> <p>The first practical change all this brings will be uncontentious - the shrewdly-directed cancer treatments, the pills to cut obesity, the better identification of risks to our individual health and survival. As with earlier advances in health care, there will be second-order controversies - it will help the rich first and draw out lucky lives even longer. Overall, though, people are no likelier to protest against the arrival of genomics in medicine than at the advent of penicillin or open-heart surgery. </p> <p>What, though, of the prospect of the wiping out of socially unpopular or genetically different groups and the creation of 'designer people', more handsome, intelligent and social than most of us today? That's the really scary stuff, isn't it? </p> <p>Up to a point. Designer, or designed, people are here already. When an abnormally intelligent and well-favoured woman seeks and mates with a clever, hunky male to produce offensively attractive and sharp children, what are they making but designer babies? The basic principles of selection have been applied to people as well as to apple trees since time immemorial. But it will prob ably go further if already rich people can buy expensive genetic treatments to cut out the chance of a son who, sadly, turns out to look exactly like Great-Uncle Jeff, the family warthog, alcoholic and train-spotter. </p> <p>Let them try. It will be far harder than they think, thanks to the huge complexity of genetic outcomes, never mind the massive laws of chance that have resulted in every one of us having the fantastic, surreal luck to be alive, and not a dried sperm or wasted egg, or, indeed, a nematode worm or the banana, with whom we share so much genetic material. If selective breeding really worked, we would presumably have already produced a superclass of wise and enlightened rulers. As it is, the cream of the cream have given us the contents of the Dome and the banalities of the current US presidential race. Far from the 'purified' races dreamed of by politicians in the early twentieth century (and not just Hitler; Churchill and most socialist thinkers were keen eugenicists, too), humanity is mingling more than ever. </p> <p>The panic of Edwardian England and Twenties America or Sweden about the 'feeble minded' and miscegenation seems as outdated as spats or Gothic architecture. Look around today and you see that purity is out. We have discovered, to use Louis MacNeice's words, that 'World is crazier and more of it than we think,/ Incorrigibly plural.' </p> <p>Or have we simply become sneakier about our language? In non-Catholic countries, the destruction of Down's syndrome embryos and therefore of large numbers of lives of people who would have been happy - indeed abnormally happy - has been going on for decades. The difference, however, is that this change comes from individuals, not politicians. We may admire the parents and carers of people with genetic abnormalities but, given the chance, most choose not be those parents. The idea of a state-sponsored drive against the fertility of any group has, by contrast, become unthinkable. </p> <p>Our strongest defence against the misuse of these discoveries is simply our democratic culture. We have learned the hard way to mistrust the state, the great misuser of science in the century just past (Chernobyl, forcible sterilisation, anthrax bombs) and we are learning to use boycotts and protests to rebuke private companies today when they push new technologies too hard and too fast. The hard questions thrown up by the genome breakthrough are not scientific ones at all. They are old-fashioned ethical and democratic ones. If you are scared by all this, then you are scared of yourself. </p> <p>I end with the opening question: could you, the reader, imagine wiping out any group, however irritating or offensive? Would you, if you could? Could you imagine any government advocating such a thing and getting away with it? </p> <p>My guess is that the new genetics will bring wonderful medicines and very small shifts in the human stock, not the new eugenics or any of the nightmares based on crude and discredited thinking from a century ago. If, on the other hand, you began this piece with a spasm of furious blinking, then I am entirely wrong and the uncovering of the human genome has been a disaster.</p>",

      "body": "<p>People can't choose how they go down in history. Most of us know nothing about King Alfred except that he burnt some cakes. How will Tony Blair be remembered? Possibly as the Prime Minister who made malicious gossip an everyday tool of modern British government.</p> <p>I'm talking about 'briefing', the practice of vilifying your colleagues in off-the-record conversations with journalists. It's the media equivalent of the poison-pen letter - an anonymous attack by someone who is scared of honest confrontation.</p> <p>Tony Blair did not invent it, of course. The technique was used by Margaret Thatcher's press officer, Bernard Ingham, and at about the same time was eagerly adopted by Peter Mandelson, then Labour's head of communications.</p> <p>On a recent Channel 4 programme about the rubbishing of Mo Mowlam, there was a revealing interview with Roy Hattersley. With the bemused indignation of an elderly vicar who has accidentally tuned in to a sex film on Channel 5, he told how he had been 'briefed' while writing a profile of a Minister. (He did not name the man, but it must have been David Clark.) A Downing Street press officer had told him, off the record, that David - appointed, of course by the Prime Minister - was no good.</p> <p>It happens every week. Last Sunday we were told that Downing Street was 'dumping on' Health Minister Tessa Jowell after an initiative on anorexia misfired. A recent Evening Standard piece told us that Chief Whip Ann Taylor was 'dispensable'.</p> <p>Downing Street staffers say this kind of treachery has always gone on, but it's not true. Before the Eighties, it would have been highly unusual for a Prime Minister, or his messengers, to calumniate members of his own government to the press. Everyone was shocked when Ingham said that John Biffen was 'semi-detached'.</p> <p>Neither John Major nor John Smith indulged in this shameful practice. Major's 'bastards' outburst expressed the fury of a decent man surrounded by traitors. Smith froze Mandelson out.</p> <p>Nor does it go on in other countries. Reading the Washington Post or the New York Times, you never see articles denigrating Clinton appointees on White House authority.</p> <p>The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have noticed how often it goes wrong. His attempt to blacken Mo's reputation backfired spectacularly. Her popularity has remained high while his plummeted. And so many senior Labour figures have been savaged by this technique that it is no wonder the public is becoming sceptical about the Government as a whole.</p> <p>But what really bothers me is the morality of it. Not to put too fine a point on it, the whole business stinks. If you are displeased with a colleague, you should look him or her in the eye and say so. That's the behaviour my parents' generation called 'manly'. It's what we expect from leaders.</p> <p>The people who do the briefing, who whisper the words of poison into the ears of journalists, are of no consequence. They are the rent boys of politics, and we shudder with disgust when they brush past us in the lobby. But what is truly disgusting is the desire for their services.</p> <p>The polite fiction that the Prime Minister's advisors are responsible is absurd. Control-freak Tony doesn't let Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson go around saying anything they like. They do what the boss tells them. Peter isn't the Prince of Darkness, though he may be Lady Macbeth.</p> <p>In the July edition of Saga magazine, Mo continues the pretence: 'Somebody is not happy with me - I don't think it's Tony Blair - but somebody wants to do me down.' She seems confident the Prime Minster won't be insulted by the implication that members of his Cabinet are stabbing one another in the back, assisted by people in his own press office, and he's too weak to put a stop to it. But of course Mo doesn't believe this, nor does anyone else.</p> <p>Does the Prime Minister actually say to his staff: 'Go out there and stick the knives into Mo Mowlam?' Or does he hide behind euphemisms, like Henry II saying: 'Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?' Does it matter? One way or another, he's responsible. He can't pos sibly be so stupid as not to know what is being done in his name.</p> <p>Corrections are issued occasionally, when a mistake has been made and the wrong person crucified. If Tony Blair does not repudiate what has been said, we can be confident that he is behind it. When we are told that Gordon Brown is psychologically unstable, Mo has failed to recover from her illness, Harriet Harman is thick, Jack Cunningham is lazy, or Neil Kinnock needs to have his ego boosted by being photographed with celebrities, we know the identity of the 'source' from whom the story comes. It's the Prime Minister.</p> <p>When this Government stumbles, it is usually over the rock of a moral question: Bernie Ecclestone, arms to Indonesia, Pinochet, Mike Tyson, Mandelson's mort gage. The latest example is the Regulation of Investigatory Practices (RIP) Bill, with its breathtaking insouciance toward civil liberties. (Home Office Minister Charles Clarke last week promised a rethink.)</p> <p>In private conversations, Tony says issues don't matter to the average voter, only to the tiny minority who read the Guardian and send money to Amnesty. He's half right. These are not bread-and-butter questions. But people expect a Prime Minister to give a moral lead.</p> <p>Tony's sure touch deserts him when he faces a decision that cannot be based on expediency. He tries to resolve the matter like a lawyer, checking what the rules say. He seems not to possess the inner core of strong convictions that would enable him to make a confident choice in a morally complex issue.</p> <p>The effect has been tragic. The Government came to power like a knight in shining armour. People really believed New Labour would rule in a different way. They wanted a change from the feebleness and sleaze of the last years of the Conservatives. And the Government's achievements have been real. The economy is healthy, the promised reform of our education system is proceeding at a cracking pace, the health service is slowly being forced to modernise, and in dozens of ways, from gun control to reform of Parliamentary hours, the country is being catapulted into the twenty-first century.</p> <p>But we have taken the road of expediency too often. Decisions such as the shockingly rapid return of Peter Mandelson to the Cabinet gave the impression that we are as soft on sleaze as was John Major, allowing the cynics in the pubs to repeat the shabby clich\u00e9 that politicians are all the same.</p> <p>High office is merciless in the way it reveals character. Slowly but relentlessly, Tony Blair's shortcomings are undermining him. The process has the tragic momentum of a Shakespeare play. One by one, the people with the strength to tell him when he is wrong are being dumped. A Minister was chatting recently about having warned the Prime Minister against foisting Alun Michael on the Welsh party: 'Tony didn't speak to me for a year,' he said. Meanwhile, advisors who play on Tony's weaknesses grown ever more powerful.</p> <p>But the process is not irreversible. Tony can stop briefing in an instant. He simply has to give the word.</p> <p>A good time to start might be the next reshuffle. The last was preceded, not so much by leaks, but by floods of vituperative briefings in which half the Cabinet were declared to be useless. This time, Tony should resist the temptation to prepare the way with mean-spirited gossip. He could announce that no 'Downing Street sources' or 'senior Cabinet members' will be commenting in advance. He could tell Alastair and Peter to keep their mouths shut, on pain of being sacked themselves. And he could energetically repudiate any reports that do appear.</p> <p>It would be a signal that he is turning over a new leaf. It would give him back the moral high ground that he commanded three years ago. And it might mark the point at which his popularity begins to rise again.

      "bodyText": "People can't choose how they go down in history. Most of us know nothing about King Alfred except that he burnt some cakes. How will Tony Blair be remembered? Possibly as the Prime Minister who made malicious gossip an everyday tool of modern British government. I'm talking about 'briefing', the practice of vilifying your colleagues in off-the-record conversations with journalists. It's the media equivalent of the poison-pen letter - an anonymous attack by someone who is scared of honest confrontation. Tony Blair did not invent it, of course. The technique was used by Margaret Thatcher's press officer, Bernard Ingham, and at about the same time was eagerly adopted by Peter Mandelson, then Labour's head of communications. On a recent Channel 4 programme about the rubbishing of Mo Mowlam, there was a revealing interview with Roy Hattersley. With the bemused indignation of an elderly vicar who has accidentally tuned in to a sex film on Channel 5, he told how he had been 'briefed' while writing a profile of a Minister. (He did not name the man, but it must have been David Clark.) A Downing Street press officer had told him, off the record, that David - appointed, of course by the Prime Minister - was no good. It happens every week. Last Sunday we were told that Downing Street was 'dumping on' Health Minister Tessa Jowell after an initiative on anorexia misfired. A recent Evening Standard piece told us that Chief Whip Ann Taylor was 'dispensable'. Downing Street staffers say this kind of treachery has always gone on, but it's not true. Before the Eighties, it would have been highly unusual for a Prime Minister, or his messengers, to calumniate members of his own government to the press. Everyone was shocked when Ingham said that John Biffen was 'semi-detached'. Neither John Major nor John Smith indulged in this shameful practice. Major's 'bastards' outburst expressed the fury of a decent man surrounded by traitors. Smith froze Mandelson out. Nor does it go on in other countries. Reading the Washington Post or the New York Times, you never see articles denigrating Clinton appointees on White House authority. The Prime Minister doesn't seem to have noticed how often it goes wrong. His attempt to blacken Mo's reputation backfired spectacularly. Her popularity has remained high while his plummeted. And so many senior Labour figures have been savaged by this technique that it is no wonder the public is becoming sceptical about the Government as a whole. But what really bothers me is the morality of it. Not to put too fine a point on it, the whole business stinks. If you are displeased with a colleague, you should look him or her in the eye and say so. That's the behaviour my parents' generation called 'manly'. It's what we expect from leaders. The people who do the briefing, who whisper the words of poison into the ears of journalists, are of no consequence. They are the rent boys of politics, and we shudder with disgust when they brush past us in the lobby. But what is truly disgusting is the desire for their services. The polite fiction that the Prime Minister's advisors are responsible is absurd. Control-freak Tony doesn't let Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson go around saying anything they like. They do what the boss tells them. Peter isn't the Prince of Darkness, though he may be Lady Macbeth. In the July edition of Saga magazine, Mo continues the pretence: 'Somebody is not happy with me - I don't think it's Tony Blair - but somebody wants to do me down.' She seems confident the Prime Minster won't be insulted by the implication that members of his Cabinet are stabbing one another in the back, assisted by people in his own press office, and he's too weak to put a stop to it. But of course Mo doesn't believe this, nor does anyone else. Does the Prime Minister actually say to his staff: 'Go out there and stick the knives into Mo Mowlam?' Or does he hide behind euphemisms, like Henry II saying: 'Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?' Does it matter? One way or another, he's responsible. He can't pos sibly be so stupid as not to know what is being done in his name. Corrections are issued occasionally, when a mistake has been made and the wrong person crucified. If Tony Blair does not repudiate what has been said, we can be confident that he is behind it. When we are told that Gordon Brown is psychologically unstable, Mo has failed to recover from her illness, Harriet Harman is thick, Jack Cunningham is lazy, or Neil Kinnock needs to have his ego boosted by being photographed with celebrities, we know the identity of the 'source' from whom the story comes. It's the Prime Minister. When this Government stumbles, it is usually over the rock of a moral question: Bernie Ecclestone, arms to Indonesia, Pinochet, Mike Tyson, Mandelson's mort gage. The latest example is the Regulation of Investigatory Practices (RIP) Bill, with its breathtaking insouciance toward civil liberties. (Home Office Minister Charles Clarke last week promised a rethink.) In private conversations, Tony says issues don't matter to the average voter, only to the tiny minority who read the Guardian and send money to Amnesty. He's half right. These are not bread-and-butter questions. But people expect a Prime Minister to give a moral lead. Tony's sure touch deserts him when he faces a decision that cannot be based on expediency. He tries to resolve the matter like a lawyer, checking what the rules say. He seems not to possess the inner core of strong convictions that would enable him to make a confident choice in a morally complex issue. The effect has been tragic. The Government came to power like a knight in shining armour. People really believed New Labour would rule in a different way. They wanted a change from the feebleness and sleaze of the last years of the Conservatives. And the Government's achievements have been real. The economy is healthy, the promised reform of our education system is proceeding at a cracking pace, the health service is slowly being forced to modernise, and in dozens of ways, from gun control to reform of Parliamentary hours, the country is being catapulted into the twenty-first century. But we have taken the road of expediency too often. Decisions such as the shockingly rapid return of Peter Mandelson to the Cabinet gave the impression that we are as soft on sleaze as was John Major, allowing the cynics in the pubs to repeat the shabby clich\u00e9 that politicians are all the same. High office is merciless in the way it reveals character. Slowly but relentlessly, Tony Blair's shortcomings are undermining him. The process has the tragic momentum of a Shakespeare play. One by one, the people with the strength to tell him when he is wrong are being dumped. A Minister was chatting recently about having warned the Prime Minister against foisting Alun Michael on the Welsh party: 'Tony didn't speak to me for a year,' he said. Meanwhile, advisors who play on Tony's weaknesses grown ever more powerful. But the process is not irreversible. Tony can stop briefing in an instant. He simply has to give the word. A good time to start might be the next reshuffle. The last was preceded, not so much by leaks, but by floods of vituperative briefings in which half the Cabinet were declared to be useless. This time, Tony should resist the temptation to prepare the way with mean-spirited gossip. He could announce that no 'Downing Street sources' or 'senior Cabinet members' will be commenting in advance. He could tell Alastair and Peter to keep their mouths shut, on pain of being sacked themselves. And he could energetically repudiate any reports that do appear. It would be a signal that he is turning over a new leaf. It would give him back the moral high ground that he commanded three years ago. And it might mark the point at which his popularity begins to rise again. With a general election expected in about a year, it won't be a moment too soon.",

      "body": "<p>Sometimes I think you could put a long blonde wig and a Wonderbra on a rolled up rug, spray it with perfume, dab on some lipstick, leave it by the side of the road and men would still gather around it, as if hypnotised, pointing, and intoning robotically: 'SEXY! SEXY!' This isn't your usual bolt of brunette jealousy, it's sheer bewilderment, and - yes, I have to admit it - a certain grudging respect, for the sheer persistence, the unflagging solidarity, of men regarding the issue of optimum female loveliness. </p> <p>Decades of feminism have passed, huge mountains of literature have built up devoted to the evils of objectification and, only this week, Marks &amp; Spencers announced that the average female form is a generous size 14. Elsewhere, big efforts are being made to convince young girls to accept that feminine beauty comes in all different shapes, hues and sizes. It's just a pity they don't make similar efforts convincing the guys. For, still, men seem absolutely determined to stick to their guns about this tall, slim blonde thing. You can try to talk them out of it until you're blue in the face, but in your heart of hearts, you know you might as well try to talk a ravenous monkey out of its next banana. </p> <p>Of course, men like other types of women, too, but after the zenith of 'the tall, slim blonde thing', it's as if all the colours on the palette of female beauty run together to form a small pool of semi-attractive everywoman 'She'll do' sludge. In this way, men are like proud Philistines in an art gallery: 'I don't know much about the diverse beauty of the female form, but I know what I like.' What women have to accept is that these guys are not just pretending to wind you up or to get you back for publicly drooling over the Portuguese football team, a lot of them actually do prefer tall, slim blondes. It's a painful thing to take on board - this 'meaning it' thing - but it's really the only way one could even begin to understand the phenomenon of Russian tennis babe, Anna Kournikova. The latest comely manifestation of that ageless blueprint of male desire - 'the tall, slim blonde thing'. </p> <p>I have nothing against tall, slim gorgeous blondes - my daughter is one. Unlike a lot of people, I've even got a few positive things to say about Ms Kournikova. She's fit, she has a modicum of talent (which is a modicum more than most British players), and she's given reporters something a bit more interesting to talk about than the high price of strawberries at Wimbledon. Kournikova's chief crime seems to be that, even more than Chris Evert and Gabriela Sabatini, she has succeeded in heterosexualising the sub-Sapphic ghetto of women's tennis. So much so, that when the 20-year-old first arrived at Wimbledon, linesmen were ordered not to stare at her legs. Presumably, they are permitted to ogle the posters plastered outside the grounds, depicting Kournikova smouldering in a Berlei sports bra that's about as sexy as a giant corn plaster. 'Only Balls Should Bounce', the poster's tag-line drones (Should have been: 'Hello Ball-Boys!'). Berlei paid Kournikova \u00a33m for this. She made \u00a37m in sponsorships last year. A 14th of that figure in actual winnings. </p> <p>Unless you're obsessed by tennis, it's difficult to see the downside of all this. Sure, it's unfair that the merely pretty are more highly rewarded than the supremely talented, but welcome to Planet Reality. One could even argue that a woman's beauty is her own business, and if she manages to turn it into a hugely lucrative cottage industry ( pace Liz Hurley) then all the better. In Kournikova's case, there is the added amusement factor that she's such an arrogant piece of work. While so many girls her age waste their best years grovelling for male validation, here's a Kournikova quote on guys: 'I'm like the most expensive exotic item on a gourmet menu. People can look then wonder about the taste and the sensuous delights of such a dish but when it comes down to it they simply can't afford such an expensive luxury.' Quick, fetch a doctor! This young woman is suffering from high self-esteem. </p> <p>Sadly, not many men seem to share Kournikova's 'gourmet' opinion of herself - of the ones I asked, at the most, they seemed to view her as an OK visual sex snack. The most common, rather Pavlovian response was: 'Oh her - blonde, yeah, nice.' To these men, Kournikova was just the latest tall, slim blonde to fall off the tall, slim blonde conveyor belt. Her gimmick, the thing that makes her seem taller, slimmer and blonder than the rest, the thing that makes her millions, is the fact she plays tennis. Without the tennis, it seems doubtful that Kournikova's prettiness, and scowly demeanour, would have got her very far in the modelling and acting worlds she professes to be interested in. That's why Kournikova should milk her situation all she can. In this unfair world, it's rather a good joke that an averagely talented blonde tennis player should make millions simply by reminding the world of a tacky Athena poster. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes I think you could put a long blonde wig and a Wonderbra on a rolled up rug, spray it with perfume, dab on some lipstick, leave it by the side of the road and men would still gather around it, as if hypnotised, pointing, and intoning robotically: 'SEXY! SEXY!' This isn't your usual bolt of brunette jealousy, it's sheer bewilderment, and - yes, I have to admit it - a certain grudging respect, for the sheer persistence, the unflagging solidarity, of men regarding the issue of optimum female loveliness. Decades of feminism have passed, huge mountains of literature have built up devoted to the evils of objectification and, only this week, Marks &amp; Spencers announced that the average female form is a generous size 14. Elsewhere, big efforts are being made to convince young girls to accept that feminine beauty comes in all different shapes, hues and sizes. It's just a pity they don't make similar efforts convincing the guys. For, still, men seem absolutely determined to stick to their guns about this tall, slim blonde thing. You can try to talk them out of it until you're blue in the face, but in your heart of hearts, you know you might as well try to talk a ravenous monkey out of its next banana. Of course, men like other types of women, too, but after the zenith of 'the tall, slim blonde thing', it's as if all the colours on the palette of female beauty run together to form a small pool of semi-attractive everywoman 'She'll do' sludge. In this way, men are like proud Philistines in an art gallery: 'I don't know much about the diverse beauty of the female form, but I know what I like.' What women have to accept is that these guys are not just pretending to wind you up or to get you back for publicly drooling over the Portuguese football team, a lot of them actually do prefer tall, slim blondes. It's a painful thing to take on board - this 'meaning it' thing - but it's really the only way one could even begin to understand the phenomenon of Russian tennis babe, Anna Kournikova. The latest comely manifestation of that ageless blueprint of male desire - 'the tall, slim blonde thing'. I have nothing against tall, slim gorgeous blondes - my daughter is one. Unlike a lot of people, I've even got a few positive things to say about Ms Kournikova. She's fit, she has a modicum of talent (which is a modicum more than most British players), and she's given reporters something a bit more interesting to talk about than the high price of strawberries at Wimbledon. Kournikova's chief crime seems to be that, even more than Chris Evert and Gabriela Sabatini, she has succeeded in heterosexualising the sub-Sapphic ghetto of women's tennis. So much so, that when the 20-year-old first arrived at Wimbledon, linesmen were ordered not to stare at her legs. Presumably, they are permitted to ogle the posters plastered outside the grounds, depicting Kournikova smouldering in a Berlei sports bra that's about as sexy as a giant corn plaster. 'Only Balls Should Bounce', the poster's tag-line drones (Should have been: 'Hello Ball-Boys!'). Berlei paid Kournikova \u00a33m for this. She made \u00a37m in sponsorships last year. A 14th of that figure in actual winnings. Unless you're obsessed by tennis, it's difficult to see the downside of all this. Sure, it's unfair that the merely pretty are more highly rewarded than the supremely talented, but welcome to Planet Reality. One could even argue that a woman's beauty is her own business, and if she manages to turn it into a hugely lucrative cottage industry ( pace Liz Hurley) then all the better. In Kournikova's case, there is the added amusement factor that she's such an arrogant piece of work. While so many girls her age waste their best years grovelling for male validation, here's a Kournikova quote on guys: 'I'm like the most expensive exotic item on a gourmet menu. People can look then wonder about the taste and the sensuous delights of such a dish but when it comes down to it they simply can't afford such an expensive luxury.' Quick, fetch a doctor! This young woman is suffering from high self-esteem. Sadly, not many men seem to share Kournikova's 'gourmet' opinion of herself - of the ones I asked, at the most, they seemed to view her as an OK visual sex snack. The most common, rather Pavlovian response was: 'Oh her - blonde, yeah, nice.' To these men, Kournikova was just the latest tall, slim blonde to fall off the tall, slim blonde conveyor belt. Her gimmick, the thing that makes her seem taller, slimmer and blonder than the rest, the thing that makes her millions, is the fact she plays tennis. Without the tennis, it seems doubtful that Kournikova's prettiness, and scowly demeanour, would have got her very far in the modelling and acting worlds she professes to be interested in. That's why Kournikova should milk her situation all she can. In this unfair world, it's rather a good joke that an averagely talented blonde tennis player should make millions simply by reminding the world of a tacky Athena poster. barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>A key architect of the New Labour project who has raised millions of pounds for the party launched an astonishing attack last night on Tony Blair, accusing him of being immoral, cowardly and a control freak. </p> <p>Ken Follett, the millionaire author whose wife Barbara is the Labour MP for Stevenage, said Blair would be remembered as the Prime Minister who had made 'malicious gossip an everyday tool of modern British government'. </p> <p>Breaking his silence for the first time about his views on Blair, Follett said that, far from leading an ethical Government, Blair presided over an administration which depended on vilifying people in secret briefings. </p> <p>His attack puts the issue of spin and the Government's message once again at the centre of the political debate. He said the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, and the Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Mandelson, were not brave enough to air their criticisms of colleagues publicly. He described spin doctors as the 'rent boys' of politics. </p> <p>Writing in today's Observer , Follett said the secret briefings were the 'equivalent of the poison-pen letter - an anonymous attack by someone who is scared of honest confrontation'. He added: 'What really bothers me is the morality of it. Not to put too fine a point on it, the whole business stinks. If you are displeased with a colleague, you should look him or her in the eye and say so. It's what we expect from leaders.' </p> <p>Follett's attack, which follows criticism of the Government by Labour backbenchers and the former general secretary of the party, Lord Sawyer, is particularly wounding as the author was once a close friend of Blair. </p> <p>In the Nineties Follett raised millions of pounds for the party as head of the 1,000 Club, an elite group who each donated \u00a31,000 a year. </p> <p>He has been credited with being one of the driving forces behind the modernisation of Labour. His wife advised its MPs on dressing well, and the couple earned themselves the sobriquet 'leaders of the luvvie brigade'. </p> <p>He fell out with the Prime Minister, however, after photographers were tipped off about a party at his house to which Blair, then leader of the Opposition, and his wife were invited. </p> <p>'Tony's sure touch deserts him when he faces a decision that cannot be based on expediency,' Follett said. </p> <p>'He tries to resolve the matter like a lawyer, checking what the rules say. He seems not to possess the inner core of strong convictions that would enable him to make a confident choice in a morally complex issue.' </p> <p>Follett said efforts to under mine the former Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, had been counterproductive. </p> <p>'Attempts to blacken Mo's reputation backfired spectacularly. Her popularity has remained high. And so many senior Labour figures have been savaged by this technique that it is no wonder the public is becoming sceptical about the Government as a whole.' </p> <p>Downing Street has always said it was not behind brief ings against Mowlam after stories appeared suggesting that she was struggling to recover from a brain tumour. Campbell has also publicly given her Mowlam his full support. But the author said of the role of Labour's spin doctors: 'The people who do the briefing, who whisper the words of poison into the ears of journalists, are of no consequence. They are the rent boys of politics.' </p> <p>He said that Blair should put a stop to all secret briefings and get on with selling the Government's message. </p> <p>'The polite fiction that the Prime Minister's advisers are responsible is absurd. Control-freak Tony doesn't let Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson go around saying anything they like. They do what the boss tells them. </p> <p>'High office is merciless in the way it reveals character. Slowly but relentlessly, Tony Blair's shortcomings are undermining him.' </p> <p>The Labour Party last night poured scorn on Follet's attack. 'It is sad to see people who purport to be on the Left peddling the propaganda of the Right,' a spokesman said. </p> <p>'The lurid, over-the-top language of Ken Follett's remarks show why he is better known for his fiction than for his judgment. </p> <p>'He joins the ranks of the disappointed and disgruntled who opt for the easy voice of opposition and the ready market to attack a Government taking the tough decisions needed to take Britain into the future. </p> <p>'As for his attack on Alastair Campbell it was Alastair Campbell who put Government briefings on the record.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "A key architect of the New Labour project who has raised millions of pounds for the party launched an astonishing attack last night on Tony Blair, accusing him of being immoral, cowardly and a control freak. Ken Follett, the millionaire author whose wife Barbara is the Labour MP for Stevenage, said Blair would be remembered as the Prime Minister who had made 'malicious gossip an everyday tool of modern British government'. Breaking his silence for the first time about his views on Blair, Follett said that, far from leading an ethical Government, Blair presided over an administration which depended on vilifying people in secret briefings. His attack puts the issue of spin and the Government's message once again at the centre of the political debate. He said the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, and the Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Mandelson, were not brave enough to air their criticisms of colleagues publicly. He described spin doctors as the 'rent boys' of politics. Writing in today's Observer , Follett said the secret briefings were the 'equivalent of the poison-pen letter - an anonymous attack by someone who is scared of honest confrontation'. He added: 'What really bothers me is the morality of it. Not to put too fine a point on it, the whole business stinks. If you are displeased with a colleague, you should look him or her in the eye and say so. It's what we expect from leaders.' Follett's attack, which follows criticism of the Government by Labour backbenchers and the former general secretary of the party, Lord Sawyer, is particularly wounding as the author was once a close friend of Blair. In the Nineties Follett raised millions of pounds for the party as head of the 1,000 Club, an elite group who each donated \u00a31,000 a year. He has been credited with being one of the driving forces behind the modernisation of Labour. His wife advised its MPs on dressing well, and the couple earned themselves the sobriquet 'leaders of the luvvie brigade'. He fell out with the Prime Minister, however, after photographers were tipped off about a party at his house to which Blair, then leader of the Opposition, and his wife were invited. 'Tony's sure touch deserts him when he faces a decision that cannot be based on expediency,' Follett said. 'He tries to resolve the matter like a lawyer, checking what the rules say. He seems not to possess the inner core of strong convictions that would enable him to make a confident choice in a morally complex issue.' Follett said efforts to under mine the former Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, had been counterproductive. 'Attempts to blacken Mo's reputation backfired spectacularly. Her popularity has remained high. And so many senior Labour figures have been savaged by this technique that it is no wonder the public is becoming sceptical about the Government as a whole.' Downing Street has always said it was not behind brief ings against Mowlam after stories appeared suggesting that she was struggling to recover from a brain tumour. Campbell has also publicly given her Mowlam his full support. But the author said of the role of Labour's spin doctors: 'The people who do the briefing, who whisper the words of poison into the ears of journalists, are of no consequence. They are the rent boys of politics.' He said that Blair should put a stop to all secret briefings and get on with selling the Government's message. 'The polite fiction that the Prime Minister's advisers are responsible is absurd. Control-freak Tony doesn't let Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson go around saying anything they like. They do what the boss tells them. 'High office is merciless in the way it reveals character. Slowly but relentlessly, Tony Blair's shortcomings are undermining him.' The Labour Party last night poured scorn on Follet's attack. 'It is sad to see people who purport to be on the Left peddling the propaganda of the Right,' a spokesman said. 'The lurid, over-the-top language of Ken Follett's remarks show why he is better known for his fiction than for his judgment. 'He joins the ranks of the disappointed and disgruntled who opt for the easy voice of opposition and the ready market to attack a Government taking the tough decisions needed to take Britain into the future. 'As for his attack on Alastair Campbell it was Alastair Campbell who put Government briefings on the record.'",

      "body": "<p>Three years into its term of office, the Labour government is starting to be judged by results. Attention has so far focused on the highly charged issues of health and education - but how does the record stand when it comes to our own individual finances? Last week's announcement of the planned Universal Bank, to be run through post offices, is an indication that money issues are high on the current political agenda. </p> <p>The Observer spoke to experts in this field and found the response to be far more positive than the day-to-day hum of New Labour criticism. </p> <p>'At least this Government is recognising there is such a thing as poverty - which the previous Government did not,' says Geoff Fimister of the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG). In 1979, one in 10 children was estimated to be living in poverty - a proportion which has risen to one in three now. But within the next year Chancellor Gordon Brown hopes to cut that proportion to one in four (3.2 million children) through Child Benefit increases and other rises. </p> <p>'The Labour Government has tended to focus on those with the lowest incomes,' says Andrew Dilnot of the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS). Calculations by the IFS show that Brown's four budgets so far have been more redistributive than one might expect from a party which seems to aim itself at the middle ground of Middle England. The poorest 10 per cent of the population are nearly 9 per cent better off as a result of the budgets, says the IFS (<a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk\">www.ifs.org.uk</a>) Meanwhile, the richest 30 per cent experienced a fall in post-tax income, once all the reforms are considered. </p> <p>And everyone benefits from Labour's handling of the economy. 'You'd have to say that Brown is doing very well,' says Mike Warburton, head of tax at accountant Grant Thornton. 'He's avoided the recession, inflation is on target, interest rates are reasonably stable and not too high, growth is in an acceptable target range, unemployment is at a 20-year low and, although the pound is high, it's not too bad in relation to non-European currencies.' </p> <p>Bharti Patel, director of the Low Pay Unit, gives the Government 'two cheers' on several of its initiatives, including parental leave and the minimum wage. Like many commentators she seems to feel that although much needs to be done, the Government has not done badly in three years. </p> <p>There are also serious failures, of course. The New Deal is in trouble. The Government has dragged its heels on the difficult issue of long-term care. It has found some issues far more difficult to handle (Individual Savings Accounts and credit unions, for instance) than in the days when it could make pious statements from the safety of the Opposition benches. It has put several issues in the 'too difficult' pile. Why else would a political party based on collectivism allow large parts of the building society movement to throw away their mutual status? </p> <p>Labour's future plans are now starting to take shape. The results of the comprehensive spending review - outlining areas of spending and retrenchment - will soon be unveiled. And on Friday Labour's national policy forum meets in Exeter to start discussing the manifesto for the next election. </p> <p>There are calls from Old Labour representatives for a higher minimum wage and basic state pension. This could well be the scene of clashes between the forces of Old and New Labour. </p> <p>In the meantime, we look at major areas of government activity over the past three years. </p> <p><strong>Taxation</strong> </p> <p>Labour has kept to its manifesto pledge that there would be no increase in the basic or top rates of income tax; in fact, it cut the basic rate to 22p in April this year. But the cut in the basic rate is widely seen as a gimmick by commentators: if Brown had wanted to target the poor more efficiently, he would have raised the tax threshold higher. He has also boxed clever to keep to the manifesto pledge - taking tax benefits away in other forms, such as the loss of the dividend tax credit. </p> <p>Warburton says: 'He has allowed himself to get far too fiddly. Most people don't understand the tax system any more.' </p> <p><strong> Welfare benefits</strong> </p> <p>The party got itself a bad reputation among Old Labour when it stuck to Conservative spending plans in the first two years: it cut the benefits paid to single parents and went further and attacked disability benefits. </p> <p>But although that reputation does linger, the reality may not be quite as bad. Fimister of the CPAG does not make the fierce attack on the Government that some might have expected of him: 'The Government has improved some disability benefits and cut others.' </p> <p>Despite the intentions of Labour's first Minister for Welfare Reform, Frank Field, to move away from means-testing, the Government is going in the opposite direction. So, although the incomes of the bottom 10 per cent of the population have improved 8.8 per cent as a result of budget measures, the IFS concludes that poor people with some savings could be losing out, while their counterparts with no extra money will be doing better. </p> <p><strong> Home ownership</strong> </p> <p>Interest rates for the country's 11 million homeowners have stayed relatively low: base rates ranging between 5 and 7.5 per cent. Although the Chancellor passed responsibility for rate-setting to the Bank of England, he takes the praise for the low-inflation, low-interest-rate climate. But if there is another 1991-style recession, the National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux believes more people could be repossessed because of a tougher stance by lenders, particularly mutuals which converted to banks. </p> <p>Labour has done nothing to stop the move from mutuality - and could indirectly take some of the blame. Labour also plans to make home ownership more risky - by extending from nine to 14 months the period in which unemployed or sick homeowners are unable to get Income Support for their mortgage payments. </p> <p><strong> Individual savings accounts</strong> </p> <p>The major criticism of Isas is, perhaps, that they do not fulfil Labour's once laudable aims of helping the poor to save - although the Pep and Isa Managers Association says that 'many new savers have been attracted' to Isas. About \u00a328 billion was invested in 9 million maxi and mini accounts in the first Isa year, which ended in April. Isas are clearly reaching more people than Peps. In 1998/99, the last Pep year, about \u00a316bn was invested in five million plans. </p> <p><strong> Pensions</strong> </p> <p>To some degree, Labour's pension policy has already been a success. Its stakeholder pension, due to start in April 2001, is dragging down charges on personal pensions to the 1 per cent a year maximum allowed under the stakeholder scheme. But Labour stopped short of the step that must surely come one day - compulsion. There is also a danger that employers will be less keen to offer their own schemes (which they would contribute to) than stakeholder schemes (where they do not have to contribute). </p> <p>The removal of the tax credit on dividends hits all our pension plans hard. But, on the plus side, the introduction of the 'minimum income guarantee' for pensioners gave a leg-up on income levels to the poorest pensioners claiming welfare benefits. </p> <p>Despite pensioners' fury over the 75p rise on their basic pension, the country's 11 million senior citizens have not, says Dilnot of the IFS, done badly under Labour: 'It has allocated a reasonable amount of money to pensioners, but in different ways - winter warmers, free TV licence and so on - instead of putting it straight into their benefit.' </p> <p>Pensions policy is an important issue for Labour, explicitly mentioned in the seventh of 10 pledges (the ones drawn up by Tony Blair in his back garden) about their aims in this Government: 'We will help build strong families and strong communities, and lay the foundations of a modern welfare state in pensions and community care.' </p> <p><strong> Long-term care</strong> </p> <p>Homilies about treating the elderly with respect are the background noise you hear whenever Health Ministers make an appearance. But apart from this nice thought, little has happened in the way of action on the results of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care for the Elderly. However, a white paper is due on this subject this month. With life expectancies extending, the bill for long-term care is potentially enormous. </p> <p>A generous critic of the Government would congratulate them for starting to tackle a difficult subject. But they will inevitably be attacked for not going further. </p> <p><strong> Banking</strong> </p> <p>Labour has taken a non-interventionist policy on some of the huge issues which are transforming banking - bank branch closures and the demutualisation of building societies and insurance companies, for instance. On cash withdrawal charges, they relied on Don Cruickshank to suggest compromises in his recent report on banking. Infuriated by Labour's lack of action, many people in rural areas may take their grudges about having to travel 10 miles to a bank into the voting booth when the election comes. </p> <p><strong> Working parents</strong> </p> <p>Along with 'New Deal', the words 'Working Families Tax Credit' are thought to be engraved on Brown's heart. Far more generous than the benefit it replaced (Family Credit), WFTC is providing an average of \u00a324 a week extra to working parents. But it is still 'too early' to judge its success definitively, says Patel of the Low Pay Unit. In the interim, she gives it 'two cheers' - the third being lost because of the way the interaction with Housing Benefit reduces the extra cash for many parents to just \u00a310 a week. Another measure to help working parents is the new arrangement for 'parental leave'. Although this is currently unpaid, campaigners are hoping that paid leave will become a manifesto pledge. Very strong hints have come from Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers that he is considering this. </p> <p><strong> New Deal</strong> </p> <p>Brown's flagship \u00a34bn programme to help the unemployed find a new skill and a new job could have set the model for the rest of the world - if only it worked. 'New Deal is not looking good,' says Patel of the Low Pay Unit. 'Within the scheme, it has proved fairly hard to place the long-term unemployed in work - particularly people from ethnic minorities. And it may be that there is some institutionalised racism in the scheme.' </p> <p>Only about a fifth of New Deal entrants are thought to keep the jobs they are offered. The Conservatives recently proposed scrapping the New Deal scheme for lone parents - without suffering any sort of backlash. </p> <p><strong> Minimum wage</strong> </p> <p>More than 1.5 million people are thought to have seen their hourly wage go up after the introduction in April 1999 of the minimum wage (\u00a33.70 an hour for people aged 22 and over; and \u00a33.20 an hour for 18-to-21-year-olds). The Low Pay Unit gives two cheers to the minimum wage - arguing that the rate should be linked to a benchmark such as half of male median earnings, currently \u00a34.94 an hour. The Unit believes that more than 1.5 million may have benefited - although some employers may have taken away some of the extra money by ruses such as reducing paid holiday. </p> <p>In general, workers' rights have improved enormously through a raft of measures, including the right to four weeks' paid holiday a year; the equal treatment of part-timers with full-time workers; and the right to claim unfair dismissal (and therefore to get financial compensation) after one year, rather than two. Some of these measures have been forced on the Government by the EU and the European Court of Justice, but Labour has, perhaps, adopted them a little more enthusiastically than the Tories would. </p>",

There are calls from Old Labour representatives for a higher minimum wage and basic state pension. This could well be the scene of clashes between the forces of Old and New Labour. In the meantime, we look at major areas of government activity over the past three years. Taxation Labour has kept to its manifesto pledge that there would be no increase in the basic or top rates of income tax; in fact, it cut the basic rate to 22p in April this year. But the cut in the basic rate is widely seen as a gimmick by commentators: if Brown had wanted to target the poor more efficiently, he would have raised the tax threshold higher. He has also boxed clever to keep to the manifesto pledge - taking tax benefits away in other forms, such as the loss of the dividend tax credit. Warburton says: 'He has allowed himself to get far too fiddly. Most people don't understand the tax system any more.' Welfare benefits The party got itself a bad reputation among Old Labour when it stuck to Conservative spending plans in the first two years: it cut the benefits paid to single parents and went further and attacked disability benefits. But although that reputation does linger, the reality may not be quite as bad. Fimister of the CPAG does not make the fierce attack on the Government that some might have expected of him: 'The Government has improved some disability benefits and cut others.' Despite the intentions of Labour's first Minister for Welfare Reform, Frank Field, to move away from means-testing, the Government is going in the opposite direction. So, although the incomes of the bottom 10 per cent of the population have improved 8.8 per cent as a result of budget measures, the IFS concludes that poor people with some savings could be losing out, while their counterparts with no extra money will be doing better. Home ownership Interest rates for the country's 11 million homeowners have stayed relatively low: base rates ranging between 5 and 7.5 per cent. Although the Chancellor passed responsibility for rate-setting to the Bank of England, he takes the praise for the low-inflation, low-interest-rate climate. But if there is another 1991-style recession, the National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux believes more people could be repossessed because of a tougher stance by lenders, particularly mutuals which converted to banks. Labour has done nothing to stop the move from mutuality - and could indirectly take some of the blame. Labour also plans to make home ownership more risky - by extending from nine to 14 months the period in which unemployed or sick homeowners are unable to get Income Support for their mortgage payments. Individual savings accounts The major criticism of Isas is, perhaps, that they do not fulfil Labour's once laudable aims of helping the poor to save - although the Pep and Isa Managers Association says that 'many new savers have been attracted' to Isas. About \u00a328 billion was invested in 9 million maxi and mini accounts in the first Isa year, which ended in April. Isas are clearly reaching more people than Peps. In 1998/99, the last Pep year, about \u00a316bn was invested in five million plans. Pensions To some degree, Labour's pension policy has already been a success. Its stakeholder pension, due to start in April 2001, is dragging down charges on personal pensions to the 1 per cent a year maximum allowed under the stakeholder scheme. But Labour stopped short of the step that must surely come one day - compulsion. There is also a danger that employers will be less keen to offer their own schemes (which they would contribute to) than stakeholder schemes (where they do not have to contribute). The removal of the tax credit on dividends hits all our pension plans hard. But, on the plus side, the introduction of the 'minimum income guarantee' for pensioners gave a leg-up on income levels to the poorest pensioners claiming welfare benefits. Despite pensioners' fury over the 75p rise on their basic pension, the country's 11 million senior citizens have not, says Dilnot of the IFS, done badly under Labour: 'It has allocated a reasonable amount of money to pensioners, but in different ways - winter warmers, free TV licence and so on - instead of putting it straight into their benefit.' Pensions policy is an important issue for Labour, explicitly mentioned in the seventh of 10 pledges (the ones drawn up by Tony Blair in his back garden) about their aims in this Government: 'We will help build strong families and strong communities, and lay the foundations of a modern welfare state in pensions and community care.' Long-term care Homilies about treating the elderly with respect are the background noise you hear whenever Health Ministers make an appearance. But apart from this nice thought, little has happened in the way of action on the results of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care for the Elderly. However, a white paper is due on this subject this month. With life expectancies extending, the bill for long-term care is potentially enormous. A generous critic of the Government would congratulate them for starting to tackle a difficult subject. But they will inevitably be attacked for not going further. Banking Labour has taken a non-interventionist policy on some of the huge issues which are transforming banking - bank branch closures and the demutualisation of building societies and insurance companies, for instance. On cash withdrawal charges, they relied on Don Cruickshank to suggest compromises in his recent report on banking. Infuriated by Labour's lack of action, many people in rural areas may take their grudges about having to travel 10 miles to a bank into the voting booth when the election comes. Working parents Along with 'New Deal', the words 'Working Families Tax Credit' are thought to be engraved on Brown's heart. Far more generous than the benefit it replaced (Family Credit), WFTC is providing an average of \u00a324 a week extra to working parents. But it is still 'too early' to judge its success definitively, says Patel of the Low Pay Unit. In the interim, she gives it 'two cheers' - the third being lost because of the way the interaction with Housing Benefit reduces the extra cash for many parents to just \u00a310 a week. Another measure to help working parents is the new arrangement for 'parental leave'. Although this is currently unpaid, campaigners are hoping that paid leave will become a manifesto pledge. Very strong hints have come from Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers that he is considering this. New Deal Brown's flagship \u00a34bn programme to help the unemployed find a new skill and a new job could have set the model for the rest of the world - if only it worked. 'New Deal is not looking good,' says Patel of the Low Pay Unit. 'Within the scheme, it has proved fairly hard to place the long-term unemployed in work - particularly people from ethnic minorities. And it may be that there is some institutionalised racism in the scheme.' Only about a fifth of New Deal entrants are thought to keep the jobs they are offered. The Conservatives recently proposed scrapping the New Deal scheme for lone parents - without suffering any sort of backlash. Minimum wage More than 1.5 million people are thought to have seen their hourly wage go up after the introduction in April 1999 of the minimum wage (\u00a33.70 an hour for people aged 22 and over; and \u00a33.20 an hour for 18-to-21-year-olds). The Low Pay Unit gives two cheers to the minimum wage - arguing that the rate should be linked to a benchmark such as half of male median earnings, currently \u00a34.94 an hour. The Unit believes that more than 1.5 million may have benefited - although some employers may have taken away some of the extra money by ruses such as reducing paid holiday. In general, workers' rights have improved enormously through a raft of measures, including the right to four weeks' paid holiday a year; the equal treatment of part-timers with full-time workers; and the right to claim unfair dismissal (and therefore to get financial compensation) after one year, rather than two. Some of these measures have been forced on the Government by the EU and the European Court of Justice, but Labour has, perhaps, adopted them a little more enthusiastically than the Tories would.",

By that time the gravelly voice and the lugubrious bloodhound face were famous the world over and Matthau was a major star. </p> <p>Success had come slowly. As a teenager on the Lower East Side he'd peddled soft drinks and played walk-on roles in the local Yiddish theatre, but it wasn't until after wartime service as a radioman-airgunner in the Army Air Corps that he studied acting with a grant under the GI Bill and became a professional actor. In the theatre and cinema he became a supporting actor, playing sardonic observers of the social scene, usually as a heavy or the hero's friend. </p> <p>In his first movie, The Kentuckian (1953), he was the villain who drew Burt Lancaster into a duel of whips and in Michael Curtiz's King Creole (1958) he was the New Orleans gang boss making life difficult for Elvis Presley. </p> <p>Between those two parts he had more sympathetic roles as the kindly neighbour of deranged teacher James Mason in Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life (1956) and as the liberal TV director who helps expose the fascistic anti-hero in Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd (1957). The title seemed to describe his career. He seemed destined to become one of those character actors like William Demarest and Sidney Greenstreet who are in constant demand, helping to populate Hollywood's special world, yet never taking centre stage. Then things changed in America as the studios declined, the conformity of the Eisenhower years gave way to the Kennedy era. </p> <p>Matthau's supporting roles got bigger and stronger and allowed him to bounce off the smooth stars he worked with. As the decent sherriff in Lonely Are The Brave (1962), he stole the show from Kirk Douglas, and as the smooth villain in Stanley Donen's Charade the following year he had better lines than Cary Grant. </p> <p>In Fail Safe he was a cold warrior, urging a pre-emptive strike on the President, Henry Fonda, and in Mirage he was a crafty New York private eye who gets bumped off by the military-industrial establishment for assisting Gregory Peck. </p> <p>His biggest theatrical success came in 1965 under Mike Nichols' direction as Oscar, the selfish, slobbish sportswriter in Neil Simon's The Odd Couple , playing opposite a then much more celebrated comic actor, Art Carney, as the prissy Felix. I remember the excitement of seeing this production on Broadway and experiencing the confident arrival of a star, someone who commanded the theatre through comic misanthropy, scorned sentimentality and did nothing to ingratiate himself with anyone, either on stage or in the audience. He combined the bull-like feroc ity of Wallace Beery with the rebarbative humour of W.C. Fields. He was immediately signed up by Billy Wilder, who saw in him a man after his own cold heart and cast him as the ambulance-chasing shyster who lures his decent brother-in-law Jack Lemmon, into a legal scam in The Fortune Cookie (1966). The pair were as perfectly matched as Laurel and Hardy. The next year they appeared together again in the film version of The Odd Couple and made a further half-dozen pictures in tandem including the two Grumpy Old Men comedies of the Nineties. None was as good as those first two, and the best of them - Wilder's 1974 version of The Front Page - was not the classic that on paper it should have been. </p> <p>Neil Simon had written The Odd Couple with Matthau in mind, and over the years Simon scripts gave him characteristic parts, the finest perhaps starring with George Burns as the vaudeville duo who can't stand each other in The Sunshine Boys . He worked beautifully with the nonagenarian Burns, and was usually at his best when locked in friendly or not so friendly combat with his dramatic or comic equals. He was marvellous with the feisty Carol Burnett in Pete 'n' Tillie, and as a techy priest in the rarely seen Italian comedy The Little Devil he brought out the best in Roberto Begnini as a devil sent to torment him. </p> <p>He could, when called upon, play more or less straight, as he did in one of his best pictures as the ruthless crop-dusting pilot and part-time bank robber who tangles with the Mob in Don Siegel's Charley Varrick (1973). </p> <p>During the last 25 years of his career the lines on the face got ever deeper and the voice became a dangerous growl. The roles, however, became increasingly stereotyped, a predictable succession of comic curmudgeons, whose hearts of gold we were invited to infer, and increasingly often to inspect. Yet he never gave up the sense of being his own man or the opponent of whatever seemed to be the establishment of the moment. In First Monday in October (1981) he played a liberal judge facing up to a right-wing woman appointed to the court. He was excellent in another courtroom drama, The Incident (1989), as an elderly lawyer who defies a xenophobic small-town community during World War II by undertaking the defence of a German PoW charged with murder. </p> <p>His final appearance was as the isolated, dying father of sisters Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow and Meg Ryan in Hanging Up . Though sick and demented he goes to his grave rejecting all gestures of sympathy, turning everyone against him, but with a joke on his lips. </p> <p>It was a bad film, but a courageous part for a sick, 78-year-old actor to accept.

      "body": "<b> Is Beatrix Potter awful, too?</b> <br> Could Anthony Holden advise me as to the worrying behaviour of my two-year-old daughter. She continues to get great joy from my reading unchallenging books such as the Harry Potter series, not to mention the incredible fantasy that is Beatrix Potter. Whoever heard of talking animals! Perhaps I have left it too late to introduce her to Chekov. <b> K Marshall </b> <br> Evesham <br> Worcestershire <p> <b> You're rubbish</b> <br> Look Anthony Holden I think your story about Harry Potter is rubbish! Although I may be only 10, I still count and there are plenty of others who do not agree with you. Holden says: 'As Harry approaches puberty, he will no doubt turn into a spotty little wizard who eventually gets the girl.' I disagree. Although he may become a teenager, I think he would never be such a thing. The books are about the fact that Harry is a wizard in this strange new world, not whether or not he gets a girl. </p> <p>I disagree with the part where he says that you can predict exactly what is going to happen. You are an adult who is probably getting paid to write and as a child I would say that because you are an adult, and the book was written for children, you would not understand the magic that children feel when reading the books. All my friends find Harry Potter exceptionally good and for your own good I advise you to stop publishing things that criticise Harry Potter books, or you will be in trouble from a dozen more readers writing you letters like this one. <br> <b> Joy Elsmore </b><br> Wokingham, Berks </p> <p><b>My son reads now</b> <br> In an age where the number of non-literary distractions seems almost overwhelming, JK Rowling has accomplished the feat of creating excitement about written stories, getting them discussed in the playground. She turned my eldest son into an avid reader. <br> <b>Julian Page </b><br> Darlington, County Durham </p> <p> <b> They're original</b> <br> I suppose it was only a matter of time before someone had to deflate JK Rowling's popularity. As a former English teacher, I can't say I have noticed her 'pedestrian ungrammatical style'. More to the point, have we to hear again the old argument about a story set in a boarding school being alien to day pupils? Surely there is attraction to something that is different from everyday reality! </p> <p>It is also good for children to read stories that are thrilling, heroic, full of surprises and where good unashamedly triumphs over evil. He should also remember that however splendid Seamus Heaney's Beowulf is, it is a translation. The Harry Potter books are, with all their faults, original works. <br> <b> E Barraclough </b><br> Leeds </p> <p> <b> Sour grapes</b> <br> One wonders whether Anthony Holden's diatribe against the Harry Potter books was born of jealousy? He wonders why people do not prefer the writings of Seamus Heaney, David Cairns or 'even my own action-packed life of Shakespeare'. </p> <p>As a newly qualified librarian, I do not feel that it is my role to dictate children's tastes to them. My own nine-year-old daughter commends Rowling's work as 'a humorous adventure which I can't put down'. </p> <p>Holden criticises the \u00e9litism of Hogwarts boarding school. But don't stories such as Beowulf rely on privileged and \u00e9lite characters such as kings, queens, knights and heroes? </p> <p>I sense a feeling of sour grapes among Mr Holden and his Old Boys' Network of literary chums which is no doubt influenced by Ms Rowling's social background. She just does not fit in with the Oxbridge, male-dominated world of literature, and so much the better. <br> <b> Phyllis Mutua </b><br> Edgware <br> Middlesex </p> <p> <b> Sheer envy</b> <br> Why should reading be 'for the brain'? Isn't it acceptable to pick up a book to read and enjoy? Comparisons are odious - why can't one enjoy JK Rowling and Jacqueline Wilson. The Illustrated Mum is superb but that doesn't make Prisoner of Azkeban any less enjoyable. That an author who writes so extensively about the royals (hardly great literature) should whinge about 'a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style' is beyond me. </p> <p>I would suggest that it is the success that Ms Rowling is enjoying that sticks in his craw. Nothing upsets our journalists more than success - it's so un-British! <br> <b> Jane Alexander</b><br> London SE3 </p> <p> <b> Such fantasy</b> <br> Anthony Holden suggests that young people should be reading more realistic things: 'Reading [Harry Potter books] is an activity marginally less testing than watching Neighbours. And that, at least, is vaguely about real life,' he claims. But he also said that 'I had looked forward to enjoying a magical ride through some thrillingly original fantasy world.' This is a contradiction. </p> <p>Is he really trying to say that children should be watching Neighbours rather than be in bed reading, even if it is Harry Potter? </p> <p>I personally love fantasy books and one reason for that is that they allow me to forget all my worries. If people enjoy fantasy then that's fine by me if it is enjoyable for them. <br> <b> Hannah Tucker (year 7) </b><br> London E8 </p> <p> <b> Get facts straight</b> <br> I have just read Anthony Holden's article about Harry Potter and it made me very annoyed. </p> <p>What is so wrong with Harry Potter that we are not to rejoice? Children are enjoying reading a perfectly good book so what is so awful? I found it quite funny how he compared the advertising and hype surrounding Harry Potter to that of the Wonderbra. They are completely different things. </p> <p>Children are not as stupid as he thinks. We can tell the difference between a good book and real life. I feel that JK Rowling has brought joy to millions. </p> <p>As for her using her initials, well it worked didn't it? I have met JK Rowling and she is very nice. I think Mr Holden should get his facts straight. <br> <b> Catherine Somerville (11)</b><br> Edinburgh </p> <p><b>A dog called Fluffy has my vote</b><br> Any book that has as a guard to the entrance to a secret tunnel, a three-headed dog, the name of which is revealed, several chapters later, to be Fluffy, gets my vote! </p> <p>And how would parents get their young (and often, not so young) children to behave at all without the constant threat that 'there'll be no Harry Potter tonight'? Poor Mr Holden if he cannot see the excitement, magic and the sheer fun in the Harry Potter series. But then, if he thinks Neighbours is about real life (even vaguely), and that 'the infantilisation of adult culture' counts as an example of flowing prose, there is really very little hope for him.<br> <b> Brian Everitt </b><br> London SE19 </p> <p><b>What a whinger</b><br> Harry Potter may not be about real life but children wouldn't want to always be reading about things that happen every day.

      "bodyText": "Is Beatrix Potter awful, too? Could Anthony Holden advise me as to the worrying behaviour of my two-year-old daughter. She continues to get great joy from my reading unchallenging books such as the Harry Potter series, not to mention the incredible fantasy that is Beatrix Potter. Whoever heard of talking animals! Perhaps I have left it too late to introduce her to Chekov. K Marshall Evesham Worcestershire You're rubbish Look Anthony Holden I think your story about Harry Potter is rubbish! Although I may be only 10, I still count and there are plenty of others who do not agree with you. Holden says: 'As Harry approaches puberty, he will no doubt turn into a spotty little wizard who eventually gets the girl.' I disagree. Although he may become a teenager, I think he would never be such a thing. The books are about the fact that Harry is a wizard in this strange new world, not whether or not he gets a girl. I disagree with the part where he says that you can predict exactly what is going to happen. You are an adult who is probably getting paid to write and as a child I would say that because you are an adult, and the book was written for children, you would not understand the magic that children feel when reading the books. All my friends find Harry Potter exceptionally good and for your own good I advise you to stop publishing things that criticise Harry Potter books, or you will be in trouble from a dozen more readers writing you letters like this one. Joy Elsmore Wokingham, Berks My son reads now In an age where the number of non-literary distractions seems almost overwhelming, JK Rowling has accomplished the feat of creating excitement about written stories, getting them discussed in the playground. She turned my eldest son into an avid reader. Julian Page Darlington, County Durham They're original I suppose it was only a matter of time before someone had to deflate JK Rowling's popularity. As a former English teacher, I can't say I have noticed her 'pedestrian ungrammatical style'. More to the point, have we to hear again the old argument about a story set in a boarding school being alien to day pupils? Surely there is attraction to something that is different from everyday reality! It is also good for children to read stories that are thrilling, heroic, full of surprises and where good unashamedly triumphs over evil. He should also remember that however splendid Seamus Heaney's Beowulf is, it is a translation. The Harry Potter books are, with all their faults, original works. E Barraclough Leeds Sour grapes One wonders whether Anthony Holden's diatribe against the Harry Potter books was born of jealousy? He wonders why people do not prefer the writings of Seamus Heaney, David Cairns or 'even my own action-packed life of Shakespeare'. As a newly qualified librarian, I do not feel that it is my role to dictate children's tastes to them. My own nine-year-old daughter commends Rowling's work as 'a humorous adventure which I can't put down'. Holden criticises the \u00e9litism of Hogwarts boarding school. But don't stories such as Beowulf rely on privileged and \u00e9lite characters such as kings, queens, knights and heroes? I sense a feeling of sour grapes among Mr Holden and his Old Boys' Network of literary chums which is no doubt influenced by Ms Rowling's social background. She just does not fit in with the Oxbridge, male-dominated world of literature, and so much the better. Phyllis Mutua Edgware Middlesex Sheer envy Why should reading be 'for the brain'? Isn't it acceptable to pick up a book to read and enjoy? Comparisons are odious - why can't one enjoy JK Rowling and Jacqueline Wilson. The Illustrated Mum is superb but that doesn't make Prisoner of Azkeban any less enjoyable. That an author who writes so extensively about the royals (hardly great literature) should whinge about 'a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style' is beyond me. I would suggest that it is the success that Ms Rowling is enjoying that sticks in his craw. Nothing upsets our journalists more than success - it's so un-British! Jane Alexander London SE3 Such fantasy Anthony Holden suggests that young people should be reading more realistic things: 'Reading [Harry Potter books] is an activity marginally less testing than watching Neighbours. And that, at least, is vaguely about real life,' he claims. But he also said that 'I had looked forward to enjoying a magical ride through some thrillingly original fantasy world.' This is a contradiction. Is he really trying to say that children should be watching Neighbours rather than be in bed reading, even if it is Harry Potter? I personally love fantasy books and one reason for that is that they allow me to forget all my worries. If people enjoy fantasy then that's fine by me if it is enjoyable for them. Hannah Tucker (year 7) London E8 Get facts straight I have just read Anthony Holden's article about Harry Potter and it made me very annoyed. What is so wrong with Harry Potter that we are not to rejoice? Children are enjoying reading a perfectly good book so what is so awful? I found it quite funny how he compared the advertising and hype surrounding Harry Potter to that of the Wonderbra. They are completely different things. Children are not as stupid as he thinks. We can tell the difference between a good book and real life. I feel that JK Rowling has brought joy to millions. As for her using her initials, well it worked didn't it? I have met JK Rowling and she is very nice. I think Mr Holden should get his facts straight. Catherine Somerville (11) Edinburgh A dog called Fluffy has my vote Any book that has as a guard to the entrance to a secret tunnel, a three-headed dog, the name of which is revealed, several chapters later, to be Fluffy, gets my vote! And how would parents get their young (and often, not so young) children to behave at all without the constant threat that 'there'll be no Harry Potter tonight'? Poor Mr Holden if he cannot see the excitement, magic and the sheer fun in the Harry Potter series. But then, if he thinks Neighbours is about real life (even vaguely), and that 'the infantilisation of adult culture' counts as an example of flowing prose, there is really very little hope for him. Brian Everitt London SE19 What a whinger Harry Potter may not be about real life but children wouldn't want to always be reading about things that happen every day. Jacqueline Wilson's book are exciting as well, so why shouldn't children have both? I picked up a few new words from Mr Holden's article but I also learned some from Harry Potter which can only be a good thing. Do you think Mr Holden is just whingeing because Harry Potter books are selling better than his? I am really looking forward to the new book and I hope Mr Holden enjoys it too. Eve Garrett (aged 9) Black Bourton Oxon For children only I'm sorry that the Harry Potter books haven't cast a spell over Anthony Holden, but the truth of the matter is that they are not written for his age group, but for mine. Although they may not be on a par with Alice in Wonderland, Treasure Island or Peter Pan, they are witty, enjoyable and imaginative ('Charm Your Own Cheese!'). He complains about marketing, However, the books were first sold by word of mouth, not advertising. Whatever Anthony Holden says, it won't stop us from enjoying the series. Tom Lazenby (aged 10) London E8 ... and the one who thinks Holden is right This morning I read with relief the crushing indictment of Harry Potter by Anthony Holden. The effect that reading these books is having both on adults and on children concerns me. Rowling's success may be attributed to her ability to provide mystery and excitement in a world where they are now rarely noticed. Unfortunately, she shows an increasing fascination and attraction to evil and black magic. Rarely ever writing with delight about anything beautiful or positive, she seems to love describing the horrible Dementors in every detail. In fact the only positive character in the whole series is the wise Professor Dumbledore, quietly in control of every situation, but whom we hardly ever see. This obsession with evil can only have a negative effect on our children's minds. Come back CS Lewis's The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and show us the wonder, magic and beauty of life again.

      "body": "<p>Headlong (2hrs 15 mins, BBC Radio 4 Books \u00a38.99) by Michael Frayn is read in an abridged version by Martin Jarvis. Art historian Martin Clay thinks he has stumbled on the discovery of the century. His boorish neighbour, Tony, shows him some old family pictures and one of them, Martin is sure, is a lost painting from Bruegel's Seasons cycle. We know that everything will end in tears, but Martin's Machiavellian plotting to acquire the missing masterpiece, and his hideous entanglement with Tony's philistine wife, is hugely enjoyable. </p> <p>Jarvis's rendering of dialogue produces uncannily real men and women and deftly exploits the comedy Abridgement loses much of the sparkling, intellectual detective work which made the book so satisfying, and consequently the comic contrast between the serious scholarship and the farcical pursuit of the picture isn't so sharp. Nevertheless it's enormous fun. </p> <p>If you're looking for holiday romance, why not try Classic Love Stories 2 (3hrs, CSA Telltapes \u00a38.99) which is beautifully read by husband and wife Joanna David and Edward Fox. Georgie Porgie in Kipling's story of the same name lives happily with a cheroot-smoking Burmese 'wife' whom he has named Georgina - until he feels it time to return to his 'own kind' to marry an English rose. Georgina's final realisation that her 'god' is not going to return as promised is indelibly poignant Edward Fox's leisurely, days-of-Empire delivery sharpens the edge of Kipling's bitter social comment. </p> <p>Holidays give you time to catch up with the classics - and the audiobook allows you to do it with your eyes shut. Wherever you are, you will be transported by David Haig reading Arnold Bennett's The Old Wive's Tale (24hrs 15 mins, Cover to Cover \u00a359.99; direct mail (01672) 562255) Haig's gentle Staffordshire accent takes you to nineteenth-century Bursley where Constance and Sophia are imprisoned in the draper's shop while their father lies upstairs, ruined by a stroke. </p> <p>Those 'terrific bosoms' of mother and aunt swathed in cocoons of crepe! Poor Maggie slaving in the subterranean kitchen for 22 years and not even invited to her master's funeral! No wonder Sophia ran away with her 'commercial', the shady Gerald Scales, never to see her mother again. </p> <p>A new Barbara Vine is always sure to intrigue. In Grasshopper (5hrs 30 mins, Penguin \u00a312.99) Clodagh &amp; Silver, two drifters drawn to one another by their rejection of conventionality, nightly roam the rooftops of Maida Vale. Peering through lighted windows into other people's lives, they become involved in an increasingly dangerous scenario. Frances Barber's seductive voice suits the fey, otherworldliness of the characters. </p> <p>Finally, why not treat yourself to 2,500 years of theatre from ancient Greece to modern musicals without stirring from the beach mat? In writing The History of the Theatre (5hrs 11mins, Naxos cassette \u00a311.99; CD \u00a316.99) David Timson hoped, like Thomas Middleton, to 'both make you sad and tickle ye'. With Derek Jacobi's narration supported by nearly 60 excerpts performed by a full cast, he certainly succeeds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502438015,00.html\">Buy Headlong at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502416962,00.html\">Buy Classic Love Stories 2 at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502419004,00.html\">Buy Grasshopper at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502425141,00.html\">Buy The History of the Theatre at BOL</a></p>",

If you're looking for holiday romance, why not try Classic Love Stories 2 (3hrs, CSA Telltapes \u00a38.99) which is beautifully read by husband and wife Joanna David and Edward Fox. Georgie Porgie in Kipling's story of the same name lives happily with a cheroot-smoking Burmese 'wife' whom he has named Georgina - until he feels it time to return to his 'own kind' to marry an English rose. Georgina's final realisation that her 'god' is not going to return as promised is indelibly poignant Edward Fox's leisurely, days-of-Empire delivery sharpens the edge of Kipling's bitter social comment. Holidays give you time to catch up with the classics - and the audiobook allows you to do it with your eyes shut. Wherever you are, you will be transported by David Haig reading Arnold Bennett's The Old Wive's Tale (24hrs 15 mins, Cover to Cover \u00a359.99; direct mail (01672) 562255) Haig's gentle Staffordshire accent takes you to nineteenth-century Bursley where Constance and Sophia are imprisoned in the draper's shop while their father lies upstairs, ruined by a stroke. Those 'terrific bosoms' of mother and aunt swathed in cocoons of crepe! Poor Maggie slaving in the subterranean kitchen for 22 years and not even invited to her master's funeral! No wonder Sophia ran away with her 'commercial', the shady Gerald Scales, never to see her mother again. A new Barbara Vine is always sure to intrigue. In Grasshopper (5hrs 30 mins, Penguin \u00a312.99) Clodagh &amp; Silver, two drifters drawn to one another by their rejection of conventionality, nightly roam the rooftops of Maida Vale. Peering through lighted windows into other people's lives, they become involved in an increasingly dangerous scenario. Frances Barber's seductive voice suits the fey, otherworldliness of the characters. Finally, why not treat yourself to 2,500 years of theatre from ancient Greece to modern musicals without stirring from the beach mat? In writing The History of the Theatre (5hrs 11mins, Naxos cassette \u00a311.99; CD \u00a316.99) David Timson hoped, like Thomas Middleton, to 'both make you sad and tickle ye'. With Derek Jacobi's narration supported by nearly 60 excerpts performed by a full cast, he certainly succeeds.

      "body": "<p>Yummy yummy, I predict much wolfing of India Knight's My Life on a Plate (Penguin, \u00a35.99) this summer. It's one of those light-as-air souffl\u00e9s that could well turn into a great meaty stockpot for the publishers. It has already been sold in eight countries, and now two Hollywood film companies are fighting to buy it. So we are talking big money, which is appropriate for India who is a big hungry girl. </p> <p>Attentive Observer readers will spot similarities between My Life on a Plate and the column India wrote for Life magazine in l998. If you remember, or rather if you don't, that column began with India, happily married with two small children, chattering cheerfully about her friends and family. But suddenly things took a darker turn and on 21 June l998 she announced: 'Stop me if this sounds at all familiar, but my husband is leaving me.' It did sound familiar because precisely the same thing had happened to the previous columnist, Kathryn Flett, now TV critic. Kathryn went on to write a moving book about it, The Heart-Shaped Bullet. India rallied quickly and consoled herself by writing a funny novel. The idea of a funny novel about divorce might sound heartless; I can only say - read My Life on a Plate and see. </p> <p>I went to visit India at home, and wow! She lives in grim, grey Dalston but the greyness ends as soon as you enter her front door - the house is pink and mauve and scarlet and turquoise, with rows of fabulous shoes instead of ornaments. India shimmies forth in a pink party dress - 'I dressed for YOU!' - and says immediately that she is not allowed to tell me about the two film companies bidding for her book because she is sworn to secrecy. But before I can even murmur, 'Oh go on', she is trumpeting, 'Miramax and Minnie Driver! Minnie Driver wants to play ME!' It seems that Minnie Driver has her own production company and wants My Life on a Plate to be her first production. This means that Minnie has now supplanted Madonna in India's affections. India wanted to quote some Madonna lyrics in her novel, but she would have had to pay the Material Girl \u00a3l0,000 for permission. So Madonna is toast. </p> <p>India Knight defies any easy categorisation, which is part of her charm. She is fiercely intelligent, but obsessed with lipstick and face cream; she is alarmingly posh, but lives in Dalston; she seems very confident most of the time but then has awful wobbles of nerves - especially about this book. She is, as her name suggests, Eurasian but hardly your Andrew Neil-type Asian babe because she is a strapping size l6 with a Wagnerian chest and a noisy habit of 'honking' - her word - at any jokes including her own. Despite the honking, she can be positively Lady Bracknellish at times. Some poor benighted customs officer once had the temerity to stop India and her mother and ask to search their baggage - they responded by suing HM Customs and Excise for false imprisonment and 'slander by conduct'. </p> <p>Actually, she isn't India Knight at all - her real name is something hideous and Belgian but she changed it by deed poll at 13. She chose India because her mother is - not Indian actually, but Pakistani - and Knight because it was the name of her then stepfather. Her early life is so complicated it would never be believed in a novel. She was born in Brussels in l965, and her first language was French. Her mother, Begum Sabiha, had fled from an arranged marriage in Pakistan to university in the States, and then to Brussels, where she met India's father - 'a rather louche rakish playboy figure' - at a dinner party and he proposed that evening. She said yes and India was born the next year (when Sabiha was just l8), but the marriage was short-lived. </p> <p>Sabiha stayed in Brussels working as a translator while India was looked after by her paternal grandparents. Then Sabiha met Andrew Knight, who was the Economist 's man in Brussels, and later its editor. India recalls her mother coming back from lunch at the Ritz one day and saying 'Look!' and showing her an engagement ring, and saying they were moving to London. India was sorry to leave her grandparents but thrilled to leave Belgium. 'Belgium is stultifying, stupefying, so even aged nine I quite fancied the idea of getting out.' </p> <p> She spoke no English so went to the French Lyc\u00e9e but was expelled at l3 for truancy and shoplifting. She and her friend would spend the morning at the Natural History Museum looking at dinosaurs, then wander down to Harrods for a little light shoplifting. Eventually a classmate snitched, and India was summoned to a great family conference with her father, stepfather and mother all asking why she did it. 'I said, \"Oh I was bored\", and then I thought: This is really very feeble, I must come up with an excuse so I invented this whole existential angst.' </p> <p>She was bundled off to boarding school, Wycombe Abbey, which of course she found bizarre. She made good friends, but never got used to the cold dormitories and only being allowed to have seven things on the top of your dressing table. She was expelled eventually for smoking pot, but managed to win an exhibition to Cambridge to read modern languages. </p> <p>All this time she made regular duty visits to her father in Belgium, but he acquired a new wife whom she found 'absurd - and unfortunately I began to see him as absurd'. Anyway she had transferred her affection to her stepfather, Andrew Knight, and to her two half-sisters. So it was a terrible shock when he and her mother split up when she was 25. Her mother went on to marry the architect Norman Foster, but the marriage only lasted four years. India remains on good terms with Knight - he took her on a family holiday to Mustique recently - but in her novel there is a poignant scene where the stepfather talks of his 'first grandson', ignoring her two sons. </p> <p>Her real father is now in his eighties, 'completely gaga', living in a home in the Ardennes. India is his only child. 'It's a nightmare! I wish he had other children. I'm going to have to arrange the funeral, talk at it, and I barely knew him.' </p> <p>After such a disrupted childhood, and then the 'loss' of her stepfather, she was desperately keen to get settled and rushed into marriage very young, at 25. 'I wanted to have my own home, I wanted to be married for ever - I took my wedding vows incredibly seriously.' She met her husband, Jeremy Langmead, when they were colleagues on the short-lived Mirabella magazine, and they had an office flirtation which turned into love on a Moroccan holiday. She became pregnant almost immediately and they had a full white wedding, with Sir Norman Foster giving her away. But in retrospect she thinks it all happened too quickly and Jeremy perhaps felt trapped. </p> <p>And they were soon embroiled in money troubles - India admits she is a disaster with money - buying an expensive house in Islington practically next door to the Blairs, and then having to sell after six months when they couldn't keep up the mortgage payments. </p> <p>Despite this, the marriage was good for several years, but then not, and My Life on a Plate covers its dying days. Here we get on to difficult ground. Most novelists have the get-out that their characters are invented so of course it isn't their marriage they're writing about. But it's more complicated in India's case because her novel is based on her column, which was not fiction. And as she is quite clearly 'Clara' in the novel, it seems natural to assume that Jeremy Langmead is Robert, the husband, who frankly seems a cold fish. </p> <p>India says piously, 'The husband in the book isn't Jeremy, and he is crueller than Jeremy.' So it's all right to call him a cold fish? 'Arguably completely frigid, yes.' But why doesn't he ever explain what he's thinking? 'Jeremy is witty and charming, but quite closed. Originally it was intriguing. I mean I'm all surface, my family are all surface, everybody shouts at each other. And he was the opposite of that, and I thought it was wonderful, all this elegant English reserve.' </p> <p>But because the husband in the novel is so mysterious and reserved, we never understand why he suddenly decides to walk out of the marriage. There is no other person involved - nor was there in real life, India insists. The rumour was that Jeremy Langmead was bisexual all along and left her for a man, but she says that is absolutely not true. 'He was faith ful throughout our marriage, we had a very vigorous and happy sex life, we have two children, and what he's done since_ Well, ask him.' [I did but he wouldn't play - or rather, he did play - he said he was just off to watch some lapdancers at Stringfellow's.] </p> <p>But, as she says, marriages do just peter out, for no particular reason, and that's what she wanted to show in the novel: 'If something's not horrible but it's barely satisfactory and you're kind of chugging along, neither of you having a very nice time, then - I'm trying to suggest in the book - maybe you should call it a day. You don't need a crisis, you don't need to find your husband in bed with someone, you don't need to be betrayed in some horrific way - things can just peter out. And it's not the end of the world, is what I wanted to say.' </p> <p>Anyway, she and Jeremy remain friends. She showed him chunks of My Life on a Plate as she wrote it, and 'he was fine about it. He said it made him sad. He told my mother it was like a map of where things went wrong and he was seeing the map properly for the first time. But he also honked which was the main idea!' </p> <p>In the novel, Clara soon finds consolation in the shape of a ballet dancer called Dunphy. In real life, India's consolation is the novelist Andrew O'Hagan. They meet every day and she thinks they will eventually live together, and have children. But, she reminds me, she is not yet divorced, and 'it's a bit too modern for me to have children while married to someone else.' </p> <p>She has already signed up for novel number two, in which Clara will be living with Dunphy. She still writes a newspaper column but her ambition now is to be a full-time novelist because 'It's a really great way of earning money! You write the book, and that's quite fun, sitting at the computer in your pyjamas honking. And then other countries buy it and film people come along and give you money and it is completely bliss.'</p>",

Some poor benighted customs officer once had the temerity to stop India and her mother and ask to search their baggage - they responded by suing HM Customs and Excise for false imprisonment and 'slander by conduct'. Actually, she isn't India Knight at all - her real name is something hideous and Belgian but she changed it by deed poll at 13. She chose India because her mother is - not Indian actually, but Pakistani - and Knight because it was the name of her then stepfather. Her early life is so complicated it would never be believed in a novel. She was born in Brussels in l965, and her first language was French. Her mother, Begum Sabiha, had fled from an arranged marriage in Pakistan to university in the States, and then to Brussels, where she met India's father - 'a rather louche rakish playboy figure' - at a dinner party and he proposed that evening. She said yes and India was born the next year (when Sabiha was just l8), but the marriage was short-lived. Sabiha stayed in Brussels working as a translator while India was looked after by her paternal grandparents. Then Sabiha met Andrew Knight, who was the Economist 's man in Brussels, and later its editor. India recalls her mother coming back from lunch at the Ritz one day and saying 'Look!' and showing her an engagement ring, and saying they were moving to London. India was sorry to leave her grandparents but thrilled to leave Belgium. 'Belgium is stultifying, stupefying, so even aged nine I quite fancied the idea of getting out.' She spoke no English so went to the French Lyc\u00e9e but was expelled at l3 for truancy and shoplifting. She and her friend would spend the morning at the Natural History Museum looking at dinosaurs, then wander down to Harrods for a little light shoplifting. Eventually a classmate snitched, and India was summoned to a great family conference with her father, stepfather and mother all asking why she did it. 'I said, \"Oh I was bored\", and then I thought: This is really very feeble, I must come up with an excuse so I invented this whole existential angst.' She was bundled off to boarding school, Wycombe Abbey, which of course she found bizarre. She made good friends, but never got used to the cold dormitories and only being allowed to have seven things on the top of your dressing table. She was expelled eventually for smoking pot, but managed to win an exhibition to Cambridge to read modern languages. All this time she made regular duty visits to her father in Belgium, but he acquired a new wife whom she found 'absurd - and unfortunately I began to see him as absurd'. Anyway she had transferred her affection to her stepfather, Andrew Knight, and to her two half-sisters. So it was a terrible shock when he and her mother split up when she was 25. Her mother went on to marry the architect Norman Foster, but the marriage only lasted four years. India remains on good terms with Knight - he took her on a family holiday to Mustique recently - but in her novel there is a poignant scene where the stepfather talks of his 'first grandson', ignoring her two sons. Her real father is now in his eighties, 'completely gaga', living in a home in the Ardennes. India is his only child. 'It's a nightmare! I wish he had other children. I'm going to have to arrange the funeral, talk at it, and I barely knew him.' After such a disrupted childhood, and then the 'loss' of her stepfather, she was desperately keen to get settled and rushed into marriage very young, at 25. 'I wanted to have my own home, I wanted to be married for ever - I took my wedding vows incredibly seriously.' She met her husband, Jeremy Langmead, when they were colleagues on the short-lived Mirabella magazine, and they had an office flirtation which turned into love on a Moroccan holiday. She became pregnant almost immediately and they had a full white wedding, with Sir Norman Foster giving her away. But in retrospect she thinks it all happened too quickly and Jeremy perhaps felt trapped. And they were soon embroiled in money troubles - India admits she is a disaster with money - buying an expensive house in Islington practically next door to the Blairs, and then having to sell after six months when they couldn't keep up the mortgage payments. Despite this, the marriage was good for several years, but then not, and My Life on a Plate covers its dying days. Here we get on to difficult ground. Most novelists have the get-out that their characters are invented so of course it isn't their marriage they're writing about. But it's more complicated in India's case because her novel is based on her column, which was not fiction. And as she is quite clearly 'Clara' in the novel, it seems natural to assume that Jeremy Langmead is Robert, the husband, who frankly seems a cold fish. India says piously, 'The husband in the book isn't Jeremy, and he is crueller than Jeremy.' So it's all right to call him a cold fish? 'Arguably completely frigid, yes.' But why doesn't he ever explain what he's thinking? 'Jeremy is witty and charming, but quite closed. Originally it was intriguing. I mean I'm all surface, my family are all surface, everybody shouts at each other. And he was the opposite of that, and I thought it was wonderful, all this elegant English reserve.' But because the husband in the novel is so mysterious and reserved, we never understand why he suddenly decides to walk out of the marriage. There is no other person involved - nor was there in real life, India insists. The rumour was that Jeremy Langmead was bisexual all along and left her for a man, but she says that is absolutely not true. 'He was faith ful throughout our marriage, we had a very vigorous and happy sex life, we have two children, and what he's done since_ Well, ask him.' [I did but he wouldn't play - or rather, he did play - he said he was just off to watch some lapdancers at Stringfellow's.] But, as she says, marriages do just peter out, for no particular reason, and that's what she wanted to show in the novel: 'If something's not horrible but it's barely satisfactory and you're kind of chugging along, neither of you having a very nice time, then - I'm trying to suggest in the book - maybe you should call it a day. You don't need a crisis, you don't need to find your husband in bed with someone, you don't need to be betrayed in some horrific way - things can just peter out. And it's not the end of the world, is what I wanted to say.' Anyway, she and Jeremy remain friends. She showed him chunks of My Life on a Plate as she wrote it, and 'he was fine about it. He said it made him sad. He told my mother it was like a map of where things went wrong and he was seeing the map properly for the first time. But he also honked which was the main idea!' In the novel, Clara soon finds consolation in the shape of a ballet dancer called Dunphy. In real life, India's consolation is the novelist Andrew O'Hagan. They meet every day and she thinks they will eventually live together, and have children. But, she reminds me, she is not yet divorced, and 'it's a bit too modern for me to have children while married to someone else.' She has already signed up for novel number two, in which Clara will be living with Dunphy. She still writes a newspaper column but her ambition now is to be a full-time novelist because 'It's a really great way of earning money! You write the book, and that's quite fun, sitting at the computer in your pyjamas honking. And then other countries buy it and film people come along and give you money and it is completely bliss.'",

Their hero is the sensible-shoed, sacked manager of Britain's leading bookseller's Deansgate store. </p> <p>Robert Topping, a 43-year-old with an alarming look of Harry Potter about him, is appealing against dismissal for refusing to reduce stock levels and increase focus on bestsellers. He is one of five managers who have dug their heels in. 'They don't have confidence in books,' says Topping of his former bosses. 'They don't have people who read books, who love books.' </p> <p>The enemy is Waterstone's managing director David Kneale, nicknamed 'The Mekon' by Private Eye. Topping accuses Kneale (whose last job was running Boots) of the low crime - at least in the book world - of 'analytical business procedures'. </p> <p>Will Self, the bad-boy novelist who pitched the debate into the public eye on Radio 4, says the policy will lead to 'cultural impoverishment' and 'wall-to-wall pulp'. He is not alone in this view. Michael Frayn says he was grateful for the loyalty of managers such as Topping when his novels, before the Booker-nominated Headlong , sold 'modestly'. 'I have done readings in Manchester as I imagine most authors have. I think that most of the big book stores are well-run and have a huge range of books. But people like the personal view and the strength is in the manager knowing his customers and his books.' </p> <p>He says he makes a point of buying books from a tiny, independent shop around the corner. </p> <p>Fay Weldon - who buys her books from Amazon.com or Waterstone's in Hampstead - says it was inevitable that independents would suffer once the Net Book Agreement was abolished. 'Books Etc opened a new store near us and within five weeks the existing book shop went out of business. Books are rather a funny stock to have. They take up a lot of space. They have to shift them quickly and there are so many of them. You can see why this is happening. </p> <p>'People think that if you remove controls, everything gets better and cheaper but that only happens in the short term. They drive out competition as they did in the music industry and then put prices back up.' </p> <p>Nicci Gerrard, co-author of Beneath the Skin as Nicci French, fears harsh economics will kill off diversity. 'It is all about market forces and pure capitalism. The little things should be able to flourish. It is all about the Harry Potter environment in which the winner takes all. It is a terrible thing for readers and for writers.' </p> <p>There is a deep irony in the corduroy-wearing protesters: here is Waterstone's, sweeper-away of small, independent stores, in trouble itself. And it is not only Waterstone's. The giant book chains and internet retailers have been accused of squeezing small local bookshops out of business. </p> <p>The book trade is being forced to face harsh facts. Kneale says fewer people go into bookshops than did so two years ago. Half of the titles Waterstone's buys from a choice of 2,000 new books every week never sell a single copy. According to Trevor Goul-Wheeker, managing director of mid-market high-street rival, Hammicks, 60 per cent of the population never visits a book store at all. </p> <p>But demonstrations? Who would have thought it until now? Certainly not the wider public, who read about huge advances paid to almost anybody from students at posh public schools to ex-journalists from Leeds and mockney-lad chefs. Harry Potter racks up more than a million orders even before the name of his latest adventure is announced. Helen Fielding is feted in Hollywood for creating the sad, self-obsessed but very ordinary Bridget Jones. </p> <p>The public could be forgiven for thinking the world of books is second only to the Premiership when it comes to soaraway, cash-fuelled success for those with the talent to make the first team. </p> <p>But this business is no beautiful game. It is more like a big, fat duck: apparently cutting serenely through calm water, the book trade is paddling furiously under the surface to stay afloat. </p> <p>The row at Waterstone's has for the first time given the wider public a glimpse of what those in the industry have known for some time: the good old days when publishers milked retailers, retailers milked the consumer and everybody had a high old time are over. </p> <p>UK book sales in 1990 were \u00a32.1 billion. In 1999, sales were, at most, \u00a31.9bn. From the attack on Waterstone's to the less widely registered but just as damaging admissions by the chain's owner, HMV Media, that all is not well on the financial front, the customer is suddenly aware that for all the big, new book store space, something is definitely wrong. </p> <p>David Kneale admits as much. He reels off reasons for the chain's recent decline in profits. These include, predictably, the advent of the internet and the demise of the Net Book Agreement which has led to heavy discounting of the most profitable titles. </p> <p>The rest of the industry, however, seems to think the problem begins and ends with Waterstone's. Publishers whinge that the one-time friend of the literati has sold out to the masses. Agents say (or, rather, whisper) that the poor authors have nowhere to go and are being bullied by publishers who slash fees to give retailers tempting discounts. </p> <p>'When I walk into a bookshop I feel like packing up and going home,' says Jo Frank of AP Watt. 'It is extraordinary that publishers publish so many titles. So many of the books just look the same. It is a wonder how anything ever sells.' </p> <p>Kneale says they are all being foul to Waterstone's because it is still the market leader, despite its flimsy balance sheet, and because the entire universe as they knew it has been stood on its head. </p> <p>'The market is undergoing significant structural and technological change and Waterstone's has to change as well. Customers want different things now.' </p> <p>The publishers had it easy for a long time. They sold large numbers of advance copies because retailers, unable to predict all but the most obvious bestsellers, did not want to run out of books and wait for new print runs. Improved technology means retailers are no longer so worried about restocking. They have better systems for returning books that sell badly. </p> <p>But there are other issues. As Alan Giles, chief executive of HMV Media, moaned this year: 'It tells you something about the quality of the book market, when the Who Wants to be a Millionaire quiz book flies off the shelves.' And people now expect to see these popular hits at anything up to 50 per cent off. </p> <p>Kneale admits to reducing the quantity of individual titles, but insists Waterstone's is extending the quality by extending the range, helped by a \u00a36m investment in new systems which enable it to spot the 50 per cent of new titles that never sell a single copy. They are not ditched entirely, he says, but are cut back to one copy instead of several. </p> <p>'We are no longer a dumping ground for publishers,' he exclaims, adding: 'That will really endear me to all those people who don't like Waterstone's already.' </p> <p>The retailers shoulder some of the blame. They have over-stretched themselves by building mega-stores with football-pitch scale floorspaces at a time when footfall is down. Those people who are entering these palaces have different expectations to their counterparts in the Eighties when Waterstone's gained hero status for stocking 30,000 titles. </p> <p>In those days, customers accepted a wait of up to three weeks for any but the best-known titles. And they did not expect a bargain. Nowadays, Waterstone's stocks 80,000 titles and WH Smith (which sold Waterstone's two years ago) stocks 30,000. </p> <p>Neither can keep abreast of the internet. Amazon, for all its share-price slump, can still beat the lot when it comes to price and accessibility. Only a virtual bookstore can stock a sizeable fraction of the 1.2 million books in print at any one time. </p> <p>David Young, chief executive of publishers Little,Brown, says the net has totally transformed the book landscape. There is no arguing with that. Stephen King published an e-book, Riding the Bullet , and at $2 a hit made a small fortune within weeks. </p> <p>Big businesses are deemed beautiful and the larger chains have merged to stay viable in books as they have in banking. The net also means price transparency: it means Harry Potter at \u00a38 instead of nearly \u00a315 in the shops. </p> <p>Imagine this 10 years ago: retailers discounting brand new, popular stock by up to 50 per cent instead of the books that were difficult to shift off the shelves. Odd, isn't it? It is more than odd. It is positively ridiculous, says Young. The consumer has never had it so good, he proclaims. </p> <p>There are still voices struggling to trumpet brightness above the gloom, including the Bookseller, whose news editor Danuta Kean says: 'I would be concerned to see anything in writing that said the book market has hit the floor.' Well, yes, possibly. But she admits that back lists are not doing well and that there are too many big shops with too much floor space to sustain a sluggish market. </p> <p>The industry hides behind the complexity of performance figures upon which nobody will agree. Whoever you believe, the growing consensus is that there is simply too much floorspace given over to books in this country. There are too many titles for a limited reading public to sustain. </p> <p>Kean patiently explains that books are not like any other kind of retail market. They cannot be compared with clothes or shoes. </p> <p>Forgive those of us looking into the new mega-bookshops-cum-bars from the outside if we don't quite appreciate the nice differences. In a modern marketplace with no fixed prices and ever-efficient technology, any trade that celebrates sales of 100,000 units as a triumph looks a little bit shaky. </p> <p>The painful truth is that books are a business as well as an art form and, until they can get a Lottery grant, the retailers are going to do more and more to incur the wrath of Topping and his band of well-read supporters. </p> <p><strong>A tale of two bookshops</strong></p> <p><strong> Waterstone's</strong> </p> <p>203 Piccadilly </p> <p>London W1 </p> <p>Tel: 020 7581 2400 </p> <p><strong> Opened</strong> Nearly 10 months ago. </p> <p><strong> Shop size</strong> The biggest book shop in Europe, 67,000 square feet. </p> <p><strong> Turnover</strong> Can't say as hasn't been running for a full year.

      "body": "<p>These were the dog days all right, these last flyblown days of August. Her maternal goodwill was worn threadbare. This was the nadir of Dorrie's year, all this holiday flesh needing to be tended and shameless bad temper on display. </p> <p>She was sitting at a table in the unshaded barbecue area by the pool over a cup of terrible coffee. And yet it was supposed to be the annual high water mark, their summer fortnight, particularly this year when they had rejected camping or self-catering in favour of splashing out on a room in this value-for-money family hotel. </p> <p>'You really are a stupid little boy. You're really pushing your luck,' said the man at the next table to one of the three children sitting with him. 'I want to see that burger finished now. Can't you for once in your whole life...' </p> <p>His voice was quiet and venomous. What was he doing here alone with his children? It must be the same as Max was doing with their three now, playing crazy golf to give her some time to herself. This man's wife was probably just round the corner over just such another cup of coffee. Was she too feeling panic at not making good use of that dear-bought commodity, solitude? </p> <p>'If you don't do what I say right now, there'll be no ice cream. No swimming. No puppet show. I mean it.' </p> <p>The small boy beside him started to cry into his burger, wailing and complaining that his teeth hurt. </p> <p>'And don't think you're going to get round me like that,' snarled the man. 'I'm not your mother, remember!' </p> <p>All over the place, if you listened, you could hear the steady exasperated undertone of the unglamorously leisure-clad parents teasing their tempestuous egomaniacal little people into, for example, eating that sandwich up 'or I tell you what, and you're being very silly, but you won't be going to the Treasure Island club tonight and I mean it.' It stuck in her throat, the bread of the weeping child. The parents said nothing to each other, except the names of sandwich fillings. She and Max were the same, they couldn't talk over, under or round the children and so it turned them sour and obdurate in each other's company. They held each other at night in bed but again could say or do nothing for fear of their children beside them, sleeping like larks, like clean-limbed breathing fruit. </p> <p>She sipped and grimaced and watched the snail's progress of the combine harvester on the adjacent cliff. There was a splash as someone jumped into the pool, and a flapping over wasps and a dragging round of high chairs to plastic tables, and howls, groaning and broken-hearted sobbing, the steady cacophony which underscores family life en masse. At least sitting here alone she had been noticing the individual elements of the composition, she realised with surprise and some pleasure. When she was with her brood she noticed nothing of the outside world, they drank up all her powers of observation. </p> <p>Here they came now, off the crazy golf course, tear-stained, drooping, scowling. Here comes the big bore, and here comes the three little bores. Stifle your yawns. Smile. On holiday Max became a confederate, saying things like 'They never stop' and 'That child is a cannibal'. Their constant crystalline quacking, demanding a response, returning indefatigable and gnat-like, drove him mad. There must be something better than this squabbly nuclear family unit, she thought, these awful hobbling five- and six-legged races all around her. </p> <p>She could see they were fighting. She saw Martin hit Robin, and Robin clout him back. It was like being on holiday with Punch and Judy - lots of biffing and shrieking and fights over sausages. What a lumpen, moping, tearful, spiritless mummy she had become, packing and unpacking for everybody endlessly, sighing. Better sigh, though, than do as she'd done earlier that day, on the beach, when, exasperated by their demands, on and on, all afternoon, she'd stood up and held out her hands to them. </p> <p>'Here, have some fingers,' she'd snarled, pretending to snap them off one by one. 'Have a leg. Have an ear. Nice?' And they had laughed uproariously, jumping on her and pinning her to the rug, sawing at her limbs, tugging her ears, uprooting her fingers and toes. Such a figure she cut on the beach these days - slumped, round-shouldered in the middle of the family encampment of towels, impatience on a monument growling at the sea. Or was it Mother Courage of the sand dunes, the slack-muscled white body hidden under various cover-ups, headgear, dark glasses, crouched amid the contents of her cart, the buckets, wasp spray, suncream, foreign legion hats with neck-protective flaps, plastic football, beach cricket kit, gaggle of plastic jelly sandals, spare dry swimsuits, emergency pants. If she lumbered off for a paddle all hell broke lose. </p> <p>'Did you have a nice time?' she said weakly as they reached her table. </p> <p>Martin was shrieking about some injustice, his father's face was black as thunder. Robin sprinted to her lap, then Maxine and Martin jumped on her jealously, staking their claim like settlers in some virgin colony. </p> <p>'She's not your long-lost uncle, your mother,' said Max, unable to get near her. 'You only saw her half an hour ago.' </p> <p>Things got worse before they got better. There was a terrible scene later on. It was in the large room by the bar, the Family Room, where at six o'clock a holiday student surf fanatic led all the young children in a song and dance session while their parents sagged against the walls and watched. </p> <p>And a little bit of this <br> And a little bit of that <br> And shake your bum <br> Just like your mum </p> <p>sang the children, roaring with laughter as they mimed the actions. After this, glass lollipops were handed out, and then the surfer started to organise a conga. The children lined up, each holding the waist of the one in front, many of them with the lollipops still in their mouths, sticks stuck outwards. </p> <p>'That's dangerous,' murmured Dorrie. 'If they fell,' and she and other mothers discreetly coaxed the sweets from the mouths of their nearest offspring with earnest promises that these would be returned immediately once the dance had finished. Then she glanced across the room and saw Martin in the line, lollipop stick clamped between his teeth. Max just beyond him, sipping from his bottle of beer, caught her eye; she, without thinking as hard as she might have done, indicated to him the lollipop peril, miming and pointing. </p> <p>The conga had started, the music was blasting out, and yet when Max wrenched the stick from between Martin's clenched teeth the boy's screams were louder even than the very loudly amplified 'Birdy Song'. Martin broke out of the line and fought his father for the lollipop. Max, looking furious, teeth bared inside his dark beard, was a figure both ridiculous and distressing, like a giant Captain Haddock carried on out in the hall, where Max dragged Martin just as the conga was weaving past, with screaming and shouting and terrible fury between them. They were hating each other. </p> <p>Dorrie edged up to them, horror-struck, and the next thing was that Max was shouting at her. All right, it was their first day, they were all tired from the journey, but this was dreadful. The other parents, following the conga, filtered past interestedly watching this scene. </p> <p>'Don't, don't, don't,' said Dorrie several times, but softly. The other two children joined them, sobbing. </p> <p>At last she got them all past reception and up the stairs. </p> <p>'I don't like you, Daddy,' wailed Martin through tears. </p> <p>'I know you don't, Martin,' huffed Max, storming off ahead. </p> <p>Really, he was very like Martin, or Martin was very like him - both prone to explosions of aggressive self-defensiveness - although of course Martin was six, whereas Max was 40. Because Max did this, she had to do the opposite in order to redress the balance, even though doing so made her look weak and ineffective. He sometimes pointed this out, her apparent ineffectiveness. But what would he rather? That she scream at them like a fishwife? Hit them? Vent her temper or ignore them, like a man? Let them get hurt? Let them eat rubbish? Let them watch junk? Just try doing it all the time before you criticise, not only for a few hours or days, she reflected, as she reined herself in and wiped tears from blubbing faces and assisted with the comprehensive noise-blowing that was needed in the wake of such a storm. </p> <p>At least he didn't hit them when he lost his temper. She had a friend whose husband did, and then justified it with talk of them having to learn, which she, Dorrie, could not have borne. She really would much rather be on her own with them, it was much easier like that. Like a skilled stage manager she had learned how to create times of sweetness and light with the three of them; she could now coax and balance the various jostling elements into some sort of precarious harmony. It was an art, like feeding and building a good log fire, an achievement. Then in Max would clump, straightways seizing the bellows or the poker, and the whole lot would collapse in ruins. </p> <p>'I'll get them to bed, Max,' she said. 'Why don't you go for a swim or something.' </p> <p>'I'll wait for you in the bar,' he said frostily. 'Remember they stop serving dinner at eight.' </p> <p>'Yes.' </p> <p>'Don't forget to turn the listening service on.' </p> <p>'No.' </p> <p>'I know when I'm not wanted.' </p> <p>She choked down her reply, and gently closed the door behind him. </p> <p>'Now then,' she said, smiling at their doleful tear-smeared faces. 'What's up? You look as though you've swallowed a jellyfish!' </p> <p>They looked at her, goggling with relief, and laughed uncertainly. </p> <p>'Two jellyfish!' she said, with vaudeville mirth. </p> <p>They laughed harder. </p> <p>'And an octopus!' she added. </p> <p>They fell on the floor, they were laughing so hard. </p> <p>The second day was an improvement on the first, although, as Dorrie said to herself, that would not have been difficult. They turned away from the glare of the packed beach towards leafy broken shade, walking inland along a lane whose hedges were candy-striped with pink and white bindweed. A large dragonfly with marcasite body and pearlised wings appeared in the air before them and stopped them in their tracks. Then they struck off across a path through fields where sudden clouds of midges swept by without touching them. When they reached a stream overarched by hawthorn trees the children clamoured to take off their sandals and dip their feet in the water. </p> <p>'This is the place for our picnic,' said Dorrie, who had brought supplies along in a rucksack, and now set about distributing sandwiches and fruit and bottles of water. </p> <p>'We can't walk across the strand today,' said Max, consulting his copy of the Tide Tables as he munched away at a ham roll. 'Low tide was earlier this morning, then not again till nine tonight. Fat lot of good that is. But tomorrow looks possible.' </p> <p>He had heard about an island not far from here which, once a day, for a short time only, became part of the mainland. When the tide was out you could walk across the strand to the island and visit the ancient cell of the hermit who had lived centuries before in the heart of its little woods. </p> <p>'There doesn't seem to be any logic to it,' said Dorrie, looking over his shoulder at the week's chart. 'No pattern to the tides, no gradual waxing and waning as with the moon. I thought the tides were supposed to be governed by the moon, but they're all over the place.' </p> <p>The children sat by them, each with a bag of crisps, nibbling away busily like rodents. </p> <p>'There is a pattern, though,' said Max. 'When there's a new moon or an old moon, the tides are at their highest and also at their lowest. It's all very extreme at those times of the month, when the earth, moon and sun are directly in line.' </p> <p>Martin, having finished his own bag of crisps, was now busily capturing ants from the grass and dropping them into his sister's bag. </p> <p>'Don't do that,' said Dorrie. </p> <p>'And when the moon's at right angles to the sun, that's when you get neap tides,' continued Max. 'Less extreme, less dramatic. What the hell's the matter now?' </p> <p>Maxine had been trying to pull her bag of crisps away from Martin, who had suddenly let go, with the result that Maxine's crisps had flown into the air and over the grass, where Martin was now rolling on them and crushing them into salty fragments. </p> <p>'Stop it!' called Dorrie. </p> <p>'Get up this minute!' shouted Max. </p> <p>'Why should I, it's a free country,' gabbled Martin, rolling back and forth, enjoying the noise and drama. </p> <p>'My crisps!' sobbed Maxine. 'They're all squashed!' </p> <p>'What's your problem,' said Martin with spiteful pleasure, getting up as his father approached, and brushing yellow crumbs from his shorts. 'You threw them away, so that means you didn't want them.' </p> <p>'I didn't throw them away!' screamed Maxine. </p> <p>'Liar, I saw you,' goaded Martin. 'I saw you throw them in the air. Little liar.' </p> <p>Maxine howled, scarlet in the face, struggling with her mother, who was trying to hold her, while Martin ran off out of range, dancing on the spot and leering and taunting. </p> <p>'Why is he such a poisonous little tick?' said Max, though without his usual fury. </p> <p>On their way back to the hotel they passed a camp-site, and stopped by the gate to read its painted sign. </p> <p>'Families and mixed couples only,' Maxine read aloud. 'What does that mean, Mum? What are mixed couples? Mum? Mum?' </p> <p>'I'm not sure,' said Dorrie. She was reminded of her parents' description of looking for somewhere to rent when they first came to London, with the signs up in the windows reading 'No Blacks, No Irish' and her father with his Dublin accent having to keep quiet for a change and let her mother do the talking. </p> <p>'Why do you suppose they want mixed couples only?' she murmured to Max. 'Why should they worry about gayness?' </p> <p>'I don't think it's that,' said Max. 'I think it's more to put off the 18 to 30 element; you know, bikers and boozing and gangs getting into fights.' </p> <p>'You 20 years ago,' said Dorrie. </p> <p>'Martin in 10 years' time,' said Max. </p> <p>'What's a couple?' persisted Maxine. 'What's a couple, Dad?' </p> <p>'A couple here means a man and a woman,' said Max. </p> <p>'Oo-a-ooh!' exclaimed Martin, giving Maxine a lewd nudge in the ribs and rolling his eyes. </p> <p>'A husband and wife,' said Dorrie deflatingly. </p> <p>'So a couple's like a family?' said Maxine. </p> <p>'Yes,' said Dorrie. </p> <p>'No,' said Max. 'A couple is not like a family. That's far too easy, just two people. It doesn't qualify.' </p> <p>Dorrie was laughing now, and put her arms round his waist, her head on his shoulder. He kissed the top of her head and stroked her hair. The three children stood round looking at them with big smug smiles, beaming with satisfaction. </p> <p>'Come in for a hug,' said Dorrie, holding out her arm to them, and they all five stood rocking by the side of the road locked into an untidy, squawking clump. </p> <p>'You're looking well,' said Max, gazing at her that evening across their mackerel pt\u00e9 and the bud vase holding the miniature yellow carnations. 'You've caught the sun. It suits you.' </p> <p>'It was a good walk today,' said Dorrie, suddenly shy. </p> <p>'They're lovely but they're very tiring,' said Max, draining his glass of beer. 'Exhausting. You should be more selfish.' </p> <p>How can I, thought Dorrie, until you are less so? It's a see-saw. But she kept quiet. He went on to talk about the timberyard, how it was doing all right but they couldn't afford to rest on their laurels with all these small businesses going down all round them. </p> <p>'We're a team,' declared Max, grandiose, pouring another glass for them both. </p> <p>'Ye-es,' said Dorrie. 'But it's a bit unbalanced, don't you think, the teamwork, at the moment?' </p> <p>'Are you saying I don't work hard enough?' demanded Max. </p> <p>'Of course not,' said Dorrie. 'You work too hard. Don't be silly. No, I meant, you do all the work that gets somewhere and gives you something to show for the effort and pulls in money, but the work I do doesn't seem to get anywhere, it doesn't show, it somehow doesn't count even though it needs doing of course.' </p> <p>'I don't see what you're driving at,' said Max, starting to look less cheerful. </p> <p>'I don't know,' said Dorrie. 'At the moment I feel sub. Sub something.' </p> <p>'Suburban?' suggested Max. </p> <p>'Subordinate?' said Dorrie. 'No.' </p> <p>'Submerged, then. How about submerged?' </p> <p>'That's nearer. Still not quite_ I know! Subdued. Though submerged is growing on me. Submerged is accurate too. That time at Marks, all my twenties, half my thirties, it's like a dream. I've almost forgotten what it used to be like.' </p> <p>And she tried to explain to Max her feelings about this encroaching blandness, adaptability, passivity, the need for one of them at least to embrace these qualities, even if this made them shudder, if the family was going to work. </p> <p>'We all have to knuckle down,' he said. 'Sooner or later.' </p> <p>'It's just it seems, some of us more than others.' </p> <p>'If we want to join in at all,' opined Max. 'Life. It's called growing up.' </p> <p>'It doesn't feel like growing up,' she muttered from her side of the fence. Rather it felt like being freeze-dried and vacuum-packed. Knuckled down was putting it mildly. </p> <p>'Well,' as I said, whatever you're feeling like, you're looking well,' said Max; and that made them both feel better. </p> <p>'Lovely, in fact,' he added, leaning across to touch her face meaningfully. </p> <p>In bed that night surrounded by their sleeping children, they held each other and started to kiss with increasing warmth. He grabbed shamelessly between her legs, her body answered with an enthusiastic twist, a backward arch, and soon he was inside her. There must be no noise, and she had pulled the sheet up to their necks. Within a couple of minutes they were both almost there, together, when there came a noise from Martin's bed. </p> <p>'Mum,' he said sleepily, and flicked his lamp on. 'Mum, I'm thirsty.' </p> <p>Max froze where he was and dropped his head and swore beneath his breath. Martin got out of bed and padded over towards them. </p> <p>'Did you hear me, Mum?' he asked crossly. 'I want some water. Now.' </p> <p>Dorrie was aware of her hot red face looking up from under Max's, and heard herself say, 'In a minute, dear. Go back to bed now, there's a good boy.' Martin paused to stare at them, then stumbled over back towards his bed. </p> <p>'Do you think he's been traumatised?' she whispered to Max, mortified, cheated of the concentrated pleasure which had been seconds away, the achievement of it, the being made whole. </p> <p>'Do I think he's been traumatised?' growled Max incredulously, rolling off her. </p> <p>'Where's your sense of humour?' she murmured in his ear, but he pulled away and turned his back on her. She didn't blame him. </p> <p>Their third day's adventure was planned by Max. They were going to cross the strand and explore the hermit's island. Today the tide was out at a reasonable time of the morning and the sun was up too. They stood and gazed across the shining sands at the exposed island, which was now, for an hour or so only, part of the mainland. </p> <p>'It's further than I thought,' said Dorrie. 'It looks well over a mile. Maybe two.' </p> <p>'Half a mile at most,' said Max heartily. 'Let's get going, remember we're racing the tide. Come on you lot, shoes and socks in the boot.' </p> <p>'I think they should wear their plastic sandals,' said Dorrie. 'I can see stones. Weed.' </p> <p>'Nonsense,' said Max. 'Lovely sand, skipping across the golden sand. Don't fuss, don't spoil it all with fussing.' </p> <p>'Skippety skip,' sang Robin. </p> <p>'I still think,' said Dorrie. </p> <p>'Give us a break,' said Max. </p> <p>'I'm not wearing my jellies,' said Martin. 'No way.' </p> <p>'No way,' echoed Maxine. </p> <p>When they started walking they were less downright, but by then it was too late. The gleaming silver-pink sand was knotted with wormcasts which made the children shudder, and studded with pebbles, and sharp-edged broken shells, which made them wince and squawk. </p> <p>'Come on,' called Max, striding ahead on his prime-of-life leathery soles. 'We've got to keep moving if we're going to be there and back in time. Or we'll be cut off.' </p> <p>Dorrie helped the children round the weeds, through ankle-deep seawater rivulets blue as the sky above, clucking, and lifting, and choking down irritation at the thought of the plastic sandals back in the boot. </p> <p>'You were right, Mum,' groaned Martin mournfully. 'I wish I'd worn them.' </p> <p>'So do I,' said Maxine, picking her way like a cross hen. </p> <p>'So do I,' wept Robin, who was walking on tiptoe, as though that might spare his soft pink feet the wormcasts, and slowing them all down considerably. </p> <p>'Come on,' yelled Max, a couple of hundred yards ahead. </p> <p>'We can't,' yelled Dorrie, who was by now carrying Robin across her front. </p> <p>It felt desperate, like the retreat from Moscow or something. Trust Max to engineer a stressful seaside event, trust Max to inject a penitential flavour into the day. They were by now half a mile out; it would be mad to go on and dismal to turn back. The sun was strong but muffled by haze, and the sky glared with the blanched fluorescence of a shaving light. </p> <p>'What's all the fuss about?' said Max, having unwillingly rejoined them. </p> <p>'I think we'll have to turn back,' said Dorrie. 'Look at the time. Even if we make it to the island we won't be able to explore, we'll have to turn round and come straight back and even then we'd be cutting it fine. Why don't you go alone, darling, you're quicker on your own.' </p> <p>'You always have to spoil it, don't you?' said Max, furious as a child. 'You never want anything I plan to work.' </p> <p>'Their feet hurt,' pleaded Dorrie. 'Don't let's quarrel in front of them.' </p> <p>'Robin, you'll come with me, won't you?' said Max, squatting down beside his son. 'I'll give you a piggyback.' </p> <p>'Max,' said Dorrie. 'It's nearly midday, it's not safe, why don't you go ahead with the camera and take photos so we'll all be able to see the hermit's house when the film's developed.' </p> <p>'Robin?' said Max. </p> <p>'I don't know what to choose,' said Robin, looking from his father to his mother and back again. He was out of his depth. </p> <p>Dorrie felt anger bulge up as big as a whale surfacing, but breathed it down and said again, 'Take the camera, darling, that way we'll all see the secret island,' and hung the camera round his neck. She made herself kiss him on the cheek. He looked at her suspiciously. The children brightened. She forced herself to hug him. The children cheered. </p> <p>'All right,' he said at last, and set off across the wet sand, running simple and free as a Red Indian. </p> <p>'I didn't know what to say, Mum,' said Robin, spreading his hands helplessly. 'Daddy said go on, go with me, not Mummy. You said no. I felt splitted in half.' </p> <p>'It's all right,' said Dorrie. 'Now everybody's happy. Look at that seagull.' </p> <p>Above them, floating on a thermal, was a big, white, cruel-beaked bird. Seagulls were always larger than you expected, and had a chilly fierce look to them, without gaiety. She could barely speak for rage, but did not assign it much importance, so used was she by now to this business of ebb and flow. Who else, she wondered, could be living at such a pitch of passion as she in the midst of this crew; so uncontrolled, so undefended? </p> <p>Having poked around the hermit's mossy cell and raced the tide back, white-toothed wavelets snapping at his heels, Max was in a good mood for the rest of the day, and they all benefited. He felt he had achieved something. He had achieved something. He had conquered the island, he had patterned it with his footprints, he had written his name on the sandy floor of the hermit's very cell with his big toe. Next week he would show them the photographs to prove it. </p> <p>When the sun was low in the sky and the children were asleep, Max suggested to Dorrie that she should go for a walk on her own, just down to the beach below the hotel. </p> <p>'It'll do you good,' he said. </p> <p>He was going to sit by the bedroom's picture window in the half-dark with a beer, and would probably be able to make out her figure if the light didn't go too fast. </p> <p>'Are you sure you'll be all right?' she said. </p> <p>'Go on,' he snorted. 'Before I change my mind.' </p> <p>She walked down barefoot through the hotel gardens, across trim tough seaside turf bordered by white-painted palisades and recently watered fuchsia bushes. Then she turned on to the low cliff path which zigzagged down to the beach and felt the longer grass brush against her legs, spiky marram grass softly spangled in the dusk with pale flowers, sea pinks and thrift and white sea campion. </p> <p>Robin had had trouble getting to sleep that evening. Stay here, he had demanded tearfully, his hand on her arm; don't go. I won't go, she had said; close your eyes. She had stroked his temple with the side of her little finger. Gradually he had allowed himself to be lowered down, a rung at a time, towards the dark surface of sleep. He had given a tiny groan as she moved to get up, but he was too far gone to climb back. She had sat by him for a little longer, creaking with fatigue, looking at his quiet face, his still hand on her arm, savouring the deep romance and boredom of it. </p> <p>There were no buildings now between her and the beach except for this last snug cottage to her left, shedding light from its windows. She paused to look up at it. It must surely house an ideal family, sheltered and enclosed but with a view of the bay too. The father was reading his children a story, perhaps, while the mother brushed their hair. Where did this cosy picture come from? Not from her own childhood. She turned and walked down to the beach. </p> <p>It was lovely to stand barefoot, invisible in the deep dusk, a great generous moon in the sky and her feet at the edge of the Atlantic. She looked out over the broad bosom of the sea, melancholy and beautiful. As sailors' ghosts looked back on their drowned selves, dismantled, broken up, sighing like the sea for the collarbone lost somewhere around the equator, the metatarsi scattered across the Indian Ocean, so she wondered if there could ever be a reassembly of such scattered drowned bodies, a watery danse macabre on the wreckers' rocks beneath a full moon. Was it possible to reclaim the scattered-to-the-winds self? She was less afraid of death, or understood it a shade more, purely through coming near it each time she had had a baby; apart from that, this puzzle was to do with the loss of self that went with the process, or rather the awareness of her individuality as a troublesome excrescence. What she wanted to know was, was this temporary, like National Service used to be, or was it for good?</p> <p>She was filled with excitement at standing by the edge of the sea alone under the sky, so that she took great clear breaths of air and looked at the dimming horizon, opening her eyes wider as if that might help her to see more. It filled her with courage and made her want to sing, something Irish or Scottish, sad and wild and expressive of this, and of how it was thrilling, being alive and not dead.</p> <p>When she turned back across the beach, away from the water, it was dark. She reached the edge of the beach, where it met the rocks and turf above, and started to climb back. A bat bounced past her ear as she crossed the bridge over the stream; then the dust of the earth path was beneath her feet again. As she walked on she looked at the cottages built on the hills around the bay, their windows yellow lozenges of enclosed warmth in the night.</p> <p>Now she was walking back past the house she had envied on the way down, the house which was so secure and self-sufficient with its warm, lit windows and snug family within. And from this house came the wailing of a child, a desolate hopeless noise. On and on it went, the wailing, steady and miserable, following her up the path. Her throat tightened and her eyes prickled; she called herself every sort of fool as she trudged on; she physically ached to pick up and hold the child, to tell it there there, then smooth it down and stroke its hand until it slept. The comfortless noise continued, not a baby's crying but the sobbing of a child. No child should be left to cry like that, she thought, ambushed by pity; and - in a rage - people aren't bloody well nice enough to their children!</p> <p>Don't be so soft, came the advice; crying never did any harm, you can't allow them to run the show or where will that land you? Let them take themselves to hell, those hard hearts who leave their children to cry themselves to sleep alone, and in hell they will have to listen to the sound of a child crying and know that they can never comfort it. That was what Dorrie was thinking as she climbed back up the hill.</p> <p>\u0095 Helen Simpson's Hey Yeah Right Get a Life is published by Cape (\u00a315.99) in October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "These were the dog days all right, these last flyblown days of August. Her maternal goodwill was worn threadbare. This was the nadir of Dorrie's year, all this holiday flesh needing to be tended and shameless bad temper on display. She was sitting at a table in the unshaded barbecue area by the pool over a cup of terrible coffee. And yet it was supposed to be the annual high water mark, their summer fortnight, particularly this year when they had rejected camping or self-catering in favour of splashing out on a room in this value-for-money family hotel. 'You really are a stupid little boy. You're really pushing your luck,' said the man at the next table to one of the three children sitting with him. 'I want to see that burger finished now. Can't you for once in your whole life...' His voice was quiet and venomous. What was he doing here alone with his children? It must be the same as Max was doing with their three now, playing crazy golf to give her some time to herself. This man's wife was probably just round the corner over just such another cup of coffee. Was she too feeling panic at not making good use of that dear-bought commodity, solitude? 'If you don't do what I say right now, there'll be no ice cream. No swimming. No puppet show. I mean it.' The small boy beside him started to cry into his burger, wailing and complaining that his teeth hurt. 'And don't think you're going to get round me like that,' snarled the man. 'I'm not your mother, remember!' All over the place, if you listened, you could hear the steady exasperated undertone of the unglamorously leisure-clad parents teasing their tempestuous egomaniacal little people into, for example, eating that sandwich up 'or I tell you what, and you're being very silly, but you won't be going to the Treasure Island club tonight and I mean it.' It stuck in her throat, the bread of the weeping child. The parents said nothing to each other, except the names of sandwich fillings. She and Max were the same, they couldn't talk over, under or round the children and so it turned them sour and obdurate in each other's company. They held each other at night in bed but again could say or do nothing for fear of their children beside them, sleeping like larks, like clean-limbed breathing fruit. She sipped and grimaced and watched the snail's progress of the combine harvester on the adjacent cliff. There was a splash as someone jumped into the pool, and a flapping over wasps and a dragging round of high chairs to plastic tables, and howls, groaning and broken-hearted sobbing, the steady cacophony which underscores family life en masse. At least sitting here alone she had been noticing the individual elements of the composition, she realised with surprise and some pleasure. When she was with her brood she noticed nothing of the outside world, they drank up all her powers of observation. Here they came now, off the crazy golf course, tear-stained, drooping, scowling. Here comes the big bore, and here comes the three little bores. Stifle your yawns. Smile. On holiday Max became a confederate, saying things like 'They never stop' and 'That child is a cannibal'. Their constant crystalline quacking, demanding a response, returning indefatigable and gnat-like, drove him mad. There must be something better than this squabbly nuclear family unit, she thought, these awful hobbling five- and six-legged races all around her. She could see they were fighting. She saw Martin hit Robin, and Robin clout him back. It was like being on holiday with Punch and Judy - lots of biffing and shrieking and fights over sausages. What a lumpen, moping, tearful, spiritless mummy she had become, packing and unpacking for everybody endlessly, sighing. Better sigh, though, than do as she'd done earlier that day, on the beach, when, exasperated by their demands, on and on, all afternoon, she'd stood up and held out her hands to them. 'Here, have some fingers,' she'd snarled, pretending to snap them off one by one. 'Have a leg. Have an ear. Nice?' And they had laughed uproariously, jumping on her and pinning her to the rug, sawing at her limbs, tugging her ears, uprooting her fingers and toes. Such a figure she cut on the beach these days - slumped, round-shouldered in the middle of the family encampment of towels, impatience on a monument growling at the sea. Or was it Mother Courage of the sand dunes, the slack-muscled white body hidden under various cover-ups, headgear, dark glasses, crouched amid the contents of her cart, the buckets, wasp spray, suncream, foreign legion hats with neck-protective flaps, plastic football, beach cricket kit, gaggle of plastic jelly sandals, spare dry swimsuits, emergency pants. If she lumbered off for a paddle all hell broke lose. 'Did you have a nice time?' she said weakly as they reached her table. Martin was shrieking about some injustice, his father's face was black as thunder. Robin sprinted to her lap, then Maxine and Martin jumped on her jealously, staking their claim like settlers in some virgin colony. 'She's not your long-lost uncle, your mother,' said Max, unable to get near her. 'You only saw her half an hour ago.' Things got worse before they got better. There was a terrible scene later on. It was in the large room by the bar, the Family Room, where at six o'clock a holiday student surf fanatic led all the young children in a song and dance session while their parents sagged against the walls and watched. And a little bit of this And a little bit of that And shake your bum Just like your mum sang the children, roaring with laughter as they mimed the actions. After this, glass lollipops were handed out, and then the surfer started to organise a conga. The children lined up, each holding the waist of the one in front, many of them with the lollipops still in their mouths, sticks stuck outwards. 'That's dangerous,' murmured Dorrie. 'If they fell,' and she and other mothers discreetly coaxed the sweets from the mouths of their nearest offspring with earnest promises that these would be returned immediately once the dance had finished. Then she glanced across the room and saw Martin in the line, lollipop stick clamped between his teeth. Max just beyond him, sipping from his bottle of beer, caught her eye; she, without thinking as hard as she might have done, indicated to him the lollipop peril, miming and pointing. The conga had started, the music was blasting out, and yet when Max wrenched the stick from between Martin's clenched teeth the boy's screams were louder even than the very loudly amplified 'Birdy Song'. Martin broke out of the line and fought his father for the lollipop. Max, looking furious, teeth bared inside his dark beard, was a figure both ridiculous and distressing, like a giant Captain Haddock carried on out in the hall, where Max dragged Martin just as the conga was weaving past, with screaming and shouting and terrible fury between them. They were hating each other. Dorrie edged up to them, horror-struck, and the next thing was that Max was shouting at her. All right, it was their first day, they were all tired from the journey, but this was dreadful. The other parents, following the conga, filtered past interestedly watching this scene. 'Don't, don't, don't,' said Dorrie several times, but softly. The other two children joined them, sobbing. At last she got them all past reception and up the stairs. 'I don't like you, Daddy,' wailed Martin through tears. 'I know you don't, Martin,' huffed Max, storming off ahead. Really, he was very like Martin, or Martin was very like him - both prone to explosions of aggressive self-defensiveness - although of course Martin was six, whereas Max was 40. Because Max did this, she had to do the opposite in order to redress the balance, even though doing so made her look weak and ineffective. He sometimes pointed this out, her apparent ineffectiveness. But what would he rather? That she scream at them like a fishwife? Hit them? Vent her temper or ignore them, like a man? Let them get hurt? Let them eat rubbish? Let them watch junk? Just try doing it all the time before you criticise, not only for a few hours or days, she reflected, as she reined herself in and wiped tears from blubbing faces and assisted with the comprehensive noise-blowing that was needed in the wake of such a storm. At least he didn't hit them when he lost his temper. She had a friend whose husband did, and then justified it with talk of them having to learn, which she, Dorrie, could not have borne. She really would much rather be on her own with them, it was much easier like that. Like a skilled stage manager she had learned how to create times of sweetness and light with the three of them; she could now coax and balance the various jostling elements into some sort of precarious harmony. It was an art, like feeding and building a good log fire, an achievement. Then in Max would clump, straightways seizing the bellows or the poker, and the whole lot would collapse in ruins. 'I'll get them to bed, Max,' she said. 'Why don't you go for a swim or something.' 'I'll wait for you in the bar,' he said frostily. 'Remember they stop serving dinner at eight.' 'Yes.' 'Don't forget to turn the listening service on.' 'No.' 'I know when I'm not wanted.' She choked down her reply, and gently closed the door behind him. 'Now then,' she said, smiling at their doleful tear-smeared faces. 'What's up? You look as though you've swallowed a jellyfish!' They looked at her, goggling with relief, and laughed uncertainly. 'Two jellyfish!' she said, with vaudeville mirth. They laughed harder. 'And an octopus!' she added. They fell on the floor, they were laughing so hard. The second day was an improvement on the first, although, as Dorrie said to herself, that would not have been difficult. They turned away from the glare of the packed beach towards leafy broken shade, walking inland along a lane whose hedges were candy-striped with pink and white bindweed. A large dragonfly with marcasite body and pearlised wings appeared in the air before them and stopped them in their tracks. Then they struck off across a path through fields where sudden clouds of midges swept by without touching them. When they reached a stream overarched by hawthorn trees the children clamoured to take off their sandals and dip their feet in the water. 'This is the place for our picnic,' said Dorrie, who had brought supplies along in a rucksack, and now set about distributing sandwiches and fruit and bottles of water. 'We can't walk across the strand today,' said Max, consulting his copy of the Tide Tables as he munched away at a ham roll. 'Low tide was earlier this morning, then not again till nine tonight. Fat lot of good that is. But tomorrow looks possible.' He had heard about an island not far from here which, once a day, for a short time only, became part of the mainland. When the tide was out you could walk across the strand to the island and visit the ancient cell of the hermit who had lived centuries before in the heart of its little woods. 'There doesn't seem to be any logic to it,' said Dorrie, looking over his shoulder at the week's chart. 'No pattern to the tides, no gradual waxing and waning as with the moon. I thought the tides were supposed to be governed by the moon, but they're all over the place.' The children sat by them, each with a bag of crisps, nibbling away busily like rodents. 'There is a pattern, though,' said Max. 'When there's a new moon or an old moon, the tides are at their highest and also at their lowest. It's all very extreme at those times of the month, when the earth, moon and sun are directly in line.' Martin, having finished his own bag of crisps, was now busily capturing ants from the grass and dropping them into his sister's bag. 'Don't do that,' said Dorrie. 'And when the moon's at right angles to the sun, that's when you get neap tides,' continued Max. 'Less extreme, less dramatic. What the hell's the matter now?' Maxine had been trying to pull her bag of crisps away from Martin, who had suddenly let go, with the result that Maxine's crisps had flown into the air and over the grass, where Martin was now rolling on them and crushing them into salty fragments. 'Stop it!' called Dorrie. 'Get up this minute!' shouted Max. 'Why should I, it's a free country,' gabbled Martin, rolling back and forth, enjoying the noise and drama. 'My crisps!' sobbed Maxine. 'They're all squashed!' 'What's your problem,' said Martin with spiteful pleasure, getting up as his father approached, and brushing yellow crumbs from his shorts. 'You threw them away, so that means you didn't want them.' 'I didn't throw them away!' screamed Maxine. 'Liar, I saw you,' goaded Martin. 'I saw you throw them in the air. Little liar.' Maxine howled, scarlet in the face, struggling with her mother, who was trying to hold her, while Martin ran off out of range, dancing on the spot and leering and taunting. 'Why is he such a poisonous little tick?' said Max, though without his usual fury. On their way back to the hotel they passed a camp-site, and stopped by the gate to read its painted sign. 'Families and mixed couples only,' Maxine read aloud. 'What does that mean, Mum? What are mixed couples? Mum? Mum?' 'I'm not sure,' said Dorrie. She was reminded of her parents' description of looking for somewhere to rent when they first came to London, with the signs up in the windows reading 'No Blacks, No Irish' and her father with his Dublin accent having to keep quiet for a change and let her mother do the talking. 'Why do you suppose they want mixed couples only?' she murmured to Max. 'Why should they worry about gayness?' 'I don't think it's that,' said Max. 'I think it's more to put off the 18 to 30 element; you know, bikers and boozing and gangs getting into fights.' 'You 20 years ago,' said Dorrie. 'Martin in 10 years' time,' said Max. 'What's a couple?' persisted Maxine. 'What's a couple, Dad?' 'A couple here means a man and a woman,' said Max. 'Oo-a-ooh!' exclaimed Martin, giving Maxine a lewd nudge in the ribs and rolling his eyes. 'A husband and wife,' said Dorrie deflatingly. 'So a couple's like a family?' said Maxine. 'Yes,' said Dorrie. 'No,' said Max. 'A couple is not like a family. That's far too easy, just two people. It doesn't qualify.' Dorrie was laughing now, and put her arms round his waist, her head on his shoulder. He kissed the top of her head and stroked her hair. The three children stood round looking at them with big smug smiles, beaming with satisfaction. 'Come in for a hug,' said Dorrie, holding out her arm to them, and they all five stood rocking by the side of the road locked into an untidy, squawking clump. 'You're looking well,' said Max, gazing at her that evening across their mackerel pt\u00e9 and the bud vase holding the miniature yellow carnations. 'You've caught the sun. It suits you.' 'It was a good walk today,' said Dorrie, suddenly shy. 'They're lovely but they're very tiring,' said Max, draining his glass of beer. 'Exhausting. You should be more selfish.' How can I, thought Dorrie, until you are less so? It's a see-saw. But she kept quiet. He went on to talk about the timberyard, how it was doing all right but they couldn't afford to rest on their laurels with all these small businesses going down all round them. 'We're a team,' declared Max, grandiose, pouring another glass for them both. 'Ye-es,' said Dorrie. 'But it's a bit unbalanced, don't you think, the teamwork, at the moment?' 'Are you saying I don't work hard enough?' demanded Max. 'Of course not,' said Dorrie. 'You work too hard. Don't be silly. No, I meant, you do all the work that gets somewhere and gives you something to show for the effort and pulls in money, but the work I do doesn't seem to get anywhere, it doesn't show, it somehow doesn't count even though it needs doing of course.' 'I don't see what you're driving at,' said Max, starting to look less cheerful. 'I don't know,' said Dorrie. 'At the moment I feel sub. Sub something.' 'Suburban?' suggested Max. 'Subordinate?' said Dorrie. 'No.' 'Submerged, then. How about submerged?' 'That's nearer. Still not quite_ I know! Subdued. Though submerged is growing on me. Submerged is accurate too. That time at Marks, all my twenties, half my thirties, it's like a dream. I've almost forgotten what it used to be like.' And she tried to explain to Max her feelings about this encroaching blandness, adaptability, passivity, the need for one of them at least to embrace these qualities, even if this made them shudder, if the family was going to work. 'We all have to knuckle down,' he said. 'Sooner or later.' 'It's just it seems, some of us more than others.' 'If we want to join in at all,' opined Max. 'Life. It's called growing up.' 'It doesn't feel like growing up,' she muttered from her side of the fence. Rather it felt like being freeze-dried and vacuum-packed. Knuckled down was putting it mildly. 'Well,' as I said, whatever you're feeling like, you're looking well,' said Max; and that made them both feel better. 'Lovely, in fact,' he added, leaning across to touch her face meaningfully. In bed that night surrounded by their sleeping children, they held each other and started to kiss with increasing warmth. He grabbed shamelessly between her legs, her body answered with an enthusiastic twist, a backward arch, and soon he was inside her. There must be no noise, and she had pulled the sheet up to their necks. Within a couple of minutes they were both almost there, together, when there came a noise from Martin's bed. 'Mum,' he said sleepily, and flicked his lamp on. 'Mum, I'm thirsty.' Max froze where he was and dropped his head and swore beneath his breath. Martin got out of bed and padded over towards them. 'Did you hear me, Mum?' he asked crossly. 'I want some water. Now.' Dorrie was aware of her hot red face looking up from under Max's, and heard herself say, 'In a minute, dear. Go back to bed now, there's a good boy.' Martin paused to stare at them, then stumbled over back towards his bed. 'Do you think he's been traumatised?' she whispered to Max, mortified, cheated of the concentrated pleasure which had been seconds away, the achievement of it, the being made whole. 'Do I think he's been traumatised?' growled Max incredulously, rolling off her. 'Where's your sense of humour?' she murmured in his ear, but he pulled away and turned his back on her. She didn't blame him. Their third day's adventure was planned by Max. They were going to cross the strand and explore the hermit's island. Today the tide was out at a reasonable time of the morning and the sun was up too. They stood and gazed across the shining sands at the exposed island, which was now, for an hour or so only, part of the mainland. 'It's further than I thought,' said Dorrie. 'It looks well over a mile. Maybe two.' 'Half a mile at most,' said Max heartily. 'Let's get going, remember we're racing the tide. Come on you lot, shoes and socks in the boot.' 'I think they should wear their plastic sandals,' said Dorrie. 'I can see stones. Weed.' 'Nonsense,' said Max. 'Lovely sand, skipping across the golden sand. Don't fuss, don't spoil it all with fussing.' 'Skippety skip,' sang Robin. 'I still think,' said Dorrie. 'Give us a break,' said Max. 'I'm not wearing my jellies,' said Martin. 'No way.' 'No way,' echoed Maxine. When they started walking they were less downright, but by then it was too late. The gleaming silver-pink sand was knotted with wormcasts which made the children shudder, and studded with pebbles, and sharp-edged broken shells, which made them wince and squawk. 'Come on,' called Max, striding ahead on his prime-of-life leathery soles. 'We've got to keep moving if we're going to be there and back in time. Or we'll be cut off.' Dorrie helped the children round the weeds, through ankle-deep seawater rivulets blue as the sky above, clucking, and lifting, and choking down irritation at the thought of the plastic sandals back in the boot. 'You were right, Mum,' groaned Martin mournfully. 'I wish I'd worn them.' 'So do I,' said Maxine, picking her way like a cross hen. 'So do I,' wept Robin, who was walking on tiptoe, as though that might spare his soft pink feet the wormcasts, and slowing them all down considerably. 'Come on,' yelled Max, a couple of hundred yards ahead. 'We can't,' yelled Dorrie, who was by now carrying Robin across her front. It felt desperate, like the retreat from Moscow or something. Trust Max to engineer a stressful seaside event, trust Max to inject a penitential flavour into the day. They were by now half a mile out; it would be mad to go on and dismal to turn back. The sun was strong but muffled by haze, and the sky glared with the blanched fluorescence of a shaving light. 'What's all the fuss about?' said Max, having unwillingly rejoined them. 'I think we'll have to turn back,' said Dorrie. 'Look at the time. Even if we make it to the island we won't be able to explore, we'll have to turn round and come straight back and even then we'd be cutting it fine. Why don't you go alone, darling, you're quicker on your own.' 'You always have to spoil it, don't you?' said Max, furious as a child. 'You never want anything I plan to work.' 'Their feet hurt,' pleaded Dorrie. 'Don't let's quarrel in front of them.' 'Robin, you'll come with me, won't you?' said Max, squatting down beside his son. 'I'll give you a piggyback.' 'Max,' said Dorrie. 'It's nearly midday, it's not safe, why don't you go ahead with the camera and take photos so we'll all be able to see the hermit's house when the film's developed.' 'Robin?' said Max. 'I don't know what to choose,' said Robin, looking from his father to his mother and back again. He was out of his depth. Dorrie felt anger bulge up as big as a whale surfacing, but breathed it down and said again, 'Take the camera, darling, that way we'll all see the secret island,' and hung the camera round his neck. She made herself kiss him on the cheek. He looked at her suspiciously. The children brightened. She forced herself to hug him. The children cheered. 'All right,' he said at last, and set off across the wet sand, running simple and free as a Red Indian. 'I didn't know what to say, Mum,' said Robin, spreading his hands helplessly. 'Daddy said go on, go with me, not Mummy. You said no. I felt splitted in half.' 'It's all right,' said Dorrie. 'Now everybody's happy. Look at that seagull.' Above them, floating on a thermal, was a big, white, cruel-beaked bird. Seagulls were always larger than you expected, and had a chilly fierce look to them, without gaiety. She could barely speak for rage, but did not assign it much importance, so used was she by now to this business of ebb and flow. Who else, she wondered, could be living at such a pitch of passion as she in the midst of this crew; so uncontrolled, so undefended? Having poked around the hermit's mossy cell and raced the tide back, white-toothed wavelets snapping at his heels, Max was in a good mood for the rest of the day, and they all benefited. He felt he had achieved something. He had achieved something. He had conquered the island, he had patterned it with his footprints, he had written his name on the sandy floor of the hermit's very cell with his big toe. Next week he would show them the photographs to prove it. When the sun was low in the sky and the children were asleep, Max suggested to Dorrie that she should go for a walk on her own, just down to the beach below the hotel. 'It'll do you good,' he said. He was going to sit by the bedroom's picture window in the half-dark with a beer, and would probably be able to make out her figure if the light didn't go too fast. 'Are you sure you'll be all right?' she said. 'Go on,' he snorted. 'Before I change my mind.' She walked down barefoot through the hotel gardens, across trim tough seaside turf bordered by white-painted palisades and recently watered fuchsia bushes. Then she turned on to the low cliff path which zigzagged down to the beach and felt the longer grass brush against her legs, spiky marram grass softly spangled in the dusk with pale flowers, sea pinks and thrift and white sea campion. Robin had had trouble getting to sleep that evening. Stay here, he had demanded tearfully, his hand on her arm; don't go. I won't go, she had said; close your eyes. She had stroked his temple with the side of her little finger. Gradually he had allowed himself to be lowered down, a rung at a time, towards the dark surface of sleep. He had given a tiny groan as she moved to get up, but he was too far gone to climb back. She had sat by him for a little longer, creaking with fatigue, looking at his quiet face, his still hand on her arm, savouring the deep romance and boredom of it. There were no buildings now between her and the beach except for this last snug cottage to her left, shedding light from its windows. She paused to look up at it. It must surely house an ideal family, sheltered and enclosed but with a view of the bay too. The father was reading his children a story, perhaps, while the mother brushed their hair. Where did this cosy picture come from? Not from her own childhood. She turned and walked down to the beach. It was lovely to stand barefoot, invisible in the deep dusk, a great generous moon in the sky and her feet at the edge of the Atlantic. She looked out over the broad bosom of the sea, melancholy and beautiful. As sailors' ghosts looked back on their drowned selves, dismantled, broken up, sighing like the sea for the collarbone lost somewhere around the equator, the metatarsi scattered across the Indian Ocean, so she wondered if there could ever be a reassembly of such scattered drowned bodies, a watery danse macabre on the wreckers' rocks beneath a full moon. Was it possible to reclaim the scattered-to-the-winds self? She was less afraid of death, or understood it a shade more, purely through coming near it each time she had had a baby; apart from that, this puzzle was to do with the loss of self that went with the process, or rather the awareness of her individuality as a troublesome excrescence. What she wanted to know was, was this temporary, like National Service used to be, or was it for good? She was filled with excitement at standing by the edge of the sea alone under the sky, so that she took great clear breaths of air and looked at the dimming horizon, opening her eyes wider as if that might help her to see more. It filled her with courage and made her want to sing, something Irish or Scottish, sad and wild and expressive of this, and of how it was thrilling, being alive and not dead. When she turned back across the beach, away from the water, it was dark. She reached the edge of the beach, where it met the rocks and turf above, and started to climb back. A bat bounced past her ear as she crossed the bridge over the stream; then the dust of the earth path was beneath her feet again. As she walked on she looked at the cottages built on the hills around the bay, their windows yellow lozenges of enclosed warmth in the night. Now she was walking back past the house she had envied on the way down, the house which was so secure and self-sufficient with its warm, lit windows and snug family within. And from this house came the wailing of a child, a desolate hopeless noise. On and on it went, the wailing, steady and miserable, following her up the path. Her throat tightened and her eyes prickled; she called herself every sort of fool as she trudged on; she physically ached to pick up and hold the child, to tell it there there, then smooth it down and stroke its hand until it slept. The comfortless noise continued, not a baby's crying but the sobbing of a child. No child should be left to cry like that, she thought, ambushed by pity; and - in a rage - people aren't bloody well nice enough to their children! Don't be so soft, came the advice; crying never did any harm, you can't allow them to run the show or where will that land you? Let them take themselves to hell, those hard hearts who leave their children to cry themselves to sleep alone, and in hell they will have to listen to the sound of a child crying and know that they can never comfort it. That was what Dorrie was thinking as she climbed back up the hill. \u0095 Helen Simpson's Hey Yeah Right Get a Life is published by Cape (\u00a315.99) in October.",

      "body": "<p>Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter will never eat lunch in that town again, not at Morton's, not at Spago. He may as well forget about the top tables of Washington DC too. </p> <p>Joe Eszterhas has never followed the rules, but this time he may have broken one too many - he's dishing the dirt on the real-life escapades of movie stars and politicians in a controversial new book sure to titillate and embarrass in equal measure when it is published in America in a fortnight. </p> <p> American Rhapsody , described as a work of fantasy , is strictly embargoed but the few who have seen it say that it is as racy as Eszterhas's $3 million Basic Instinct script. It has already infuriated Hollywood insiders who see it as a craven act of betrayal by a revenge-seeking has-been, down on his luck after a series of embarrassing flops. </p> <p>The book has also sparked a furore in political and literary circles, its blend of fact and fiction providing some ill-timed discomfort for Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush, not to mention Bill Clinton, whose impeachable intimacies inspire pages of narrative debate between the President and his penis, named 'Willard' - or so we're told. </p> <p>Other famous private parts are also writ large in the Eszterhas oeuvre, but no one is as cruelly exposed as his former friend Sharon Stone who first found fame with the infamous crotch shot dreamt up for her by Eszterhas in Basic Instinct . </p> <p>Stone is portrayed as a dope-smoking and power-obsessed manipulator whose apparent talent on many of Hollywood's more luxurious casting couches catapulted her to stardom - and even into the arms of the amorous President, fantasises Eszterhas. But if none of that titillates the scandal-weary, the salacious detail and bitchy, bitter barbs make up for it. </p> <p>'Sharon was straddling my back with her legs, moving up and down. I noticed she wasn't wearing any underwear,' writes Eszterhas in a scene which claims to show Stone's tactics for winning a rewrite of a sex scene in Sliver at a meeting in a Four Seasons Hotel suite with director Phillip Noyce. 'Noyce was gaping at us, his eyes huge, splotches now on his black t-shirt. He stared at the two of us for a few seconds, then said to Sharon in a flat, dull tone, \"Do the scene how you want.\"' </p> <p>His imagination doesn't stop there: 'Sharon's knowledge of power was elemental, primal, learned in modelling sessions, casting couches and the back rooms of shadowy, back-lighted discos in Milan and Buenos Aires.' Or this supposed comment from one of Stone's former agents: 'We used to have a saying among us at the agency: \"Put Sharon in the room alone with the director and she'll close the deal.\"' </p> <p>Ouch, and what else but a terse 'no comment' from Stone's publicist, Cheryl Meisel. Eszterhas's other high-profile targets aren't talking either, as the August issue of Tina Brown's struggling Talk magazine hits the newsstands with exclusive excerpts from the book. </p> <p>The players who are exposed by Eszterhas include a veritable A-Z of scandal-sheet regulars: Warren Beatty, Richard Gere, Michael Douglas, Farrah Fawcett, movie mogul David Geffen, producer Robert Evans, former Clinton aide James Carville, Hustler proprietor Larry Flynt and Monica Lewinsky. </p> <p>'Everyone is mad at him, and no one wants to legitimise his words by commenting on them,' says Jeannette Walls, critically acclaimed author of Dish: the Inside Story on the World of Gossip . 'Hollywood is closing ranks. It's simply verboten to say anything against the Hollywood power people, especially the ones who made you a multimillionaire. He's written his own career death sentence with this one, and his name is mud.' </p> <p>After burning brightly for more than a decade with box-office hits Flashdance , Jagged Edge and Basic Instinct , Eszterhas's star had burnt out following a string of embarrassingly bad movies, among them the notorious Showgirls . </p> <p>'Let's face it, all of his recent movies have been real stinkers, I mean, laugh- out loud bad,' says Walls. 'He'd become a parody of himself. I guess he felt he had nothing to lose; he'd already alienated a lot of important people.' </p> <p>The Hollywood establishment had good reason to fear the worst from the big-mouthed, big-buck screenwriter, a man already infamous for fighting the high and mighty. Eszterhas challenged Sylvester Stallone to a fight when the actor rewrote his screenplay for F.I.S.T. ; he had even publicly humiliated Mike Ovitz by leaking details of a meeting that revealed the power-mad, vindictive nature of the once all-powerful 'super agent'. 'Everyone has been nervous about this book for months,' a Hollywood publicist told me. 'This is a guy that loves to aim below the belt.' </p> <p>Part journalistic expos\u00e9, part naughty novel, American Rhapsody is being spun as a creative by-product of a massive mid-life crisis, coinciding neatly as it did two years ago with news of Clinton's 'inappropriate relationship' with the star-struck White House intern. </p> <p>Exiling himself in Hawaii to 'clean out' his life after years of drug use and sexual excess, the 56-year-old former Rolling Stone journalist began to recognise himself in Bill Clinton, whom he describes as America's first rock'n'roll president. 'I understand absolutely his lifelong obsession with his penis and where that led him in his private life,' Eszterhas says. 'For many years of my own life, I had that same obsession.' </p> <p>Struck by the extent to which Clinton-era Washington had come to resemble Hollywood, Eszterhas had found the plot for his own comeback in the Lewinsky scandal. The President, he writes, was more Hollywood mogul than politician, conducting his affairs much like the early studio bosses with young starlets or Seventies rock stars with their panty-throwing groupies. </p> <p>'The only place where I'd seen a cigar inserted in related fashion was in grandly decadent movie producer Robert Evans's mink-rugged bedroom,' reminisces Eszterhas in one of the book's more lurid passages. 'And even in Bob's inner chamber of horrifying pleasure, it wasn't in real life; it was in the photograph up on the wall... it was easy to visualise [Clinton] hanging out in Evans's bedroom with Jack Nicholson, sharing a joint and watching as a magician twirled a girl around and around, C-notes coming out of her every orifice.' </p> <p>Even Ezsterhas admits that the 'twisted little man' inside him, 'the crude, insulting little prick' was 'hallucinating, daydreaming, wet-dreaming, projecting' as he wrote his brazen book - providing all who appear in its pages with cause to dismiss it. 'He's pissing poison into the pond that spawned him,' says one Hollywood agent who's seen the galleys. 'What he cannot establish as fact he simply makes up.' </p> <p>Relying on fictional 'first-person' monologues to get inside his subjects, Eszterhas has pushed the boundaries of non-fiction even further than controversial Reagan biographer Edmund Morris. In Dutch, Morris imagines himself as a number of different fictional narrators who knew the former President at different times in his life. </p> <p>Publisher Alfred Knopf Inc, which plans a 200,000 initial print run for American Rhapsody, admits the book 'flouts virtually every rule'. But it also contends that Eszterhas 'combines comprehensive research with insight, honesty and astute observation to reveal ultimate truths'. Apparently the book's British publishers, Fourth Estate, didn't share the same editorial vision - it pulled out of the Eszterhas deal fearing libel suits. </p> <p> Talk is putting a brave face on the deal, despite the perception that it was born of desperation. 'It gives the message they'll run anything for a circulation boost,' says New York University media pundit Toby Miller. 'You have to wonder: where is the wisdom in risking the wrath of Hollywood when you're dependent on it? It's not like this book contains a scoop of any significance.' </p> <p>'Don't tell me, I know the ending already,' says Ted Casablancas, a Hollywood watcher at E! Online. 'It's like the sequel to the Julia Phillips story. You know, once-powerful producer comes out of rehab, can't find work, so pens a tell-all, in her case the prescient You'll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again . You know what she's doing now?

Gone, I guess, with the wind that swirls away crumpled, discoloured tissues. Perhaps it was such elegiac musings which made Isherwood, who returned to his early diaries in 1971 and rewrote them, decide not to publish Lost Years after all. He was between projects, fumbling to find a way ahead. Eventually, he abandoned this memoir and applied its method of scrutinising the past to his Berlin sojourn in Christopher and His Kind, published in 1976.</p> <p>Isherwood's executor, Don Bachardy, and the editor Katherine Bucknell have brushed aside his scruples, arguing that Lost Years should be published because it was 'never completed but also never destroyed'. With its exhausting tally of binges, blow-jobs and buggery, the book will make tongues wag for a while, but will do no good to Isherwood's literary reputation.</p> <p>Or am I fussing about fuddy-duddy values? Isherwood's publishers sell him as a personality and claim that Lost Years establishes his credentials as a 'hero of gay liberation', like a spry, tanned version of Quentin Crisp. This ploy may guarantee him a secure niche in the market, but it ignores his achievements in the decade before he decamped to America in 1939: his rancorous anatomy of England in All the Conspirators and The Memorial, or the Berlin stories with their pitiless account of fascism and the private moral compromises it entailed.</p> <p>Except for Prater Violet - a mordant account of filming an operetta while Vienna disintegrates, completed just before these diaries begin - nothing Isherwood wrote in the second half of his life was as good. Once settled in Los Angeles, he toiled on tawdry Hollywood scripts. To survive, he deceived himself: he assured friends that Lana Turner would be plausible as Diane de Poitiers, or that Gregory Peck could impersonate Dostoevsky.</p> <p>When not at work, he boozed, brawled and generally disgraced himself, once incontinently piddling on a sofa after he passed out at Charlie Chaplin's house. He also had prodigious quantities of sex, both indoors and alfresco. There were long-term affairs, but his lovers were always supplemented by a repertory company of fuck buddies. Some interim arithmetic early in this book concludes that he has had 400 partners so far (and of course he was still counting).</p> <p>Periodically he sought to purge himself by retreating to a Vedanta Center, for him the celestial equivalent of a fat farm. Some of the years in question were lost to drink, and much of the sex had also been effaced when Isherwood tried to recall it. Sex, after all, is repetitious, even when you factor in the variants he relished. Referring to himself in the third person - a tactic which conveniently enables him to disown responsibility for his younger self - Isherwood sums up Christopher's affair with one particular cloneable blond: 'I suppose they sucked cock and rimmed each other.' (I omit the footnote which explains the latter practice, though if you're mystified, wait for the reference to Somerset Maugham below.)</p> <p>He has no 'detailed memories' at all of his sexual sessions with Auden, which lasted intermittently from 1926 to 1938; he assumes they wrestled. The multiple partners merge, occasionally salvaged from the 'dark backward and abysm' (no, I am not alluding to a bodily zone) by some special quirk. One boy has 'an unusually small cock', but the ecumenical Christopher is 'no size queen'. Another boasts 'big, firm, hotly inviting buttocks'.</p> <p>Mostly the owners of these appendages lack heads. Either their backs are turned, or their faces are foraging below waist level. Certain coital feats are unforgettable, even through the temporal fog. Isherwood unwisely sodomised his lover Bill Caskey in Mexico. Caskey was suffering from a typical touristic ailment, and Christopher, as he puts it, 'hit the jackpot'. Back in Los Angeles, he and Caskey took possession of a new home by performing an act of 'sexual magic'. Christopher, as Isherwood reports, 'fucked him in every room of the apartment'.</p> <p>This turns out to be less heroic than it sounds. There were only five rooms to baptise, and Isherwood admits that separate orgasms were not required, just 'five stickings-in and pullings-out'. Even so, you can see why Chaplin worried about spillage on the furniture when Isherwood came calling. If it all sounds pornographic, then perhaps that was Isherwood's purpose: the enforced, elderly rekindling of bygone lusts.</p> <p>Sometimes, actual sex couldn't do it for him, and he had to switch on a blue movie in his head. Because Jim Charlton is too coy 'to play-act at the stud in bed', Christopher has to improvise a scenario. 'With Jim's cock inside him, he told himself: \"The big fighter pilot was naked on top of him, raping him, fucking the shit out of him\" etc, etc.' On a return trip to England in the frigid winter of 1947, he 'wrote a hard-core story about a sailor whose nickname was \"Dynamite\". Getting horny was a way of raising his body temperature - until he lowered it again by jacking off.' There you have the short, nihilistic story of sex itself, encapsulated in a law of thermodynamics.</p> <p>In this welter of semen, it's surprising to find the odd encounter which is not coital. At a party given by George Cukor for Somerset Maugham, Christopher witnesses 'a truly classic display of ass licking'. This, as it happens, is merely metaphorical; Isherwood is referring to another guest's craven flattery of Maugham. Likewise, when he meets No\u00ebl Coward, Christopher has 'his ass tickled by a master'. Again, the transaction is metaphorical, since Coward has just told him that he resembles Lawrence of Arabia.</p> <p>Friends sometimes asked Isherwood if he'd made a pact with the devil. He liked to assume that they were referring to his 'Peter Pannish' adolescent looks, and smirked triumphantly. Wasn't he, after all, supposedly 'the best lay on the Pacific coast'? Didn't one of the partners he shared with Spender say he was better in bed than Stephen, because he conducted you down from orgasm as well as up to it? But Mephistopheles destroyed Faust by granting his wishes - for prolonged youth, and for sex with Helen of Troy. It is dangerous for a writer to have too much fun, and even Isherwood regrets the quiet, private mornings when he might have worked on a book, if only he hadn't been hungover or still entangled with a pick-up from the night before.</p> <p>In Enemies of Promise, Cyril Connolly mentioned 'the pram in the hall' as one of the obstacles to literary achievement. Isherwood, who here nastily excoriates his mother as 'the matriarch-cunt' when she pleads for grandchildren, never had to fear the distraction of domesticity. But the plethora of nubile Bobs, Bills, Chucks, Jakes, Jims, Randys and Toms proved to be as troublesome as a heterosexual writer's brood of babies. Isherwood lost more than a few years in California. He also, as this sad and rather shaming book makes clear, mislaid his gift.</p>",

This turns out to be less heroic than it sounds. There were only five rooms to baptise, and Isherwood admits that separate orgasms were not required, just 'five stickings-in and pullings-out'. Even so, you can see why Chaplin worried about spillage on the furniture when Isherwood came calling. If it all sounds pornographic, then perhaps that was Isherwood's purpose: the enforced, elderly rekindling of bygone lusts. Sometimes, actual sex couldn't do it for him, and he had to switch on a blue movie in his head. Because Jim Charlton is too coy 'to play-act at the stud in bed', Christopher has to improvise a scenario. 'With Jim's cock inside him, he told himself: \"The big fighter pilot was naked on top of him, raping him, fucking the shit out of him\" etc, etc.' On a return trip to England in the frigid winter of 1947, he 'wrote a hard-core story about a sailor whose nickname was \"Dynamite\". Getting horny was a way of raising his body temperature - until he lowered it again by jacking off.' There you have the short, nihilistic story of sex itself, encapsulated in a law of thermodynamics. In this welter of semen, it's surprising to find the odd encounter which is not coital. At a party given by George Cukor for Somerset Maugham, Christopher witnesses 'a truly classic display of ass licking'. This, as it happens, is merely metaphorical; Isherwood is referring to another guest's craven flattery of Maugham. Likewise, when he meets No\u00ebl Coward, Christopher has 'his ass tickled by a master'. Again, the transaction is metaphorical, since Coward has just told him that he resembles Lawrence of Arabia. Friends sometimes asked Isherwood if he'd made a pact with the devil. He liked to assume that they were referring to his 'Peter Pannish' adolescent looks, and smirked triumphantly. Wasn't he, after all, supposedly 'the best lay on the Pacific coast'? Didn't one of the partners he shared with Spender say he was better in bed than Stephen, because he conducted you down from orgasm as well as up to it? But Mephistopheles destroyed Faust by granting his wishes - for prolonged youth, and for sex with Helen of Troy. It is dangerous for a writer to have too much fun, and even Isherwood regrets the quiet, private mornings when he might have worked on a book, if only he hadn't been hungover or still entangled with a pick-up from the night before. In Enemies of Promise, Cyril Connolly mentioned 'the pram in the hall' as one of the obstacles to literary achievement. Isherwood, who here nastily excoriates his mother as 'the matriarch-cunt' when she pleads for grandchildren, never had to fear the distraction of domesticity. But the plethora of nubile Bobs, Bills, Chucks, Jakes, Jims, Randys and Toms proved to be as troublesome as a heterosexual writer's brood of babies. Isherwood lost more than a few years in California. He also, as this sad and rather shaming book makes clear, mislaid his gift.",

      "body": "<p>There are two versions of southern Florida. There is the one sold in the tourist brochures, a place of coral gardens and dolphins, of alligators and teeming swamps, heritage trails and gallery-hopping. And there is Carl Hiaasen's version. </p> <p>Hiaasen is the blazing conscience of the sunshine state, the chronicler of property developers masquerading as gangsters and gangsters masquerading as property developers, of bent politicians and judges, of drug wars and theme-park murders. In his version, Florida is a place ruled by 'ribbon snippers' and ruined by 'greedheads'. P.J. O'Rourke once observed that the only thing more likely to kill Florida's tourist trade than reading Carl Hiaasen was a visit there. </p> <p>It wasn't always so. When Hiaasen first came down here as a boy 40 years ago from his home near Fort Lauderdale, it was the kind of paradise described in the brochures. 'Being able to move to the Keys was a dream I had ever since I was five years old,' he says, bright-eyed. 'The first time my dad brought me here we stayed in this tiny little place called Tarpon Lodge and I remember running out to the dock with my grandfather and looking down over the side and seeing snappers and barracuda and parrot fish. It was all so beautiful, and I thought if I ever swing it, if I ever get lucky enough, this is where I would like to raise a family.' </p> <p>Five years ago, Hiaasen got lucky enough to buy a little slice of his boyhood. Sitting outside his house, with its unbroken views of Florida Bay, a path leading down to a mooring where his neat skiff is tied, a fish eagle perched on top of his boathouse, you could easily convince yourself that the remembered paradise still exists. Hiaasen writes here most days, brings his new baby down to watch the porpoises playing around the dockside in the early morning, takes the boat out to fish at dusk. </p> <p>To reach his little Nirvana, however, you have to flog down from Miami past the tattoo parlours and the pet grooming salons and the T-shirt halls of fame, past the salmon-pink motels with their Texaco garage (circa 1970) architecture, past the inevitable Denny's and Wendy's, the marinas and condos and malls that crowd the ribbon of land between Interstate 1 and the sea. Islamorada - the name means purple isles - is, in the tourist board's judgment, the sports fishing capital of the world. On a bad day, though, Hiaasen sees his home town simply as a 'urination stop' for the occupants of several thousand hire cars on the road to the original Margaritaville, Keywest. </p> <p>One of Hiaasen's editors once described his decision to move down here as being akin to keeping a bedside vigil with a dying relative. You could say that he has a love-hate relationship with his home state, the central character in his novels, but that would be underplaying it. 'Florida is my life,' he said. 'If I had any sense at all, I'd have baled out a long time ago. I guess it's a place I believe is worth fighting for and worth fighting about. So I stayed.' </p> <p>Hiaasen does his scrapping with the greatest possible panache. In his celebrated muckraking newspaper column in the Miami Herald , he chooses his targets carefully and fillets them mercilessly. 'I live for jumping on crooked politicians,' he says. In the recent past, his subjects have included a district attorney accused of biting a stripper in a go-go lounge, a junkie judge who fuelled his habit with $30,000 bribes from the FBI, and the state governor who oversaw a dozen squad cars being sent to arrest the rap group 2LiveCrew for their inflammatory lyrics. </p> <p>Those scumbags who don't make it into his column tend to crop up one way or another in his novels. Hiaasen is the author of eight hellish, hilarious visions of tropical greed and excess, the ultimate beach reading. The latest, Sick Puppy , has a typically extravagant plot involving a dognapping and a rogue rhino, a drive-by eco-warrior exacting savage revenge on people who throw litter from convertibles and a cast of condo-constructing, mangrove-trashing low-lives, who get their weekend thrills shooting gimpy zoo animals in mocked-up hunts. </p> <p>'The fiction is a pretty good outlet for things you can't get away with in journalism,' he says smiling. 'I don't pick particular people and say you're going to be a character in my novel, but certainly they are composites. The lobby ist in Sick Puppy - Palmer Stote - is a very accurate representation of what a political lobbyist does down here, ie bribery, extortion, general sleaze. I combine traits and eccentricities. For example, Stote carries six cellphones like one lobbyist I know. Some of these people are OK, but many of them are such despicable human beings that you don't know how they get up of a morning and look at themselves in a mirror. I kind of skim the worst of the worst.' </p> <p>Hiaasen is sometimes accused of being too outlandish in his comedy. He argues that he never writes anything that does not happen and often what he does write is overtaken by events. Since he's described the grimly staged 'big game hunts', for example, there have been a couple of investigations into similar operations in the region. 'The greatest difficulty,' he says, 'is that it's very hard to stay ahead of the curve of weirdness in this place. I'm increasingly frustrated because everything I've imagined has come to pass.' </p> <p>Like all the best satirists, the quality that Hiaasen prizes above all others is innocence. He grew up in a town called Plantation. His grandfather, originally from a small Norwegian community in North Dakota, had been among the first to settle there; he set up a law practice, which Hiaasen's father inherited. It was his grandfather who instilled in Hiaasen a love of books. 'He didn't speak English until he was 13, but he educated himself, put himself through law school, he was a preacher too, and he read literally until he couldn't see any more,' Hiaasen recalls. 'He lived to be 100 and when he died I went through his books, and nearly every one of them had these very fine margin notes on almost every page. But when I started writing fiction, it puzzled him. He was from a world where you read to gain knowledge, not for entertainment.' </p> <p>Plantation was then the westernmost town in Florida, bordering the Everglades. Beyond it, there was just 'swamps and water and snakes and critters', territory which Hiaasen and his friends used to explore in little boats, camping out, catching water moccasins. Now the interstate goes out beyond there, and the Everglades has shrunk to half its previous size, threatening the entire ecology of the region; much of Hiaasen's childhood has been paved over. The development had begun when he was a child and he can't remember a time when he was not angry about it. 'As kids, we would go out every day and there would be a bulldozer tearing down the place where we had a fort or a den, so there was this sense of outrage. You know, do they have to destroy everything we love?' </p> <p>He fantasised about direct action, 'but we were just kids on bicycles with fishing rods'. The closest they ever got to eco-terrorism was shifting surveyors' poles around. But from an early age, he thought that writing about the desecration might be a way of getting people to take notice. He put out a magazine at high school, called More Trash , which was 'less satirical than smart ass', but it brought home to him that 'by writing strong opinions about topical things everybody felt a need to read it, and they were perversely interested in who you were going to needle next'. </p> <p>After college, he joined the Herald as a reporter and started needling full-time. During the cocaine wars of the early Eighties, when there were machine- gun shoot-outs in Miami's shopping malls, Hiaasen was writing analytical pieces about the Colombian-based gangs and their Florida pushers. His editor at the time, Bill Montalbano, told him that the stories they were publishing were 'too good for the newspaper' and suggested that they sat down together to write a novel. In fact, Hiaasen notes, Montalbano's motivation was more venal: 'He just got remarried, had a little child and wanted to buy a swimming-pool.' </p> <p>They wrote five chapters and sent them off. Two weeks later, the book was sold, the swimming-pool ordered. Hiaasen and Montalbano did three traditional mystery detective books together and Hiaasen subsequently began writing fiction on his own. His first book, Tourist Season , which features the ransoming of the Orange Bowl Queen and the aerial bombardments of cruise ships, set the tone for what followed. </p> <p>Hiaasen has been accused in the past simply of hating tourists. He is, it is true, fond of calling the 46 million visitors to Florida each year, many of whom drive past his front door, 'tourons' (to rhyme with morons). But he pleads innocent to the general charge. 'Some people come down here and they stare at the water and the islands and they are completely awestruck and mesmerised by it all in the same way that I am,' he says, warming up for a mini-rant. 'But what I don't understand is where they take these boats out every day and feed dolphins buckets of fish so they don't know how to hunt any more, and then they let all these kids jump in and touch them. It's not enough to see something in nature; you have to turn it into some fucking attraction. The compulsion to be entertained is what drives this county. We have to be led into a queue and then stand there and wait to be shown something. It's like a disease here. And as a result, many people cannot connect to anything that is simply natural.' </p> <p>The disease he describes has its nerve centre a few hundred miles north of the Keys in the original Magic Kingdom in Orlando. Hiaasen's life ambition is to be banned forever from DisneyWorld. To this end, he wrote a little pamphlet about the corporation called Team Rodent. It is a brilliant, often savagely funny critique of how 'Mouse-witz' conquered his state. </p> <p>'The absolute worst thing Disney did,' he wrote, and in Hiaasen's view that is saying something, 'was to change how people in Florida thought about money; nobody ever dreamed there could be so much. Bankers, lawyers, real-estate salesmen, hoteliers, farmers, citrus growers - everyone in Mickey's orbit had drastically to recalibrate the concepts of growth. Suddenly, there were no limits. Merely by showing up, Disney had dignified blind greed in a state pioneered by undignified greedheads. Everything the company touched turned to gold, so everyone in Florida craved to touch or be touched by Disney. The gate opened and in galloped fresh hordes. The orange groves and citrus stands of old Orlando rapidly gave way to an execrable panorama of urban blight.' </p> <p>His 80-page mousehunt concludes with a memorable, couldn't-make-it-up investigation into the peculiar death from rectal injuries of a rare black rhino in Disney's newly opened Animal Kingdom. 'I'm perhaps the only man you have ever met who has pictures of a rhino necropsy stashed away somewhere,' he says. Hiaasen can see the comedy in all this but the principle he takes enormously seriously. I wonder if he has any hope that the Disney-based destruction might be reversed in some way; is there any going back? </p> <p>He talks of the encouragement he gets from people who read his books and who care in the same way about the concreting of their own childhood. 'But no,' he says, 'it can't be reversed, though the hurricanes help occasionally. They sort of purge the place.' </p> <p>The other effective purgative is Hiaasen's column. He can point to instances where he has made a small difference: a guy recently who decided to cut down 12,000 mangroves - the hub of Florida's eco-system - in a state national park to give himself a sea view was the subject of one recent attack, and he was subsequently arrested. </p> <p>'Of course, he's got a big lawyer and he'll probably get off in the end, but it's causing him no end of misery and maybe the next asshole that comes along - and there's always the next asshole - will think twice about it.' </p> <p>Given the nature of Hiaasen's column, it is perhaps surprising that he has not had more legal difficulties. The only person who has ever sued him was 'one of our insane mayors', a man he dubbed Mayor Loco. 'I didn't accuse the guy of any crime or attribute to him any nasty diseases, just kept calling him Mayor Loco. It later turned out that the election he won was stolen - a whole bunch of dead people had voted for him, so he was kicked out. The lawsuit against me did not allege any liability. It just said that after he'd been kicked out for rigging elections and no one would hire him because they knew him as Mayor Loco. Our response was that we would be happy to have psychiatrists look at him - this was a guy who used to turn up at the newspaper office ranting in his bathrobe - and clearly he didn't fancy that.' </p> <p>Does he never feel like a quieter life, just getting on with his fishing? </p> <p>'Some days, I really enjoy writing the column,' he says, 'and some days it's the purest form of torture. I still agonise over every miserable adjective. When you get fired up and you have something to write about, like during the Elian Gonzalez case, then you just have to go nuts, because you're speaking for a lot of people who're pulling their hair out.' </p> <p>But there are other moments when he considers packing it in. Hiaasen is 47 now; he was first married when he was 17 ('We were crazy about each other and it seemed like the right thing to do). He has a son from that marriage, Scott, 29, who is also a journalist, and from his second marriage he has a nine-year-old stepson, Ryan and a baby, Quinn, born at the beginning of this year. His daughter-in-law is expecting twins. 'So I'm going to be a grandfather and a father in the same year. I'm waiting for the call from Jerry Springer. </p> <p>'There's certainly a temptation when you reach a certain age just to chill out and look out only for the people you care about. Now I've got a little one in the house it would be nice occasionally not to have to deal with crazies on your answering machine or the odd threat in the mail or whatever. Of course, after the Gonzales stuff, I got a bunch of letters saying I was anti-Hispanic and a racist and a Castro sympathiser. And, of course, I could not resist sending these people back letters saying, \"Please keep it quiet but I've been working for the communists for years\". And signed them Carl \"Che\" Hiaasen.' </p> <p>But he doesn't see much hope of himself mellowing out - 'I know I'd be miserable doing that'; if anything he thinks he'll get madder as he gets older. He points to a passage in Sick Puppy which he says is about as close to his philosophy as anything in his books. It comes from Skink, a recurrent alter-ego, an ex-governor gone native in the Everglades: 'People like us are doomed to be angry, and to stay angry, because that's the only way things get changed.' </p> <p>Before I leave, Hiaasen, the most laid-back angry man I have met, shows me around his garage. Around the walls are half-a-dozen tanks containing pet reptiles. He has a frog that eats mice, a wedding gift from his lawyer: 'It has canines but it's kind of slow,' he says. 'Sometimes, the mouse survives in there for a day before he catches up with it.' </p> <p>He takes out a couple of snakes from other tanks. One, which can apparently pretend to be a rattler, is five feet long. Does it bite? I ask. 'They have razor-sharp teeth, but you won't see them until they're embedded in you,' he says. 'Then you have problems.' </p> <p>With Hiaasen around, a lot of Florida's legislators and businessmen, you imagine, know exactly that feeling. </p> <p><strong> Hiaasen on Hiaasen</strong></p> <p><strong> Tourist Season </strong></p> <p>'This involved the kidnapping of the Orange Bowl queen which was, no doubt, a submerged teenage fantasy of mine.

'The absolute worst thing Disney did,' he wrote, and in Hiaasen's view that is saying something, 'was to change how people in Florida thought about money; nobody ever dreamed there could be so much. Bankers, lawyers, real-estate salesmen, hoteliers, farmers, citrus growers - everyone in Mickey's orbit had drastically to recalibrate the concepts of growth. Suddenly, there were no limits. Merely by showing up, Disney had dignified blind greed in a state pioneered by undignified greedheads. Everything the company touched turned to gold, so everyone in Florida craved to touch or be touched by Disney. The gate opened and in galloped fresh hordes. The orange groves and citrus stands of old Orlando rapidly gave way to an execrable panorama of urban blight.' His 80-page mousehunt concludes with a memorable, couldn't-make-it-up investigation into the peculiar death from rectal injuries of a rare black rhino in Disney's newly opened Animal Kingdom. 'I'm perhaps the only man you have ever met who has pictures of a rhino necropsy stashed away somewhere,' he says. Hiaasen can see the comedy in all this but the principle he takes enormously seriously. I wonder if he has any hope that the Disney-based destruction might be reversed in some way; is there any going back? He talks of the encouragement he gets from people who read his books and who care in the same way about the concreting of their own childhood. 'But no,' he says, 'it can't be reversed, though the hurricanes help occasionally. They sort of purge the place.' The other effective purgative is Hiaasen's column. He can point to instances where he has made a small difference: a guy recently who decided to cut down 12,000 mangroves - the hub of Florida's eco-system - in a state national park to give himself a sea view was the subject of one recent attack, and he was subsequently arrested. 'Of course, he's got a big lawyer and he'll probably get off in the end, but it's causing him no end of misery and maybe the next asshole that comes along - and there's always the next asshole - will think twice about it.' Given the nature of Hiaasen's column, it is perhaps surprising that he has not had more legal difficulties. The only person who has ever sued him was 'one of our insane mayors', a man he dubbed Mayor Loco. 'I didn't accuse the guy of any crime or attribute to him any nasty diseases, just kept calling him Mayor Loco. It later turned out that the election he won was stolen - a whole bunch of dead people had voted for him, so he was kicked out. The lawsuit against me did not allege any liability. It just said that after he'd been kicked out for rigging elections and no one would hire him because they knew him as Mayor Loco. Our response was that we would be happy to have psychiatrists look at him - this was a guy who used to turn up at the newspaper office ranting in his bathrobe - and clearly he didn't fancy that.' Does he never feel like a quieter life, just getting on with his fishing? 'Some days, I really enjoy writing the column,' he says, 'and some days it's the purest form of torture. I still agonise over every miserable adjective. When you get fired up and you have something to write about, like during the Elian Gonzalez case, then you just have to go nuts, because you're speaking for a lot of people who're pulling their hair out.' But there are other moments when he considers packing it in. Hiaasen is 47 now; he was first married when he was 17 ('We were crazy about each other and it seemed like the right thing to do). He has a son from that marriage, Scott, 29, who is also a journalist, and from his second marriage he has a nine-year-old stepson, Ryan and a baby, Quinn, born at the beginning of this year. His daughter-in-law is expecting twins. 'So I'm going to be a grandfather and a father in the same year. I'm waiting for the call from Jerry Springer. 'There's certainly a temptation when you reach a certain age just to chill out and look out only for the people you care about. Now I've got a little one in the house it would be nice occasionally not to have to deal with crazies on your answering machine or the odd threat in the mail or whatever. Of course, after the Gonzales stuff, I got a bunch of letters saying I was anti-Hispanic and a racist and a Castro sympathiser. And, of course, I could not resist sending these people back letters saying, \"Please keep it quiet but I've been working for the communists for years\". And signed them Carl \"Che\" Hiaasen.' But he doesn't see much hope of himself mellowing out - 'I know I'd be miserable doing that'; if anything he thinks he'll get madder as he gets older. He points to a passage in Sick Puppy which he says is about as close to his philosophy as anything in his books. It comes from Skink, a recurrent alter-ego, an ex-governor gone native in the Everglades: 'People like us are doomed to be angry, and to stay angry, because that's the only way things get changed.' Before I leave, Hiaasen, the most laid-back angry man I have met, shows me around his garage. Around the walls are half-a-dozen tanks containing pet reptiles. He has a frog that eats mice, a wedding gift from his lawyer: 'It has canines but it's kind of slow,' he says. 'Sometimes, the mouse survives in there for a day before he catches up with it.' He takes out a couple of snakes from other tanks. One, which can apparently pretend to be a rattler, is five feet long. Does it bite? I ask. 'They have razor-sharp teeth, but you won't see them until they're embedded in you,' he says. 'Then you have problems.' With Hiaasen around, a lot of Florida's legislators and businessmen, you imagine, know exactly that feeling. Hiaasen on Hiaasen Tourist Season 'This involved the kidnapping of the Orange Bowl queen which was, no doubt, a submerged teenage fantasy of mine. ' Double Whammy 'Sex, murder and corruption on the professional bass-fishing circuit. This was territory I had pretty much to myself. I couldn't see much danger of Updike or Norman Mailer going in that direction.' Lucky You 'A good old-fashioned tale of greed and the Florida state lottery. ' Skintight 'I thought I had invented the most repellent plastic surgeon ever but he has since been eclipsed. The other day, we had a guy arrested: a bodybuilder had come in asking for pectoral implants and this guy used breast implants instead. He woke up with a boob on each shoulder.' Native Tongue 'Any time you can have a villain romanced to death by a dolphin and manage to convince your editors that it's an important component of your novel, you're doing something right.' Strip Tease 'The book was about how you can always count on men to behave badly.' Sick Puppy 'I enjoy the idea of beating a litterbug senseless, because that's a death-penalty issue. Haul them off and straight into the electric chair. No question.' \u0095 Sick Puppy is published by Macmillan at \u00a316.99.",

When she appeared on television, the Duke would yodel: 'Here comes the Blimp', while the Duchess, not to be outdone, described her nemesis as 'that 14-carat beauty' and 'the monster of Glamis'. </p> <p>It's well known that royalty attracts a dismal, often homosexual, cast of toadies, timeservers, creeps, and arse-lickers, but the Windsors' court-in-exile was, as Christopher Wilson expertly demonstrates in this gruesomely fascinating tale, one of the queerest and nastiest entourages in recent memory. </p> <p>The Duke was a pathetic figure.

According to this spicy rendering of one of the many sad, shameful footnotes in the life of former king Edward VII, the Windsors routinely referred to her as 'that fat Scotch cook' and 'the Loch Ness monster'. When she appeared on television, the Duke would yodel: 'Here comes the Blimp', while the Duchess, not to be outdone, described her nemesis as 'that 14-carat beauty' and 'the monster of Glamis'. It's well known that royalty attracts a dismal, often homosexual, cast of toadies, timeservers, creeps, and arse-lickers, but the Windsors' court-in-exile was, as Christopher Wilson expertly demonstrates in this gruesomely fascinating tale, one of the queerest and nastiest entourages in recent memory. The Duke was a pathetic figure. In the Bahamas, where he found some comfort, it was said he 'used to be First Lord of the Admiralty, but now he's third mate on an American tramp'. After much sleuthing Wilson shows that once Wallis Simpson failed to get her hands on the crown, she became more interested in the seedy by-ways of Anglo-American demi-monde.

Anglo-Australian Attitudes by Michael Davie, a former Observer journalist, is a discursive set of essays on the history of the vexed relationship between Australians and what they are no longer allowed to think of as their mother country. Davie - conspicuously knowledgeable about the countries' common history - writes as an Englishman who prefers Australia and cannot understand why Australians cling to any British traditions. </p> <p>Davie starts with the issue of class, claiming that it is a myth that Australia is classless. It had never crossed my mind that Australia might consider itself classless, since, like east coast America, it has preserved the institutions of birth, education and privilege rather more intact than Magdalen College, Oxford. He then has a chapter on attitudes to Gallipoli - clearly a formative moment in making Australians think badly of Britain since it was generally assumed that Churchill had sent large numbers of Australian troops needlessly to their deaths as cannon fodder. What emerges is another side to Gallipoli, a side carefully excised from official accounts in order not to offend Australian sensibilities. </p> <p>A chapter on the role of the governor-general misses the point of the arguments surrounding the referendum over whether or not Australia should be a republic, which involved a recognition of the potential problem of a Prime Minister having no limits to his or her authority - an issue about which one might find British sympathisers. </p> <p>At the book's heart are a pair of chapters on why it might be regarded as legitimate for Australians to think ill of Britain. The first was the scandal over the Australian test matches in 1933 when the captain, Douglas Jardine, insisted that his players adopted bodyline bowling which, if not illegal, was certainly regarded as profoundly unsporting. Jardine was assumed to be a typical Englishman - arrogant, hypocritical and pretending to be a good sportsman when actually he was not. In fact, he comes across as extremely unusual, a shit of the first order, of which presumably there are examples in Australia and Britain.</p> <p>The second, mid-century event that confirmed Australians in their views of the perfidy of Albion was when Churchill failed to send effective help to Australia when it was faced by Japanese invasion. But as Davie effectively demonstrates, there was an element of self-delusion about the might of the British Empire if Australians thought that Britain would happily send off its fleet to the South Pacific when still faced by German invasion of its own shores. </p> <p>Cumulatively, the book makes you wonder why anyone in Australia should be remotely sympathetic towards Britain. The reality, of course, is different from this one-sided book. For example, the current exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery of photographs by Polly Borland of Australians in Britain includes in the catalogue a wealth of information about why Australians were keen to leave Australia in the 1960s and 1970s.

In it Robicheaux has to come to terms with the sad, sordid past of his own mother, Mae, whom he scarcely knew. He discovers that she was a prostitute, murdered one stormy night on the edge of a bayou on Purple Cane Road, drowned in a muddy puddle by two cops working for the Mob.</p> <p>Robicheaux's painful search for his mother's killers brings him into contact with an intriguing bunch of characters. They include Belmont Pugh, a preacher who has progressed from door-to-door salesman to state governor, and the chilling Johnny Remeta, a seemingly unstoppable hit man with a high IQ and psychotic personality. Burke's Cajun cop, a Vietnam veteran, is a detective in the classic US mould: a flawed knight errant, a tragic hero, battling injustice and his own demons. (Like his creator, Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic.) Burke has said he sees him as closest to Everyman in the medieval morality play, a man of courage and humility who tries to give a voice to the weak and the powerless. </p> <p>As with virtually all Burke's other novels, Purple Cane Road is for Robicheaux a journey into the past. Influenced by Flannery O'Connor, William Faulkner and his own 'Gethsemane experience' which enabled him to give up drink, Burke creates characters in spiritual crisis. In the course of his search for his mother's killers, Robicheaux sees that if he can come to terms with his and his family's troubled past, he might at last find some form of redemption.</p> <p>Burke's writing can only be measured in superlatives. Nobody else in the mystery genre is doing what he is doing - as a descriptive writer alone he is without equal. In Purple Cane Road he writes with a depth of feeling that is rare in the mystery genre. I defy anyone to read the final page without shedding a tear. </p> <p>George Pelecanos is hot but he's not exactly sunny. However, <strong> The Big Blowdown</strong> is a perfect summer read for its pace, its plotting and its sheer page-turning narrative drive. Although the last to be published here, it's the first of Pelecanos's acclaimed DC Quartet and in my view it's the best. Big is a pretty prosaic adjective, but use it in the title of a crime novel and it somehow gives the result mythic qualities, from Chandler's The Big Sleep through to Ellroy's The Big Nowhere. And the Fifties B movies that used it? Films such as The Big Heat, The Big Combo and The Big Steal came almost to define pulp crime fiction. </p> <p>However, Pelecanos's title is more than a nod to his hard-boiled precursors - with The Big Blowdown he has actually written one of those Fifties noir thrillers and there are mythic qualities aplenty. Not that the novel is simply a retro gimmick or even straightforward pulp. Pelecanos has a larger story to tell: that of the immigrant experience in multi-ethnic inner-city Washington from the Thirties through to the Fifties. </p> <p>The novel starts with a bunch of boys growing up in poverty in the Thirties, then focuses on one of them - Pete Karras - who goes off to war and comes back a hero. He and his Italian friend Joe Recevo, fond of snappy clothes and easy living, go for the easy money - debt-collecting for the local mob boss. Karras is too lenient with his fellow immigrants, so the mob boss decides to teach him a vicious lesson. Three years later, Karras finds that his criminal past impinges on new friendships and that there must come a final and bloody reckoning. </p> <p>Pelecanos has enormous strengths as a crime writer. He can't write a dull sentence, his dialogue has great rhythm, his action scenes are ferociously effective. But more than that, he has a powerful social conscience and The Big Blowdown, as with his other novels, deals with themes of friendship, social injustice, ethnic co-existence and the possibility that ordinary people, if they have courage enough, can triumph over the corrupt and the lawless. </p> <p>Reg Gadney is another writer with a strong sense of pace and narrative drive. After a slightly bitty start he demonstrates these qualities to the full in <strong> Strange Police</strong>, the fourth outing for former customs agent Alan Rosslyn. In it Rosslyn is in Greece doing minor surveillance work when his client, Cleo Ipsilanti, is murdered. </p> <p>Since he was also her lover, he becomes the prime suspect. Hurriedly smuggled out of Greece by the British intelligence service, he discovers back in London that Ipsilanti was involved in a well-planned operation to steal the Elgin Marbles and return them to Athens. And the curious thing is, certain members of the security forces seem to be in on it.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of the novel is the thought Gadney has obviously given to the plan to steal the Marbles. It's so detailed, you come to think it might well work in actuality. He also peoples Strange Police with an assortment of vivid characters, from the single-minded, devious intelligence officer Marion Shaw, who effortlessly manipulates Rosslyn, to the villainous Constantine Dragos, who has a vicious metal claw in place of a hand. </p> <p>If that sounds James Bond-like, there are occasional reminders of those kinds of straight-ahead adventures here, just as there are of Le Carr\u00e9, in the petty wrangles and squabbles that Gadney writes about between and within security services. But Gadney owes nothing to other authors, especially in the quality of the writing and the enthusiastic way he tells his exciting story. </p> <p>Hearing that Norris Church Mailer is Norman Mailer's wife might make you wary of her first novel, <strong> Windchill Summer</strong>. But this is no vanity project published for its marketing possibilities. Mrs Mailer can write and this is an impressive, ambitious debut in which she successfully marries a thriller to a - probably autobiographical - coming-of-age novel.</p> <p>It's the long hot summer of 1969 in Sweet Valley, Arkansas. It's the summer of the moon landing and anti-Vietnam war demonstrations. The main narrator, Cherry, and Baby, her Filipino best friend, are working sticky, sweaty nights at the pickle plant. Another friend, Carlene, is pulled from the bottom of the lake, murdered.</p> <p>Over the following days and weeks Cherry, brought up strictly in the Holiness Church, begins to question all her old certainties as she discovers that everyone around her seems to have dark secrets, even those whom she thinks she knows best. Confidently plotted, the novel's initial easy pace builds to a strong climax when the Vietnam war is brought brutally back home.</p>",

But more than that, he has a powerful social conscience and The Big Blowdown, as with his other novels, deals with themes of friendship, social injustice, ethnic co-existence and the possibility that ordinary people, if they have courage enough, can triumph over the corrupt and the lawless. Reg Gadney is another writer with a strong sense of pace and narrative drive. After a slightly bitty start he demonstrates these qualities to the full in Strange Police, the fourth outing for former customs agent Alan Rosslyn. In it Rosslyn is in Greece doing minor surveillance work when his client, Cleo Ipsilanti, is murdered. Since he was also her lover, he becomes the prime suspect. Hurriedly smuggled out of Greece by the British intelligence service, he discovers back in London that Ipsilanti was involved in a well-planned operation to steal the Elgin Marbles and return them to Athens. And the curious thing is, certain members of the security forces seem to be in on it. One of the pleasures of the novel is the thought Gadney has obviously given to the plan to steal the Marbles. It's so detailed, you come to think it might well work in actuality. He also peoples Strange Police with an assortment of vivid characters, from the single-minded, devious intelligence officer Marion Shaw, who effortlessly manipulates Rosslyn, to the villainous Constantine Dragos, who has a vicious metal claw in place of a hand. If that sounds James Bond-like, there are occasional reminders of those kinds of straight-ahead adventures here, just as there are of Le Carr\u00e9, in the petty wrangles and squabbles that Gadney writes about between and within security services. But Gadney owes nothing to other authors, especially in the quality of the writing and the enthusiastic way he tells his exciting story. Hearing that Norris Church Mailer is Norman Mailer's wife might make you wary of her first novel, Windchill Summer. But this is no vanity project published for its marketing possibilities. Mrs Mailer can write and this is an impressive, ambitious debut in which she successfully marries a thriller to a - probably autobiographical - coming-of-age novel. It's the long hot summer of 1969 in Sweet Valley, Arkansas. It's the summer of the moon landing and anti-Vietnam war demonstrations. The main narrator, Cherry, and Baby, her Filipino best friend, are working sticky, sweaty nights at the pickle plant. Another friend, Carlene, is pulled from the bottom of the lake, murdered. Over the following days and weeks Cherry, brought up strictly in the Holiness Church, begins to question all her old certainties as she discovers that everyone around her seems to have dark secrets, even those whom she thinks she knows best. Confidently plotted, the novel's initial easy pace builds to a strong climax when the Vietnam war is brought brutally back home.",

News that the city now has the same infection levels as sub-Saharan Africa has sparked fears across America and Europe that years of safe-sex education are being undermined by complacency. It is the first reported rise in infection rate in any US city since the HIV epidemic started being brought under control. San Francisco public health officials estimate that the number of new HIV infections - which can lead to Aids - has doubled in the past year to 900. 'This is a harbinger of what is going to happen all over the country.

Anonymous testing at clinics across San Francisco - where high-risk groups serve as an early warning system - show the proportion of HIV positive cases has nearly tripled in three years, from 1.3 per cent in 1997 to 3.7 per cent in 1999.

In both the US and the UK, there are increasing signs that those at risk are reverting to unsafe practices, lulled into a false sense of security by powerful drugs and - until now - falling infection rates. In Britain, the number of recorded infections rose last year to 2,500, the highest for a decade, although researchers insist that was caused by more people coming forward for testing, rather than the actual rate of infection rising. However, Aids prevention workers worry that people are letting down their guard, with all the early-warning signals all pointing the wrong way: \u0095 The number of gay men having unprotected anal intercourse has risen, according to research just completed by the Terrence Higgins Trust - although more men know the HIV status of their partner. \u0095 Hepatitis infection rates among injecting drug users have risen, suggesting there is more sharing of needles. \u0095 Gonorrhoea cases rose by 26 per cent in men and 30 per cent in women last year - and jumped by more than 50 per cent in young men, suggesting fewer people practise safe sex. The rise in infections in San Francisco was preceded by similar signs of less than safe sex in high-risk groups.

      "bodyText": "Prison authorities had been warned to keep a close eye on the killer of British student Isabel Peake before he was found dead in his Portuguese prison cell, it emerged yesterday. Three hours before the 21-year-old Algerian asphyxiated himself by setting light to his mattress, he had been treated for self-inflicted cuts on his wrists. Guards were watching football on television when he died. The disclosures have shocked and angered families of his three victims. Sid Ahmed Rezala had been in the Lisbon jail awaiting extradition to France for trial. The report of the duty doctor who treated the cuts on his wrist shows that the prison director was immediately warned that Rezala was likely to make another attempt on his life. But the guards did not look in again on the self-styled 'Train Killer', who was slowly dying in the smoke. There was immediate speculation that the prison officers had their attentions instead on the Euro 2000 football semi-final between France and Portugal on television at the time. The battered body of Isabel Peake, a 20-year-old Birmingham University student, was found beside a railway line near Chabenet in central France last October. She had been on her way home after an exchange visit. On Thursday, her distraught parents said they were shocked by Rezala's suicide. It did not soften the blow of their daughter's death, they added. Curtains were kept drawn at their Staffordshire home as Brian and Annie Peake prepared a statement which was read out by their lawyer. 'We need time to consider the implications. We will not be making any further state ments at this stage and ask for our privacy to be respected.' Yesterday the family's MP, Bill Cash, said: 'This entire tragedy is absolutely saturated by blunders, a roll call of unmitigated bungling. This will only add to the suffering of Mr and Mrs Peake and their family. They have been unable to see their daughter's killer brought to justice.' When the guards eventually broke in to Rezala's cell on Wednesday - he had blocked the cell door with his bedframe - he was already unconscious. Gilbert Collard, lawyer for the parents of Corinne Caillaux, 36, stabbed to death on an express train, announced that he intends to sue France and Portugal for allowing Rezala to escape justice. 'Rezala will now never be declared guilty of the crimes he committed', he said. Rezala had claimed that 'blinding light flashes' made him hurl Isabel to her death from a train. He said he was high on drink and drugs, and added: 'There was nothing I could do. When that happens you aren't even aware of all the blood you spill. I got her and chased her and threw her off the train.' Rezala confessed to Figaro magazine from jail. He said he had chatted to Isabel as she waited at Limoges station to catch a train on her way home to Stoke-on-Trent. Rezala said: 'She was a gentle girl who didn't deserve to die. Isabel was very sweet. We got on well. She was supposed to be going back to England to see her boyfriend.' French police took nearly a week to identify Isabel's body, by which time the killer's trail was cold and Rezala struck again before his arrest in Lisbon. He also admitted murder ing Caillaux and his ex-girlfriend, Emilie Bazin, 20. Rezala's own lawyer, Alain Richard, called the suicide a scandal. 'His death must have been slow. In spite of the smell, the smoke, nobody noticed a thing,' he said. French newspapers claimed that guards were watching the dramatic climax of the semi-final match between France and Portugal which started at around the time that Rezala was last seen by doctors. He died just after 11pm, after a controversial hand-ball penalty incident involving Portugal's Everton defender Abel Xavier.\\ Rezala was said to have been growing increasingly disturbed as extradition to France loomed, showing signs of 'extreme despair and anxiety'. Celso Manata, the prison director, said he was under constant watch. However, the doctor who treated Rezala at 8pm said he was 'nervous, restless and under great pressure'. The report says Rezala was suffering from a grave personality disorder. 'I felt that he had a clear strategy to do harm to himself,' Dr Rizerio Salgado, warned the prison director. Salgado says that he saw numerous slash marks on Rezala's arms. 'We couldn't take any risks, and so I spoke to the prison director,' he explained. Rezala had been moved to the prison two weeks ago from a hospital, where he had been under observation. He told another magazine: 'I have tried several times to commit suicide. I slashed my veins, tried my jugular, and to hang myself. It did not work.' Rezala may have copied a prisoner in another Portuguese prison who died after setting fire to his cell. The incident has further strained relations between France and Portugal in the aftermath of the controversial Euro 2000 match. The Portuguese authorities deny French accusations of negligence on their part, pointing out that prison suicides in France are the highest in Europe, at 23 per 10,000 prisoners, compared with 8.2 per cent in Portugal. Mystery remains as to how Rezala managed to set fire to a flame-retardant mattress. He was not allowed to keep matches or a lighter and had to ask guards if he wanted to smoke.",

      "body": "<p>It was meant to be English football's finest hour since Alf Ramsey's red-shirted heroes won the 1966 World Cup at Wembley. A mixture of big names, magnificent modern stadiums and nostalgia about England's special status as the inventor of soccer would ensure the 2006 tournament came 'home' to where the game began.</p> <p>Four years on, humiliation awaits. England may get as few as two, and possibly only one, of the 24 votes of football's rulers who will decide in Zurich on Thursday which nation will host the prestigious and money-spinning 2006 finals. South Africa will probably win, with Germany second, while England could trail in last behind no-hopers Morocco and Brazil.</p> <p>This weekend, as Fifa, the sport's governing body, released a report by its inspectors which placed England's bid below those of Germany and South Africa, the inquest has already started about where it all went wrong. Critics claim 2006 campaigners optimistically ignored England's diminished influence in world football. Crucially, the bid team - run by the Football Association - stands accused of offering 'over the top' hospitality to soccer's movers and shakers in an increasingly desperate bid for favour.</p> <p>Senior politicians and even Prince Charles were pressed into service to help England's cause, while lavish functions were put on to impress voters in some of England's most sumptuous surroundings, including Highgrove, Lan caster House and the Natural History Museum.</p> <p>In a prelude to the looming storm of recrimination after this week's decision in Zurich, Prime Minister Tony Blair is already distancing himself from the bid he once backed so enthusiastically.</p> <p>It is unclear why \u00a310 million was spent on a bid which was apparently doomed from the start. 'Ten million quid to win just two votes is a nonsense, a complete and scandalous waste of money,' said one football insider. 'We would have been better taking the money and offering each of the Fifa 24 a big, fat brown envelope of cash instead.'</p> <p>Demands are growing for an explanation of how England managed to spend \u00a37m more than South Africa, and twice as much as arch-rivals Germany, and still lose. Questions will be asked in Parliament once the full scale of England's failure becomes clear.</p> <p>'If it transpires that a lot of money has been spent without yielding anything we will be highlighting the cost of the bid, once we know the outcome of the voting,' said John Greenway MP, the Conservatives' spokesman on sport. 'If we don't get 2006, one can look into all the elements of what it cost and where it went wrong. We have some concerns there.'</p> <p>The Observer can reveal that Kate Hoey, the Sports Minister, has written to FA chief executive Adam Crozier suggesting they open up the 2006 bid books in order to avoid suspicion. In her letter of 20 June, Hoey wrote: 'I am conscious that whatever the result on 6 July there will be keen interest in the amount spent on the World Cup bid by the FA in 1999 and 2000. Publication of these sums clearly identified in the [FA's] 1999 annual report in advance of any questions would prevent mischief-makers seeking to portray the FA as having something to hide.'</p> <p>But the 2006 campaign refuses to divulge spending details, though \u00a33m of their \u00a310m budget is Lottery funding from Sport England. The FA claims it is 'a private organisation spending money donated by other private organisations' and has no duty to reveal where the money went. Its financial affairs are kept secret.</p> <p>They include details of payments to Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst - both heroes of England's victory in 1966 - for their efforts as global ambassadors for the 2006 bid. Both covered thousands of miles globetrotting to try winning friends and influencing football people.</p> <p>FA sources claim that Charlton received around \u00a3250,000 for his work and was paid \u00a33,000 for each of many overseas lobbying trips he took. Hurst is thought to have received a similar amount. Both men took time away from their business activities to help the bid.</p> <p>The accounts also reveal how much was spent on, for example, the four-day 'lobbying exercise' put on by the 2006 team in May 1999. Sixteen of the Fifa 24 and their wives enjoyed lunch with Prince Charles, drinks at Downing Street, West End shows and a boat-trip on the Thames before attending the FA Cup Final.</p> <p>Fifa inspectors were ferried round England in military helicopters as they assessed stadiums.</p> <p>Sport England said its \u00a33m went on salaries, costs and promotional literature and not on such travel or hospitality.</p> <p>Sir Bob Scott, a veteran of two Manchester bids to stage the Olympics, said England's team had got its tactics wrong, were too optimistic about their chances and too naive in the intrigue inherent in bidding for big sports events.</p> <p>'Bidding for the Olympics or the World Cup is a world where everybody is polite and nice, and everybody says your bid is brilliant and that you'd be a very worthy host.

      "bodyText": "It was meant to be English football's finest hour since Alf Ramsey's red-shirted heroes won the 1966 World Cup at Wembley. A mixture of big names, magnificent modern stadiums and nostalgia about England's special status as the inventor of soccer would ensure the 2006 tournament came 'home' to where the game began. Four years on, humiliation awaits. England may get as few as two, and possibly only one, of the 24 votes of football's rulers who will decide in Zurich on Thursday which nation will host the prestigious and money-spinning 2006 finals. South Africa will probably win, with Germany second, while England could trail in last behind no-hopers Morocco and Brazil. This weekend, as Fifa, the sport's governing body, released a report by its inspectors which placed England's bid below those of Germany and South Africa, the inquest has already started about where it all went wrong. Critics claim 2006 campaigners optimistically ignored England's diminished influence in world football. Crucially, the bid team - run by the Football Association - stands accused of offering 'over the top' hospitality to soccer's movers and shakers in an increasingly desperate bid for favour. Senior politicians and even Prince Charles were pressed into service to help England's cause, while lavish functions were put on to impress voters in some of England's most sumptuous surroundings, including Highgrove, Lan caster House and the Natural History Museum. In a prelude to the looming storm of recrimination after this week's decision in Zurich, Prime Minister Tony Blair is already distancing himself from the bid he once backed so enthusiastically. It is unclear why \u00a310 million was spent on a bid which was apparently doomed from the start. 'Ten million quid to win just two votes is a nonsense, a complete and scandalous waste of money,' said one football insider. 'We would have been better taking the money and offering each of the Fifa 24 a big, fat brown envelope of cash instead.' Demands are growing for an explanation of how England managed to spend \u00a37m more than South Africa, and twice as much as arch-rivals Germany, and still lose. Questions will be asked in Parliament once the full scale of England's failure becomes clear. 'If it transpires that a lot of money has been spent without yielding anything we will be highlighting the cost of the bid, once we know the outcome of the voting,' said John Greenway MP, the Conservatives' spokesman on sport. 'If we don't get 2006, one can look into all the elements of what it cost and where it went wrong. We have some concerns there.' The Observer can reveal that Kate Hoey, the Sports Minister, has written to FA chief executive Adam Crozier suggesting they open up the 2006 bid books in order to avoid suspicion. In her letter of 20 June, Hoey wrote: 'I am conscious that whatever the result on 6 July there will be keen interest in the amount spent on the World Cup bid by the FA in 1999 and 2000. Publication of these sums clearly identified in the [FA's] 1999 annual report in advance of any questions would prevent mischief-makers seeking to portray the FA as having something to hide.' But the 2006 campaign refuses to divulge spending details, though \u00a33m of their \u00a310m budget is Lottery funding from Sport England. The FA claims it is 'a private organisation spending money donated by other private organisations' and has no duty to reveal where the money went. Its financial affairs are kept secret. They include details of payments to Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst - both heroes of England's victory in 1966 - for their efforts as global ambassadors for the 2006 bid. Both covered thousands of miles globetrotting to try winning friends and influencing football people. FA sources claim that Charlton received around \u00a3250,000 for his work and was paid \u00a33,000 for each of many overseas lobbying trips he took. Hurst is thought to have received a similar amount. Both men took time away from their business activities to help the bid. The accounts also reveal how much was spent on, for example, the four-day 'lobbying exercise' put on by the 2006 team in May 1999. Sixteen of the Fifa 24 and their wives enjoyed lunch with Prince Charles, drinks at Downing Street, West End shows and a boat-trip on the Thames before attending the FA Cup Final. Fifa inspectors were ferried round England in military helicopters as they assessed stadiums. Sport England said its \u00a33m went on salaries, costs and promotional literature and not on such travel or hospitality. Sir Bob Scott, a veteran of two Manchester bids to stage the Olympics, said England's team had got its tactics wrong, were too optimistic about their chances and too naive in the intrigue inherent in bidding for big sports events. 'Bidding for the Olympics or the World Cup is a world where everybody is polite and nice, and everybody says your bid is brilliant and that you'd be a very worthy host. But later, when voting for someone becomes real rather than just a promise, they find a reason not to vote for you. 'No football delegate from Asia or Latin America is going to be anything except extremely polite...and praise the England bid. But behind the scenes, any genuine, honest consideration of England's likely vote was that it was nothing like as solid as the England team was claiming it was. Some public statements by the bid team have been a bit short on realism.' A senior football figure said England were 'foolish' to even enter the 2006 race given the FA's previous 'gentleman's agreement' with Germany to back them for 2006 if Germany helped the FA secure Euro 96, which they did. 'There was a deal to back each other's bid, but the FA reneged on it. That went down very badly with leaders of European football, most of whom are backing Germany and are furious with England for splitting the European vote.' denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

Physicists from Europe, the US and Japan reported on terahertz technology last week - and revealed that detectors based on it could be installed in airports and hospitals within three years.

Precious Life grew out of Ireland's Youth Defence movement, linked with militant anti-abortion groups in the US, who have burnt down 12 clinics and killed four doctors since 1994. Other UK pro-lifers, including the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, distance themselves from Youth Defence, which claims to have the support of the Pope. In 1995, Youth Defence leaders Naimh Nic Mhathuna and John Heaney had a private audience with the Pope and claimed he told them Ireland 'was under attack' by pro-abortionists and to 'continue in your apostolate and be courageous'. Next month Youth Defence hosts a pro-life conference in Rome where US Christian Defence Coalition leader Patrick Mahoney will speak.

      "body": "<p>'I was told it'd be a very informal meeting - that we'd have our heads bashed together and be told to grow up.' This is Edward, an investment consultant and father of four who is getting divorced. He is talking about a directions (or conciliation) hearing in the family law courts - an initial session in front of a judge.</p> <p>The judge opened the proceedings by asking Edward why he was asking for residence. 'I said, \"I'm not, the children live with me\",' he recalls. 'She then looked very embarrassed, grabbed her notes and started frantically reading.'</p> <p>The judge then told Edward she wanted to resolve the dispute that day. 'When I pointed out that my barrister said that wasn't the purpose of a directions hearing, she said \"this is my court\".'</p> <p>Welcome to the world of family law, a world of uninformed decision-making, impatient judges and rigid court orders. In family law, judges have the widest discretion and are least restrained by precedent.</p> <p>The thinking is that there can only be loose guidelines within family law, no strict rules, to allow for the 'uniqueness' of each family. But this results in a 'complete lottery', says one barrister specialising in family law. 'With family cases - and this is different from any other area of law - the judge is given this excuse to be inconsistent, quite maverick in approach, or even outrageous.'</p> <p>What's more, this is a system which decides that the best people to carry out the central role of assessing parents and their children, the Court Welfare Officers, are professionals from the criminal probation service.</p> <p>'People would come in on a Friday afternoon from working with criminal offenders, and start work as court welfare officers on a Monday morning,' says Alan Sealey, who last year resigned his position as chair of the Association of CWOs. He describes the service he left as 'a hell of a mess - haphazard and there's no training'.</p> <p>'The Court Welfare Officer didn't seem to me to be a person who understood children at all,' says Dave, a builder, who was recently granted sole residence of his three-year-old son. 'She didn't seem interested in [his son] John, except about how much contact he had with his mum. In her report she wrote that \"there weren't many pictures of mum around the house\".' She might have wondered just how many people decorate their homes with photographs of their ex? (The amount of time a CWO will spend with a child varies enormously; there might be repeated visits or none at all.)</p> <p>Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, claims that fundamental changes to the system are imminent.</p> <p>From April 2001, CWOs will be the responsibility of a new department, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCAs). But these 'fundamental' changes seem to amount to nothing more than a new home. (And nobody in the service seems to have noticed that the name seems, unfortunately - if aptly - to be a variant of Kafka.)</p> <p>What's more, according to Mr Justice Wall, a senior High Court judge 'with all the administration involved we'll be lucky to have CAFCAs set up with a roof, let alone any fundamental changes'.</p> <p>Those parents who do manage to gain an audience with a judge will face further problems. The standard divorce, money and contact cases coming to court, which are increasing in number, though divorce rates appear to have levelled off, will be heard by part-time judges and judges drawn from the county courts (traditionally known as the 'cut-price' or 'poor man's courts').</p> <p>So what is going on in the family courts? Are they governed by a disdain for parenting, coupled with a particular suspicion of involved parents? Or perhaps still at work is the influence of a culture - the same one that sends its supposed elite off to boarding school - that does not understand children.</p> <p>How else to explain the stories I was hearing all the time? Stories of judges ignoring women's concerns about domestic violence; stories of the fathers every year who kill their children during their post-divorce contact period. Stories of fathers given an hour a fortnight to spend with their children, post-divorce, causing damage that only those who have been separated from a child can understand.</p> <p>I began taking an interest in family law following my own and friends' divorces, witnessing the reckless decisions I saw being taken about families' lives. At first, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Some of the characters within family courts seem to come straight from the pages of Charles Dickens. Only in the family courts could one hear, as I did last month, the phrase 'in these very modern times in which we live, where some couples cohabit without marrying', uttered by a barrister.</p> <p>Those going through the system are often rendered passive by it. They can see the problems but don't want their whole lives affected, so they choose to 'get on with things' rather than fight back. Or worse, they do fight back, and become manic, angered by the intricate injustices which, in turn, might result in them being seen as the problem.</p> <p>Sarah Heatley's story (see the parent's story below) might offer an extreme case study. But every day routine misery is visited upon parents and children. Over the past few months, The Observer has been exploring the system, spending time watching these daily traumas unfold.</p> <p>The mother, Iris, comes through the plate-glass doors of the family courts building first. She talks about what she thinks will happen that day at court. Her former partner, Dan, has sued for joint residence of their two children. Iris wants sole residence.</p> <p>Iris imagines she will be ushered into a court room with a judge. She doesn't really see the day ahead anymore clearly than that. She knows she is paying 'around \u00a3600' for a barrister to be in court with her that day, whom she has not yet met.</p> <p>There are tables in recesses along the corridor, off which the individual courts lead. The solicitor shepherds Iris to one of these tables, and the barrister arrives. Within the hour, Iris's solicitor, who has the most knowledge of her circumstances, leaves so as to save her client the hourly cost of her services and in order to get on with her own heavy workload.</p> <p>Dan turns up, with a solicitor but no barrister. They sit at another table further down the corridor. The hearing is scheduled for 11am, in half-an-hour's time. A clerk comes out and says the judge is running a bit late. Iris's barrister reads her papers and says she will talk to Dan's solicitor, to see what can be negotiated.</p> <p>The hearing in front of the judge never happens. The mother's barrister and the father's solicitor begin a whole day of back-and-forth, table-hopping negotiations, like over-active hosts at a gala dinner. This controlled frenzy is repeated all along the corridor, and indeed the other floors of this family court building, each time set in relief against the bleached-out faces of the mothers and fathers immobile at their separate tables.</p> <p>None of the professionals - the solicitors, barristers, court welfare officers or indeed the judge - are surprised that the hearing does not take place. It is common practice for a hearing date and time to be fixed, but all the professionals involved come to the court premises with the knowledge that a discussion will take place in the corridors, rather than everybody going into court to put their case before a judge.</p> <p>A 'settlement' is thus forced out of the parties under the worst possible circumstances - the threat of that great indeterminate, the judge, actually deciding the case. It is not a healthy environment in which to make important decisions about one's children. But it is very difficult, unless one is practising in this field, to get a clear picture of how it operates.</p> <p>So much of what is going on in the family courts is secret. Family hearings are most often held 'in chambers', i.e. in private, and not reported. This is for obvious, but not insurmountable, reasons, and it means that much of what goes on is not investigated, or indeed challenged. And in fact, such is the pressure of family work that, around the country, any judge with spare time is pressed into service. On the one hand, lawmakers are talking about the need for an ever more specialised family court. But, in reality, the pressure of work means that pretty much any judge who wants to can obtain what's called a 'family ticket' - the right to sit as a family judge.</p> <p>So parents expose their families to the mercy of whichever judge hears their case. Training, background, what a judge may have read most recently, will all be crucial to the outcome of the case.</p> <p>Family judges have so much work ('10 cases on your desk each morning'), it can be hard for anything bar the most blaring of messages to reach them.</p> <p>Last week a circuit judge, a perfectly kind and gentle person, told me: 'Quite often, you see a man, he tells you that \"when we were married, she drove me mad, and I whacked her. I've never laid a hand on the kids, though, and I wouldn't.\" I must say, I find that quite compelling.'</p> <p>If family court hearings were open, bad practice could be exposed much earlier. We would also all have at least the chance of a clearer idea of what constitutes family law and what fashions are being followed at any time.</p> <p>According to Lord Justice Thorpe, in the early 1990s the Lord Chancellor's Department carried out a consultation about whether family justice should come out from behind closed doors, but the outcome itself was never published - a muffling of the secrecy inquiry worthy of a Blackadder script. But while the political shenanigans continue, parents - and children - carry on suffering.</p> <p>A father fighting right now for overnight contact with his three-year-old daughter (and there are no allegations of damaging behaviour of any kind), told me: 'I've been pursuing this for two years now; last year I almost gave up - I thought it would make more sense all round for me to cut off contact completely and just forget I ever had a child.'</p> <p><b>The child's story</b></p> <p>Now 12, Jasmine was seven years old when her parents separated.</p> <p>She did not see her father at all for a period of 10 months, following a court welfare service report recommending restricted contact.</p> <p>She talks about being interviewed by a court welfare officer. After litigating for four years, her father established steady contact.</p> <p>'It was a bit weird really - I was pulled out of my class, out of lessons to go to see him (the CWO). I didn't know what it was about the first time.</p> <p>'He came to see me in school about three times, I think. He was stupid.

      "bodyText": "'I was told it'd be a very informal meeting - that we'd have our heads bashed together and be told to grow up.' This is Edward, an investment consultant and father of four who is getting divorced. He is talking about a directions (or conciliation) hearing in the family law courts - an initial session in front of a judge. The judge opened the proceedings by asking Edward why he was asking for residence. 'I said, \"I'm not, the children live with me\",' he recalls. 'She then looked very embarrassed, grabbed her notes and started frantically reading.' The judge then told Edward she wanted to resolve the dispute that day. 'When I pointed out that my barrister said that wasn't the purpose of a directions hearing, she said \"this is my court\".' Welcome to the world of family law, a world of uninformed decision-making, impatient judges and rigid court orders. In family law, judges have the widest discretion and are least restrained by precedent. The thinking is that there can only be loose guidelines within family law, no strict rules, to allow for the 'uniqueness' of each family. But this results in a 'complete lottery', says one barrister specialising in family law. 'With family cases - and this is different from any other area of law - the judge is given this excuse to be inconsistent, quite maverick in approach, or even outrageous.' What's more, this is a system which decides that the best people to carry out the central role of assessing parents and their children, the Court Welfare Officers, are professionals from the criminal probation service. 'People would come in on a Friday afternoon from working with criminal offenders, and start work as court welfare officers on a Monday morning,' says Alan Sealey, who last year resigned his position as chair of the Association of CWOs. He describes the service he left as 'a hell of a mess - haphazard and there's no training'. 'The Court Welfare Officer didn't seem to me to be a person who understood children at all,' says Dave, a builder, who was recently granted sole residence of his three-year-old son. 'She didn't seem interested in [his son] John, except about how much contact he had with his mum. In her report she wrote that \"there weren't many pictures of mum around the house\".' She might have wondered just how many people decorate their homes with photographs of their ex? (The amount of time a CWO will spend with a child varies enormously; there might be repeated visits or none at all.) Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, claims that fundamental changes to the system are imminent. From April 2001, CWOs will be the responsibility of a new department, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCAs). But these 'fundamental' changes seem to amount to nothing more than a new home. (And nobody in the service seems to have noticed that the name seems, unfortunately - if aptly - to be a variant of Kafka.) What's more, according to Mr Justice Wall, a senior High Court judge 'with all the administration involved we'll be lucky to have CAFCAs set up with a roof, let alone any fundamental changes'. Those parents who do manage to gain an audience with a judge will face further problems. The standard divorce, money and contact cases coming to court, which are increasing in number, though divorce rates appear to have levelled off, will be heard by part-time judges and judges drawn from the county courts (traditionally known as the 'cut-price' or 'poor man's courts'). So what is going on in the family courts? Are they governed by a disdain for parenting, coupled with a particular suspicion of involved parents? Or perhaps still at work is the influence of a culture - the same one that sends its supposed elite off to boarding school - that does not understand children. How else to explain the stories I was hearing all the time? Stories of judges ignoring women's concerns about domestic violence; stories of the fathers every year who kill their children during their post-divorce contact period. Stories of fathers given an hour a fortnight to spend with their children, post-divorce, causing damage that only those who have been separated from a child can understand. I began taking an interest in family law following my own and friends' divorces, witnessing the reckless decisions I saw being taken about families' lives. At first, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Some of the characters within family courts seem to come straight from the pages of Charles Dickens. Only in the family courts could one hear, as I did last month, the phrase 'in these very modern times in which we live, where some couples cohabit without marrying', uttered by a barrister. Those going through the system are often rendered passive by it. They can see the problems but don't want their whole lives affected, so they choose to 'get on with things' rather than fight back. Or worse, they do fight back, and become manic, angered by the intricate injustices which, in turn, might result in them being seen as the problem. Sarah Heatley's story (see the parent's story below) might offer an extreme case study. But every day routine misery is visited upon parents and children. Over the past few months, The Observer has been exploring the system, spending time watching these daily traumas unfold. The mother, Iris, comes through the plate-glass doors of the family courts building first. She talks about what she thinks will happen that day at court. Her former partner, Dan, has sued for joint residence of their two children. Iris wants sole residence. Iris imagines she will be ushered into a court room with a judge. She doesn't really see the day ahead anymore clearly than that. She knows she is paying 'around \u00a3600' for a barrister to be in court with her that day, whom she has not yet met. There are tables in recesses along the corridor, off which the individual courts lead. The solicitor shepherds Iris to one of these tables, and the barrister arrives. Within the hour, Iris's solicitor, who has the most knowledge of her circumstances, leaves so as to save her client the hourly cost of her services and in order to get on with her own heavy workload. Dan turns up, with a solicitor but no barrister. They sit at another table further down the corridor. The hearing is scheduled for 11am, in half-an-hour's time. A clerk comes out and says the judge is running a bit late. Iris's barrister reads her papers and says she will talk to Dan's solicitor, to see what can be negotiated. The hearing in front of the judge never happens. The mother's barrister and the father's solicitor begin a whole day of back-and-forth, table-hopping negotiations, like over-active hosts at a gala dinner. This controlled frenzy is repeated all along the corridor, and indeed the other floors of this family court building, each time set in relief against the bleached-out faces of the mothers and fathers immobile at their separate tables. None of the professionals - the solicitors, barristers, court welfare officers or indeed the judge - are surprised that the hearing does not take place. It is common practice for a hearing date and time to be fixed, but all the professionals involved come to the court premises with the knowledge that a discussion will take place in the corridors, rather than everybody going into court to put their case before a judge. A 'settlement' is thus forced out of the parties under the worst possible circumstances - the threat of that great indeterminate, the judge, actually deciding the case. It is not a healthy environment in which to make important decisions about one's children. But it is very difficult, unless one is practising in this field, to get a clear picture of how it operates. So much of what is going on in the family courts is secret. Family hearings are most often held 'in chambers', i.e. in private, and not reported. This is for obvious, but not insurmountable, reasons, and it means that much of what goes on is not investigated, or indeed challenged. And in fact, such is the pressure of family work that, around the country, any judge with spare time is pressed into service. On the one hand, lawmakers are talking about the need for an ever more specialised family court. But, in reality, the pressure of work means that pretty much any judge who wants to can obtain what's called a 'family ticket' - the right to sit as a family judge. So parents expose their families to the mercy of whichever judge hears their case. Training, background, what a judge may have read most recently, will all be crucial to the outcome of the case. Family judges have so much work ('10 cases on your desk each morning'), it can be hard for anything bar the most blaring of messages to reach them. Last week a circuit judge, a perfectly kind and gentle person, told me: 'Quite often, you see a man, he tells you that \"when we were married, she drove me mad, and I whacked her. I've never laid a hand on the kids, though, and I wouldn't.\" I must say, I find that quite compelling.' If family court hearings were open, bad practice could be exposed much earlier. We would also all have at least the chance of a clearer idea of what constitutes family law and what fashions are being followed at any time. According to Lord Justice Thorpe, in the early 1990s the Lord Chancellor's Department carried out a consultation about whether family justice should come out from behind closed doors, but the outcome itself was never published - a muffling of the secrecy inquiry worthy of a Blackadder script. But while the political shenanigans continue, parents - and children - carry on suffering. A father fighting right now for overnight contact with his three-year-old daughter (and there are no allegations of damaging behaviour of any kind), told me: 'I've been pursuing this for two years now; last year I almost gave up - I thought it would make more sense all round for me to cut off contact completely and just forget I ever had a child.' The child's story Now 12, Jasmine was seven years old when her parents separated. She did not see her father at all for a period of 10 months, following a court welfare service report recommending restricted contact. She talks about being interviewed by a court welfare officer. After litigating for four years, her father established steady contact. 'It was a bit weird really - I was pulled out of my class, out of lessons to go to see him (the CWO). I didn't know what it was about the first time. 'He came to see me in school about three times, I think. He was stupid. He had these pebbles and he said one pebble was my sister, one was me, one my dad, and one my mum. Then he'd move my sister's pebble over to my dad, and mine over to my mum. It was rubbish. He'd say, do you want to live with your dad? You don't really know what to answer. 'I was about seven or eight then, I think, and I just said, \"I dunno\" or, \"with my mum\" or something. 'Things are good now, I see my dad quite a lot (alternate weekends, and Wednesday evenings), so I don't have to miss him that much. 'When the welfare officer asked me, I just picked my mum. I didn't know what to choose. I remember I felt like I was stuck, I got confused.' The parent's story In 1993 Sarah Heatley's ex-husband killed their two children, Jack and Nina, and then committed suicide, on his first unsupervised contact with them. Sarah now has a four-year-old son, George. She was back in the courts this January, over contact with his father, Jan. 'Jan has shared care of his two older sons by a previous relationship. He always said he wasn't concerned with George, that it complicated things with his older boys. 'He would have George every Saturday for three hours. I didn't think it was worth staying in Sheffield for that, so I took a job in Colchester, with better pay. 'Jan applied for overnight contact with George. I said I wasn't happy with Jan's safety standards. The night I met him it was in a pub, and he'd left his 10-year-old son at home. But the case welfare officer (CWO) and judge recommended overnight contact. 'I felt that they thought, here is a hysterical woman, tread carefully. The CWO said to me, \"I'm afraid we sometimes sanction contact, even when the circumstances are not ideal.\" I was told that I had to oblige, that it was in George's interests. 'In 1997, a television programme took me to meet the judge and the CWO who'd been involved with Nina's and Jack's custody. The CWO expressed no remorse or regrets - he just wanted to vindicate himself on film. 'When I told him I didn't want their father to have unsupervised contact, he'd said: \"There's nothing to be anxious about.\" 'After the camera was switched off, the judge took me to one side and gave me his heartfelt sympathies.

The barrister's story 'You go into court never knowing the outcome, or even knowing whether stuff that's been agreed by both counsel outside the court will be ratified by the judge.

Among the Colombian scientists who met with Sands was Eduardo Posada, president of the Colombian Centre for International Physics, who found Fusarium to be 'highly toxic'. His data found that that the mortality rate among hospital patients who were immune-deficient and in-fected by the fungus was 76 per cent. 'To apply a mycoherbicide from the air that has been associated with a 76 per cent kill rate of hospitalised human patients would be tantamount to biological warfare', he said.",

      "body": "<p>Spain, wrote the great Victorian traveller Richard Ford, is 'a bundle of local units tied together by a rope of sand'. And 150 years later Spaniards are still arguing over what holds and shapes the nation, most recently in a furious debate over teaching history.</p> <p>A report issued last week by the Royal Academy of History complains that the subject is so localised that in some areas children lack any sense of a common past. In the green and Celtic corner of Galicia, for example, textbooks devote only 22 lines to the Second Republic, the Civil War and the Franco dictatorship, yet use 22 pages to detail changes in Galicia over the period.</p> <p>The heaviest guns are reserved for the Basque country where historians accuse the ikastolas , or Basque-language schools, of fomenting racism: 'The history taught is partial and tendentious, inspired by nationalist ideas that encourage racism and the exclusion of common ties.'</p> <p>British historian Raymond Carr says: 'The establishment of a balance between the demands of central government in Madrid and a resistant provincialism helps to map the course of Spanish history.' But the telling of this history has long been a weapon in the political arsenal. During the dictatorship a single historical 'truth' was disseminated, of an imperial Spain, undivided; local languages, such as Basque and Catalan, were banned, as were local histories.</p> <p>The 1978 constitution recognised a 'nation of nations', granted autonomy to 17 regions and with it the right to set up to 45 per cent of the local curriculum. Therefore, textbooks destined for Madrid or Santiago de Compostela or Barcelona are issued in separate editions. 'The word \"Spain\" has been practically wiped out, and instead the phrase \"territorial limits\" is used,' complained Gonzalo Anes, director of the academy. 'The role of politicians should be to learn, and not to take it upon themselves to write history.'</p> <p>The immediate uproar sparked by his report came mostly from nationalist politicians who described it as an attack on the regions in line with a recent hardening of the government's position towards Basque nationalists, in particular.</p> <p>The ikastolas waved aloft EU-prize-winning text-books to illustrate their academic credentials. Catalans wondered why the report was written without the input of a couple of eminent Catalan academicians. Sergi Pami\u00e8s, a prominent Catalan writer, said: 'This is an old argument - part of Spain's inability to understand its many nations. It can show up in laws, in the economy, in the way some resources are distributed. This ghost still walks: not wanting to admit that this is a multi-national country.'</p> <p>He added: 'I know that when my children study history they will be told lies, so it doesn't make any difference if it's a nationalist lie or a Spanish lie - what hurts is that they do it with my taxes.'</p> <p>Alberto Letona, who runs a cultural foundation in Bilbao, said learning about Basque history does not preclude learning about Spanish or European history. 'Under Franco there was no polemic, because we learnt a history that was simply one story, but with the advent of democracy it has become more complicated because each area wanted to reflect its own interests,' says Letona, a supporter of the ikastolas .</p> <p>'With a bit of common sense it could be solved,' says Pami\u00e8s. 'But then we wouldn't be living in Spain' - a country of gloriously varied regions.</p>",

And 150 years later Spaniards are still arguing over what holds and shapes the nation, most recently in a furious debate over teaching history. A report issued last week by the Royal Academy of History complains that the subject is so localised that in some areas children lack any sense of a common past. In the green and Celtic corner of Galicia, for example, textbooks devote only 22 lines to the Second Republic, the Civil War and the Franco dictatorship, yet use 22 pages to detail changes in Galicia over the period. The heaviest guns are reserved for the Basque country where historians accuse the ikastolas , or Basque-language schools, of fomenting racism: 'The history taught is partial and tendentious, inspired by nationalist ideas that encourage racism and the exclusion of common ties.' British historian Raymond Carr says: 'The establishment of a balance between the demands of central government in Madrid and a resistant provincialism helps to map the course of Spanish history.' But the telling of this history has long been a weapon in the political arsenal. During the dictatorship a single historical 'truth' was disseminated, of an imperial Spain, undivided; local languages, such as Basque and Catalan, were banned, as were local histories. The 1978 constitution recognised a 'nation of nations', granted autonomy to 17 regions and with it the right to set up to 45 per cent of the local curriculum. Therefore, textbooks destined for Madrid or Santiago de Compostela or Barcelona are issued in separate editions. 'The word \"Spain\" has been practically wiped out, and instead the phrase \"territorial limits\" is used,' complained Gonzalo Anes, director of the academy. 'The role of politicians should be to learn, and not to take it upon themselves to write history.' The immediate uproar sparked by his report came mostly from nationalist politicians who described it as an attack on the regions in line with a recent hardening of the government's position towards Basque nationalists, in particular. The ikastolas waved aloft EU-prize-winning text-books to illustrate their academic credentials. Catalans wondered why the report was written without the input of a couple of eminent Catalan academicians. Sergi Pami\u00e8s, a prominent Catalan writer, said: 'This is an old argument - part of Spain's inability to understand its many nations. It can show up in laws, in the economy, in the way some resources are distributed. This ghost still walks: not wanting to admit that this is a multi-national country.' He added: 'I know that when my children study history they will be told lies, so it doesn't make any difference if it's a nationalist lie or a Spanish lie - what hurts is that they do it with my taxes.' Alberto Letona, who runs a cultural foundation in Bilbao, said learning about Basque history does not preclude learning about Spanish or European history. 'Under Franco there was no polemic, because we learnt a history that was simply one story, but with the advent of democracy it has become more complicated because each area wanted to reflect its own interests,' says Letona, a supporter of the ikastolas . 'With a bit of common sense it could be solved,' says Pami\u00e8s. 'But then we wouldn't be living in Spain' - a country of gloriously varied regions.",

Some celebrities are notoriously fickle and may move out as quickly as they move in - assuming they move in at all.

It has obviously escaped the attention of your journalists that Whitby and Bridlington are at the seaside.

My remarks (which were made to a small gathering at the Covent Garden Community Association) were entirely to do with ensuring that the best British stage actors were protected from being occasionally elbowed aside by foreign stars.

      "body": "<p>There is a poster currently decorating the walls of many European towns, particularly in France, that shows a rather grey and grim council-type flat. The legend across the image, which promotes Adidas, says simply: 'Everybody comes from somewhere'. The undesirable apartment in the photo was once inhabited by Zinedine Yazid Zidane, or 'Zizou' as he is known in Italy and France, very possibly the finest football player on the planet. </p> <p>Today Zidane, already a world champion, will attempt to lead France to victory in the final of the European Championship. Having turned 28 just over a week ago, the French midfielder is in his prime and is firmly in the process of establishing his name alongside other world all-time greats such as Puskas, Pele, Cruyff, Platini and Maradona. </p> <p>A sportsman of uncharacteristic humility, Zidane tends to be embarrassed by those sorts of comparisons. Although hugely ambitious, his drive to get ahead has been tempered by a strong awareness of where he's come from. The bleak poster home was located in La Castellane, a run-down suburb in the Arab quarter of Marseilles, where Zidane lived with his Algerian parents, Smail and Malika, and their three other French-born sons, Jamel, Farid and Nourredine, and sister, Lila. Zidane moved his parents to a sumptuous villa soon after becoming wealthy. Of his father, he once said: 'He has been my guide in life. He has worked hard for very little return, but for him life is still about human relationships rather than money.' </p> <p>Often described as a no-go area, owing to the fear it inspires in the town's more conservative citizens, La Castellane is really a no-leave district. There are few opportunities for its largely North African-origin population to get out and make their mark. Which is why Zidane enjoys unparalleled cult status in the high-rise blocks that surround the old Mediterranean port. </p> <p>The footballer acknowledged the support a while back by paying for the clubhouse for a local football side, the Association des Jeunes de la Nouvelle Vague. If his constituency is La Castellane, his rule nevertheless extends right across France. The two goals he scored in the 1998 World Cup final against Brazil guaranteed him a special place in the hearts of his countrymen. That game - in which, to the disgust of Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front, France fielded a team from various ethnic backgrounds - also served to usher in a sense of a new multi-cultural France. And at its creative centre was Zidane, the son of an Algerian supermarket worker. After the match, his image was projected on to the Arc de Triomphe with the message: 'Merci Zizou.' </p> <p>But it nearly didn't happen like that. Zidane was sent off in the qualifying rounds of France 98 for stamping on the captain of the Saudi Arabian team. Doubters immediately turned to that old saw about being able to take the boy out of the ghetto but not the ghetto out of the boy. </p> <p>It was a curious criticism because very often Zidane had been accused of appearing too cold and controlled. In fact, Zidane has long possessed an unlikely combination of street-toughness and a Zen-like calm. Jean Varraud, the Cannes scout who first spotted Zizou playing for his boys club, Septemes, recalls the promising teenager quietly walking across the pitch to head-butt an opponent. </p> <p>'I immediately saw this boy would become a great player,' recalls Varraud. 'He had an exceptional speed of foot that I've never seen before or since. Also he had this warrior side that you find in kids from underprivileged neighbourhoods. He was hungry.' </p> <p>One story has it that a director at Cannes was furious with Varraud for bringing the 16-year-old Zidane to the club. 'What are you thinking of?' he is supposed to have asked. 'Putting an Arab in the team? Are you mad?' But it was another Cannes director, Jean-Claude Elineau, who invited the youngster to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that it was living with the Elineaus that he 'found equilibrium'. </p> <p>In school, according to his mother, he had been 'a bit distracted'. He practised judo and messed around on a skateboard but football was always his obsession. He used to watch games on TV and felt a magical exhilaration. 'I had an impression of another world, a world of dreams. I couldn't imagine one day it would be mine.' </p> <p>At Cannes he met his wife, V\u00e9ronique, a dancer. Together now for more than 10 years, they have two boys, Enzo and Luca, names that have not entirely pleased the more militant Muslims among the player's hometown fans (Zidane see himself as a Muslim but does not practise the faith). </p> <p>A French sports journalist who remembers Zidane at Cannes describes him then as being 'very lean but with more hair'. A tall, well-built man today, with noble poise and handsomely genial features, Zidane is no friend of the over-head camera. From above, you can see the monkish bald patch that adds years to the already mature-looking man on view from the pitch. In an age of saturation marketing and total image, Zidane's alopecia may possibly have meant that he is lagging behind in the superstar stakes in comparison to, say, the tonsorially blessed (if shaven) David Beckham. </p> <p>Not that he would be concerned with such matters. Rather he sees himself, in the words of one French journalist who knows him, as a 'craftsman of football'. Certainly, while learning his trade at Cannes, he would not even have hallucinated thoughts of fame and riches. He was overjoyed to receive a \u00a3500 bonus on making his first-team debut one month short of his seventeenth birthday in 1989. He immediately sent the money to his parents. A year later he was given a red Renault Clio by the Cannes president and doubtless confusing it for a sports car, spent his leisure hours cruising up and down the Croisette. </p> <p>From Cannes he was transferred to Bordeaux in 1992 and made his debut for France two years later. He scored twice in that game and went on to be voted the young French player of the year. In 1996 it was time to move again, but this time abroad to Italy. </p> <p>Leaving aside its sunny climate and glorious belle \u00e9poque architecture, Marseilles is in many ways reminiscent of English port towns like Liverpool or Newcastle. It has the same kind of provincial independence and bullish identity. So when the young man from La Castellane went to join Juventus in the Alpine city of Turin, he took a friend from home with him. </p> <p>The Geordie Paul Gascoigne did a similar thing when he left England for Lazio in Rome. The difference being that Zidane's friend was a sensible chap called Malek, while Gazza was accompanied by the perpetually thirsty Jimmy Five Bellies. It was one of many smart decisions that has enabled Zidane, who was endowed with similar skills to Gascoigne, to go on to become peerless while the Englishman has remained but one of a number of gifted players who never fulfilled their potential. </p> <p>Again, it was not an easy path for Zidane. When he joined up with Juve, he had just finished playing for France in Euro 96, a tournament that was for him a bitter personal disappointment, not least because he was carrying an injury. Having seen Zidane's lacklustre performances, Gianni Agnelli, the legendary president of Juve, expressed the idea that perhaps he had granted funds (what turned out to be a bargain \u00a33.5 million) for the wrong player. But Michel Platini, the sublime French midfield artist who played for Juve in the Eighties, was quick to reassure Agnelli that he had not made a mistake, as would soon become apparent. </p> <p>Zidane has won two Serie A titles with Juventus as well as losing twice in the final of the European Champions League Cup. His team-mate, the irrepressible Dutchman, Edgar Davids, has said of Zizou: 'He is the footballer I admire most.' </p> <p>At the 1998 World Cup, Cesare Maldini, the manager of the Italian team, said: 'I would give up five players to have Zizou in my squad.' Footballers throughout the game seem to respect Zidane because while he is an individual who can do just about anything with a ball, he is also an out-and-out team player and one who does not freeze on the big occasion. In 1998 he was voted European and World Footballer of the Year. And he has improved since then. Zidane attributes much of his progress to playing in Italy. He singles out the influence of Piero Ventrone, the Juventus fitness trainer, for dramatically increasing his explosive power (the use of body-building drugs has put Juve under scrutiny by the football authorities in recent years). </p> <p>Yet there are signs that he may leave Italy soon. His wife is said not to like Turin and there has been talk of a move to Spain or even back to France. 'My heart beats for Olympic Marseille,' he has said, referring to the club he supported as a boy. </p> <p>But with the way he has played for France in the past few weeks, it's unlikely that Juve would let him go or that Marseilles could afford him. He seems to have everything. An immense strength is allied to the most delicate touch. Looking at his upper body you would never guess at the swift subtlety expressed below the knees. He can run with the ball but is also able to make pinpoint long and short passes without breaking stride. And he scores unforgettable goals. </p> <p>The whole package has left him indispensable to France. 'If he is not there,' said Aime Jacquet, the French manager during the World Cup, 'the team is not the same.' </p> <p>One of the ways that it is not the same is that it also tends not to include Zidane's great friend Christophe Dugarry. According to observers of the French national side, Zidane's influence rivals that of Didier Deschamps, the captain, and it said that if they do not rate a player, he does not make it into the team. Equally, many feel that Dugarry would not have made it into the World Cup squad in 98 without the bond he has formed with Zidane. </p> <p>Coming into the tournament, some wondered if Zidane, who admits to an almost poetic sensitivity, might have been adversely affected by the manner in which Juve needlessly lost the Italian championship on the last day. He returned to Marseilles for a while to recharge his batteries and to attempt to forget the Italian campaign. 'I tried to make myself feel better by telling myself that soccer is just a sport,' he said. 'However, this technique did not work.' </p> <p>Unusually for a professional footballer, Zidane is still boyishly in love with the game. Following a Juventus fixture on Sunday afternoons the whole team goes to a restaurant in Turin to unwind together. In Italy the the evening match is televised. As the rest of the players chat, Zidane will sit staring at the TV, the kid from La Castellane entranced by a game that no one else can play as well as him. </p> <p><strong> Zinedine Yazid Zidane</strong></p> <p>AKA: Zizou </p> <p>DoB: 23 June 1972 (Marseille) </p> <p>Family: Married to V\u00e9ronique (two sons - Enzo, 6, and Luca, 3) </p> <p>Clubs: Cannes, Bordeaux, Juventus </p> <p>Honours: Italian league champion (1997, 1998); European Super Cup (1997); Intercontinental Cup (1997); World Cup (1998) </p> <p>Internationals: 55 (15 goals)</p>",

That's what happened.'</p> <p>However, I believe that, in the course of that same interview, Aspinall let his guard drop for a moment and unwittingly gave the lie to his own story.

His wife wanted to call the doctor but of course he would not allow it: he insisted he would do the interview as soon as he'd been bandaged.</p> <p>Half an hour later he reappeared and the butler served tea. Aspinall still seemed shaky but warmed up as he expatiated on a Rider Haggard novel called Nada the Lily which apparently gave him his lifelong 'Zulu' philosophy (basically - animals good, humans bad). He also told a delightful story about how, in his twenties, he had discovered that Colonel Aspinall of the Indian Medical Service was not his real father, and that he was conceived under a tamarisk tree beside a lake in Uttar Pradesh on the night of the regimental ball.

She now works in South Africa as a hotel manager and that is where she intends to stay for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>She is currently back in London for a couple of months to sort out her financial affairs and sell her flat, which is on the market. She has had the property in Bethnal Green in London since 1988, when she bought it for \u00a365,000 with a 100 per cent endowment mortgage. </p> <p>She is hoping the flat will fetch between \u00a3115,000 and \u00a3120,000. After paying off her mortgage, fees and her debts, she would like to invest the remainder here before she leaves. </p> <p>She is prepared to tie up the money for five years but then wants it to be accessible in case she decides to return to the UK and wants to buy another property. </p> <p>She is not sure what her options are as a non-taxpayer and is looking for an investment that she can leave here without having to manage it. </p> <p>She would also like to have some money available in a bank account, say \u00a32,500-\u00a35,000, in case she decides to continue her travels. </p> <p>After selling her property, she is wondering what to do about her mortgage endowment policy with Legal &amp; General. She is prepared to keep up the \u00a378 per month premium payments for the full term, but is not sure whether it is worthwhile now that she has seen the bad press endowments have been receiving. </p> <p>She also has a personal pension with Legal &amp; General, which was started when she opted out of Serps in 1988. Her National Insurance contribution rebates were paid into the plan until she left the UK in 1995. She is curious to know what has happened to this plan. </p> <p>She is also concerned about making more provision for her retirement since she has no pension scheme in South Africa. </p> <p>She says: 'I have been advised that I cannot start a pension here [UK] as a non-taxpayer. Is this correct?' </p> <p>She is interested in her tax status generally, and would like to know what would happen if she returned to the UK to work. </p> <p>She says: 'I don't expect to be eligible for any [tax] rebate for my last year of work in 1995 as it was so long ago, but would like to know where I stand, considering I quite literally disappeared.' </p> <p>Her only other remaining financial interest in the UK is 200 Halifax shares which she wonders whether to keep. </p> <p>In South Africa her wages are more than adequate to maintain her standard of living and her accommodation and bills are paid for. </p> <p> <strong>Adviser 1: Tony Shah</strong><br>Providing Lizzie has not entered the UK on visits of more than 183 days in a tax year or 90 days on average, she will be regarded as non-resident for tax purposes and does not need to pay UK tax on assets held abroad. As she left the UK five years ago, she will be able to sell her UK property without paying capital gains tax. </p> <p>The net proceeds from the sale of the flat should be invested offshore so she can benefit from the funds growing free of tax. There are many offshore investments available from UK institutions, but she needs to consider several factors, such as the term of the investment. </p> <p>Her attitude to risk is another consideration. Does she want to invest in cautious funds that can reduce volatility but also limit returns, such as with-profits funds, or is she prepared to invest in stock markets? </p> <p>When Lizzie returns to the UK, she will become liable for UK tax again on a worldwide basis. So if she wants to use the proceeds of her investment bond for home purchase, she should make sure she sells it beforehand rather than waiting until the tax year in which she returns. </p> <p>She should keep her Legal &amp; General endowment going as the surrender value will be poor. </p> <p>It is true that she cannot take out a UK pension while living away, and nor can she do much with her Serps pension. She will need to sort all that out on her return.</p> <p>\u0095 Tony Shah works for financial adviser Towry Law. </p> <p><strong>Advisor 2: Robert Rackcliffe</strong><br> For the money Lizzie raises from the sale of her flat, we would normally consider offshore investments, where interest can be paid gross without deduction of tax. </p> <p>There are a number of excellent offshore investment bonds designed to run for at least four or five years but which allow the investor to withdraw up to 80 per cent of capital without penalty.

She now works in South Africa as a hotel manager and that is where she intends to stay for the foreseeable future. She is currently back in London for a couple of months to sort out her financial affairs and sell her flat, which is on the market. She has had the property in Bethnal Green in London since 1988, when she bought it for \u00a365,000 with a 100 per cent endowment mortgage. She is hoping the flat will fetch between \u00a3115,000 and \u00a3120,000. After paying off her mortgage, fees and her debts, she would like to invest the remainder here before she leaves. She is prepared to tie up the money for five years but then wants it to be accessible in case she decides to return to the UK and wants to buy another property. She is not sure what her options are as a non-taxpayer and is looking for an investment that she can leave here without having to manage it. She would also like to have some money available in a bank account, say \u00a32,500-\u00a35,000, in case she decides to continue her travels. After selling her property, she is wondering what to do about her mortgage endowment policy with Legal &amp; General. She is prepared to keep up the \u00a378 per month premium payments for the full term, but is not sure whether it is worthwhile now that she has seen the bad press endowments have been receiving. She also has a personal pension with Legal &amp; General, which was started when she opted out of Serps in 1988. Her National Insurance contribution rebates were paid into the plan until she left the UK in 1995. She is curious to know what has happened to this plan. She is also concerned about making more provision for her retirement since she has no pension scheme in South Africa. She says: 'I have been advised that I cannot start a pension here [UK] as a non-taxpayer. Is this correct?' She is interested in her tax status generally, and would like to know what would happen if she returned to the UK to work. She says: 'I don't expect to be eligible for any [tax] rebate for my last year of work in 1995 as it was so long ago, but would like to know where I stand, considering I quite literally disappeared.' Her only other remaining financial interest in the UK is 200 Halifax shares which she wonders whether to keep. In South Africa her wages are more than adequate to maintain her standard of living and her accommodation and bills are paid for. Adviser 1: Tony Shah Providing Lizzie has not entered the UK on visits of more than 183 days in a tax year or 90 days on average, she will be regarded as non-resident for tax purposes and does not need to pay UK tax on assets held abroad. As she left the UK five years ago, she will be able to sell her UK property without paying capital gains tax. The net proceeds from the sale of the flat should be invested offshore so she can benefit from the funds growing free of tax. There are many offshore investments available from UK institutions, but she needs to consider several factors, such as the term of the investment. Her attitude to risk is another consideration. Does she want to invest in cautious funds that can reduce volatility but also limit returns, such as with-profits funds, or is she prepared to invest in stock markets? When Lizzie returns to the UK, she will become liable for UK tax again on a worldwide basis. So if she wants to use the proceeds of her investment bond for home purchase, she should make sure she sells it beforehand rather than waiting until the tax year in which she returns. She should keep her Legal &amp; General endowment going as the surrender value will be poor. It is true that she cannot take out a UK pension while living away, and nor can she do much with her Serps pension. She will need to sort all that out on her return. \u0095 Tony Shah works for financial adviser Towry Law. Advisor 2: Robert Rackcliffe For the money Lizzie raises from the sale of her flat, we would normally consider offshore investments, where interest can be paid gross without deduction of tax. There are a number of excellent offshore investment bonds designed to run for at least four or five years but which allow the investor to withdraw up to 80 per cent of capital without penalty. This should provide Lizzie with the access she needs should she return to the UK and want to buy another property. As an investment bond does not produce any interest, it would not need to be declared for income tax purposes in South Africa. Another advantage of an offshore bond is that it can be considered similar to an offshore pension fund. If Lizzie returned to the UK, she would have the option of taking withdrawals from the investment as income. If Lizzie invested \u00a340,000 in an offshore investment bond, she could place the balance, say \u00a35,000, in an offshore high-interest current account. Her existing pension with Legal &amp; General should remain invested to provide benefits at Lizzie's normal retirement age. We would recommend that she continue with her endowment policy, as 25-year maturing policies are still yielding excellent returns and surrender values are generally poor mid-term. \u0095 Robert Rackliffe works for financial adviser Jackson Battern . \u0095 Advice is for guidance only.",

Highly controversial, however, is the plan to 'require lone parents of secondary-school-age children to be actively seeking work'. The Tories would be very tough on some benefit claimants. For claimants who need money for emergencies and capital costs, such as new shoes or new cookers, spending would be cut by about a sixth. The Tories also guarantee that 'at the end of the Parliament, the next Conservative government will take a smaller share of the nation's income in tax than at the beginning'.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>People are surprisingly passionate about potatoes. The merest mention of them to my (American) hairdresser brought forth a eulogy, not for the Idaho potato, which is famous in its homeland and even forms the logo of a posh restaurant in north London (Idaho, 13 North Hill, London N6, 020 8341 6633), but for the Ukon Gold. And while the Idaho is so firmly wedded to its native soil that it refuses to produce anything of substance elsewhere, the Ukon Gold is occasionally available in this country.</p> <p>Alan Wilson, agronomist for Waitrose and author of The Story of the Potato , grows them in his garden. 'It's a beautiful, round, yellow, buttery potato,' he says. So when will they be for sale in his own supermarket? This is a good question, apparently, and one which may have a positive outcome if enough people ask for it at a two-day public potato event to be held in conjunction with the HDRA - The Organic Association on 7 and 8 October (at Ryton Organic Gardens, Coventry, 01203 303 517). To be fair, Waitrose has pioneered the commercialisation of old-fashioned, threatened potato varieties, without which they would face de-listing from the UK and European seed catalogues. Right now in its stores you should be able to buy Kestrel, Duke of York, Carlingford and Red King Edward, which is a variety successfully rescued by the campaign.</p> <p>If it's a talking point that you're looking for, then Sainsbury's will offer the Blue Congo potato from Finland in October (when all maincrop, as opposed to new or early potato varieties, become available). It is said to make a 'lovely purple mash', which will probably appeal to customers already hooked on Terra blue potato crisps.</p> <p>Would it be cynical to wonder whether blue crisps are the ones always left over at parties?

      "bodyText": "People are surprisingly passionate about potatoes. The merest mention of them to my (American) hairdresser brought forth a eulogy, not for the Idaho potato, which is famous in its homeland and even forms the logo of a posh restaurant in north London (Idaho, 13 North Hill, London N6, 020 8341 6633), but for the Ukon Gold. And while the Idaho is so firmly wedded to its native soil that it refuses to produce anything of substance elsewhere, the Ukon Gold is occasionally available in this country. Alan Wilson, agronomist for Waitrose and author of The Story of the Potato , grows them in his garden. 'It's a beautiful, round, yellow, buttery potato,' he says. So when will they be for sale in his own supermarket? This is a good question, apparently, and one which may have a positive outcome if enough people ask for it at a two-day public potato event to be held in conjunction with the HDRA - The Organic Association on 7 and 8 October (at Ryton Organic Gardens, Coventry, 01203 303 517). To be fair, Waitrose has pioneered the commercialisation of old-fashioned, threatened potato varieties, without which they would face de-listing from the UK and European seed catalogues. Right now in its stores you should be able to buy Kestrel, Duke of York, Carlingford and Red King Edward, which is a variety successfully rescued by the campaign. If it's a talking point that you're looking for, then Sainsbury's will offer the Blue Congo potato from Finland in October (when all maincrop, as opposed to new or early potato varieties, become available). It is said to make a 'lovely purple mash', which will probably appeal to customers already hooked on Terra blue potato crisps. Would it be cynical to wonder whether blue crisps are the ones always left over at parties? No matter, for there is one issue that is infinitely more important than novel varieties.

      "body": "<p>Saturday night, Sunday morning. It's 1.30am and we're weaving off London's Old Kent Road, down dark, lonely side streets, past abandoned warehouses, over shattered glass. We round a corner and - watch out! - almost smack into a Mercedes SLK doing a three-point turn. We wait, then slope slowly on down the street, past a scene unimaginable from only a couple of roads away, a scene familiar and gratifying to anyone who's ever been to a nightclub on the basis of a scrawled address, the hallelujah welcome sign that says you've made it. Well: you've found it. </p> <p>People. Hundreds and hundreds of people. Groups of girls clack past, screeching into mobiles, showing off, looking for friends. Boys spill up from round the corner, neatly dressed and coiffed, to eye the enormous queue - three people wide, 200 yards long - that hems the blank brick wall of the club, before pitching up at its end. Some march to the front of the line, but are swiftly disaffected of their delusions of superior status by the bouncers, who aren't so much heavy-handed as just heavy. Still, a spot of sweet talk and we queue-hop. Through a metal detector, on to a clothes-bag-and-body-search that would shame Heathrow, and in. Three vast rooms, each progressively darker, both in lighting and sounds. The darkest is the most popular: we arrive just in time for the PA from Colour Girl, who performs her latest single, 'Joyrider'. Once she's off, the DJ slams on some moodier, harder music. The crowd goes bananas.</p> <p>It's fantastic to see. A group of perfectly turned out, seemingly aloof young men, who'd been standing around as though training for cool school, suddenly and simultaneously throw some joyful, eye-popping moves. They continue to do so for as long as the DJ plays the tunes they like: often not very long, given his habit of letting each track last all of a minute and a half. Low-attention-span clubbing. On the stage, a gaggle of lads argy-bargy as to who gets to chat over the records.</p> <p>There are more girls in the other rooms. And what girls they are. Of all shapes, ages, colours, they are united in their rejection of unnecessary clothing. The skimpiest of skirts and hankiest of tops are uniform, as are glamour heels. Their hair is twisted into works of art. In many clubs, this could lead to snooty attitudes towards other women: here, the toilets chatter with compliments - 'Lookin' good, girl!' The good humour stands in contrast to the hassle getting in. The friendliness of the clubbers goes against long-held assumptions about this area of south-east London and, in particular, about the kind of people that are into the skippy drums, cut-up vocals and hard basslines of the music now known as UK garage. </p> <p> You might not think you know about UK garage, but you do. It's what pours from every car, thumps out of every window, clogs up the compilation racks in Our Price and HMV. It packs out Under-18 nights and goes on student-union tours. It's what you hear when you flip across your radio on a Saturday night. It's 'Re-Rewind', 'Sweet Like Chocolate', 'Little Bit Of Luck', 'Never Gonna Let You Go', 'Girls Like Us', 'Thong Song', 'Buggin\". It beats Steps into third place in the Top 20, after Craig David's 'Fill Me In' and Sweet Female Attitude's 'Flowers'. It's all those pop songs with those light 'n' frisky drums. </p> <p>Forget Ibiza Uncovered and, these days, Overexposed . Take a summer trip to Cyprus instead, to the once sleepy town of Ayia Napa. You'll meet Radio 1 there, and MTV. Or talk to the punters at Twice As Nice, the packed-to-the-rafters Sunday night UK garage club held at central London's The End. Ask Sarah, who's 32, a dressed-to-the-99s sales accountant who sometimes spends \u00a3200 on going out over the weekend. She used to go to 'field raves' in the early 90s, but then didn't bother clubbing until UK garage became big. </p> <p>'Yeah, it made me start going out again,' she says. 'I like the vibe, I like the music. I love soul, too, but soul to me isn't for coming out. But with garage, I can dance to it and that's the main attraction. I like the people, too, because a lot of the girls are nice, they're trendy. And there's no attitude at all. Everyone comes out to enjoy themselves. They don't stand around, you know, just looking bored.' </p> <p>'Everyone's coming out for this atmosphere now,' says Vanessa, who's 21 and works in advertising. 'It's nice to be in a club and to see loads of different people, new people every week. It shows that it's alive.' </p> <p>Keep talking and you'll find out that - blimey! - even the boys are positive. Peter, who's a security guard at the Old Bailey, is happy to explain the appeal. 'I like the vibe, the people, the music, the chicks,' he grins. 'The chicks are more sophisticated, sexy. It's not like any other club... I met my wife here a year ago. I was a little bit tipsy and she came up to me and rescued me and took me home. When we have kids, I'll get my mum to look after them and we'll both come to Twice as Nice.' </p> <p> But it's not just the clubbers who are enjoying themselves. UK garage has started to give the British music industry the shake-up it's needed for the past five years. Dave Norton is a PR for Four Liberty Records, an Eastender whose first musical influences were Chuck Berry and Little Richard (he's 43). He is over the moon about UK garage. 'I'm someone who's always been totally in love with black music,' he enthuses. 'Through the 70s, with James Brown, through the 80s with the jazz funk and soul, into the 90s... UK garage is a continuation of this wonderful legacy. Plus, it's British, it's our version. </p> <p>There's so many influences that have been added into the stew. If you look at current American black music, essentially it's just a version of early soul and disco. With UK garage, there are those influences, but there's also dancehall reggae, drum and bass, even hardcore in there, too. It's a broad church and it's bringing everyone in. If you held up a mirror to what's going on culturally in the UK today, then UK garage would look back at you. It's going to dominate the charts.' </p> <p>Or meet Nigel Blunt, who manages Oracabessa, a Birmingham-based record label set up by Ali Campbell from UB40. Nigel's a laidback man whose CV includes band, label and club management from as far back as the New Romantic era. Nigel is not usually moved to over-enthusiasm, but even he's bubbling. 'You can press 1,000 copies of your single, get it rinsing in a disco, and within weeks it can be dropping on national radio, if The Dreem Teem pick up on it,' he grins. 'The music scene has never had so few rules. It's like the Wild West out there, I tell you. The last time I saw excitement like this was punk. It's just black people this time.' </p> <p>Sensational prospects for a music that began so humbly. Here's the story. In 1993, in a grotty south London pub called the Elephant and Castle, a clever promoter called Timmy Ram Jam decided to try and catch the late-night clubbers stumbling out of the Ministry of Sound. He started his club at 6am. Now-established UK garage DJs like Matt Jam Lamont and Mickey Simms played tuneful American house music: but, crucially, played the records a bit too fast. This was for two reasons. First: British crowds - for some long-acknowledged but inexplicable reason - have always liked their music faster-tempoed than Americans. Second: the clubbers had been up all night. The DJs wanted to keep them awake. </p> <p>From there, the club moved to the big- ger, but no more salubrious, Frog and Nightgown on the Old Kent Road, then the Arches in Southwark, and finally, to the Colliseum at Vauxhall. It picked up DJs, MCs, pirate radio coverage and plenty of punters along the way. Twice As Nice every Sunday night at the Colliseum started in 1997. Within weeks, it had legendary status, boasting DJs such as EZ (now on Kiss FM) and The Dreem Teem - producers and DJs Spoony, Timmi Magic and Mikee B, now on Radio 1. </p> <p>I went to Twice As Nice in 1998. It was rammed. There were so many people spilling out of the club on to the road that they literally stopped the traffic. Inside, the atmosphere was uplifting and full of energy: plenty of posing, but even more dancing, breaking loose, proper night-of-your-lifetime clubbing. Everything about the club seemed completely new to me. It had its own sound: skippy drums, boot-shuddering bass and uplifting vocals. It had its own look: dressy, exclusive, designer-labelled - the boys in head-to-toe Moschino and Versace, the girls likewise, though not so warmly wrapped. It had its own tipple: champagne. Far from wanting to drop a pill and veg out, the new crew wanted to keep their cool, dance well, look great. And it had its own ambience: it was racially mixed (very unusual in clubland) and inclusively friendly (unusual in an underground club). It was inevitable that the press would pick up on it. </p> <p>Unfortunately, when it did, it got things slightly wrong. The media concentrated on the champagne-BMW-designer-label lifestyle, as opposed to the music. Then, because the flourishing club scene didn't immediately translate into chart-hit records, the press turned away, talking flash-in-the-pan, leaving those involved in the scene smarting and irritated. </p> <p>Richard Benson was one of the first journalists outside the music press to champion the UK garage scene. He says: 'Everyone who went to garage clubs three or four years ago could see what was happening, because the music made sense there,' he says, 'but it took a long time to replicate the excitement of the clubs on vinyl. The Next Big Thing was actually jumping up and down and asking for support for years, but the media chose to ignore or misrepresent it.' </p> <p>In those years, when UK garage was filling the clubs, but not being played on mainstream radio, the role of pirate radio was fundamental. Benson visited Ice FM, one of London's most popular pirates, which broadcasted from ex-fireman Ricky D's kitchen. He recalls Technics decks on the worktops, memos to DJs Blu-tacked on the fridge, empty champagne bottles in one corner, boxes of 12in vinyl singles in all the others, and, sitting on the windowsill, the 'horn'. The horn, like a 6in mini-loudhailer, is a cheap piece of broadcasting equipment that beams the music to a transmitter atop another block of flats. </p> <p>The pirates broke and still break those independent label records that suddenly and rudely gate-crash the top 10. They pick up on tracks that go down well in clubs, and the listeners tape the shows, then take the tapes to record shops to get the vinyl. Between 1997 and 2000, with the mainstream media so shy of the culture, the pirates cleaned up: their number in London alone has almost quadrupled since 1996. </p> <p>Four years on, and the UK garage hits are coming thick and fast. DJs Mark Hill and Pete Devereux, alias Artful Dodger, who gave us 'Re-Rewind' (which launched teen- age lover-crooner Craig David), 'Movin' Too Fast', and now 'Woman Trouble' have already sold in excess of 1 million records. Producers such as Truesteppers, Wookie and Zed Bias are in ouch-that's- hot demand. And, after a couple of years in which most vocals seemed to be supplied by American r'n'b artists (producers would take the a cappella version of a single by Whitney Houston, Brandy, Destiny's Child and do a bootleg remix), British vocalists are coming through. </p> <p>We all know about 'making love on a Tuesday, Wednesday, etc, etc' Craig David; now there's Alan Shearer-in-a-suit Robbie Craig, Stockport bargirls Sweet Female Attitude, potential pop queen Colour Girl, even Neneh Cherry, whose career got a shot in the arm with The Dreem Teem's remix of Buddy X. And it's not just British performers who are benefiting from UK garage's Midas touch. Oracabessa is mining a rich seam of talent from Jamaica, and has already had hits with Mr Vegas's 'Heads High' and B15 Projects' 'Girls Like Us'. </p> <p>UK garage, because it was given time to develop at its own pace, away from press glare and major label cherry-picking, is now throwing up more talent than any other pop genre. 'I think the reason why UK garage works is that you can throw in anything, it'll go in the mix,' says writer and singer Colour Girl, real name Becky, an Essex girl with a two-year-old son. 'A screaming diva vocal, something haunting, like Wookie, or Witchidam, for the reggae.' </p> <p>Colour Girl herself came from house music, but now finds UK garage more fulfilling. 'I don't often feel proud about being British, but I do with UK garage. For years, we were left behind by America. They had the best hip-hop, r'n'b, soul, house music. Now we've come up with our own unique music. Let's just hope it's got enough legs to trot over the Atlantic and kick some arse.' </p> <p>Writer-singers like Colour Girl, Craig David and the amazingly soulful Robbie Craig are to be f ted in an industry that has relied for many years on boy/girl/combination-bands that sing, dance, look pretty, but don't pen tunes. UK garage producers can write, too. Artful Dodger are classically trained. Another who looks as though he could become a star - though not, perhaps, in the hold-the-front-page mould - is 27-year-old polite-as-you-like Wookie. Wookie (real name Jason Chue: Chue-Chewbacca-Wookie-geddit?) has an LP coming out later this year: 'There'll be tracks of the same speed as UK garage, but the mood will be lower, you wouldn't play them out.' He's self-taught - he wrote all his first tunes on a \u00a31,100 keyboard - and part of Jazzie B's Soul II Soul crew. (They met six years ago when Wookie was renting a flat from Jazzie's barber.) Wookie's already remixed Gabrielle, Whitney Houston, Brandy, Angie Stone and is an example of what The Dreem Teem's Timmi Magic calls the 'depth' of the UK garage scene. 'It isn't just bedroom producers,' says Timmi. 'There are legitimate songwriters, like Wookie, and K Warren, Dubaholics, TJ Cases_ they're another reason why this scene will last. They can write.' </p> <p> Sunday afternoon at Radio 1. The Dreem Teem have just come off air from their 10am-1pm show. All three have been up all night DJing at clubs, and now, though their stint is over, they can't stop. They have to discuss and approve a TV ad for their mix LP (part of the INcredible series), and go through what will happen for a telly programme to be made around their Ayia Napa trip. They'll be there, with Radio 1, on 21-23 July. They munch chocolate bars and crisps to keep up their energy. </p> <p>The Dreem Teem are possibly the most well known DJs of the UK garage scene, mostly because of their Radio 1 show. (Other DJs, like EZ and Artful Dodger, have prime-time Kiss slots, but Kiss only broadcasts in London.) They met in 1996 through working on the same pirate radio station: Spoony played US garage; Timmi Magic came from acid house; Mikee B was into drum and bass and hardcore - et voil\u00e0, the essential ingredients of UK garage. Since then, they've become a respected production team as well as building on their club and radio DJing. </p> <p>The Dreem Teem came to Radio 1 via shows on Kiss and on Galaxy, a station which broadcasts almost everywhere in the UK, except London - thus disproving the UK garage 'is a London thing' theory. They're very different characters: Timmi, who oversees their production work, is the most naturally lively and jokey; Mikee is laid-back and only contributes to conversations when he has to; Spoony is the spokesman, a man who can argue his corner and who is keen to represent UK garage in what he feels is its correct light. </p> <p>'When people write about the house scene, they don't write about sweaty people with their tops off any more,' he points out. 'So why do they always write about the champagne and the suits? It's too easy. For the record, only one of us three has a BMW. And one of us doesn't even drink champagne.' </p> <p>The Dreem Teem believe that UK garage will stick around because it's strong in so many areas. It has a healthy clubscene that's now spread nationally, a thriving and long-established pirate radio stage; plus, now, mainstream chart hits, mainstream radio play, and telly-friendly Ayia Napa for those who want a holiday. All backed up by talented writers, producers, singers and MCs: 'MCs are our rappers,' says Timmi. 'Instead of Mel C featuring Left Eye, soon it'll be Baby Spice featuring PSG.' </p> <p> Friday afternoon at Uptown Records on D'Arblay Street in London's Soho. The basement is mobbed: there are queues at the desk and at the turntables at the back of the shop, where customers can try out the wares. Check that the record they're listening to is the one they want. 'We get a lot of people coming in and singing to us,' smiles 28-year-old Huckleberry Finn, who's in charge of the underground music section. 'People play tapes down the phone of stuff they've heard on pirates. I've had kids come up and go: You got the song with the bass? I'm going: Well, is it a soft bass? A hard bass? Does it go woooooooh?' </p> <p>Huckleberry has an ear for hits: he bought in the very first white-label copies of 'Flowers', 'Little Bit Of Luck', 'Buggin\", 'Girls Like Us'. He tells me that the next track to look out for will be 'Can I Get Your Number' by Obi: 'That's my top tip.' His tips have started to pay off: several major record labels are sniffing about, offering him A&amp;R consultancy deals, because 'they miss so much they shouldn't. There's a lot of homegrown talent that's going unspotted.' </p> <p>Huckleberry, like The Dreem Teem, came up through the pirates, via soul, rave and hardcore. And, like The Dreem Teem, he's concerned with spreading the message: in his case, worldwide, developing contacts with Japan, America, Switzerland. 'The whole scene happened naturally,' he says. 'It was an accident, there was no bandwagon to be jumped on. We all know each other and we plodded along, doing our thing, helping each other out, you know - you do a mix for me and I'll do one for you - there's been no money involved.' </p> <p>But now, of course, there is. And it alters things. 'There's no extra people involved,' says Huckleberry. 'It's not like we're finding new fans under the carpet. They're coming into our scene from other ones, like we did. So, if that scene is trance, or house, and if over the last year you've lost 15 per cent of your trance or house fans to UK garage, then that's a problem for some people.' </p> <p>He means the long-established, multi-millionaire house and trance DJs that still dominate Radio 1's prime Friday and Saturday night slots. Pete Tong, Judge Jules, Danny Rampling: they all came out of the acid house scene of the late 80s and they are unlikely to give up their top-boy positions easily. One wonders why The Dreem Teem aren't given an early night Friday slot, where they could break out of the daytime playlist and DJ as they did on Kiss or Galaxy or just be free to play their own choice of records. </p> <p>It seems that 2000 could be UK garage's year. Admittedly, there are many people who can't stand the skippety drums and mucked-up vocals, but to stand in the way of a genuinely multiracial, thoroughly friendly, utterly new-sounding, exciting, innovative, fresh British music is just plain churlish. Its variations are vast, from the Jamaican connection with Oracabessa to the pop- tastic 'Flowers' girls; from the sweet nu soul vocals of Lain, who sings with Wookie, through the sample gimmick of 'I Don't Smoke Da Reefer' (taken from comedian Marcus Brigstocke, not Jim Davidson, as has been reported) all the way to the growl of MC Neat. It's the soundtrack to the suburbs, the beat of the street. It's aiming for America and it's as mainstream as we want it to be. And just how mainstream is that? Well: Posh Spice, bless her, is studio-bound for her first solo LP. Her first single, 'Out Of Your Mind', is a duet with Dane from Another Level, produced by those 'Buggin\" Truesteppers. Come in, Judge Jules, your time is up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Saturday night, Sunday morning. It's 1.30am and we're weaving off London's Old Kent Road, down dark, lonely side streets, past abandoned warehouses, over shattered glass. We round a corner and - watch out! - almost smack into a Mercedes SLK doing a three-point turn. We wait, then slope slowly on down the street, past a scene unimaginable from only a couple of roads away, a scene familiar and gratifying to anyone who's ever been to a nightclub on the basis of a scrawled address, the hallelujah welcome sign that says you've made it. Well: you've found it. People. Hundreds and hundreds of people. Groups of girls clack past, screeching into mobiles, showing off, looking for friends. Boys spill up from round the corner, neatly dressed and coiffed, to eye the enormous queue - three people wide, 200 yards long - that hems the blank brick wall of the club, before pitching up at its end. Some march to the front of the line, but are swiftly disaffected of their delusions of superior status by the bouncers, who aren't so much heavy-handed as just heavy. Still, a spot of sweet talk and we queue-hop. Through a metal detector, on to a clothes-bag-and-body-search that would shame Heathrow, and in. Three vast rooms, each progressively darker, both in lighting and sounds. The darkest is the most popular: we arrive just in time for the PA from Colour Girl, who performs her latest single, 'Joyrider'. Once she's off, the DJ slams on some moodier, harder music. The crowd goes bananas. It's fantastic to see. A group of perfectly turned out, seemingly aloof young men, who'd been standing around as though training for cool school, suddenly and simultaneously throw some joyful, eye-popping moves. They continue to do so for as long as the DJ plays the tunes they like: often not very long, given his habit of letting each track last all of a minute and a half. Low-attention-span clubbing. On the stage, a gaggle of lads argy-bargy as to who gets to chat over the records. There are more girls in the other rooms. And what girls they are. Of all shapes, ages, colours, they are united in their rejection of unnecessary clothing. The skimpiest of skirts and hankiest of tops are uniform, as are glamour heels. Their hair is twisted into works of art. In many clubs, this could lead to snooty attitudes towards other women: here, the toilets chatter with compliments - 'Lookin' good, girl!' The good humour stands in contrast to the hassle getting in. The friendliness of the clubbers goes against long-held assumptions about this area of south-east London and, in particular, about the kind of people that are into the skippy drums, cut-up vocals and hard basslines of the music now known as UK garage. You might not think you know about UK garage, but you do. It's what pours from every car, thumps out of every window, clogs up the compilation racks in Our Price and HMV. It packs out Under-18 nights and goes on student-union tours. It's what you hear when you flip across your radio on a Saturday night. It's 'Re-Rewind', 'Sweet Like Chocolate', 'Little Bit Of Luck', 'Never Gonna Let You Go', 'Girls Like Us', 'Thong Song', 'Buggin\". It beats Steps into third place in the Top 20, after Craig David's 'Fill Me In' and Sweet Female Attitude's 'Flowers'. It's all those pop songs with those light 'n' frisky drums. Forget Ibiza Uncovered and, these days, Overexposed . Take a summer trip to Cyprus instead, to the once sleepy town of Ayia Napa. You'll meet Radio 1 there, and MTV. Or talk to the punters at Twice As Nice, the packed-to-the-rafters Sunday night UK garage club held at central London's The End. Ask Sarah, who's 32, a dressed-to-the-99s sales accountant who sometimes spends \u00a3200 on going out over the weekend. She used to go to 'field raves' in the early 90s, but then didn't bother clubbing until UK garage became big. 'Yeah, it made me start going out again,' she says. 'I like the vibe, I like the music. I love soul, too, but soul to me isn't for coming out. But with garage, I can dance to it and that's the main attraction. I like the people, too, because a lot of the girls are nice, they're trendy. And there's no attitude at all. Everyone comes out to enjoy themselves. They don't stand around, you know, just looking bored.' 'Everyone's coming out for this atmosphere now,' says Vanessa, who's 21 and works in advertising. 'It's nice to be in a club and to see loads of different people, new people every week. It shows that it's alive.' Keep talking and you'll find out that - blimey! - even the boys are positive. Peter, who's a security guard at the Old Bailey, is happy to explain the appeal. 'I like the vibe, the people, the music, the chicks,' he grins. 'The chicks are more sophisticated, sexy. It's not like any other club... I met my wife here a year ago. I was a little bit tipsy and she came up to me and rescued me and took me home. When we have kids, I'll get my mum to look after them and we'll both come to Twice as Nice.' But it's not just the clubbers who are enjoying themselves. UK garage has started to give the British music industry the shake-up it's needed for the past five years. Dave Norton is a PR for Four Liberty Records, an Eastender whose first musical influences were Chuck Berry and Little Richard (he's 43). He is over the moon about UK garage. 'I'm someone who's always been totally in love with black music,' he enthuses. 'Through the 70s, with James Brown, through the 80s with the jazz funk and soul, into the 90s... UK garage is a continuation of this wonderful legacy. Plus, it's British, it's our version. There's so many influences that have been added into the stew. If you look at current American black music, essentially it's just a version of early soul and disco. With UK garage, there are those influences, but there's also dancehall reggae, drum and bass, even hardcore in there, too. It's a broad church and it's bringing everyone in. If you held up a mirror to what's going on culturally in the UK today, then UK garage would look back at you. It's going to dominate the charts.' Or meet Nigel Blunt, who manages Oracabessa, a Birmingham-based record label set up by Ali Campbell from UB40. Nigel's a laidback man whose CV includes band, label and club management from as far back as the New Romantic era. Nigel is not usually moved to over-enthusiasm, but even he's bubbling. 'You can press 1,000 copies of your single, get it rinsing in a disco, and within weeks it can be dropping on national radio, if The Dreem Teem pick up on it,' he grins. 'The music scene has never had so few rules. It's like the Wild West out there, I tell you. The last time I saw excitement like this was punk. It's just black people this time.' Sensational prospects for a music that began so humbly. Here's the story. In 1993, in a grotty south London pub called the Elephant and Castle, a clever promoter called Timmy Ram Jam decided to try and catch the late-night clubbers stumbling out of the Ministry of Sound. He started his club at 6am. Now-established UK garage DJs like Matt Jam Lamont and Mickey Simms played tuneful American house music: but, crucially, played the records a bit too fast. This was for two reasons. First: British crowds - for some long-acknowledged but inexplicable reason - have always liked their music faster-tempoed than Americans. Second: the clubbers had been up all night. The DJs wanted to keep them awake. From there, the club moved to the big- ger, but no more salubrious, Frog and Nightgown on the Old Kent Road, then the Arches in Southwark, and finally, to the Colliseum at Vauxhall. It picked up DJs, MCs, pirate radio coverage and plenty of punters along the way. Twice As Nice every Sunday night at the Colliseum started in 1997. Within weeks, it had legendary status, boasting DJs such as EZ (now on Kiss FM) and The Dreem Teem - producers and DJs Spoony, Timmi Magic and Mikee B, now on Radio 1. I went to Twice As Nice in 1998. It was rammed. There were so many people spilling out of the club on to the road that they literally stopped the traffic. Inside, the atmosphere was uplifting and full of energy: plenty of posing, but even more dancing, breaking loose, proper night-of-your-lifetime clubbing. Everything about the club seemed completely new to me. It had its own sound: skippy drums, boot-shuddering bass and uplifting vocals. It had its own look: dressy, exclusive, designer-labelled - the boys in head-to-toe Moschino and Versace, the girls likewise, though not so warmly wrapped. It had its own tipple: champagne. Far from wanting to drop a pill and veg out, the new crew wanted to keep their cool, dance well, look great. And it had its own ambience: it was racially mixed (very unusual in clubland) and inclusively friendly (unusual in an underground club). It was inevitable that the press would pick up on it. Unfortunately, when it did, it got things slightly wrong. The media concentrated on the champagne-BMW-designer-label lifestyle, as opposed to the music. Then, because the flourishing club scene didn't immediately translate into chart-hit records, the press turned away, talking flash-in-the-pan, leaving those involved in the scene smarting and irritated. Richard Benson was one of the first journalists outside the music press to champion the UK garage scene. He says: 'Everyone who went to garage clubs three or four years ago could see what was happening, because the music made sense there,' he says, 'but it took a long time to replicate the excitement of the clubs on vinyl. The Next Big Thing was actually jumping up and down and asking for support for years, but the media chose to ignore or misrepresent it.' In those years, when UK garage was filling the clubs, but not being played on mainstream radio, the role of pirate radio was fundamental. Benson visited Ice FM, one of London's most popular pirates, which broadcasted from ex-fireman Ricky D's kitchen. He recalls Technics decks on the worktops, memos to DJs Blu-tacked on the fridge, empty champagne bottles in one corner, boxes of 12in vinyl singles in all the others, and, sitting on the windowsill, the 'horn'. The horn, like a 6in mini-loudhailer, is a cheap piece of broadcasting equipment that beams the music to a transmitter atop another block of flats. The pirates broke and still break those independent label records that suddenly and rudely gate-crash the top 10. They pick up on tracks that go down well in clubs, and the listeners tape the shows, then take the tapes to record shops to get the vinyl. Between 1997 and 2000, with the mainstream media so shy of the culture, the pirates cleaned up: their number in London alone has almost quadrupled since 1996. Four years on, and the UK garage hits are coming thick and fast. DJs Mark Hill and Pete Devereux, alias Artful Dodger, who gave us 'Re-Rewind' (which launched teen- age lover-crooner Craig David), 'Movin' Too Fast', and now 'Woman Trouble' have already sold in excess of 1 million records. Producers such as Truesteppers, Wookie and Zed Bias are in ouch-that's- hot demand. And, after a couple of years in which most vocals seemed to be supplied by American r'n'b artists (producers would take the a cappella version of a single by Whitney Houston, Brandy, Destiny's Child and do a bootleg remix), British vocalists are coming through. We all know about 'making love on a Tuesday, Wednesday, etc, etc' Craig David; now there's Alan Shearer-in-a-suit Robbie Craig, Stockport bargirls Sweet Female Attitude, potential pop queen Colour Girl, even Neneh Cherry, whose career got a shot in the arm with The Dreem Teem's remix of Buddy X. And it's not just British performers who are benefiting from UK garage's Midas touch. Oracabessa is mining a rich seam of talent from Jamaica, and has already had hits with Mr Vegas's 'Heads High' and B15 Projects' 'Girls Like Us'. UK garage, because it was given time to develop at its own pace, away from press glare and major label cherry-picking, is now throwing up more talent than any other pop genre. 'I think the reason why UK garage works is that you can throw in anything, it'll go in the mix,' says writer and singer Colour Girl, real name Becky, an Essex girl with a two-year-old son. 'A screaming diva vocal, something haunting, like Wookie, or Witchidam, for the reggae.' Colour Girl herself came from house music, but now finds UK garage more fulfilling. 'I don't often feel proud about being British, but I do with UK garage. For years, we were left behind by America. They had the best hip-hop, r'n'b, soul, house music. Now we've come up with our own unique music. Let's just hope it's got enough legs to trot over the Atlantic and kick some arse.' Writer-singers like Colour Girl, Craig David and the amazingly soulful Robbie Craig are to be f ted in an industry that has relied for many years on boy/girl/combination-bands that sing, dance, look pretty, but don't pen tunes. UK garage producers can write, too. Artful Dodger are classically trained. Another who looks as though he could become a star - though not, perhaps, in the hold-the-front-page mould - is 27-year-old polite-as-you-like Wookie. Wookie (real name Jason Chue: Chue-Chewbacca-Wookie-geddit?) has an LP coming out later this year: 'There'll be tracks of the same speed as UK garage, but the mood will be lower, you wouldn't play them out.' He's self-taught - he wrote all his first tunes on a \u00a31,100 keyboard - and part of Jazzie B's Soul II Soul crew. (They met six years ago when Wookie was renting a flat from Jazzie's barber.) Wookie's already remixed Gabrielle, Whitney Houston, Brandy, Angie Stone and is an example of what The Dreem Teem's Timmi Magic calls the 'depth' of the UK garage scene. 'It isn't just bedroom producers,' says Timmi. 'There are legitimate songwriters, like Wookie, and K Warren, Dubaholics, TJ Cases_ they're another reason why this scene will last. They can write.' Sunday afternoon at Radio 1. The Dreem Teem have just come off air from their 10am-1pm show. All three have been up all night DJing at clubs, and now, though their stint is over, they can't stop. They have to discuss and approve a TV ad for their mix LP (part of the INcredible series), and go through what will happen for a telly programme to be made around their Ayia Napa trip. They'll be there, with Radio 1, on 21-23 July. They munch chocolate bars and crisps to keep up their energy. The Dreem Teem are possibly the most well known DJs of the UK garage scene, mostly because of their Radio 1 show. (Other DJs, like EZ and Artful Dodger, have prime-time Kiss slots, but Kiss only broadcasts in London.) They met in 1996 through working on the same pirate radio station: Spoony played US garage; Timmi Magic came from acid house; Mikee B was into drum and bass and hardcore - et voil\u00e0, the essential ingredients of UK garage. Since then, they've become a respected production team as well as building on their club and radio DJing. The Dreem Teem came to Radio 1 via shows on Kiss and on Galaxy, a station which broadcasts almost everywhere in the UK, except London - thus disproving the UK garage 'is a London thing' theory. They're very different characters: Timmi, who oversees their production work, is the most naturally lively and jokey; Mikee is laid-back and only contributes to conversations when he has to; Spoony is the spokesman, a man who can argue his corner and who is keen to represent UK garage in what he feels is its correct light. 'When people write about the house scene, they don't write about sweaty people with their tops off any more,' he points out. 'So why do they always write about the champagne and the suits? It's too easy. For the record, only one of us three has a BMW. And one of us doesn't even drink champagne.' The Dreem Teem believe that UK garage will stick around because it's strong in so many areas. It has a healthy clubscene that's now spread nationally, a thriving and long-established pirate radio stage; plus, now, mainstream chart hits, mainstream radio play, and telly-friendly Ayia Napa for those who want a holiday. All backed up by talented writers, producers, singers and MCs: 'MCs are our rappers,' says Timmi. 'Instead of Mel C featuring Left Eye, soon it'll be Baby Spice featuring PSG.'

      "body": "<p>The streets are clogged in San Jose today with hopes and dreams in suits and jeans all creeping towards the arena for a piece of that off-the-shelf success stuff. The kind peddled by gurus with five-digit speech fees whose audio-cassette programmes appear in airport bookshops, titles like Maximum Achievement , Unleash the Power Within and Million Dollar Habits . They claim to possess the secrets of boundless wealth, lifelong happiness and trim thighs, all of which are apparently available to everyone all the time. Which explains why 15,000 hungry punters have log-jammed the traffic around the SJ Convention Center in time for the 8am kick-off. 'Results 2000,' flashes the electric billboard. 'Create An Extraordinary Quality Of Life.'</p> <p>Results is a big deal in a huge business, a kind of all-star motivational circus featuring such giants of the genre as Anthony Robbins and Brian Tracy - authors of the above-cited blockbusters - and speaker-circuit celebrities like Gulf War general Norman Schwarzkopf, Larry King (live by satellite) and Danny Glover of Lethal Weapon fame. Results takes its feel-good romp around the US, greeting audiences of 10,000 and more with the news that you, yes you, can make your dreams come true if only you make lists, believe in yourself and buy the six-tape programme after the show. And at every venue, grown adults with MBAs, even plcs, have jumped around like teenagers to teenage music, hugged their neighbours and scribbled down copious notes before plundering their savings at the product stalls to the rear. Worth well more than $100m a year, the success industry well deserves its name.</p> <p>'I WANT YOU ALL TO COMMIT TO AN OUTSTANDING LEVEL OF EXCELLENCE!' It is 10am and Tony Robbins, the 6ft 7in undisputed heavyweight champion of the circuit, adopts the Atlas pose on stage - shoulders back, beaming teethy smile, as big as a house and with hands like shovels, he looks like a cross between Arnie and Jaws from the James Bond movies. He tells us we are unique and we can do anything as long as we achieve a 'peak state', so in a thunder-clap roar he commands us to dance to his 'peak state' tune - a 20-second snatch of the Dutch duo 2 Unlimited, whose 'Get Ready for This' is rivalled only by Snap's 'I've Got the Power' in the motivational hit parade. And everyone, all 15,000 of us, dances. Robbins has fireworks, he stamps, he claps, he beats his huge chest - he is the booming behemoth of the success business.</p> <p>Robbins is a showman, harnessing the same mass-manipulation machinery as television evangelists, and rock bands. The sceptic shrinks from this disturbing conjunction of charismatic speakers, life-changing agendas, emotion-whipped crowds and 'all major credit cards accepted'.</p> <p>But Robbins couldn't care less about sceptics - he meets all ironic barbs head on and smashes through them with the sheer force of his will. Like a latter-day Marvel hero, Captain American Dream, he embodies his can-do philosophy. He's a self-made centillionaire who could snap you like a twig, but all he wants is for you to live a life as fulfilled as his. He makes upwards of $125,000 per gig, and his clients include Bill Clinton, Andre Agassi and, at one time, Princess Diana.</p> <p>However, there's more to the success industry than titanic Tony. In his wake marches a legion of lesser gurus, each carving a lucrative niche, one of the most successful of whom is Brian Tracy, who performed his first public (not corporate) gig in the UK this May, in Manchester.</p> <p>Against the virile, chest-beating Robbins, Tracy is a neutered shell - he has none of the charisma or brio one expects of a motivational guru. While Robbins charges about on stage bellowing about RPMs - 'RESULTS-FOCUSED, PURPOSE-DRIVEN MASSIVE-ACTION-PLANS' - Tracy is to be found calmly sipping his third black coffee in the sumptuous Hyatt hotel down the road, a few hours before his performance. A stiff, grey man of 56 in a sombre suit who speaks softly and smiles awkwardly through imperfect teeth, he cuts a desperately ordinary figure.</p> <p>'Most people say I'm the highest-content speaker and writer in the personal-development business worldwide,' he says. 'I've published three books, there's a fourth coming out, I've got offers on the table for two more and outlines for 20 others. And my books are good. They are judged by the people who read them as the best books ever written in their field in history in any language. And I've been published in a dozen languages.

While a superficial observer might attribute Robbins' popularity to his charm, his size, the music and lewd references to erections - or 'Mr Happy', as he calls it - Tracy offers no excuses.

Albert Einstein once said that 'too many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers - this is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves'.

Singing the virtues of graft and perseverance, he inflated his speech fees over 20 years to the current $25,000, and that's irrespective of the audience - public or corporate, large or small.

'Because I'm not a glad-hander. My material is very practical; it doesn't try to fool you. You know, recently the editors of my latest book tried to shorten it and they couldn't.

There have been no new discoveries or scientific breakthroughs, despite the industry's wildest exaggerations. Rather, motivational literature remains characterised by the oldest material going - vintage truisms of the bumper-sticker kind, such as 'Failing to plan is planning to fail' or the particularly helpful 'Time management is the key - try to find faster ways of doing things.' The bibliography of Tracy's latest oeuvre, Maximum Achievement , contains the likes of Kahlil Gibran, Emerson, Epictetus, Plato, Winston Churchill, Longfellow and Roosevelt, all of whom the author quotes liberally to bolster such home-grown aphorisms as: 'If you change your thinking, you change your life.' The effect is a kind of clich\u00e9 soup - every word is undeniably true in both the deepest and the corniest ways; most of it is common to most self-respecting gurus and ultimately too hackneyed to be of interest.

'It's not plagiarism or stealing, it's eclecticism.

It is how these elements are combined that counts. Recipes are another example_' And architecture is another, and music. Having detected a cynic, he rises admirably to the challenge with an instant volley of cheesy analogies, each one meticulously explained.

But you see, America is made up of the people who left seeking opportunity, and Europe is made up of those who stayed, seeking security and creating a huge bureaucracy with some of the worst corruption in the Western world. Look at France. And in England you have this union movement that's just so... What you fail to grasp is the difference between the active and passive voice, I discovered this the other day. You can either say, \"All this prosperity isn't helping the poor\" - passive. Or \"Poor people aren't taking advantage of all this prosperity\" - active. The first is \"I'm a victim\", the second is \"I'm in control, I'm in charge of my life\". All this talk about wealth distribution is pure socialist claptrap - wealth is created, not distributed. And how are you going to create wealth if you only work 30 hours per week - that's the main trouble with poor people, they don't work enough hours! How can you British be so wrong-headed as to deny the fact that these principles work! It's the same mentality as those outrageously incompetent officers in the First World War who sent their men to the slaughter and sat back in their chteaux drinking wine and smoking cigars...' And so on.</p> <p>Despite Tracy's protestations, however, the success industry is making headway in the UK - we even have a home-grown guru circuit. It's a punier proposition to the American scene, to be sure, playing to hundreds rather than thousands, but nonetheless, it's a start. David Hughes of Nightingale Conant, which publishes all of Tracy's material - alongside Robbins, Deepak Chopra, all the big guns - recognises the British wariness of the motivational business. But he feels it's merely a style thing.</p> <p>'Personal improvement is a growing industry, in the UK,' he says. 'Our sales have doubled in the last three years, only we don't like to bow down to the guru so much. Take Tony Robbins - in the US, they like a big, glossy hero picture, but here we had to reduce the picture on the packaging and market it according to its content. In fact, Brian Tracy's style is more appropriate, in a way, to the English market.'</p> <p>Paul McKenna, the TV hypnotist, is one of Hughes's biggest sellers in the UK. He believes that our traditional scepticism is a double-edged sword because, in fact, much of this goal-setting, list-making stuff is good for you. 'It's a bit of a clich\u00e9, but the world is changing. Communication has hugely speeded up technological development, and the brain has become the most important resource. So the motto must be 'Improve thy brain', except no one ever taught us how at school.' The key, inevitably, is hypnosis. 'We have much better psychological technology now,' he explains. 'That Freudian nonsense about taking you back to the root of your trauma is thankfully losing ground. It's like if someone comes to you with a broken leg, would you keep throwing them down the stairs until they feel better? While they can take six months to treat a simple phobia for example, I take half an hour.'</p> <p>In the stark concrete green room to the left of the stage, Brian Tracy quietly runs over his speech notes one last time. On the TV screen in the corner, Tracy's warm-up, a former tax attorney called Sanford ('Sandy') Botkin, hams his way through what you can and can't claim if you're self-employed. Just outside the door, Robbins is doing 'live shots' for a local TV outfit - despite having slept only two hours last night, and spent the morning roaring and stamping, Robbins manages to cram his every window with media interviews. Then the door bursts open.</p> <p>'Hi Brian!' It's Jan, the chirrupy event organiser, with a microphone headset and a clipboard. She stands fanning herself and beaming. 'Have you felt the energy in there? Isn't it aaahsome? Wow, I'm like toadally buzzing on the energy!'</p> <p>Before Tracy takes the stage, Robbins does him the service of geeing up the crowd - he bounds out to that 2 Unlimited tune for what seems like the 20th time today to hurl Results 2000 T-shirts into the crowd as a guitarist might plectrums. Everyone flocks to the falling bundles, pushing and grabbing and cheering. Then Brian comes on, a grey and gestureless man with an overhead projector, and the music dies. Row upon row of salesmen and women produce notepads and red Biros. He asks them: 'Who's the most important person in the room?' And everyone shouts 'Me!' That's about as fun as it gets.</p> <p>For most of his set, Tracy rattles through the magic of goal-setting. But for the last quarter, he simply sells his wares shopping-channel style, one product at a time, spinning pitches of superlatives and unconfirmable statistics, even kissing the cassette-boxes before moving on, most of which were graced with his own image. It's a remarkable and shameless performance, considering his $500 a minute fee, and not one that endears him to the wearying punters.</p> <p>Certainly behind the till at the hot-dog stall where Tracy appears on a screen beside the soft-drinks machine, the cashier cannot fathom his style. 'Why's he have to kiss it like that?' she asks no one in particular. 'He's kissing every one, what's the matter with him?'</p> <p>You can feel the relief when Danny Glover totters onto the stage, yelling, 'Would y'all give it up for Brian Tracy!'</p> <p>While Glover relates his battle with dyslexia as a child, Tracy marches back to the Green Room once more to gather his things and rush off to the airport - no sense in hanging around, there's work to be done. He meets an orgy of mutual congratulation. Fellow gurus compliment him on an illuminating speech, members of the audience sneak in to shake his hand and thank him profusely for tripling their incomes. And I'm seized by the realisation that in this room, I am the only sceptic and the only non- millionaire. Perhaps life really is built on simple truths, truths of which I have long lost sight in my stubborn scepticism - perhaps irony is a British malaise after all. And loath as I am to succumb to these empires of aphorism and advertorial, I well know the dull sting of underachievement, the gnawing guilt of not turning my 'shoulds' into 'musts'.</p> <p>So I ask him: Mr Tracy, what can you do for me, a humble journalist? Can I triple my income, too?</p> <p>'Of course you can,' he says, sensing a convert. 'But you must be specific about your goals.'</p> <p>Er, I want to be a better journalist, make more money, er_</p> <p>'Right. Well, a journalist is really a subject entrepreneur. You must first see what the market wants and then you'll make money. We're living in a boom period right now, so people are interested in positive articles. So end all of your articles with some practical tips, and you'll get syndicated, believe me. I've got it - why not write a series of articles about self-made millionaires in the UK? Call it 'You Can Do It - Success in the UK'. Keep interviewing self-made millionaires about how they achieved their success, and when you've interviewed a hundred, you've got a book!'</p> <p>But Brian, you're asking me to become a success guru, not a journalist.</p> <p>'It's what people want to read,' he adds, climbing into his limousine. 'And you must expect to be turned down a hundred times.' A crushing handshake and he pulls away into the distance. And by the time he's left the parking lot, like cigarette smoke, he's gone.</p> <p><b>So how was it for you?</b></p> <p><b> Catalina Di Novo, 29</b> <br> 'Actually this is my first time at an event like this. I'm a model. I do all kinds of stuff, but this year I'm going into business, so I need to really believe in myself, to have that confidence to go out there. The business idea is where I travel and go to restaurants and hotels all over the world and I score them for other businesses, for airlines and travel operators - it's a service, so I get paid for it. Hopefully I'll be in business by the end of the year. And yes, I'm definitely going to buy some motivation tapes.'</p> <p><b> RJ Moye, 46</b> <br> 'I've never attended a Robbins event before, and I have to say, it's fantastic - it's unbelievable, actually. Almost better than a touchdown at a 49ers game. Great place to do some networking, too. I believe this is a turning point for me, business wise. I'm a computer salesman, you see, but also a financial services guy, selling pension plans, organising finances. And I've decided today to really make a plan and move into financial services full time. I'll double or quadruple my income before the year's out, definitely. No doubt at all. If other people can do it, so can I.'</p> <p><b> Jon Berghofs, 18</b> <br> 'I'm, like, the No.2 salesman for Cutco cutlery, which is the biggest cutlery company in California. And I'm still at school, so you know, I'm real good. I read Tony Robbins' Unlimited Power book last summer and I've been selling a lot of knives since then. I also read all Brian Tracy's stuff, his Psychology of Selling , and right after, I set a company record - the most knives sold in two weeks. This summer, I plan on making $60-90K, and I'm going to double the all-time record for selling knives.'</p> <p><b> Bob Livingstone, 53</b> <br> 'I've been a big Tony Robbins fan for years, now more than ever. He taught me to tap into my own energy. When I started listening to Tony tapes, I was making $7 an hour, and just last year I made $70,000. And that's nowhere near where I'm capable of going. I used to manage facilities, large buildings and so on, but lately I've been moving into financial services. And as long as I stay focused, plus my spiritual convictions - I'm a Christian - I'll have more money than I'll ever need. In a few months, I'll be making $100,000.'</p> <p><b> Tom Patten, 67</b> <br> 'I'm a landlord, I've got a bunch of real estate, so that's all I do - I own it. I'm not here for business goals, mainly I'm here for private, personal goals. Like, I want to better my health, I want to write a book, too, so I need lots of energy, right?

And Brian Tracy, he was the first person I followed when I moved into sales. Actually, Brian's message was more useful to me today, because right now I'm a senior manager in worldwide sales development at Cisco, the networking company, and I'm trying to develop a leadership mindset. I did all that doubling my salary before, but money doesn't make you happy. Money doesn't matter. Now my focus is on how I can help others achieve their goals, help them be happy and empowered.'</p>",

The kind peddled by gurus with five-digit speech fees whose audio-cassette programmes appear in airport bookshops, titles like Maximum Achievement , Unleash the Power Within and Million Dollar Habits . They claim to possess the secrets of boundless wealth, lifelong happiness and trim thighs, all of which are apparently available to everyone all the time. Which explains why 15,000 hungry punters have log-jammed the traffic around the SJ Convention Center in time for the 8am kick-off. 'Results 2000,' flashes the electric billboard. 'Create An Extraordinary Quality Of Life.' Results is a big deal in a huge business, a kind of all-star motivational circus featuring such giants of the genre as Anthony Robbins and Brian Tracy - authors of the above-cited blockbusters - and speaker-circuit celebrities like Gulf War general Norman Schwarzkopf, Larry King (live by satellite) and Danny Glover of Lethal Weapon fame. Results takes its feel-good romp around the US, greeting audiences of 10,000 and more with the news that you, yes you, can make your dreams come true if only you make lists, believe in yourself and buy the six-tape programme after the show. And at every venue, grown adults with MBAs, even plcs, have jumped around like teenagers to teenage music, hugged their neighbours and scribbled down copious notes before plundering their savings at the product stalls to the rear. Worth well more than $100m a year, the success industry well deserves its name. 'I WANT YOU ALL TO COMMIT TO AN OUTSTANDING LEVEL OF EXCELLENCE!' It is 10am and Tony Robbins, the 6ft 7in undisputed heavyweight champion of the circuit, adopts the Atlas pose on stage - shoulders back, beaming teethy smile, as big as a house and with hands like shovels, he looks like a cross between Arnie and Jaws from the James Bond movies. He tells us we are unique and we can do anything as long as we achieve a 'peak state', so in a thunder-clap roar he commands us to dance to his 'peak state' tune - a 20-second snatch of the Dutch duo 2 Unlimited, whose 'Get Ready for This' is rivalled only by Snap's 'I've Got the Power' in the motivational hit parade. And everyone, all 15,000 of us, dances. Robbins has fireworks, he stamps, he claps, he beats his huge chest - he is the booming behemoth of the success business. Robbins is a showman, harnessing the same mass-manipulation machinery as television evangelists, and rock bands. The sceptic shrinks from this disturbing conjunction of charismatic speakers, life-changing agendas, emotion-whipped crowds and 'all major credit cards accepted'. But Robbins couldn't care less about sceptics - he meets all ironic barbs head on and smashes through them with the sheer force of his will. Like a latter-day Marvel hero, Captain American Dream, he embodies his can-do philosophy. He's a self-made centillionaire who could snap you like a twig, but all he wants is for you to live a life as fulfilled as his. He makes upwards of $125,000 per gig, and his clients include Bill Clinton, Andre Agassi and, at one time, Princess Diana. However, there's more to the success industry than titanic Tony. In his wake marches a legion of lesser gurus, each carving a lucrative niche, one of the most successful of whom is Brian Tracy, who performed his first public (not corporate) gig in the UK this May, in Manchester. Against the virile, chest-beating Robbins, Tracy is a neutered shell - he has none of the charisma or brio one expects of a motivational guru. While Robbins charges about on stage bellowing about RPMs - 'RESULTS-FOCUSED, PURPOSE-DRIVEN MASSIVE-ACTION-PLANS' - Tracy is to be found calmly sipping his third black coffee in the sumptuous Hyatt hotel down the road, a few hours before his performance. A stiff, grey man of 56 in a sombre suit who speaks softly and smiles awkwardly through imperfect teeth, he cuts a desperately ordinary figure. 'Most people say I'm the highest-content speaker and writer in the personal-development business worldwide,' he says. 'I've published three books, there's a fourth coming out, I've got offers on the table for two more and outlines for 20 others. And my books are good. They are judged by the people who read them as the best books ever written in their field in history in any language. And I've been published in a dozen languages. I've eight books in German, and this year I will be the best-published personal-success author in German history.' The self-aggrandisement is interminable, unprompted and without apology. As befits the author of The Science of Self-Confidence , modesty isn't a Tracy tenet. Post-boast, I ask him if dispensing life's great answers all day makes it hard to be humble. His features harden. 'Look, you couldn't possibly be successful in a profession that requires performance unless you have an ego.' More coffee. 'Egoless people just aren't successful.' Tracy is in many ways a more intriguing figure than Robbins, for he relies on nothing but content - perhaps his favourite word. While a superficial observer might attribute Robbins' popularity to his charm, his size, the music and lewd references to erections - or 'Mr Happy', as he calls it - Tracy offers no excuses. Stony, dour and defensive in person, he has nonetheless succeeded in a field that, at first, doesn't seem to suit him, armed only with his precious material and a steely resolve. And like many modern gurus, he made his fortune teaching others to make theirs. Tracy began life as a salesman, rising diligently through the ranks selling everything from cars to real estate, until one day 20 years ago, he unearthed the holy grail of consumer society - that what people really want isn't this house or that car, but the ability to buy any damn house or car they want. Albert Einstein once said that 'too many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers - this is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves'. And no more so than here in the bars and restaurants of San Jose - not the romantic San Jose to which Dionne Warwick once asked directions, but the blocky, functional hub of northern California's Silicon Valley - where venture capitalists repeatedly ask e-entrepreneurs the same questions: what's the market, how big is it, will it last? Well, Tracy's market is guaranteed and limitless - everyone who wants to be successful at anything. 'When I started in this field, I used to speak to tiny audiences - seven people, then 12 - and I lost $100 each time. But you know, anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first. Never be afraid of failure. If you want to succeed, you must double your rate of failure.' Singing the virtues of graft and perseverance, he inflated his speech fees over 20 years to the current $25,000, and that's irrespective of the audience - public or corporate, large or small. In a typical year, he'll speak, say, 120 times, which makes a cool $3m before counting the $15m annual sales of his book and audio programmes, bestsellers like The Psychology of Selling and Breaking The Success Barrier . 'You know why they like me in Germany?' he says. 'Because I'm not a glad-hander. My material is very practical; it doesn't try to fool you. You know, recently the editors of my latest book tried to shorten it and they couldn't. These are some of the finest editors in New York City. You know what they said? There was too much content.' This magical 'content' that promises to double or triple your income in 90 days - with emotional, spiritual and physical fulfillment tossed into the bargain - is nothing new. There have been no new discoveries or scientific breakthroughs, despite the industry's wildest exaggerations. Rather, motivational literature remains characterised by the oldest material going - vintage truisms of the bumper-sticker kind, such as 'Failing to plan is planning to fail' or the particularly helpful 'Time management is the key - try to find faster ways of doing things.'

The effect is a kind of clich\u00e9 soup - every word is undeniably true in both the deepest and the corniest ways; most of it is common to most self-respecting gurus and ultimately too hackneyed to be of interest. Who was it that said stealing from one is plagiarism but stealing from many is research? Tracy bristles, brushes away the hovering waitress and bites his lip. 'It's not plagiarism or stealing, it's eclecticism. It's like elements of the periodic table: there are millions of ways of combining those elements to make compounds, some of which will be strong and powerful and useful, others of which will not. It is how these elements are combined that counts. Recipes are another example_' And architecture is another, and music. Having detected a cynic, he rises admirably to the challenge with an instant volley of cheesy analogies, each one meticulously explained.

While Glover relates his battle with dyslexia as a child, Tracy marches back to the Green Room once more to gather his things and rush off to the airport - no sense in hanging around, there's work to be done. He meets an orgy of mutual congratulation. Fellow gurus compliment him on an illuminating speech, members of the audience sneak in to shake his hand and thank him profusely for tripling their incomes. And I'm seized by the realisation that in this room, I am the only sceptic and the only non- millionaire. Perhaps life really is built on simple truths, truths of which I have long lost sight in my stubborn scepticism - perhaps irony is a British malaise after all. And loath as I am to succumb to these empires of aphorism and advertorial, I well know the dull sting of underachievement, the gnawing guilt of not turning my 'shoulds' into 'musts'. So I ask him: Mr Tracy, what can you do for me, a humble journalist? Can I triple my income, too? 'Of course you can,' he says, sensing a convert. 'But you must be specific about your goals.' Er, I want to be a better journalist, make more money, er_ 'Right. Well, a journalist is really a subject entrepreneur. You must first see what the market wants and then you'll make money. We're living in a boom period right now, so people are interested in positive articles. So end all of your articles with some practical tips, and you'll get syndicated, believe me. I've got it - why not write a series of articles about self-made millionaires in the UK? Call it 'You Can Do It - Success in the UK'. Keep interviewing self-made millionaires about how they achieved their success, and when you've interviewed a hundred, you've got a book!' But Brian, you're asking me to become a success guru, not a journalist. 'It's what people want to read,' he adds, climbing into his limousine. 'And you must expect to be turned down a hundred times.' A crushing handshake and he pulls away into the distance. And by the time he's left the parking lot, like cigarette smoke, he's gone. So how was it for you? Catalina Di Novo, 29 'Actually this is my first time at an event like this. I'm a model. I do all kinds of stuff, but this year I'm going into business, so I need to really believe in myself, to have that confidence to go out there. The business idea is where I travel and go to restaurants and hotels all over the world and I score them for other businesses, for airlines and travel operators - it's a service, so I get paid for it. Hopefully I'll be in business by the end of the year. And yes, I'm definitely going to buy some motivation tapes.' RJ Moye, 46 'I've never attended a Robbins event before, and I have to say, it's fantastic - it's unbelievable, actually. Almost better than a touchdown at a 49ers game. Great place to do some networking, too. I believe this is a turning point for me, business wise. I'm a computer salesman, you see, but also a financial services guy, selling pension plans, organising finances. And I've decided today to really make a plan and move into financial services full time. I'll double or quadruple my income before the year's out, definitely. No doubt at all. If other people can do it, so can I.' Jon Berghofs, 18 'I'm, like, the No.2 salesman for Cutco cutlery, which is the biggest cutlery company in California. And I'm still at school, so you know, I'm real good. I read Tony Robbins' Unlimited Power book last summer and I've been selling a lot of knives since then. I also read all Brian Tracy's stuff, his Psychology of Selling , and right after, I set a company record - the most knives sold in two weeks. This summer, I plan on making $60-90K, and I'm going to double the all-time record for selling knives.' Bob Livingstone, 53 'I've been a big Tony Robbins fan for years, now more than ever. He taught me to tap into my own energy. When I started listening to Tony tapes, I was making $7 an hour, and just last year I made $70,000. And that's nowhere near where I'm capable of going. I used to manage facilities, large buildings and so on, but lately I've been moving into financial services. And as long as I stay focused, plus my spiritual convictions - I'm a Christian - I'll have more money than I'll ever need. In a few months, I'll be making $100,000.' Tom Patten, 67 'I'm a landlord, I've got a bunch of real estate, so that's all I do - I own it. I'm not here for business goals, mainly I'm here for private, personal goals. Like, I want to better my health, I want to write a book, too, so I need lots of energy, right? And these events, they get me all hyped up and excited. I've been going to Tony workshops for 10 years and every time I get new energy, oh yeah, you betcha.' Randy Weld, 32 'I've been to every single Tony event in the Bay Area and I think he's absolutely awesome. And Brian Tracy, he was the first person I followed when I moved into sales. Actually, Brian's message was more useful to me today, because right now I'm a senior manager in worldwide sales development at Cisco, the networking company, and I'm trying to develop a leadership mindset. I did all that doubling my salary before, but money doesn't make you happy. Money doesn't matter. Now my focus is on how I can help others achieve their goals, help them be happy and empowered.'",

      "body": "<p>It's 2am. The time when only clubbers and nursing mothers should still be up. But pull back your curtains and you might be surprised by the number of lights on in your street. Night-time is no longer ring-fenced for sleep. It has become the new daytime, offering us the chance to catch up on everything we didn't manage to cram in during what used to be our waking hours. Now, instead of sleeping, we can check our bank balances by phone, buy groceries, surf the net for cheap flights or swop our slippers for training shoes and go to the gym.</p> <p>Such flexibility, however, has a price. Our bodies are run by circadian rhythms, a prehistoric internal clock that regulates when we feel sleepy or awake, our body temperature, hormone secretion and level of alertness. It makes our brains and bodies active during the day and recuperate through the night. So robust is this clock - based in cells in the hypothalamus in the brain (3cm behind the eyes) - that even two weeks on a night shift without a break will not destroy its intrinsic rhythm, and when scientists keep human volunteers in isolation, without cues of what time it is in the day, they still show daily cycles of temperature changes, sleep and wakefulness, and hormone release. Continually working against our body's natural rhythm is likely to cause ourselves both physical and psychological damage and, research shows, may actually increase our risk of depression, stomach ulcers and heart disease.</p> <p>At the sleep unit in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, consultant Tom Mackey believes that our normal circadian rhythms are increasingly being completely distorted. 'More and more of us are being pressured into doing things at odd hours. There's more flexitime at work, but this can mean people taking work home and staying up doing it long after the children have gone to bed. This is going to have an impact on quality and length of sleep. If people don't go to bed at a reasonable time, say around 11pm, and have between six and eight hours of sleep, they will build up a sleep debt that will make them unable to concentrate and liable to swings in temper and depression. You need sleep for rest and repair; in sleep you lay down the memories of experiences you've had during the day. You need to process them. If you bombard your mind with information for too long, then everything gets disorganised - you become unable to manage daytime activities.' Many people repay their week's sleep debt at weekends, but such blocks of extra sleep may not be as good as the natural way of sleeping. 'You can't replicate the normal sleeping act,' warns Mackey.</p> <p>The circadian rhythms that run the sleep/wake cycle are as old as evolution itself. In his laboratory in Northwest University in Illinois, Phil Lowrey has studied the genetic basis of circadian rhythms in various organisms. 'You see circadian rhythms in single-celled bacteria, all the way up the evolutionary ladder to humans. It is important for all living things to have a biological timing system. There are many similarities between the genes in humans that are responsible for circadian rhythms and those which are responsible in flies.' Just as the way glucose is stored and released in the body is similar in all species, because it works well, so it is with circadian rhythms. Once nature has a prototype that works, everyone gets it. Much of Lowrey's work has been done on hamsters, largely nocturnal creatures, whose circadian rhythms get them up just before dusk and make them sleepy before dawn, so they can avoid predators and hunt down food.</p> <p>Our circadian rhythms were developed in the opposite direction. 'Our prehistoric ancestors would have needed their clock to get them out hunting during the day and probably in bed around 6pm to 8pm to avoid predators,' says Lowrey. 'Our night vision is not as good as that of nocturnal animals - our natural rhythm was to sleep as the sun went down. The invention of the electric light obviously changed that.'</p> <p>Like most biological systems, circadian rhythms are not made to measure. Our internal clock runs a bit longer than 24 hours, hence its Latin name, circadian, which means almost a day. Each day, the cells in the hypothalamus readjust their timing in response to environmental cues such as the amount of daylight. This doesn't happen immediately, hence jet lag when we fly across time zones. It can take one day per time zone to make a full recovery. If the clock was unable to self-regulate as the seasons changed, the poor hamster would suddenly find itself waking up in broad daylight between the paws of a predator.</p> <p>That humans tend to vary in their circadian rhythms has been known for centuries. Benjamin Franklin's maxim 'Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise' recognised that some people are born to be larks (to get up and go to bed early) while others are owls (late risers and late to bed). Larks are 'morning people' - productive and communicative from the time their eyes open - while owls are grouchy and groggy until midday. Franklin's maxim has, however, largely been disproved by researchers. A paper in the British Medical Journal in 1998 based on nearly 1,300 people found that far from being the poorer bird, owls tended to be richer and were more likely to have their own cars than larks. There was no real difference in death rates between the two. According to Dr Chris Martyn, one of the authors of the paper, the idea of industrious, prosperous larks probably dates from before artificial light, when people needed to get up early to make the most of daylight. 'I'm an owl by nature, so I was pleased with our findings because I was fed up with larks claiming moral superiority for getting up early. '</p> <p>Other research nevertheless suggests that owls may pay a price - health problems - because they tend to go to sleep at less regular times. While the temperature of the body should fall at night (and does whether or not we are asleep, reaching its lowest at around 4am), it falls more in larks than in owls. 'Larks go to bed at a more appropriate time for their body clock,' says Dr James Waterhouse, lecturer in the Research Institute of Sport and Exercise Science at John Moores University in Liverpool. 'Owls probably pay for less regular hours by having a greater incidence of low mood and sub-clinical depression.'</p> <p>Phil Lowry's Northwest laboratory has moved even closer to uncovering the havoc that a disturbed clock can have on the body. Last month, the lab published a paper in Science describing the first genetic mutation in the biological clock of a hamster, which is similar to a human's. The mutation switched the hamster's circadian cycle from 24 hours to 20. 'Humans may have similar problems with their circadian rhythms that could be responsible for sleep problems,' says Lowrey. 'The result is that some people want to go to sleep earlier but can't until 3am. While others can't stay awake after 5pm. These are all new areas of research, but if humans continue to push themselves, to override our natural body clocks so we can do what we want, when we want, then there will be health consequences.'</p> <p>Much of the damage that can be done by disrupting the biological clock has been seen in shift workers. The fatigue and disorientation following night shifts is similar to that of jet lag. As with jet lag, the body adjusts over time, but the wake-and-sleep cycle never seems to be totally reversed. As more of us push back our circadian clocks, going to bed later and later, the effects on our bodies will be similar to those of shift workers. Peter Colquhoun, a retired chronopsychologist who studied shift work in his Medical Research Council laboratory in Cambridge for many years, believes that more accidents happen at night, when workers are less alert. He studied people working continuous night shifts who were responsible for various monitoring devices in the military. 'They only managed a partial adjustment of their circadian rhythms - instead of having a trough in their temperature at 4am or 5am, their temperature flattened out over the day and night. Similarly, their fall in alertness at 4am flattened out. People sleep less on night shifts and have more psychosomatic illness. Our increasingly 24-hour society means more people are doing things at funny times - so more of the population is liable to make mistakes.'</p> <p>Apart from psychosomatic illness, shift workers also get physically unwell. 'If you continue to be a night worker, then you have a high incidence of indigestion and of stomach ulcers - our bodies are better able to metabolise food we eat in the day,' says Dr Waterhouse. 'You will also have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease. Night workers have adrenaline levels that are high in the middle of the night, so they are kept alert - this is stressful physiologically, and there's probably a medical cost involved in terms of cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>'There is also evidence that working nights affects the immune system. It isn't equally competent over 24 hours, it's related to levels of the hormone cortisol. When a person is stressed, cortisol levels rise, the immune response is depressed and infections may be more likely. Night workers have an increased rate of sick leave.' The best thing for night workers to do is to change their lifestyle, keeping to their pattern of being awake at night and asleep during the day, even on days off. Otherwise their clocks can never even partially adjust.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the move towards a 24-hour society gathers pace. Tesco started by opening four shops for 24 hours in 1996 - now it has 170 stores open day and night. 'It is in response to consumer demand,' says its spokesman, Russell Craig. 'People are more conscious of their leisure time. They don't want to shop as soon as they get home; they might want to see the children, eat supper and wander out to shop at midnight. We have a global economy. When it's night-time for us, it's daytime in the US - business goes on through the night. If you drive through any city, you'll see people in suits at 2am.'</p> <p>A report from the Future Foundation says that between 9pm and 11pm, more than 1 million people are still working. Over a four-year period, there has been a 20 per cent rise in the number of people watching television between 3am and 6am. The foundation says that people increasingly want everything available to them 24 hours a day and forecasts that people will work longer hours, but outside the 9-to-5 model. All of which means going against the body's natural inclination. 'We have deep-seated biological rhythms and we really can't beat them,' cautions Dr Mackay. 'If we interfere with them, the consequences will catch up with us.'</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The lane that leads to Paul Daniels' house (his \u00a31.5m minimalist Thames-side mansion, as Hello! has it) is pure Disney: a bucolic England of birdsong, wood smoke, drifts of roses on flint walls, rowing boats beached on stripy lawns. Paul and his wife, The Lovely Debbie McGee, are running a little late - they're bowling back from Bluewater, where he has been signing copies of his autobiography - so there's an opportunity to wander around inspecting everything before they get back: the wraparound view from their 60s glass box; the flowerbeds spilling over with peonies; the pleasure-cruisers pfutting past behind a screen of willows. Then a gold Mercedes two-seater is entering the drive, spraying gravel around in its wake, and Paul Daniels, who was once very famous for being a magician, is stepping out, tieless, in a crumpled blue suit. 'It's a tough life, isn't it?' he calls out breezily, and for a moment he reminds me of Alistair McGowan's spoof of Nigel Havers hosting OK! TV : you'll never have a house like this, you wouldn't know what to do with it anyway, this is how really rich people live. </p> <p>Paul Daniels was never a cuddly entertainer. He always got up people's noses. A pint-sized telly colossus during the 80s, he bestrode a world of wide lapels and sequinned dollybirds and Seaside Specials and cheesy grins, without bothering to disguise a certain anti-populist bloody-mindedness. Though he married his magic with comedy banter learned from American one-liner books, you could not have mistaken him for a warm man. Unlike the Brucies and Tarbies, he never courted affection. He is, he says proudly, a wizzywig. 'Know what that is? WYSIWYG? What You See Is What You Get. I'm not precious. I'm me. I don't put on any airs and graces, which sometimes upsets people.' </p> <p>The papers were always full of Paul Daniels. He refused to sign a petition supporting the rights of Aids sufferers to have children; he raised funds for the Tories; he boasted about the wealth he'd accumulated through shrewd investment; he stifled rivalry by never inviting younger 'patter' magicians to do guest spots on his shows; he remarked that, like Jesus, he too could walk on water. In addition, 'the mini magician' had a short fuse and, for a brief period, wore a wig that made a deep impression on Spitting Image puppeteers. In other words, he was the flip side of Tommy Cooper: technically accomplished with wand and saw, but seriously short on charm. </p> <p>In 1995, when audience figures slumped, Alan Yentob pulled the string which released the trap door, at which point Daniels and Debbie, his assistant, suddenly vanished - pouff! - from the BBC schedules. Though he was indignant at the time about the way this was handled, he now insists he's well out of television. 'I never realised what a strain it was. I don't get uptight, I'm a cool guy. But when I found out I wasn't going to be doing any more series, I really went: \"Phew.\"' In any case, television studios aren't the same now, being stuffed with 'nerds': people 'who've been to university and have degrees in media and communications_ who don't understand this peculiar emotion called theatre'. </p> <p>You may think that magic is a dying art, having been hijacked by the tiger acts of Vegas and the subversive antics of Penn and Teller, but Daniels insists that his act is evergreen. 'I'm an oddity, you see. The rest of the world of magic looks at me with some amazement. They can't figure out how I can do a tiny trick with a cup and a ball in a 7,000-seater hall. But I do. And everybody laughs.' He may have called time on his annual Magic Show tour, but he has no plans to cut down on his other commitments. Lucrative cabaret for corporate events, after-dinner speaking, 'designing' effects for musicals and product launches: these things keep Mr and Mrs Daniels in cars, new DVD systems and Caribbean holidays. (He's a little cross that the BBC recently sent a docusoap crew to his favourite resort in Barbados. 'They gave it the tabloid treatment. And it really is much better than that. Why else would I have gone there for 20 years, you know? It's not as they depicted it at all. Who cares about life downstairs? Who goes down there, for Chrissake? You live in your room and the salons and the foyers. My God, my French is improving here.') He certainly feels no inclination to retire, or anything dull like that. No: he follows his mother's example. The other day, he noticed that she had a blackened fingernail. She explained she'd crushed it while lugging some paving slabs around the garden. She's 83. </p> <p>'People imagine that if you're not on television, you're out of work and starving to death. The truth of the matter is, of course, that you can't make a living only out of television. Well, you can - does it sound bigtime? - at my level.' </p> <p>Of course it sounds bigtime. Daniels has always tootled his horn at volume. Settling down on the patio, surveying his acres, his river view, a garage full of fine motors tucked away just out of sight, he's very Toadish indeed. When the sun has the temerity to pop behind a cloud, there is a discreet mechanical hum as the overhead canopy automatically furls itself away. 'When the sun goes in, it goes in,' he points out. </p> <p>'It's magic!' I joke. </p> <p>But Daniels is sternly literal. 'No! This' - gesturing - 'is an electronic world of wonder. Not quite finished yet. But fabulous, yes.' </p> <p> The autobiography has the same boisterously immodest quality, in spades. Here are a few artless picture captions to give you a flavour: 'The Ferrari. My brother, Trevor, was pleased when he got to drive it on my wedding day'; 'No, it's not a trick photograph. I was trading in the Bentley on the left for the one on the right. Now there's posh!'; 'Enjoying the tranquillity of the garden at our previous house. It was once owned by Roger Moore of 007 fame.' Daniels enjoys the good things in life because, as he says, 'I've earned the damn things, and I can afford it.' </p> <p>Whether he can afford his next and most mind-boggling trick remains to be seen. The Vanishing Elephant, the Magic Kettle That Poured Any Drink, the Houdini Water Torture Escape... all of these famous illusions pale in comparison to Daniels' forthcoming project: The Magician Who Launched A Ballet Company. The storehouses in North Lincolnshire that once accommodated all his magic paraphernalia - his guillotines and birdcages and decks of cards - are being emptied out and gutted, to be replaced with barres and mirrors. Debbie, a one-time soloist with the Iranian National Ballet, will be the company's artistic director, choreographer and costume designer. Her husband, who is investing heavily, will be 'building in the visual effects'. Poop-poop! It all sounds kitsch beyond belief. </p> <p>Ballet Imaginaire's production of Coppelia opens in Lincoln in September, nine months to the day after Daniels first suggested it to Debbie, because 'nine months is a proper time for a birth. It's our baby, yes. It'll be the first really high-profile touring ballet because none of the others, without conceit, will have celebrity adjuncts, any add-ons. I'm an add-on! So it'll be fascinating.' With bullish certainty, he says he's not at all apprehensive about this new venture. 'I was in Moli\u00e8re - not Moli\u00e8re . Yes, Moli\u00e8re - a couple of years ago. I loved it. I've presented QED and Medical Express and all this stuff; I love doing things that I don't normally do, and it comes quite easily to me. It annoys people enormously.' </p> <p>Debbie has dragged her husband along to plenty of ballets over the years, but he can't cite one performance that he particularly enjoyed. 'They stick in the mind for the wrong reasons. Every time I went to one of these things, I thought: \"I wouldn't put this scenery behind a pantomime!\" And, 'Aren't these costumes naff?\" And, \"Why are they doing that, Debbie?\" No, I wasn't a great ballet fan beforehand. I come from a north-east industrial town where you were kind of brought up to believe that ballet dancers were ponces. It took years to realise that they were fitter than footballers.' </p> <p>Debbie, daintily turned out in a pencil skirt, tan stilettoes and apricot shell top that matches her lipstick and the fruit juice she is carrying on a tray, comes tripping out of the house. At 42, she's 20 years younger than her husband, and superfeminine and supercoiffed in the way that only perfume-counter assistants seem to be nowadays. Friendly and utterly without guile, Debbie talks deferentially about 'Paul' and 'us', whereas her husband talks about 'me' and 'I'. </p> <p>Spotting that she has a few slices of white bread to hand, the ducks come charging up the lawn. 'Where's your photographer now?' asks Daniels, raising his eyebrows (amateurs!). He cups his hands around his mouth and bellows, foghornlike: 'Eva! Eva! Eva! Eva!' </p> <p>Perhaps I should go and find her. </p> <p>'Well, it's a good shot,' says Daniels sagely. The photographer approaches at a gallop, and is reprimanded. 'You must move slowly, Eva, or the ducks get frightened.' Watching his wife having her picture taken with the ducks, his attention wanders away from our conversation. As she shreds the bread with perfectly manicured nails, he says, 'Debbie. That's a bit big . Are you all right? What's going on? Can you get rid of that plastic bird? Why don't you go on the grass?' </p> <p> On the Paul Daniels website, this is how he sums himself up: 'Height: 5ft 5in. Favourite colour: blue. Favourite food: anything except cauliflower cheese sauce. Dislikes: inefficiency, idleness, centre-lane drivers, over-the-top use of traffic cones, war, violence and murder, especially when they come in the name of religion.' </p> <p>Daniels was born 62 years ago in South Bank near Middlesbrough, where his father was the projectionist at the Hippodrome cinema. A conspicuously short child, he was a loner until the age of 11 when, convalescing at the home of a family friend in the Yorkshire countryside, he pulled an old book called How to Entertain at Parties out of the shelves. An 'excellent antidote' to his natural shyness, magic was also a way of deterring bullies. 'Magic does give you a sort of power. If you are a quiet, shy kid, there is an awareness that hey, yes, this is a bit special. And, therefore, even to yourself, you are elevated slightly.' After grammar school, he started to work for Eston Urban Borough Council as a junior clerk, rising to the position of internal auditor. He married a colleague at the council, had three sons, and started carving out a reputation on the Working Men's Club circuit after hours. In 1970, he made his TV debut on Opportunity Knocks (and came second, as the letter inviting him to appear on the programme had told him he would). Guest spots on variety shows followed. By the time he had his own series, his marriage had fallen apart. These were the 'mad years': a while back on a train journey, he scribbled a list of the women he'd slept with, and gave up around 300. </p> <p>In 1979, he turned up at the rehearsal rooms in Shepherd's Bush to start work on his Great Yarmouth summer show. And there, perched on a wall, was the diminutive Debbie McGee. He was 40; she was 20. What did he first notice about her? 'She was easy to spot, she was the only one there. \"Who's this old tart sitting on this wall?\"' </p> <p>His wife's smile does not falter. 'I was early,' she explains. </p> <p>Debbie ('Height: 5ft 1in. Weight: 7st 3lb. Hobbies: tennis, piano, reading, clothes. Favourite colour: pale pink. Pet hates: smelly people') grew up in Surrey. She always adored showbiz ('I was just in love with the business of performing') and at 15 was accepted by the Royal Ballet School to study for its teaching diploma. After that 'I was actually offered places with a couple of big European ballet companies, but I decided to accept at the Iranian National Ballet. I was very mercenary because they were paying the most money - double what the Royal Ballet corps de ballet were.' So off she went to Iran, performing Swan Lake for the Shah while beady-eyed guards with machine-guns stood in the wings. The company was loaded, and so able to recruit retired ballerinas, such as Svetlana Beriosova (who gave Debbie private coaching when, after six weeks, she was made a soloist), and choreographers, such as Alvin Ailey. All the scenery - like most of the 150 dancers - was imported from Europe or the States. Small wonder, somehow, that the Revolution followed shortly afterwards. </p> <p>Back in the UK, desperate for work and feeling that she'd lost 'the ballet bug', Debbie auditioned for a summer show. 'I needed a job, basically. I'd never even heard of Paul Daniels. Came home, rang a load of friends up. \"I've got a job with this guy Paul Daniels, what does he do?\" And when they told me, I thought: \"Oh God no, I hate magic, I've signed a contract for four and a half months... in Great Yarmouth.\" I was dreading it.' She saw him acting the fool on Blankety Blank , stripping down to Superman underpants, and was not impressed. Later, she had a change of heart. When Mrs Merton famously asked her, 'What was it that first attracted you to the short, balding millionaire Paul Daniels?' she said he made her laugh. They were together intermittently for just under 10 years before he finally popped the question in 1987. </p> <p>Paul says it was a very conscious decision to wait for so long before making an honest woman of Debbie. 'Now, if we'd got married when she was 20 and I was 40, the press would have shredded us. But, nevertheless, at 30, this is a woman who has made her mind up. This is not a passing fad or fancy, she is not a gold-digger and I am not an older-man-going-for-a-younger-bird. She was 30 years old. Perfect timing.' </p> <p>Debbie: 'I had no idea that Paul was going to propose, but, by then, we were in a very steady, stable...' </p> <p>Paul: 'No, we'd moved out of the stable, we were in the mansion by then.' </p> <p>Debbie (doggedly): 'Before then we'd been together and apart, but by this stage we'd been together for two years, so I knew things were quite serious. But I wasn't really expecting_' </p> <p>Paul: 'When was I ever serious?' </p> <p>Debbie: 'Well, exactly. But I mean, you know, I couldn't think of the word. My vocabulary's a bit short.' </p> <p>When I ask Paul for the key to the success of their relationship, there's a pause while he puts his head on one side and considers the question. 'Well. Um... I'm funny!' My eyes flick involuntarily to Debbie, bolt upright in her chair, ankles tidily crossed, a smile soldered to her face. 'We laugh all the time, don't we?' he continues, oblivious. 'We really are good friends, good laughers. Debbie does occasionally try to have a row with me. I'm not the tidiest fella in town, you know.' </p> <p>Debbie: '99 per cent of the time we hardly ever have a cross word. We don't actually row.' </p> <p>'Although,' interjects Paul, 'it is astonishing how often you are wrong.' </p> <p>Debbie (an airhostess in turbulence): 'I'll agree to disagree on that.' </p> <p>Later, she says that the nine years she spent in limbo, waiting for Daniels to settle down, were pretty painful. 'Oh yes, because I really wanted to be serious. He kept saying, \"Go away, you're much too young for me, find somebody your own age.\" I got terribly hurt sometimes. I wanted us to be together. I didn't have any sense that it would work out in the end. I never thought he would actually take that extra step.' </p> <p>Throughout this period, of course, the pair were working together constantly. Debbie swears that she never had a moment's regret about becoming a magician's assistant. 'I did meet someone who was at the Royal Ballet School the year before me, and she said, \"Oh Deborah,\" - they didn't call me Debbie - \"Did I see you jumping out of a box or something on a Royal Variety Performance ?\" But I can't really understand it when people ask me what it feels like to have taken second best. I worked with Abba and Chris de Burgh, toured in Europe, did all this television work, lovely work, earning a lot more money than if I'd been working as a ballet dancer. I learned my craft and now I feel so relaxed on stage. Now I've got this opportunity to give all this knowledge I've got to other performers. I just feel lucky that I stopped dancing properly when I was about 24. I think I've saved my body.' It was Debbie's decision not to have children. Though Paul's oldest son from his first marriage has been in trouble with the police and nowadays has more contact with the tabloids than his dad ('TV Paul Daniels' son is a down and out!'), he and Debbie are close to the younger two. </p> <p>This house on the river was bought a few years ago, when they wearied of their last home, which had seven bathrooms and a staff of five. They wanted a simpler life, with a view of moorhens and only the occasional visit from a cleaning lady. 'It was the ugliest property on the river, and now people go by and say: \"Oooh, look at that,\"' says Daniels, Toadishly. 'That's a great tip for investment, you know. Always buy the worst house on the best street.' Out went the hessian wallhangings (shreds of which you can still see in some far-flung corridors) and the old purple and orange Hygiena kitchens. In came spanking new cornicework and cream sofas as long as cruise ships. 'And we have a Linley look in the woodworking, do you see?' points out Daniels. 'Well, no, he didn't do it, but it's very derivative. I'm not sure who made it, but I suspect he works awfully close to Lord Linley. You'll notice that because of the line of the willows there, people can't really see us, right? In the winter, when the boat licences run out, the leaves fall off and the view expands. It's just pole position. Absolutely pole position.' </p> <p>While the pair pose obligingly on their swing seat, I potter in the kitchen. The video collection includes La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e, Murder She Wrote and Emmanuelle . Next to the Smeg hob, two cookbooks are propped open on twin stands, at recipes for Fillet of Sole With Banana And Cream, and Tart Lemon Tart. For the first years of their marriage, Debbie was famous for never cooking the same meal twice in a year. She's a little less strict about that nowadays and today is adept at conjuring hash and curry out of leftovers. When the photos have been taken, she busily fixes up cups of tea and hands round a plate of almond slices and mini Bakewells while Daniels continues to reminisce. 'And I won all the comedy awards. There are boxes somewhere of awards and trophies and things. I'll sell 'em,' he says airily. 'I don't want to dust 'em. Ha ha ha! It was nice to get 'em, but...' </p> <p>Debbie distributes napkins. 'I've unpacked quite a few in your office,' she says helpfully. </p> <p>'I've wondered where all this rubbish is coming from,' roars her husband excitedly. 'It's you! Divorce! Scoop! Divorce!' </p> <p> Debbie sees me off into the taxi. I watch her picking her way back across the gravel, heading for the plate-glass of the dining-room extension, and for some reason I am reminded of the Houdini Water Torture Escape. I hope Debbie knows that the padlock is a dummy. I hope she knows it's all done with false lids.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The lane that leads to Paul Daniels' house (his \u00a31.5m minimalist Thames-side mansion, as Hello! has it) is pure Disney: a bucolic England of birdsong, wood smoke, drifts of roses on flint walls, rowing boats beached on stripy lawns. Paul and his wife, The Lovely Debbie McGee, are running a little late - they're bowling back from Bluewater, where he has been signing copies of his autobiography - so there's an opportunity to wander around inspecting everything before they get back: the wraparound view from their 60s glass box; the flowerbeds spilling over with peonies; the pleasure-cruisers pfutting past behind a screen of willows. Then a gold Mercedes two-seater is entering the drive, spraying gravel around in its wake, and Paul Daniels, who was once very famous for being a magician, is stepping out, tieless, in a crumpled blue suit. 'It's a tough life, isn't it?' he calls out breezily, and for a moment he reminds me of Alistair McGowan's spoof of Nigel Havers hosting OK! TV : you'll never have a house like this, you wouldn't know what to do with it anyway, this is how really rich people live. Paul Daniels was never a cuddly entertainer. He always got up people's noses. A pint-sized telly colossus during the 80s, he bestrode a world of wide lapels and sequinned dollybirds and Seaside Specials and cheesy grins, without bothering to disguise a certain anti-populist bloody-mindedness. Though he married his magic with comedy banter learned from American one-liner books, you could not have mistaken him for a warm man. Unlike the Brucies and Tarbies, he never courted affection. He is, he says proudly, a wizzywig. 'Know what that is? WYSIWYG? What You See Is What You Get. I'm not precious. I'm me. I don't put on any airs and graces, which sometimes upsets people.' The papers were always full of Paul Daniels. He refused to sign a petition supporting the rights of Aids sufferers to have children; he raised funds for the Tories; he boasted about the wealth he'd accumulated through shrewd investment; he stifled rivalry by never inviting younger 'patter' magicians to do guest spots on his shows; he remarked that, like Jesus, he too could walk on water. In addition, 'the mini magician' had a short fuse and, for a brief period, wore a wig that made a deep impression on Spitting Image puppeteers. In other words, he was the flip side of Tommy Cooper: technically accomplished with wand and saw, but seriously short on charm. In 1995, when audience figures slumped, Alan Yentob pulled the string which released the trap door, at which point Daniels and Debbie, his assistant, suddenly vanished - pouff! - from the BBC schedules.

Debbie (doggedly): 'Before then we'd been together and apart, but by this stage we'd been together for two years, so I knew things were quite serious. But I wasn't really expecting_' Paul: 'When was I ever serious?' Debbie: 'Well, exactly. But I mean, you know, I couldn't think of the word. My vocabulary's a bit short.' When I ask Paul for the key to the success of their relationship, there's a pause while he puts his head on one side and considers the question. 'Well. Um... I'm funny!' My eyes flick involuntarily to Debbie, bolt upright in her chair, ankles tidily crossed, a smile soldered to her face. 'We laugh all the time, don't we?' he continues, oblivious. 'We really are good friends, good laughers. Debbie does occasionally try to have a row with me. I'm not the tidiest fella in town, you know.' Debbie: '99 per cent of the time we hardly ever have a cross word. We don't actually row.' 'Although,' interjects Paul, 'it is astonishing how often you are wrong.' Debbie (an airhostess in turbulence): 'I'll agree to disagree on that.' Later, she says that the nine years she spent in limbo, waiting for Daniels to settle down, were pretty painful. 'Oh yes, because I really wanted to be serious. He kept saying, \"Go away, you're much too young for me, find somebody your own age.\" I got terribly hurt sometimes. I wanted us to be together. I didn't have any sense that it would work out in the end. I never thought he would actually take that extra step.' Throughout this period, of course, the pair were working together constantly. Debbie swears that she never had a moment's regret about becoming a magician's assistant. 'I did meet someone who was at the Royal Ballet School the year before me, and she said, \"Oh Deborah,\" - they didn't call me Debbie - \"Did I see you jumping out of a box or something on a Royal Variety Performance ?\" But I can't really understand it when people ask me what it feels like to have taken second best. I worked with Abba and Chris de Burgh, toured in Europe, did all this television work, lovely work, earning a lot more money than if I'd been working as a ballet dancer. I learned my craft and now I feel so relaxed on stage. Now I've got this opportunity to give all this knowledge I've got to other performers. I just feel lucky that I stopped dancing properly when I was about 24. I think I've saved my body.' It was Debbie's decision not to have children. Though Paul's oldest son from his first marriage has been in trouble with the police and nowadays has more contact with the tabloids than his dad ('TV Paul Daniels' son is a down and out!'), he and Debbie are close to the younger two. This house on the river was bought a few years ago, when they wearied of their last home, which had seven bathrooms and a staff of five. They wanted a simpler life, with a view of moorhens and only the occasional visit from a cleaning lady. 'It was the ugliest property on the river, and now people go by and say: \"Oooh, look at that,\"' says Daniels, Toadishly. 'That's a great tip for investment, you know. Always buy the worst house on the best street.' Out went the hessian wallhangings (shreds of which you can still see in some far-flung corridors) and the old purple and orange Hygiena kitchens. In came spanking new cornicework and cream sofas as long as cruise ships. 'And we have a Linley look in the woodworking, do you see?' points out Daniels. 'Well, no, he didn't do it, but it's very derivative. I'm not sure who made it, but I suspect he works awfully close to Lord Linley. You'll notice that because of the line of the willows there, people can't really see us, right? In the winter, when the boat licences run out, the leaves fall off and the view expands. It's just pole position. Absolutely pole position.' While the pair pose obligingly on their swing seat, I potter in the kitchen. The video collection includes La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e, Murder She Wrote and Emmanuelle . Next to the Smeg hob, two cookbooks are propped open on twin stands, at recipes for Fillet of Sole With Banana And Cream, and Tart Lemon Tart. For the first years of their marriage, Debbie was famous for never cooking the same meal twice in a year. She's a little less strict about that nowadays and today is adept at conjuring hash and curry out of leftovers. When the photos have been taken, she busily fixes up cups of tea and hands round a plate of almond slices and mini Bakewells while Daniels continues to reminisce. 'And I won all the comedy awards. There are boxes somewhere of awards and trophies and things. I'll sell 'em,' he says airily. 'I don't want to dust 'em. Ha ha ha! It was nice to get 'em, but...' Debbie distributes napkins. 'I've unpacked quite a few in your office,' she says helpfully. 'I've wondered where all this rubbish is coming from,' roars her husband excitedly. 'It's you! Divorce! Scoop! Divorce!' Debbie sees me off into the taxi. I watch her picking her way back across the gravel, heading for the plate-glass of the dining-room extension, and for some reason I am reminded of the Houdini Water Torture Escape. I hope Debbie knows that the padlock is a dummy. I hope she knows it's all done with false lids.",

Men don't do that nowadays. The prevailing culture is one of emotional hooliganism, fuelled by the excuse of searing honesty.

Now we've got Hanif Kureishi's Intimacy , a thinly disguised novel considered a 'hate letter' to his ex-partner and mother of his twins, Tracey Scoffield. There's Joseph Stone's weekly Guardian column, ostensibly about co-parenting, but in which he takes gratuitous side-swipes at his ex-wife Dilys. There's Terence Conran who, in rage at third wife Caroline's \u00a310.5m divorce settlement, publicly dismissed any contribution she might have made to the Conran empire; and US billionaire Ron Perelman who, in an ongoing battle over child custody, discredits and humiliates his ex-wife Patricia Duff at every turn.</p> <p>Then there's Tim Lott, the dreaded Tim Lott.

      "byline": "Stephanie Dennison",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Jackie Hickling</strong></p> <p> I've always hated worms. Even hearing the word 'worm' made me feel sick. I couldn't go for a walk or a bike ride with my children in case I saw one, and if it rained, I couldn't leave the house for fear of them squirming on to the pavement. </p> <p> One of my earliest memories is of being at junior school when the teacher decided she'd get me over this fear by having a wormery in the classroom. One of the boys decided to fill my lift-up desk with worms. I screamed the place down, I was hysterical - and it's gone on from there. </p> <p> After I had a stroke during the birth of my fourth child, Johnny, it got much worse. It was bad enough losing control of my left side, let alone losing control of my head. When Johnny was a toddler he escaped out of the yard towards the lake, but as I tried to chase him I saw a worm on the grass and couldn't get past it, even though I could see Johnny heading for the water. Robin, my eldest daughter, grabbed him just in time. </p> <p> So when I heard the BBC was looking for phobics to participate in a science programme, I rang them. They wired me up to see how I'd react to a kiddie's picture of a worm smiling, and my blood pressure dropped so low they thought I was going to have another stroke. Then they introduced me to Paul. I walked into the room at Warneford Hospital in Oxford and there was this large man with grass cuttings on his trousers where he'd been mowing the lawn earlier, and I thought: 'Mad professor.' I was sceptical. But he got me to analyse myself. A lot of doctors talk down to you, or expect you won't understand things, whereas Paul talks to you on the same level. He's open and lets you into his life, talks about his wife and children. So I began to trust him. </p> <p> He got down to the point of why I was scared of worms, what I knew about them. He asked if, because of the stroke, I was scared of dying. I said no. Then I told him about this repetitive vision of being in a box with worms around me. He showed me pictures of worms in a book, which I took home to practise touching the paper. Later he gave me a glass box and he put a worm in it, and I had to hold it. Ooh. </p> <p> Paul's increased the quality of my life tremendously. I feel he's the first doctor to actually do something to help me. I'm a lot more normal. I'm in and out of hospitals a lot, so the time I do have with the children is precious. I can now go to watch them playing football in the park, whatever. I still freeze when I see a worm - I have palpitations and my heart races, but only for a few seconds, and I walk around it. I don't think I could have trusted anyone other than Paul. </p> <p><strong> Paul Salkovskis</strong><br> Jackie was terrified when we first met. I knew she'd had a stroke and wasn't in the best physical health. I first had to identify how it was affecting her and what she feared might happen. Jackie was trying really hard not to think too much about what she was afraid of, which was unusual. She was also having fragmentary images of a worm, coming downwards. I asked her if she would close her eyes and picture it, which she was reluctant to do. As she calmed down, it turned out this worm was one of many. She was lying in a coffin and there were worms all around her; she couldn't move or scream. The fear that seemed to be driving this wasn't worms, per se, but being trapped in a coffin.</p> <p> She'd had a stroke and become immobilised, unable to speak. My strong hunch was that she had a fear of worms, then had a stroke and started envisaging what could happen, and a locked-in syndrome developed. One of the things that we teach people to do is to stay in control, but Jackie could only use one hand.

      "bodyText": "Jackie Hickling I've always hated worms. Even hearing the word 'worm' made me feel sick. I couldn't go for a walk or a bike ride with my children in case I saw one, and if it rained, I couldn't leave the house for fear of them squirming on to the pavement. One of my earliest memories is of being at junior school when the teacher decided she'd get me over this fear by having a wormery in the classroom. One of the boys decided to fill my lift-up desk with worms. I screamed the place down, I was hysterical - and it's gone on from there. After I had a stroke during the birth of my fourth child, Johnny, it got much worse. It was bad enough losing control of my left side, let alone losing control of my head. When Johnny was a toddler he escaped out of the yard towards the lake, but as I tried to chase him I saw a worm on the grass and couldn't get past it, even though I could see Johnny heading for the water. Robin, my eldest daughter, grabbed him just in time. So when I heard the BBC was looking for phobics to participate in a science programme, I rang them. They wired me up to see how I'd react to a kiddie's picture of a worm smiling, and my blood pressure dropped so low they thought I was going to have another stroke. Then they introduced me to Paul. I walked into the room at Warneford Hospital in Oxford and there was this large man with grass cuttings on his trousers where he'd been mowing the lawn earlier, and I thought: 'Mad professor.' I was sceptical. But he got me to analyse myself. A lot of doctors talk down to you, or expect you won't understand things, whereas Paul talks to you on the same level. He's open and lets you into his life, talks about his wife and children. So I began to trust him. He got down to the point of why I was scared of worms, what I knew about them. He asked if, because of the stroke, I was scared of dying. I said no. Then I told him about this repetitive vision of being in a box with worms around me. He showed me pictures of worms in a book, which I took home to practise touching the paper. Later he gave me a glass box and he put a worm in it, and I had to hold it. Ooh. Paul's increased the quality of my life tremendously. I feel he's the first doctor to actually do something to help me. I'm a lot more normal. I'm in and out of hospitals a lot, so the time I do have with the children is precious. I can now go to watch them playing football in the park, whatever. I still freeze when I see a worm - I have palpitations and my heart races, but only for a few seconds, and I walk around it. I don't think I could have trusted anyone other than Paul. Paul Salkovskis Jackie was terrified when we first met. I knew she'd had a stroke and wasn't in the best physical health. I first had to identify how it was affecting her and what she feared might happen. Jackie was trying really hard not to think too much about what she was afraid of, which was unusual. She was also having fragmentary images of a worm, coming downwards. I asked her if she would close her eyes and picture it, which she was reluctant to do. As she calmed down, it turned out this worm was one of many. She was lying in a coffin and there were worms all around her; she couldn't move or scream. The fear that seemed to be driving this wasn't worms, per se, but being trapped in a coffin. She'd had a stroke and become immobilised, unable to speak. My strong hunch was that she had a fear of worms, then had a stroke and started envisaging what could happen, and a locked-in syndrome developed. One of the things that we teach people to do is to stay in control, but Jackie could only use one hand. So to have a worm wriggling around was much harder to control, which meant treatment took longer. I also didn't want to put her blood pressure up because she'd had a stroke, so I had to balance out her anxiety with the need to keep things moving. Gradually, I got her used to having worms in her hand, then going out into the grass and getting used to the worms you can't see. One of the things about fears is that the thing we can't see is often more frightening than that which you can. My aim with Jackie was to get completely rid of the fear. For 71 per cent of people we see, a year after treatment there is no residual problem. With the other 29 per cent, it isn't that they aren't improved, it's just that they need a bit more of the same. For Jackie, there was an intermediate end, which was walking on grass and dealing with the restrictions in her life. She's still got some fear and needs further treatment. You have to bear in mind the importance of helping people to feel understood, and I give that the highest priority.

Some analysts have expressed fears that the company will run out of cash by September, a claim hotly disputed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

'It's not a stock that should be the major holding in your portfolio,' he says. ' Observer readers shouldn't take all their money out of their Isas and invest in Amazon. We've racked up some pretty big operating losses, but we understand we've got to make some pretty big profits in the future.' </p> <p>The irony is that, despite its slump in value and the volatility of its stock, Amazon has a better chance of becoming a major player in the e-tail sector than virtually any other 'pure' internet company.

Bezos himself asks investors to think ahead 10 years, rather than focusing on the short term. Small wonder. The predictions made for growth in the e-tail sector are huge. Gartner Group, for instance, estimates e-tail sales in the US at nearly $30bn this year, up 75 per cent on last year's figure. By 2004 the sector will account for 7 per cent of retail sales. </p> <p>But while predictions for future growth are soaring, the value of the companies currently competing in the sector are crashing. In the US, a report from Goldman Sachs found that 10 publicly quoted e-tailers are burning money so quickly they will have to raise more in the coming months if they are not to go under. We have already seen online video distributor Reel.com collapse, while music e-tailer <a href=\"http://www.CDNow.com\" target=\"_new\">CDNow</a> is in trouble.

'We're about to see the revenge of the bricks,' said Andrew Peck of business consultancy The Smith Group. </p> <p>David Pannell, consultant with Durlacher, agrees: 'Who will capture the growth in e-sales? The stock market is saying it will be established retailers, not the dotcoms.' </p> <p>Consumers seem to share his view.

The report found that 63 per cent of customers were inclined to trust <a href=\"http://www.whsmith.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">whsmith.co.uk</a>, against 59 per cent for Amazon. And some online brands are already losing their novelty value. Doug Wilson, a director with market analyst Datamonitor, says: 'If you shop at most online sites today it's the equivalent of going into a basic discount store. People in the offline world like to shop with retailers who offer customer service - such as Selfridge's, and are going to expect the equivalent online.' </p> <p>Pressure on pure internet firms is likely to intensify dramatically in the coming months. The P500 report, a survey out this week by Online Research Agency, finds that although only 20 per cent of the UK's biggest firms currently have an e-commerce presence, by the end of this year half of them will be selling online. And the bricks- and-mortar firms have a significant advantage in the race to dominate the internet: money. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Tesco.com\" target=\"_new\">Tesco</a>, for instance, now claims to be the biggest online grocer that delivers to your door. But each van Tesco uses to fulfil online purchase orders costs the retail giant nearly \u00a31,000 a week, according to industry sources. 'The amount of money now being spent by the major corporations in comparison to start-ups is very similar, but in relative terms they haven't even begun to flex their muscles,' said Nick Rosen of Online Research. </p> <p>Similarly, in the US, analysts at <a href=\"http://www.forrester.com\" target=\"_new\">Forrester Research</a> predict that companies such as Wal-Mart, Kmart and Toys 'R' Us, which have large inventories and huge customer bases, will emerge as major online players once the dust settles. </p> <p>The events of last Christmas show how much pain the pure internet firms are likely to feel. According to a survey by internet analysis firm Media Metrix, nearly half of the 50 most visited sites during the holiday period had a strong bricks-and-mortar presence; only a handful of 'pure' websites made the list. Datamonitor's Wilson com ments: 'Internet companies have to spend a fortune building a brand, but Tesco doesn't have to spend much convincing people it's a grocer.' </p> <p>One theory now in fashion is that many dotcoms will end up being swallowed by high street retailers looking for new business opportunities. 'Many will just get bought by established brands looking for a quick way to resolve their channel problems,' said Rosen at Online Research. 'For instance, a camera firm may not sell online because this would upset retailers who already sell its products, but acquiring an internet firm would get round this problem.' </p> <p>This is not to say all pure e-tailers are doomed.

Basta adds: 'The money will be channelled to those firms which are seen as long-term successes. There will be less of a portfolio approach to investment.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, the list of firms on dotcom death row is set to grow while the established retailers look for ways of commanding their turf. </p> <p>Said Wilson: 'God tends to be on the side of the big battalions.'</p>",

Since she is not a regular viewer of Ally McBeal and doesn't, to my knowledge, intersperse her Postman Pat books with Marie Claire, it is difficult to know where this distorted self-image comes from. It has something to do with peer groups and playground chat, but I have no doubt somewhere in that complex mix of social conditioning lie the pervasive images of television, press and posters. no one knows whether a five-year-old's unthinking repetition becomes a 15-year-old's anorexia, but it is disturbing. </p> <p>My reaction to the announcement by women's minister Tessa Jowell that television and magazines were to monitor how women's bodies were represented on TV was therefore rather different to the predictable hysteria of the tabloid press. The Daily Mail ' s front- page 'Lunacy of the TV weight watch police' was taken up by editorials condemning 'political correctness gone mad' ( Express ) and 'a total joke' ( Sun ). </p> <p>It is slightly disappointing to discover that the study may not even happen: the Broadcasting Standards Commission has given no commitment to count fatties and thinnies on the box and is merely thinking, in the light of Jowell's 'body image summit', about whether such research is feasible and whether it wants to do it anyway. </p> <p>What is fascinating about this furious reaction to an idea that may never happen is that the fury comes from the very same newspapers that tend to save their most savage bile for those who offend their rather precious standards of taste and decency. In recent weeks, Channel 5 in general and its chief executive David Elstein in particular have been the targets of malicious attacks simply because the channel dares to show some not very attractive dangly bits without a fig leaf. We see the same chorus of blinkered condemnation whenever some kind of violent atrocity can be tenuously linked to a TV programme or movie (never, of course, to something published in a newspaper). Anyone who's ever murdered their husband and buried his body under their patio would have been the model of law-abiding citizenship if only they hadn't succumbed to the temptation of watching Channel Four. </p> <p>The reason for these outbursts of self-righteous fury lies in assumptions about TV's influence. Repeated use of four-letter words or scenes of nudity or mindless violence on TV are deemed at best to degrade viewers' delicate minds and at worst to persuade them that such behaviour should be mimicked in the real world at the earliest opportunity. </p> <p>All this is unproven, unprovable and 95 per cent nonsense. Adults exposed to the now familiar 'strong language' that accompanies much contemporary drama are unlikely suddenly to expand their vocabulary when remonstrating with children or neighbours the following day. On the other hand, they are less likely to be surprised (or even offended) by the colourful language that often accompanies road rage or a post-soccer-match inquisition in the pub. </p> <p>Similarly, watching an hour of Friday-night steamy heterosexual activity on Channel 5 is unlikely to send thousands of viewers off to copulate like rabbits all weekend. It may, however, remind those of us who may be having doubts (or memory loss) that sex can be quite pleasant. </p> <p>Apply that model to TV violence, though, and I begin to side with the moralists. However much dramatic reality may demand it, there is always the nagging fear that graphic acts of violence on TV might somehow legitimise violent conduct among viewers who are that way inclined. But those who advance this argument must also accept the logical extension that other kinds of TV images - be it the negative portrayal of ethnic minorities or the constant parade of thin women who define female beauty - can also reinforce social norms which are undesirable. </p> <p>Our obsession with taste and decency is not helped by the presence of two regulators expressly charged with looking after broadcasting's moral welfare. It scarcely matters how much thoughtful research the Independent Television Commission or the Broadcasting Standards Commission does on the role of broadcasting: as we saw this week with the publication of the BSC's annual report, the spotlight will always be on complaints about the f-word or Keith Chegwin's willy. </p> <p>Perhaps the much-touted single regulator will provide an opportunity to change our research priorities. In the meantime, I hope the BSC does find a way to count fatties on the box. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk\">S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk</a></p>",

The Daily Mail ' s front- page 'Lunacy of the TV weight watch police' was taken up by editorials condemning 'political correctness gone mad' ( Express ) and 'a total joke' ( Sun ). It is slightly disappointing to discover that the study may not even happen: the Broadcasting Standards Commission has given no commitment to count fatties and thinnies on the box and is merely thinking, in the light of Jowell's 'body image summit', about whether such research is feasible and whether it wants to do it anyway. What is fascinating about this furious reaction to an idea that may never happen is that the fury comes from the very same newspapers that tend to save their most savage bile for those who offend their rather precious standards of taste and decency. In recent weeks, Channel 5 in general and its chief executive David Elstein in particular have been the targets of malicious attacks simply because the channel dares to show some not very attractive dangly bits without a fig leaf. We see the same chorus of blinkered condemnation whenever some kind of violent atrocity can be tenuously linked to a TV programme or movie (never, of course, to something published in a newspaper). Anyone who's ever murdered their husband and buried his body under their patio would have been the model of law-abiding citizenship if only they hadn't succumbed to the temptation of watching Channel Four. The reason for these outbursts of self-righteous fury lies in assumptions about TV's influence. Repeated use of four-letter words or scenes of nudity or mindless violence on TV are deemed at best to degrade viewers' delicate minds and at worst to persuade them that such behaviour should be mimicked in the real world at the earliest opportunity. All this is unproven, unprovable and 95 per cent nonsense. Adults exposed to the now familiar 'strong language' that accompanies much contemporary drama are unlikely suddenly to expand their vocabulary when remonstrating with children or neighbours the following day. On the other hand, they are less likely to be surprised (or even offended) by the colourful language that often accompanies road rage or a post-soccer-match inquisition in the pub. Similarly, watching an hour of Friday-night steamy heterosexual activity on Channel 5 is unlikely to send thousands of viewers off to copulate like rabbits all weekend. It may, however, remind those of us who may be having doubts (or memory loss) that sex can be quite pleasant. Apply that model to TV violence, though, and I begin to side with the moralists. However much dramatic reality may demand it, there is always the nagging fear that graphic acts of violence on TV might somehow legitimise violent conduct among viewers who are that way inclined. But those who advance this argument must also accept the logical extension that other kinds of TV images - be it the negative portrayal of ethnic minorities or the constant parade of thin women who define female beauty - can also reinforce social norms which are undesirable. Our obsession with taste and decency is not helped by the presence of two regulators expressly charged with looking after broadcasting's moral welfare. It scarcely matters how much thoughtful research the Independent Television Commission or the Broadcasting Standards Commission does on the role of broadcasting: as we saw this week with the publication of the BSC's annual report, the spotlight will always be on complaints about the f-word or Keith Chegwin's willy. Perhaps the much-touted single regulator will provide an opportunity to change our research priorities. In the meantime, I hope the BSC does find a way to count fatties on the box.

But it could just as easily mean that Charles Dunstone and his team suspect the staggering growth rates enjoyed in the first 12 years of business cannot be sustained in the future and are casting around for other sources of growth. </p> <p>Certainly, the business has done spectacularly. Turnover in the past three years alone has risen almost fourfold, while profits before tax have jumped from \u00a313.9 million to \u00a329.6m. The charts presented to analysts are designed to suggest growth will continue forever. Bar charts showing handset sales and mobile phone usage march across the page, increasing by 25 per cent or more each year. Sales of replacement handsets, for example, are expected to rise to 227 million by 2003, from 22 million last year, dwarfing the 83 million likely to be sold to new users. </p> <p>These are forecasts, not facts, albeit based on research by experts. Many other businesses are betting their futures on predictions of an explosion in the use of mobiles for internet access and text messaging - just look at what Vodafone and the rest paid for their third-generation licences. And the valuations of handset manufacturers such as Nokia and Ericsson are predicated on punters regularly swapping their old-fashioned mobile phones for Wap-enabled ones in the latest design. </p> <p>Carphone Warehouse has plenty of scope for growth even if these forecasts prove optimistic. It has 477 UK outlets, but could open more. It is building a network on the Continent, and branch openings - 60 in three months - will keep sales growing. </p> <p>But, as everyone from Marks &amp; Spencer to Boots can attest, building European networks is harder than it sounds. The risk is that it absorbs a lot of investment and never produces decent returns. Good returns have been Carphone Warehouse's hallmark. Gross margins in the retail business are more than 30 per cent. Operating margins have been falling, partly because of growth, and are now 4.9 per cent compared with 7.4 per cent two years ago. The company says it can return to the higher levels as expansion slows. But some analysts worry these may not be sustainable. </p> <p>The phone manufacturers and network operators which are its suppliers will have been reading the prospectus too. It would not be surprising if, having studied the phenomenal growth Carphone Warehouse has enjoyed, they were thinking of ways to keep more of the profits for themselves, either by cutting subsidies or selling more directly. There is increasing competition elsewhere too. The fact that you can now get handsets from places such as Tesco and Woolworths underlines how close they are to a commodity product. </p> <p>Conveniently, the prospectus lists all the other potential threats to business in a section called Investment considerations - and the six pages devoted to these should be essential reading for anyone considering applying for shares. These range from the possibility that Value Telecom and Mviva will distract management's attention from running the core retail business, to the threat that its reputation for impartial advice will be undermined by the fact that its salesmen will now be rewarded for pushing these two services. </p> <p>But all companies, however risky, can be sold at a price. The question is, does Carphone Warehouse's valuation adequately reflect the risks? The only way to treat Mviva and Value Telecom is as costs, and their profits, if they do arrive, as a bonus. The mid price of 195p puts the valuation at \u00a31.6bn, equal to more than 50 times forecast earnings. That is below Matalan, the other retail star of the stock market. But Matalan's suppliers are not likely to try to muscle in on its success, and it has more scope for growth in outlets. </p> <p>Mobile mania means that the flotation is likely to be oversubscribed and could go to a premium. But buyers should be aware of the risks in the business. This is not a share which you can just buy and forget about. </p> <p><strong> Healthy prospect</strong><br> Smith &amp; Nephew never seems to live up to the promise of its products. It is the leading company in wound management - producing products such as synthetic skin for burns patients - and in arthroscopy techniques such as keyhole surgery. It is also one of the top companies in orthopaedic products, such as hip and knee replacements. All are fast-growing areas, with the potential for further acceleration. Yet S&amp;N's sales growth has been pedestrian, and shares have lagged far behind the market over the past five years. </p> <p>Last week's trio of announcements suggests that could finally change. It is selling its consumer products businesses - solid names including Simple, Lil-lets and Elastoplast, which distracted management from a single-minded focus on its core, more high-tech, areas. It is giving shareholders the \u00a3235m that is raising - plus an extra \u00a3180m from its own resources through a 37.14p special dividend - and consolidating its share capital. And it is changing its dividend policy to reflect its 'strategic growth aims'. </p> <p>In layman's language, the immediate effect of that is a one-third cut in payout as it aims for dividends to be covered 2.5 times by earnings, rather than 1.3 to 1.7 times as in the past. The benefit to S&amp;N, however, is that it frees up the \u00a325m or so a year of cash that was needed to pay the dividend and can now be used to finance acquisitions. </p> <p>It could, of course, have simply kept hold of the sales proceeds and used that to keep up the dividend flow. But chief executive Chris O'Donnell says there are no large acquisitions on the horizon, although it will keep up the pace of smaller deals. </p> <p>Shorn of the consumer businesses, its sales growth should start to accelerate. Analysts expect it to achieve 8 per cent organic sales growth, with a further 4 per cent from acquisitions.

      "body": "<p>This is the story of Kevin Jones, Britain's king of pyramid selling. In a five-year reign in the Nineties, this slick Doncaster hairdresser-turned-serial superspiv fleeced more people through more illegal get-rich-quick schemes than any other con merchant in the UK before him. </p> <p>His conviction in February - he and four co-conspirators were jailed for 20 years in all - marked the Department of Trade and Industry's biggest success to date in nailing fraudsters. But, because of strict reporting restrictions, the full story of the Yorkshire pharaoh's rise and fall can only now be told. </p> <p>Dubbed 'the man with the golden tongue', Jones's tale of high living, fast cars and quick riches is a caution to fools easily parted from their money. It is also, the authorities hope, a warning to future fast-buck merchants aiming to take advantage of the greedy or just plain gullible. </p> <p>Last week, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) closed its file on the 41-year-old Yorkshire swindler. At Leicester Crown Court, it decided not to pursue one of the smaller pyramid-selling scams in which he was alleged to have been involved. In 1994 about 3,000 suckers lured by that particular get-rich-quick scheme - cynically promoted as Peace of Mind - together lost \u00a31.3 million. </p> <p>Ten days ago, Kevin Jones and his older brother, Russell, were also acquitted over their alleged role in the Ostrich Farming Corporation (OFC), which fleeced 2,800 people - including ITN newsreader Fiona Armstrong - of \u00a322m in the most bizarre fast-buck scheme of the last decade. </p> <p>OFC's two founders had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and were jailed. Kevin Jones' acquittal was, nonetheless, another huge disappointment to the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the case. But what the ostrich jury did not know was that four months previously - following a dogged seven-year international pursuit by the DTI - Kevin Jones had already been locked up for five-and-a-half years over another scam which made headlines in the Nineties: Alchemy International. </p> <p>'You have... cynically and dishonestly and systematically exploited on an extensive, indeed, near countrywide, scale, the trust and aspirations of a very large number of people,' Judge Hoffman said on sentencing Jones over the 'complex and elaborate' Alchemy swindle at Leeds Crown Court. </p> <p>Snared by happy clappy seminars at top hotels, slick videos, sales patter and downright lies, scores of taxi drivers, cleaners, redundant miners and professional people flocked to Alchemy. </p> <p>So high-profile was the scheme that it featured on BBC's That's Life and national television news.

      "bodyText": "This is the story of Kevin Jones, Britain's king of pyramid selling. In a five-year reign in the Nineties, this slick Doncaster hairdresser-turned-serial superspiv fleeced more people through more illegal get-rich-quick schemes than any other con merchant in the UK before him. His conviction in February - he and four co-conspirators were jailed for 20 years in all - marked the Department of Trade and Industry's biggest success to date in nailing fraudsters. But, because of strict reporting restrictions, the full story of the Yorkshire pharaoh's rise and fall can only now be told. Dubbed 'the man with the golden tongue', Jones's tale of high living, fast cars and quick riches is a caution to fools easily parted from their money. It is also, the authorities hope, a warning to future fast-buck merchants aiming to take advantage of the greedy or just plain gullible. Last week, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) closed its file on the 41-year-old Yorkshire swindler. At Leicester Crown Court, it decided not to pursue one of the smaller pyramid-selling scams in which he was alleged to have been involved. In 1994 about 3,000 suckers lured by that particular get-rich-quick scheme - cynically promoted as Peace of Mind - together lost \u00a31.3 million. Ten days ago, Kevin Jones and his older brother, Russell, were also acquitted over their alleged role in the Ostrich Farming Corporation (OFC), which fleeced 2,800 people - including ITN newsreader Fiona Armstrong - of \u00a322m in the most bizarre fast-buck scheme of the last decade. OFC's two founders had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and were jailed. Kevin Jones' acquittal was, nonetheless, another huge disappointment to the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the case. But what the ostrich jury did not know was that four months previously - following a dogged seven-year international pursuit by the DTI - Kevin Jones had already been locked up for five-and-a-half years over another scam which made headlines in the Nineties: Alchemy International. 'You have... cynically and dishonestly and systematically exploited on an extensive, indeed, near countrywide, scale, the trust and aspirations of a very large number of people,' Judge Hoffman said on sentencing Jones over the 'complex and elaborate' Alchemy swindle at Leeds Crown Court. Snared by happy clappy seminars at top hotels, slick videos, sales patter and downright lies, scores of taxi drivers, cleaners, redundant miners and professional people flocked to Alchemy. So high-profile was the scheme that it featured on BBC's That's Life and national television news. In all, 7,300 people were taken for a \u00a33m ride over 18 months before the DTI finally shut Alchemy down in July 1994. The lure was the old pyramid trick - with a twist. Vast rewards were promised to investors who forked out up to \u00a314,000 each and recruited other 'players' to join Alchemy's 'Golden Matrix'.

      "body": "<p>The bods charged with delivering Nokia's wireless internet strategy could manage only the hastiest of interviews last week - in the back of a London taxi between Piccadilly Circus and Paddington Station. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Ilkka Pukkila, director of Nokia's 3G marketing strategy, and Ukko Lappalainen, the company's 3G general manager, hadn't banked on the capital's atrocious traffic conditions and were thus running late for the interview. Admittedly, Nokia is a giant in the mobile communications market. But a hasty briefing in the back of a lurching black cab is probably not what the Finnish company has in mind when it comes to developing communications on the move. </p> <p>When The Observer caught up with the pair, they had just finished a presentation to the City's finest in which they pushed the line that, honestly, the costs of rolling out the wireless internet of the future - also known as third-generation (3G) services - are not really going to be that expensive. </p> <p>Unfortunately, fellow mobile giant Ericsson is not so optimistic. On Thursday the company's president, Kurt Hellstroem, warned that growth in the mobile market is likely to slow because of the costs of 3G licences. His comments focused investors' concerns on the wireless industry's massive capital requirements and sent the price of telecom shares plunging. </p> <p>As the taxi weaved through thick London traffic, the two Nokia executives expressed incredulity that the city centre could be so jam-packed. 'It's because of all the telecom firms digging up the roads and laying thick cables,' the pair were informed. </p> <p>In Nokia's world, of course, there would be no need for so many cables. Wireless base stations would act as substitutes for many of the inner city networks currently being laid across the UK to cope with the huge demand for new information services. </p> <p>But the promised wireless revolution now seems to have hit a snag: how will it be financed? The key problem is that the industry is embarking on a roll-out of new technology which will transform mobile handsets into sophisticated devices capable of receiving and sending data wherever we are. </p> <p>Revolution is something of a misnomer. Evolution is more the order of the day. This may look like semantic pedantry, but the fact that the mobile data explosion will roll out in stages has profound implications for the industry. </p> <p>Already, consumers in the UK can buy Wap (Wireless Application Protocol) phones which allow them to download basic text services from the world wide web; soon, general packet radio services and, in the longer run, 3G technology, will be rolled out. </p> <p>The problem is that each new technology requires huge investment. And this will come on top of the billions the mobile phone networks are now having to pay for the cost of 3G licences. Nokia estimates that it will take an incumbent mobile operator between five and seven years to claw back the costs of that 3G licence and of building a network in any particular country. </p> <p>Analysts now talk of mobile phone operators having to spend more than \u00a3100 billion on licences and 3G technology if they want to build a global network. But other technologies are sucking up mobile operators' capital expenditure, such as Wap and GPRS. </p> <p>Who is going to pay for all this new technology? You can almost hear investors stealing the best line from Jerry Maguire: 'Show us the money. Show us the money.' </p> <p>Nokia suggests that 3G means operators can double their revenues and cut their costs in half. The latter can be done, apparently, because 3G networks will have 'scaleability' - that is, they will be able to adapt at little cost in the long run, thus bringing overall capital expenditure down. </p> <p>Pukkila argues that there will be three key drivers behind the doubling of revenue growth: 'There will be services that are time-critical: you will be able to receive information in real time. There will be services that are person-sensitive: they know who you are and will arrange their services around you. And they will be location-sensitive: they know where you are. These factors will allow for the creation of premium services that will put some real value on the networks.' </p> <p>Nokia believes consumers are prepared to pay for these services. 'People are already paying a little extra for banking over their mobile phone in Finland,' Lappalainen explained. Advertising and the application of the technology to other services - such as clever gizmos which help black cabs negotiate tricky driving conditions in central London - will also be big cash generators. The City has yet to be convinced. </p> <p>As Alistair Scott, head of Asian Telecoms Research at Merrill Lynch, wrote in Asiacom , a business newsletter: 'There is a huge leap of faith needed by the financial community that the operators will sort this out.' He points out that in Asia, operators cashflows simply cannot finance Wap, GPRS and 3G. </p> <p>The problem is not confined to Asia, however. Few, if any, operators really, know what is going to happen. Telecom Italia Mobile, for instance, recently shut down its strategic planning department because it couldn't see even six months into the future. </p> <p>Removing the uncertainty surrounding the different wireless technologies will be crucial for the mobile networks. For example, nearly a third of the value of NTT DoCoMo, Japan's giant mobile phone company, is based on the potential of its data services. </p> <p>But jumping on the technology bandwagon carries its own risks. BT Cellnet, has made much of the fact that it is the first UK operator to roll out GPRS services in the UK. But, to cut a long and complex story short, the handsets it is using work to a different GPRS standard from the version agreed by the industry, which limits their ability to use upgraded software packages in the future. </p> <p>The operators themselves do admit that things could be better handled. One2One has spent huge amounts of time and money gearing up for GPRS, which it believes will be far more important than the introduction of Wap because it will allow the delivery of huge amounts of data and video services at speeds far faster than those on offer through today's conventional modems. </p> <p>While Wap allows for the simplification of web pages so that they are easy to view on mobile phone screens, GPRS adds a completely new dynamic. The systems would work well together, but the industry has ended up launching two different sets of handsets at different times. </p> <p>Craig Tillotson, One 2 One's strategic development director, says: 'The timing was unfortunate. The Wap browser model was ready before GPRS. In a perfect world everything would be ready at the same time.' </p> <p>Given this uncertainty, questions must now be asked about who will pay for the new generations of handsets. Currently mobile phones are heavily subsidised by the operators because they 'locks' users into their networks for a year or two. But given the huge costs facing the networks, consumers will probably end up being asked to pay hundreds (instead of tens) of pounds for their phones. Nokia doesn't rule this scenario out. Pukkila said: 'It [the subsidisation of handsets] will not necessarily continue. It remains to be seen. It's very much up to the operators to decide.' </p> <p>Some back-of-the-envelope calculations by Laurent-Pierre Baculard, a principal with management consultancy AT Kearney, suggest that if a 3G licence costs \u00a35bn, an operator will probably need another \u00a33bn to develop the network and a further \u00a31bn to subsidise the costs of the new handsets. </p> <p>And this is for 3G, which won't be available for another three years at least. Imagine how many more billions of pounds have to be factored in for the roll-out of Wap and GPRS until then. </p> <p>Such financial fears plays into the hands of big operators such as Orange and Vodafone. 'They will have a different scale of purchase with the manufacturers. They will enjoy economies of scale by buying en masse from the manufacturers,' Baculard says. </p> <p>These fears also mean that the operators will look to secure exclusive deals with content and service providers. This will see certain sites heavily promoted and easily accessible through particular mobile phone networks because the operators are receiving a kickback on any e-commerce transactions. </p> <p>It all boils down to one question, according to Kee-hian Tan, vice-president of e-commerce with AT Kearney. 'One of the big uncertainties is how much people will use these new services. How much content will people pay for? If we can expect a shift to higher usage, with people spending more on access, it's possible to say handsets will be subsidised.' Big if. </p> <p><strong>Acronym buster</strong></p> <p><strong> Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)</strong> </p> <p>WAP phones are now available in the mass market (Nokia's 7110 phone and Ericsson's R320 handset).

Secret police and gendarmes patrolling concurrent World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development conferences in Paris were not as troubled as their counterparts in Seattle and Washington had been. </p> <p>A handful of noisy anti-globalisation protesters outside the OECD's forum were placated by the words of a conference delegate from Friends of the Earth, which was consulted alongside other non-governmental organisations on new guidelines for multinationals. The final communiqu\u00e9 from Ministers of the 'rich man's club' was peppered with references to social inclusion, poverty reduction and sustainable development. </p> <p>Across the city in Bercy, Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister, and James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, argued for a more comprehensive approach to development that would encompass human rights, access to healthcare and education. </p> <p>'[We should] think about development in the broadest possible sense, the one described by Amartya Sen, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, in one of his books, Development as Freedom ,' said the French prime minister. </p> <p>Wolfensohn added: 'People are the ends of development. Were they measuring their lives in terms of GDP per capita?' </p> <p>With one eye on last December's shenanigans in Seattle, the agents and proponents of this globalisation, are falling over themselves to present the softer side of economic liberalisation. They are putting into practice a lesson learnt from the IMF and World Bank handbook - that it is difficult to push through adjustment policies without the support of the local population. </p> <p>Some of the global doubters will be reassured by talk of rethinking development policy, and a shift away from the Washington consensus - the IMF and World Bank-led focus on liberalisation, privatisation and trade specialisation. Concerns about Third World debt lay at the heart of the anti-globalisation protests. </p> <p>The new approach is rooted in development concepts that go beyond the traditional debate on growth and equity. Economic development becomes more than growth in per capita income and is seen, instead, as the aggregate of human development. The talk is of 'pro-poor' growth, analysing macroeconomic statistics in conjunction with life expectancy, access to primary education, and healthcare. Policies that focus on these indicators are considered important as an end to the development process as well as a means of stimulating growth. </p> <p>This subtle change of tack is being dubbed the 'Third Way for the Third World': a global free market system that is morally anchored by a watered-down version of equality of opportunity. Inequalities can be stomached so long as citizens and countries are provided with the capabilities - education, and healthcare - that allow them to compete in the market. The role of the state is essentially one that facilitates provision of these capabilities and of institutions that protect the working of the free market. </p> <p>'Third Way for the Third World' does no justice to the approach. The study of the role of institutions and human indicators in development preceded New Labour by decades. Now, world leaders such as Jospin are showing a willingness to talk about it seriously. Indeed, Jospin talked about the need for a European approach to development which could be established if the EU took a unified approach - it accounts for a third of voting rights at the World Bank. </p> <p>The relevance of new approaches to development stretches beyond the Third World. Globalisation means that the world can gainfully be considered one giant developing country. There are pockets of underdevelopment in industrialised nations. Likewise, there are islands of Silicon Valley-style dotcom wealth in the poorest countries - Bangalore, for example. </p> <p>So a changing conception of development economics has global repercussions. </p> <p>'It's not just the economics of development; it's the economics of the world,' said Wolfensohn at the World Bank conference. </p> <p>Extrapolating elements of development theory to world level informs the need for institutions to facilitate and manage the workings of a global market. Robert Mundell, last year's Nobel prizewinner in economics, advocated a global currency. The Paris gatherings to talk about sustainable development were also about setting down the ground rules for globalisation. </p> <p>Jospin called for the creation of a World Environment Organisation to manage protection of global public goods. </p> <p>Four multilateral institutions: the World Bank, IMF, OECD and UN launched A Better World for All - a joint response to the challenges of social development - at the Geneva Social Summit last week. The release was rounded upon by NGOs for hijacking the agenda. </p> <p>The NGOs criticised the document for putting all the onus for poverty alleviation on changes in developing countries, rather than on reform of the international financial system or of the structural adjustment policies agreed as a condition of lending programmes. </p> <p>Indeed, talk of broader concepts of development has not filtered into policy changes. The French government may wish to lead a European approach to development, but its policy negotiators are keen to scupper agreements to untie aid. Structural adjustment policies have been scrapped; in their place are Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which have yet to yield substantially different policies. </p> <p>They are based on applying the high principles and 'tough medicine' of neoclassical economics. NGOs and developing countries have noted that their record is mixed at best, and that industrialised nations are rather worse at applying free trade principles to themselves. </p> <p>Last week the World Bank came under fire from pro-Tibetan groups for failing to publish a critical report on a controversial project, backed by a World Bank loan, that involves resettling 57,750 Chinese farmers on Tibetan land. </p> <p>The World Bank has suffered splits on these issues. Ravi Kanbur, an eminent economist who wrote this year's draft World Development Report , last month resigned over differences with World Bank economists. Last year, the bank's former chief economist, Joseph Stiglitz, resigned, reportedly following US pressure. </p> <p>Stiglitz was outspoken in his attacks on the Washington consensus. After stressing the importance of openness, accountability and democracy, he said, the international financial orthodoxy then strips away decision-making: 'It's nice to have votes, developing countries are told, but don't get involved in anything that affects your life. It's a very mixed message.' </p> <p>Stiglitz pointed to India as a country that can work perfectly well without an independent central bank. </p> <p>He cited the move in 1997 to make capital market liberalisation a central policy aim of the IMF as showing that 'ideology' was driving policy. There is no definitive evidence of its effect on growth. </p> <p>A new weapon in the NGO arsenal is to take on the international institutions using their own terms. The most effective way to combat poverty in the developing world is to focus on agricultural incomes. Genuine free trade would open up the protected markets of industrialised nations. Similarly, the success of the new economy informs the need for investment in education. </p> <p>Such policies of investment in human capital illustrate that comparative advantage is a dynamic process. Protection was afforded to today's industrialised nations during the development of their industries, yet free trade is a cornerstone of policy foisted upon the least developed countries. </p> <p>Similarly, debt is portrayed as a tax on national income that diminishes incentives to produce. Suggestions were made that the IMF and World Bank apply market principles to its policy advice by taking an equity stake in countries carrying out the policies. The institution's advisers could also be paid in relation to achievement of human development objectives. </p> <p>NGOs argue the Washington consensus was structured not as a means of development, but to open up markets for multinationals and to entrench power structures. </p> <p>Such suspicions will persist until the international financial institutions take a leaf out of their own manual for development and become more transparent, accountable and democratic. Moves in that direction are afoot, but the proof of any change will be in the policies espoused in the PRSPs.

      "body": "<p><strong> Stand-Up With Alan Davies </strong> BBC1 <br> <strong> A Many Splintered Thing</strong> BBC 1 <br> <strong> Wimbledon</strong> BBC1 and 2 <br> <strong> Glastonbury</strong> BBC1 </p> <p>During the programme Stand-Up With Alan Davies, a rather earnest, intense, off-duty and therefore not awfully funny Davies told it like it apparently is. 'My likeability gets remarked upon,' he sighed, in that slightly campy, nasal, Essex twang, ' but that's just the way I am.' He could probably have substituted 'hair' for 'likeability' but it still seemed a little odd to remark upon one's marketable asset with such cool detachment, not to mention a complete lack of irony. </p> <p> This was Davies as a model or a racehorse - nice mane, strong fetlocks, lovely likeabilities. He started as a stand-up and morphed into an actor. Rather, I'd always thought he started as a stand-up, but it turns out he was really a luvvie all along. In Stand Up With _ he revealed that he'd applied to do drama at Warwick and was put off by an audition in which he had to pretend to walk through a blizzard, which he did in a very Alan Davies sort of way - scrunched-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo and a shrug. </p> <p> None the less, as an actor Davies has done very well for someone who only seems to have on offer a few, subtly varying shades of Alan Davies, plus John McEnroe's hair, circa 1980. Indeed, he's done even better at being Alan Davies than Frank Skinner has at being Frank Skinner. There's the bemused Jonathan Creek, the bemused bloke in the building society ads, the perpetually bemused guest on various completely bemusing panel games, the wryly bemused stand-up interviewing his peers and, this week, the definitively bemused and irritatingly spelt, Russel - befuddled fulcrum of a lust triangle - in A Many Splintered Thing . </p> <p> I bet Davies sometimes wakes up in the night sweating and waiting for the knock on the door: 'That's enough now, Mr Davies. Likeability and unlikely hair are, unfortunately, no longer quite enough to sustain your career and anyway, we're currently looking for somebody essentially likeable who also hints at psychosis, kind of a new Keith Allen but maybe with a ponytail. So, if you don't mind coming with me...' </p> <p> A Many Splintered Thing is a comedy about adultery, which is probably what passes for a hip, modern romance at BBC Towers. Still, at least modern romance is a subject that writer/producer Geoff Deane knows a bit about - he's the one who wrote and sang the hits for the unforgettable 1980s band of the same name. Geoffrey is a real old new romantic, then, and you could spot some of his legendary charm in, for example, A Many Splintered Thing 's pay off-line: drunk man shouts: 'I may be married but at least I've got a cock!' through his lesbian mistress's letterbox before falling over in the gutter and being urinated on by a small passing dog. </p> <p> No? Still not entirely convinced by the scene's edgily contemporary likeability? Well, admittedly it's not quite Cary Grant and Ros Russell, but this is presumably why Deane was smart enough to employ Mr Alan Congeniality-Davies to imbue the scene with instant likeability. But aside from being stylistically derivative (fantasy scenes, internal voiceovers, Frasier-style captions); despite, too, the premise of the cheekily-loveable yet under-achieving adulterer married, predictably, to a be-bobbed, power-dressed, she-bitch-in-heels but sleeping with a younger, blonder dippy-chick; and despite the fact that some of Deane's lines rely too heavily on Davies and the excellent Josie Lawrence. </p> <p> If you enjoy oral sex after your watershed, A Many Splintered Thing is an (in)decently likeable adult comedy. Though none of Deane's oral sex is quite as funny as Davies's own failsafe recipe for the 'Blow-Job Slammer', shared with us during Stand Up With _ : Salt and lemon and _ well, I guess you have to tell it likeably , which is beyond me. Though I console myself by having much better hair than Davies - even since he chopped off his curls. </p> <p> Twenty years ago, John McEnroe owned the prototype for Alan Davies's hair. And, if he didn't have Alan's marketable likeability, he had genius instead. Interestingly, he has now lost the hair, acquired likeability in spades and channelled his genius into new arenas. Since retiring from playing competitively, McEnroe has usually covered Wimbledon for, I think, NBC, so invariably each summer we'd be shown shots of a distant, suited-and-booted Mac in headphones, while David Mercer or Bill Threlfall said something like: 'And there's John McEnroe, of course - arguably one of the greatest grass-court players of the modern era, blah, blah...' </p> <p> And I would stamp my little foot and shout: 'Not \"arguably\" anything!' Because McEnroe is one of only two stars I have blindly and devotedly hero-worshipped in a slobberingly uncool and fanlike way. Well, to be honest, there were three, if you include Red Rum. </p> <p> But now, finally, McEnroe has been hired by the BBC to commentate on key men's matches and, from last Monday, it was immediately obvious that he was going to affect the coverage in the much the same way he affected the game - by being brilliant and irreverent, informed, intelligent, exasperated, inspired, anxious and always keeping his solid, reliable BBC commentary doubles partners on their metaphorical toes. </p> <p> It is obvious, too, that whatever the Mercers and Threlfalls may have felt about him in the past, they all now adore him. As Holland were losing to Italy on Thursday night, Agassi tussled with Todd Martin, and Bill Threlfall admitted that he really doesn't approve of Mexican waves. McEnroe ribbed him: 'Come on, Bill, don't be old fashioned!' and Bill was forced to admit: 'I'm an old fashioned guy.' Not exactly a shock revelation, but still a whole lot more than we've learned about Mr Threlfall in the last 100 years of his commentating career. </p> <p> Oh, it was sweet! Like little green and purple flowers blooming in the light, everybody wanted to open up to McEnroe, so each time he served up tidbits of important historical information (for example, the first time he played on Centre Court was as a qualifier against Jimmy Connors, who refused to acknowledge him in the locker room), or lobbed us practical tactical tips (if your opponent makes you feel nervous, try some topspin, because it's much tougher to hit flat balls consistently), you got Mercer reminiscing about umpiring the 1984 Connors-McEnroe final: 'The one mistake I made was that I said it was the third set when it was the second!' 'I find it hard to believe that was the only mistake, but we'll leave it at that,' said McEnroe - and I swear you could hear Mercer purr. </p> <p> The BBC failing to secure \u00a340 million worth of football highlights suits me fine - especially if it means there's enough in the kitty to keep McEnroe on the payroll. He's loving it, too, of course. 'I know I've arrived!' he said on Monday. 'First at the BBC, then at Buckingham Palace!' (he plays a charity exhibition there with Bj\u00f6rn Borg today). Endearing? Likeable? During Henman v Clement on Thursday, I think Mercer might well have hugged him after the following exchange: </p> <p> <strong> Mac: </strong> 'Talking of tragedy, what was it with Great Britain's performance in the European Championships?' <br> <strong> Mer:</strong> 'Ah well, I speak as a Welshman, John, that was England . Not a great performance, was it!' (Lengthy silence while this geographical revelation sank in.) <br> <strong> Mac:</strong> 'Great Britain! That includes Scotland and Wales..?' <br> <strong> Mer:</strong> 'Yes, and Northern Ireland.' <br> <strong> Mac:</strong> 'Maybe that's the answer. You all band together!' <br> <strong> Mer: </strong> 'Lot of politics...' <br> <strong> Mac:</strong> 'Welcome to sports!' </p> <p> Lot of politics, too, in the week's other great live televisual meeting of minds. Having spent the previous week in a health farm with Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey, I was already feeling slightly disorientated on Sunday night, when I settled down to watch David Bowie (my other hero, right there beside McEnroe) and was confronted by Glastonbury 's answer to McEnroe and Threlfall, aka Billy Bragg and Boris Johnson - the latter pronouncing Glastonbury 'Glarse-tunbry', Bragg as 'Braaarg', singing the Clash's 'Bank Robber' and getting a henna tattoo. </p> <p> This was hallucinatorily fabulous TV, and Bragg and Johnson should be given a Baddiel and Skinner-style show immediately. Indeed, it completely overshadowed the main event in which Bowie unfortunately decided to do a cocktail bossa nova version of my favourite song but, despite this, it was still a pretty good week for heroes. Indeed, all it lacked was a very soppy documentary about Red Rum.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stand-Up With Alan Davies BBC1 A Many Splintered Thing BBC 1 Wimbledon BBC1 and 2 Glastonbury BBC1 During the programme Stand-Up With Alan Davies, a rather earnest, intense, off-duty and therefore not awfully funny Davies told it like it apparently is. 'My likeability gets remarked upon,' he sighed, in that slightly campy, nasal, Essex twang, ' but that's just the way I am.' He could probably have substituted 'hair' for 'likeability' but it still seemed a little odd to remark upon one's marketable asset with such cool detachment, not to mention a complete lack of irony. This was Davies as a model or a racehorse - nice mane, strong fetlocks, lovely likeabilities. He started as a stand-up and morphed into an actor. Rather, I'd always thought he started as a stand-up, but it turns out he was really a luvvie all along. In Stand Up With _ he revealed that he'd applied to do drama at Warwick and was put off by an audition in which he had to pretend to walk through a blizzard, which he did in a very Alan Davies sort of way - scrunched-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo and a shrug.

He takes the leading roles of Dido and the Sorceress; his Aeneas is grizzled Guillermo Resto, who has danced with Morris for 17 years.

After his stint at successive Edinburgh Festivals, he has struck up a special relationship in London with the English National Opera, whose musicians are prepared to be sidelined while dancers take pride of place. The singers are stacked in boxes on either side of the stage, a stereophonic choir of angels. </p> <p>Some are saints in a new Morris/ENO production of Virgil Thomson's Four Saints in Three Acts (1934), given its world premiere last Wednesday. It is a shorter version of the original 90-minute operatic spectacle, with a libretto by Gertrude Stein and choreography by Frederick Ashton.

They look more Mexican than Spanish, in earth-coloured costumes by Elizabeth Kurtzmann. Hot red and ochre backdrops suggest a tropical semi-paradise where saints bloom like lilies. </p> <p>Gertrude Stein proposed a pantheon of saints, including two Teresas. Morris limits himself to one Teresa and an Ignatius - Michelle Yard and John Heginbotham, young, rapt, uncontaminated by experience. They have a direct line to heaven, accessed via a garden swing. Heginbotham is a Holy Fool, leading his followers in a blissful round of 'pass the pigeon on the grass, alas, and the magpie in the sky' (carolled by baritone Gavin Carr). Yard's vocation we have to take on trust, waiting for her to reveal the god-given attributes that will take her to a place of grace. </p> <p>Morris has not yet passed on to these youngsters how to carry a leading role. There are no supporting saints to help them out and the ensemble sags in between bouts of dancing. Watching the singers can be more rewarding, as they chant antiphonal stage instructions from their blue and gold eyries. A plainer setting might actually help unify the production, putting all the performers on an egalitarian footing. </p> <p>Full-blown divadom flourishes in the North African climate of Dido. Morris hefts his huge arms to the skies like Isadora at her ripest, then gets down and dirty as the smirking Sorceress. Sarah Connolly voices her/his dual personality, welcoming death as Aeneas departs. </p> <p>Resto's presence is so powerful that the stage is bereft without him. For the first time, I found the dancing chorus intrusive; an unaware innocence has been lost in this revival. Even Morris seems too knowing. </p> <p>The Royal Opera House has become an altogether jollier place, with 146 children attending last Monday's matin\u00e9e by the Kirov Ballet, while Royal Ballet fans mingled with newcomers below stairs in the 400-seater studio theatre. The Royal Ballet has still to discover how to programme its playpen. Should it offer friendly access to ballet for those hesitant about paying upstairs prices or new works that challenge? Its first programme was a messy compromise, re-deemed by Michael Corder's Masquerade . Neither new nor daring, it showcased first-rate dancers in a cornucopia of steps. Rather too many, but we needed diverting. </p> <p>The second programme was more satisfying, mixing beginner choreographers with experienced ones. Both Poppy Ben David, still at the Royal Ballet School, and Vanessa Fenton, a new member of the company, showed considerable promise. Fenton's trio featured Alina Cojocaru, a meteor about to burst through the company's ranks; Ben David's Siren Song (to seductive music by 13-year-old Benjamin Marquise Gilmore from the Yehudi Menuhin School) was fresh and witty. </p> <p>Then came two older, garrulous choreographers, Jacopo Godani and William Tuckett, splicing up the vocabularies of contemporary and classical dance. Tuckett's Death and the Maiden trio climaxed in a wild, whirling lift for Zenaida Yanowsky, manhandled by Jonathan Cope. Its extravagance was typical of the piece, which calmed unexpectedly in a coda in which the dancers at last acknowledged the musicians. No such luck in Godoni's Aeon's Run, to a computerised score by Diego Dall'Osto, which went on for aeons. </p> <p>Godoni's costive combinations further bunched the muscles of its cast of eight. The intimacy of the studio theatre exposes just how many Royal Ballet dancers have bulges where the Kirov's don't. The cause is not just modern choreography - there is something wrong with the company's daily training, for incomers, even those as sleek as Cojocaru, start developing bulk they do not need. </p> <p>Leaving the best till last, Christopher Wheeldon scored a hit with a suite, There Where She Loves, to songs by Chopin and Kurt Weill.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Sun is God: J.M.W. Turner</strong>, Tate Liverpool to 1 October </p> <p><strong> Douglas Gordon</strong>, Tate Liverpool to 1 October </p> <p>People were easily shocked by Turner. Short, stubby, bow-legged and unkempt, he looked, they said, like a coachman or a tenant farmer. Constable called him uncouth. Delacroix was appalled by his clumpy footwear. Turner owned a pub in Wapping, drank with stevedores and, even when he was supremely famous, could be spotted scoffing shrimps with the daytrippers on the Margate steamer. When he died, fellow Academicians were horrified to learn that he had a secret life with an illiterate woman in Chelsea, where his nickname on the streets was Admiral Puggy Booth - after his supposed profession. </p> <p>As in life, so in art: some people thought Turner's later work didn't look remotely like painting. 'Tinted steam,' sneered Constable; others suggested soapsuds, custard or whitewash. 'Pictures of nothing, and very like' was Hazlitt's famous barb; which, turned on its head by modern critics, makes Turner a pioneer of abstract art. To his contemporaries, these veils and vortices of light were the empty ramblings of Admiral Booth; to the twentieth century, they made him Turner Our Contemporary. Not the least achievement of this tremendous show is to reveal his light, as it were, in both lights: to present him as simultaneously ancient and modern. </p> <p>The method is simple. Fifty paintings from the last decade of Turner's life have been removed from their frames and hung, somewhat lower than usual, in entirely natural light. You see them as they might have been seen in the 1840s, specifically in Turner's own studio. Yet you also see them as startlingly live and direct, liberated from the antique frames, security glass and Soane-pink walls that force them back in time at the Clore Gallery in London. The contrast is there in every work: intensely vital images, still quick with the maker's mark, painted on the frail and aged canvas now exposed round the edge of each stretcher. </p> <p>The absence of artificial lighting has a radical effect on these pictures. Some look dramatically darker. The Angel Standing in the Sun is no longer so radiantly blond: the sun burns with the dark ferocity you might expect in a vision of the apocalypse. Others appear magically brighter: Turner's translucent dawn over Lake Lucerne seems to rival the gallery's own sunlight. As that light changes throughout the day, its passage is reflected in the paintings: a sea that looks as still as a field of mown hay begins to ruffle and shiver, icy skies thaw and glow, dying rays come up like wild fire. This isn't just some trick of the light, it is inherent in Turner's painting: all those millions of coloured touches add up to an ever-changing play of light - generally frozen in the steady glare of electric bulbs. </p> <p>In these conditions, you literally see more of Turner. He has been described as an action painter; like Jackson Pollock in Hans Namuth's film, Turner made a spectacle of himself in the act of painting. He would arrive at the Royal Academy with the bare rudiments of a picture, then work it up in a storm of brushwork. The effect was so rapid that his enemies thought Turner must be excavating some buried image from the canvas. Up close and personal at the Tate, you can discern his movements everywhere - the spatters of wet oil, clinging like droplets to an earlier crust of pigment, the quick sweeps that barely graze the canvas, the deep score of his thumbnail furrowing through the paint. </p> <p>This doesn't tell you how he did it - especially in those late watercolours that materialise in waves of tinted light - but it does give a sense of Turner's fearless innovation. The surface of 'Disaster at Sea' is a mayhem of paint: glutinous as bubble gum, stiff as lunar rock, molten as the wax Turner was mixing with his oils. The black clouds are literally bursting with claggy matter, showered on the shipwrecked figures below who are, by contrast, as cursory and trivial as the putty on a stately home ceiling. Forget the fatality, it is the elemental upheaval that obsesses Turner - and, of course, the hint of sun that makes the darkness visible. </p> <p>Turner is routinely pegged as a sun-worshipper, lying on his back as a boy in Covent Garden to experience the widest angle of rays, traipsing all over Europe to observe the solar effect on foreign landscapes. As its title indicates, the sun is the central fact of every picture in this show. But seen together - they've never been shown as a concerted group before - these paintings amount to a far more complex affair with sunlight. </p> <p>In late Turner, the sun transforms matter into energy, turning the substantial world into a mirage. All the local details listed in his titles simply vanish into the ether: there are no dolphins, blazing wrecks or distant coastlines. In Hurrah! For the Whaler Erebus! Another Fish! , the ship and its catch are dissolving in a flood of irradiated light. The Two Figures on a Beach from 1845 are just ghostly afterthoughts in a radical sunscape. In the end, the only reality in Turner's art is the constant phenomenon of the sun. </p> <p>Some people regard these pictures as oblique self-portraits; instead, Turner seems to be escaping from himself, from all those heroes and ships and classical allegories that infest his official works. The more he stares at the sun, the more unconstrained his painting, as if he wanted to breach the picture frame altogether and let in a world of light. It's probably best to see this show on a clear day, when the sun returns the favour and you don't have to squint to see every trace of Turner's genius. Otherwise, Tate Liverpool has shown him to perfection. Never quite abstract - there is always some faint horizon that returns them to earth - these last images are closer to the sublime than anything in English painting. </p> <p>'The Sun is God' is the inspiration of Mark Francis, late of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Sad to say, he is also responsible for inviting the Turner Prize winner Douglas Gordon to produce a parallel show. Gordon has installed a sunny yellow lightbox in a maze and painted some nerdish wordplay on the title of Turner's show round the doorway between the two exhibitions. Thankfully, that's as far as he goes. </p> <p>Gordon is also showing Hitchcock's Dead on Arrival on a triptych of screens at three fractionally different speeds. Once your eyes adjust to this mild d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu , there is the pleasure of watching the movie and listening to the wonderful soup of soundtracks. There are further word associations, a morbid peepshow that blinks on and off, and one of Gordon's own films in which a hand repeatedly slaps the camera so that it, too, seems to blink on and off. Metaphysics is generally held to be Gordon's fort\u00e9, but there's no evidence of subtle thought in this show. Without the powerful prop of Hitchcock, Douglas Gordon falls flat.</p>",

Some people regard these pictures as oblique self-portraits; instead, Turner seems to be escaping from himself, from all those heroes and ships and classical allegories that infest his official works. The more he stares at the sun, the more unconstrained his painting, as if he wanted to breach the picture frame altogether and let in a world of light. It's probably best to see this show on a clear day, when the sun returns the favour and you don't have to squint to see every trace of Turner's genius. Otherwise, Tate Liverpool has shown him to perfection. Never quite abstract - there is always some faint horizon that returns them to earth - these last images are closer to the sublime than anything in English painting. 'The Sun is God' is the inspiration of Mark Francis, late of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Sad to say, he is also responsible for inviting the Turner Prize winner Douglas Gordon to produce a parallel show. Gordon has installed a sunny yellow lightbox in a maze and painted some nerdish wordplay on the title of Turner's show round the doorway between the two exhibitions. Thankfully, that's as far as he goes. Gordon is also showing Hitchcock's Dead on Arrival on a triptych of screens at three fractionally different speeds. Once your eyes adjust to this mild d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu , there is the pleasure of watching the movie and listening to the wonderful soup of soundtracks. There are further word associations, a morbid peepshow that blinks on and off, and one of Gordon's own films in which a hand repeatedly slaps the camera so that it, too, seems to blink on and off. Metaphysics is generally held to be Gordon's fort\u00e9, but there's no evidence of subtle thought in this show. Without the powerful prop of Hitchcock, Douglas Gordon falls flat.",

      "body": "<p>'Welcome to the schizophrenic world of Hank III,' says Shelton Hank Williams by way of introducing the second part of his stage act. He's spent the previous 90 minutes playing a beautifully judged country set, his astringent but melodic voice delivering a mixture of old favourites such as Johnny Cash's 'Cocaine Blues', new songs by himself and others, blues, rockabilly, and a clutch of tear-jerkers by his famous grandfather, Hank Williams. </p> <p>He's warned us what's coming, but it's still a shock when Williams sets aside his battered straw stetson and he and a band featuring fiddle and stand-up bass blast into a set of full-on thrash metal delivered at ear-damaging volume, with the lazy southern twang of his vocals replaced by a manic jabber. It is, he tells me later, his way of 'letting people know who I am, and the kind of music I was raised on - Black Sabbath and Nirvana. And this way, no one can say I'm cashing in, because no matter how good a country artist I might one day become, people will always say I'm riding on other people's coat-tails.' </p> <p>The coat-tails in question are the most famous in country music. Almost half a century after his death at the age of 29, Hank Williams remains the undisputed king of country, a Fifties legend as tragic and potent as Monroe or Dean, with a life and songbook steeped in betrayal, booze and Bible-belt religion. Williams's melancholy canon, packed with standards such as 'Your Cheating Heart' and 'Lovesick Blues', is much covered even now. </p> <p>For the divorced wife and three-year-old son he left behind, Williams's legacy proved something of a poisoned chalice. Hank Jr, cynically groomed by his mother, Audrey, to impersonate his famous father, eventually rebelled, and became reborn as one of Seventies Nashville's hell-raising 'outlaws' alongside Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson. He survived a barbiturate overdose, a near-fatal mountaineering accident and a severe cocaine addiction before securing his own entry into the country hall of fame. </p> <p>The family baggage carried by Hank III is, you sense, somewhat weightier than that borne by rock sprogs like Rolan Bolan, Zak Starr or Simon Collins. Sporting a Sid'n'Nancy T-shirt beneath his battered rodeo shirt, a pair of worn-out cowboy boots held together by duck tape, and a colourful set of tattoos, his lanky frame and gaunt good looks eerily recall those of his grandpop - hell, he even has Hank the first's fluting vocals and steer-calling yodel down pat. Small wonder that a portion of his audience consists of 'a lot of older people who come just to hear me sing those three Hank Williams songs'. </p> <p>Shelton's parents divorced when he was three, and prickly relations with his father (whom he didn't see again until he was eight), helped direct his musical interests towards punk and metal. Then, three years ago, while playing drums with a Nashville punk band, he was served a paternity suit on stage, the result of 'a one-night stand who had waited three years to tell me I had a kid'. That his passing fling was the daughter of a policeman didn't help; Hank III was landed with a $28,000 back bill and ongoing payments of $600 a month. </p> <p>Instructed by the judge to find a job paying more than the $50 a gig he was earning, the 24-year-old Shelton decided to cash in on the family name. 'I went knocking on managers' doors saying, \"I'm Hank Williams the Third, are you interested in getting behind me?\"' The result was a ghoulish album, Three Hanks: Men With Broken Hearts , on which he and his father sang along with the disembodied voice of Hank the first, a project he now disowns. </p> <p>Then something odd happened - Shelton Hank Williams discovered country music afresh. He'd grown up with albums by George Jones and Merle Haggard lying around the house, now he tapped into young songwriters like Wayne Hancock (with whom is now friends) and Dale Watson; men steeped in the gritty, emotional lineage of his granddad rather than the slick, pop-country sound of modern Nashville, which Shelton had intended to exploit. </p> <p>Shelton's recently released debut, Risin' Outlaw , allies him firmly with Hancock, Watson and others for whom the spiritual home of modern country is not Nashville but Austin, Texas. It's a likeable but patchily impressive debut, featuring only three Williams originals, for which he blames his record company. He has, he says, pitched them a score of songs which they turned down as being 'too country' and therefore unlikely to score the all-important radio exposure. </p> <p>When Hank Williams's grandson is rebuffed for being 'too country', something is surely amiss in the state of Tennessee, and Shelton is scathing about a Nashville establishment apparently interested only in hunks in hats and babes in boots who can deliver mainstream success. 'Nashville has become stale and formulaic,' he says. 'The musicians got outsmarted by the lawyers and businessmen. Every year they throw 40 acts against the wall and see which ones stick. In fact, it's become a sports town more than a music town -they'd rather have football stars on the Grand Ole Opry than singers.' As an example, he points to Chad Brock, an ex-wrestler who currently occupies the number one spot with a cutesy piece of fluff called 'Yes', about which Shelton is vitriolic. </p> <p>The shift in attitude from cash-in cowboy to authentic artist helps explain why Shelton has taken up the 'outlaw' tag, though he's keen to distance himself from his father's generation. 'In the Seventies outlaws meant hanging out with Hell's Angels and shooting up dope. For me and Wayne [Hancock] and for unsigned Nashville bands like Greg Garing and the Hot Town Tigers, it's a musical definition, about making music for ourselves and our fans. We don't care about becoming Entertainer of the Year.' </p> <p>His outspokenness, and a freely admitted taste for booze and pot, haven't helped his standing with a Nashville ruling caste still steeped in the puritan values of the 1940s, and which like to promote its wares as a wholesome alternative to the evils of rock and rap. 'They have this thing called media school to help you evade difficult questions, which I have turned down six times. I'm here to speak what I feel, not to be a puppet for a record company.' </p> <p>Shelton's relations with his record company, Curb - run by a former Republican governor of California, Mike Curb - reached a bizarre nadir when it joined forces with his parents, manager and ex-girlfriend to persuade their wayward charge to enter rehab to wean him off liquor and weed. After a break-up with his girlfriend, Hank Three was showing signs of emulating the self-destructive habits of Hanks One and Two. 'They were concerned about my emotional health - I was heartbroken and depressed,' he admits, though the suggestion that his father helped him enter rehab brings a pained expression. 'That was a scam,' he says. 'He's never around, then when everything is going to shit, here's Hank Junior to the rescue! </p> <p>'What happened was that Hank Junior and Waylon [Jennings] came in and said, \"We just don't want you to get as crazy as we did\". I said, well, I'm not snorting pounds of coke like you guys did, I'm just smoking pot and drinking alcohol - big fuckin' deal. On the day I went in I told my girlfriend I'd do it to win her back. I wrote her 20 letters, never got one in return, realised it was all a game and walked out.' </p> <p>Since then, says Hank III, he's calmed down. He has his career plan in place, with a new country album due to be recorded this summer back to back with a thrash metal album titled This Ain't Country . His future, though, is in the music of his grandfather. 'Pop country will eventually choke itself to death, then the old stuff will come back,' he predicts.

      "body": "<b> Genoveva/Il Mondo della Luna </b> Garsington, Oxfordshire <p><b> Ion</b> Almeida, London N1 </p> <p>The three-arched Italianate loggia and statuary, usually so handsome a backdrop to the stone terrace of Garsington's stage, had been wrapped and hidden in yards of stressed, bloodied tarpaulin - a brutish echo of Christo's shrouded Reich stag and a shock, no doubt, to the ghost of Ottoline Morrell, whose Bloomsbury spirit still pervades the captivating house and garden which once were hers. This bracing, abstract evocation of eighth-century Brabant provided the setting for Schumann's only opera, Genoveva, a rousing psycho- drama of German romanticism which explores love, lust and guilt in the Dark Ages. Apparently last staged in this country by students in 1893, this operatic ugly duckling has had to wait for the enterprise of one inquisitive opera lover, Leonard Ingrams, for a modern, professional production. </p> <p>Of course it helps to have an opera festival in your own garden, but one of the more serious pleasures of Garsington has always been the rehabilitation of spurned, ditched or disowned repertoire. This involves risk.

      "bodyText": "Genoveva/Il Mondo della Luna Garsington, Oxfordshire Ion Almeida, London N1 The three-arched Italianate loggia and statuary, usually so handsome a backdrop to the stone terrace of Garsington's stage, had been wrapped and hidden in yards of stressed, bloodied tarpaulin - a brutish echo of Christo's shrouded Reich stag and a shock, no doubt, to the ghost of Ottoline Morrell, whose Bloomsbury spirit still pervades the captivating house and garden which once were hers. This bracing, abstract evocation of eighth-century Brabant provided the setting for Schumann's only opera, Genoveva, a rousing psycho- drama of German romanticism which explores love, lust and guilt in the Dark Ages. Apparently last staged in this country by students in 1893, this operatic ugly duckling has had to wait for the enterprise of one inquisitive opera lover, Leonard Ingrams, for a modern, professional production. Of course it helps to have an opera festival in your own garden, but one of the more serious pleasures of Garsington has always been the rehabilitation of spurned, ditched or disowned repertoire. This involves risk. Without doubt, many members of his deluxe audience would prefer a popular warhorse to an arcane oddity; the man in front who spent much of the first half studying the palm of his hand until his wife nudged him was certainly one.

It's five years since her first play, Blasted , was given a widespread critical lashing, and turned into a box-office success. Headlined by the Daily Mail as a 'Disgusting Feast of Filth', the play has since been produced in Austria, France, Italy, Serbia and Australia. When Kane died, a minute's silence was observed on German radio. </p> <p>In Blasted eyeballs were eaten; in Cleansed tongues and limbs were freely lopped off. Kane didn't, she said, see the point of the off-stage violence of Greek drama: 'Why pay \u00a310 to not see it? Why not stay at home?' The gory explicitness which helped to make her drama notorious is entirely lacking from her posthumous play now premiered at the Royal Court Upstairs. But 4.48 Psychosis is no less disturbing for that. </p> <p>This is Kane's most nakedly autobiographical work: it's a study of the clinical depression from which she suffered, and it's a declaration of suicide - '4.48' is the time chosen by a character to kill herself. It is dazzlingly well staged by Kane's long-time director James Macdonald and the designer Jeremy Herbert; it is tightly, raptly acted by Daniel Evans, Jo McInnes and Madeleine Potter. </p> <p>Three figures sprawl on a sparse set in front of a huge, slanted mirror. They argue among themselves - sometimes as if each were a facet of a single person. They also play the parts of doctor and patient. They are always at odds with each other and with themselves: on the stage, they may seem to lounge, but in the mirror, tilting towards the audience, they look like insects trapped on a flypaper or people spreadeagled at a fairground wall of death. A girl lolls back on a table with apparent ease, but her reflec tion makes her look as if she's spread out for sacrifice. </p> <p>This is the monochrome world of the depressive. Occasionally a great sizzling sound breaks out and the mirror is covered in a fuzz of light, as if a television has gone barmy. At one point, shadows of unseen people walk across the stage. The silhouettes of windows are projected; views of London streets are glimpsed - but you know these are windows that can never be opened. Which makes the ending of the play the more compelling. 'Please open the curtains,' are its last words. As they are said, the cast leaves the stage and opens the shutters of the windows in the auditorium. </p> <p>When Sarah Kane was alive, one of the charges against her was that she was merely setting out to shock - though shock may seem less of a threat to the theatre than boredom. 4.48 Psychosis makes it clear that all Kane's plays have been howls from the heart. It is her most beguiling work: it's hard not to like a dramatist who describes a dream in which a doctor 'gave me eight minutes to live. I'd been sitting in the fucking waiting room half an hour.' It is also the most obviously direct and modest. There is no attempt to paint a tumultuous inner landscape on to the outer world. There is no attempt to suggest a colourful literary madness: it is a picture of the real thing. It's fragmentary: sometimes arresting and individual; sometimes leaden, with the dull repetitiveness of the person who has lost her energy; and it's sometimes apocalyptic. Kane - who was a born-again Christian until she was 17 - never lost the rhythm and iconography of her religion. </p> <p>There's a thin line in Tennessee Williams's work between tosh and transcendence. It's a line which Nicholas Hytner's fine production of Orpheus Descending, seen by me at a Donmar preview, cunningly observes. A subtle, ever-changing performance by Helen Mirren lets humour into the hot house and in doing so banishes some of Williams's absurdities. </p> <p>The play needs this touch, for there are many moments here which are the stuff of an ad for Southern Comfort. Bobbing around in the background is a cluster of female grotesques - salacious and disapproving. There's a rent-a-voodoo figure who is wheeled on to wail at significant moments. And there's a heavy-handed overlay of myth: boy with guitar goes into the depths of the South, where he revivifies a woman whom he ends up losing. </p> <p>Mirren takes the central part of the fed-up creature of Italian descent, orphaned when her father is burnt to death by a local posse because he traded with blacks. She has been left by the love of her life for a richer woman, and shackled to death in the shape of a brutal, ailing husband. </p> <p>Mirren has spent a lifetime on the stage being gorgeous - not merely physically, but vocally. Ever since as a teenager she played Cleopatra - wheeling her arms around her in despair at Antony's death, swishing her golden hair like a whip - she's been sumptuous and expansive. Confronted with Williams's operatic lushness, she might have been expected to go in for floridity. She does the opposite. </p> <p>In the intimate space of the Donmar, not helped by Bob Crowley's dull design, she creates not simply one but a series of characters. She arrives - shrivelling well - buttoned into her black coat as tightly as Mary Poppins, with a set face and tight voice and just an occasional compulsive Mediterranean fling of the arm to suggest future steaminess. She crawls up a spiral staircase as painfully as if she were a pensioner. When she bursts into fecundity, she makes a total surprise of what might be thought the normal Mirren mode. </p> <p>The architects Haworth Tompkins are transforming the theatres of London. The practice has carved a magical space out of the Gainsborough Studios and re-made the Royal Court. Haworth Tompkins have also released the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park from its muddle of car park and lavatories, opening the space in front of the theatre and hanging a scatter of lights like berries high up on what looks like netting. The place has become a nest dropped into the middle of the park. </p> <p>And in it some golden eggs are being laid. The theatre has sensibly retained Alan Strachan as one of its directors. Now Rachel Kavanaugh has cleverly translated Much Ado About Nothing to a postwar genteel, demob-happy England. The cry of love rings out from the tennis court; the toffs are in uniform; the often arduous comic relief afforded by Dogberry and his mates is re-imagined as Dad's Army , with Ian Talbot particularly effective as a bouncy-toed, barking Mainwaring figure. Tom Mannion is a striking, unaffected Benedick - he almost makes you believe this is a character who cares.</p>",

      "body": "<p>To what has been a dreary little summer, the Royal Academy's Scottish Colourists' exhibition brings, at first glance, uncomplicated joy - bright light in the grey, the flash and glitter of vivid reds, golds and greens through the rain. And that, really, is what Samuel Peploe, Francis Cadell, Leslie Hunter and John Duncan Fergusson did for Scotland before and after the First World War. They were light-bringers: hugely influenced by French post-impressionism, they gave northern art a shock from which, thankfully, it has never quite recovered.</p> <p>Their work is expensive now and held in high regard. In America, it is studied by art PhD students. But this, remarkably, is their first major exhibition in London, certainly since the group collapsed in the 1930s. You only need to compare the best Cadells, Peploes and Hunters to the far limper, greyer versions of post-impressionism from the Bloomsbury set from the same period to see what London has been missing.</p> <p>They seem to be everything that Scots are reputedly not - vivacious, flashy, cheerful, exhibitionist. Later generations of Scottish painters got the message, to the point where it became degraded: even now, the annual Royal Scottish Academy show in Edinburgh still throws up rip-off McMatisses and lurid tartan Cezannes just for pleasure, a concept learnt from the Colourists.</p> <p>But the original four were serious, and often inspirational painters, highly regarded by their French contemporaries. None of the four exist outside their society. Despite the often bright colours, there is also a ripple of melancholy in the RA rooms, since the four represent what is now a lost country - the confident, outward-looking and wealthy middle-class Scotland, born of Empire and destroyed by war and the Depression. It was the Scotland whose 'Glasgow Boy' painters had been f ted in France and the US, whose architecture was exemplified by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose City fathers bought Van Gogh and Dali at a time when these painters were generally ridiculed, which was undergoing the full spate of a literary renaissance, and which was briefly rich in enlightened, vigorous patrons. It was a country whose flash and glitter can be glimpsed in Cadell's Edinburgh interiors and big-hat ladies.</p> <p>Then came the war and the Depression. Private patrons, who had encouraged the artists and bought their work, went bust or found themselves short of cash. Even Peploe's prices plunged. The raffish, good-living Cadell, who had insisted on fighting through the First World War as a private soldier, albeit in a specially tailored uniform, was reduced to appealing for money from a fund 'for the Relief of Decayed Scottish Artists'. All but Fergusson, who lived until 1961, were dead by the end of the Thirties. Because their market had been largely in Scotland, their international reputation went into a steep decline.</p> <p>Something of the ambiguous relationship between the Colourists and their country is caught by Leslie Hunter, a cousin of my great-grandmother. Compared to the others, Hunter is variously described as shadowy, neurotic and his life 'the most erratic to follow': in the blown-up pic tures which introduce this exhibition, he stares at the photographer with a swollen, slightly vacant look, sandwiched between a pork-pie hat and a thick tweed suit. His family, like many, had reacted to bad times by emigrating and he started his career in California, mixing with the likes of Jack LondonSadly he lost all his work in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.</p> <p>Hunter was a serious alcoholic. It was obvious that he would have problems with my great-grandfather, who was a fierce teetotaller and, as Lord Provost of Glasgow, the epitome of respectable Scottish society. There were terrible rows when Hunter came to beg for money for paints, and to dry out. Hunter, whose later work has been compared to Matisse and Van Gogh, did a large portrait of Anne Cameron, my great-grandmother, but then fell back off the wagon. My great-grandfather took the painting into the garden and burnt it. Anne, more appreciative of Hunter's genius, defiantly hung one of his still-lifes in the house: it was allowed to remain only because her husband never recognised the artist. Hunter died soon afterwards, as tormented as ever.

      "bodyText": "To what has been a dreary little summer, the Royal Academy's Scottish Colourists' exhibition brings, at first glance, uncomplicated joy - bright light in the grey, the flash and glitter of vivid reds, golds and greens through the rain. And that, really, is what Samuel Peploe, Francis Cadell, Leslie Hunter and John Duncan Fergusson did for Scotland before and after the First World War. They were light-bringers: hugely influenced by French post-impressionism, they gave northern art a shock from which, thankfully, it has never quite recovered. Their work is expensive now and held in high regard. In America, it is studied by art PhD students. But this, remarkably, is their first major exhibition in London, certainly since the group collapsed in the 1930s. You only need to compare the best Cadells, Peploes and Hunters to the far limper, greyer versions of post-impressionism from the Bloomsbury set from the same period to see what London has been missing. They seem to be everything that Scots are reputedly not - vivacious, flashy, cheerful, exhibitionist. Later generations of Scottish painters got the message, to the point where it became degraded: even now, the annual Royal Scottish Academy show in Edinburgh still throws up rip-off McMatisses and lurid tartan Cezannes just for pleasure, a concept learnt from the Colourists. But the original four were serious, and often inspirational painters, highly regarded by their French contemporaries. None of the four exist outside their society. Despite the often bright colours, there is also a ripple of melancholy in the RA rooms, since the four represent what is now a lost country - the confident, outward-looking and wealthy middle-class Scotland, born of Empire and destroyed by war and the Depression. It was the Scotland whose 'Glasgow Boy' painters had been f ted in France and the US, whose architecture was exemplified by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose City fathers bought Van Gogh and Dali at a time when these painters were generally ridiculed, which was undergoing the full spate of a literary renaissance, and which was briefly rich in enlightened, vigorous patrons. It was a country whose flash and glitter can be glimpsed in Cadell's Edinburgh interiors and big-hat ladies. Then came the war and the Depression. Private patrons, who had encouraged the artists and bought their work, went bust or found themselves short of cash. Even Peploe's prices plunged. The raffish, good-living Cadell, who had insisted on fighting through the First World War as a private soldier, albeit in a specially tailored uniform, was reduced to appealing for money from a fund 'for the Relief of Decayed Scottish Artists'. All but Fergusson, who lived until 1961, were dead by the end of the Thirties. Because their market had been largely in Scotland, their international reputation went into a steep decline. Something of the ambiguous relationship between the Colourists and their country is caught by Leslie Hunter, a cousin of my great-grandmother. Compared to the others, Hunter is variously described as shadowy, neurotic and his life 'the most erratic to follow': in the blown-up pic tures which introduce this exhibition, he stares at the photographer with a swollen, slightly vacant look, sandwiched between a pork-pie hat and a thick tweed suit. His family, like many, had reacted to bad times by emigrating and he started his career in California, mixing with the likes of Jack LondonSadly he lost all his work in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Hunter was a serious alcoholic. It was obvious that he would have problems with my great-grandfather, who was a fierce teetotaller and, as Lord Provost of Glasgow, the epitome of respectable Scottish society. There were terrible rows when Hunter came to beg for money for paints, and to dry out. Hunter, whose later work has been compared to Matisse and Van Gogh, did a large portrait of Anne Cameron, my great-grandmother, but then fell back off the wagon. My great-grandfather took the painting into the garden and burnt it. Anne, more appreciative of Hunter's genius, defiantly hung one of his still-lifes in the house: it was allowed to remain only because her husband never recognised the artist. Hunter died soon afterwards, as tormented as ever. While he was doing his great houseboat paintings on Loch Lomond he was seen in violent rages, throwing unsatisfactory canvases into the water. There were never enough patrons to boost the Glasgow artists. The big American and Russian patrons never looked north, and four of the most talented painters Scotland produced died poor andrelatively unhonoured. How large do they bulk now? They could never have done what they did without the influence of, first, Manet and Whistler and, later, Cezanne and Matisse - but then, a similar story applies to scores of major twentieth-cen tury painters.

A diverting talker, if that was what was wanted. But his highly developed sense of the absurd... he would probably have to sit on that. What else could he do with it? </p> <p>Haig worked for the Samaritans for five years during the Eighties, combining this with a flourishing career as an actor. And now he has written The Good Samaritan. On the page, it is entertaining (absurdity comes into its own) yet sobering, too. It is the story of a good samaritan who becomes the person in need of help, the one who has fallen by the wayside. </p> <p>I first met Haig 12 years ago. He had just won an Olivier award as best actor for his part in Timberlake Wertenbaker's Our Country's Good . I liked him immediately and remember being slightly dazed by his big house, filled with small children, in south-east London. He seemed abnormally settled for an actor, a young, responsible paterfamilias. </p> <p>He is 43 now, plumper, glossier but seemingly not a day older. He has a bucolic face - lightly tanned at present - and a moustache, which I suppose to be only a temporary adornment, cultivated for his next role as Teddy Platt, lord of the manor, in Alan Ayckbourn's House and Garden at the National, which is where I meet Haig during a rehearsal break. I note that the twinkle in his eye is just as I remember it. His charm, as an estate agent might say, is unspoilt. </p> <p>Haig has been extraordinarily productive in the last decade as an actor, a playwright and a parent. As an actor, he has been, to name a few roles, in Ben Elton's Gasping (just finished); Inspector Grimm in the BBC's The Thin Blue Line and a discomfitingly likeable paedophile in Alan Bennett's Talking Heads. And in Terry Johnson's Dead Funny, Haig was exactly that. </p> <p>His first play, My Boy Jack (1997), about the relationship between Rudyard Kipling and his son, transferred to the West End and is now being developed as a film. He also has a further film script and a third play in the pipeline. And as if all this were not enough, he has five children: Alice,15, Caroline,12, Freddy, eight, Harry, six, and Connie,10 months. He ought, I observe, to have the good grace to look a little bit tired. </p> <p>Where was he based as a Samaritan? 'I used to work in the crypt of a church in the City. It was very atmospheric; each of the crypt's arches contained a telephone booth.' His training was rigorous. The Samaritans 'brutally excise' a percentage of volunteers and many 'rule themselves out' once they realise that they must not be 'judgmental about anything'. </p> <p>He found the work 'harrowing'. It was essential, he explains, to find a 'disengagement' in order not to be swamped by other people's misery and yet at the same time - and it was this he found most difficult - to keep with each new caller 'the illusion of spontaneity and freshness alive'. </p> <p>He is quick to spot the similarities between being a Samaritan and an actor. The weariness of having to sound fresh sounds exactly like that encountered by actors in long-running West End hits. The similarity is also about 'enforced intimacy'. You become close to fellow actors who, once the play is over, you may never see again. </p> <p>Being an actor helped with the writing of the play: 'You get used to a boredom threshold. You often have to bolster a scene that has passed its sell-by date. So I am puritanical about keeping dialogue taut.' </p> <p>Sometimes, indeed, the dialogues are not only taut but entirely one-sided - one of the Samaritans is stressed by silent callers. How common are such calls? 'When I showed the script to the Samaritans, they pointed out that I had the figure of silent calls too low - 38 per cent of calls are silent.' </p> <p>In the play, Haig describes a call from a 17-year-old who is killing himself with a drug overdose. The Samaritan has to respect the boy's wish not to be saved. The woman talking to him has to provide a kind of spoken lullaby and is desolate afterwards. </p> <p>A debate arises about whether the Samaritans are right not to trace calls when lives are at stake. 'Two or three times', Haig had to talk to people in their death-throes. But unlike the character in his play, he agrees with the Samaritans' 'central principle' of not betraying the trust of callers in any way. </p> <p>Has he ever called a helpline himself? 'Yes, but I am not going to tell you about it.' He says he could imagine calling the Samaritans when he was in New York acting in Yasmina Reza's Art . He felt 'profoundly isolated and depressed'. </p> <p>Appropriately enough, it was during this time that he started to work on The Good Samaritan . He did not enjoy the writing, even though the result appears so effortless. 'I suppose it was because it was examining such uncomfortable recesses.' </p> <p>'Uncomfortable recesses' is an understatement, for Haig includes in the play a scene in which a woman describes giving birth to a stillborn baby. A few years ago, Haig and his wife had a stillborn daughter, whom they named Grace. </p> <p>Although the scene is fictionalised and the woman is 'nothing like my wife', it is a kind of memorial to Grace and also a 'buried tribute' to his wife who, like the character in the play, had to experience giving birth to a dead baby, 'utterly alone' with no midwife to help her while he ran frantically down the hospital corridors looking for help. It would be pat to suggest that the scene is a kind of therapy; if anything, it is a protest. </p> <p>Haig tells me that he and and his wife have improvised a 'domestic Zen' garden in Grace's memory, consisting of gravel, bamboo and bonsai. 'It is very peaceful, even if its little water feature is a bit blocked up at the moment,' he says. </p> <p>There is nothing pious about Haig, though there have been times when it might have helped to believe in God - 'My younger sister died when she was only 22.' She died unexpectedly, of a brain haemorrhage, and the experience has left him with a tendency to be always braced for the worst. Sometimes, his children ask him about heaven and he tries to be 'fluffy' about it. He hopes he can get away with this until their corrective 'cynicism' sets in. </p> <p>With such a big family, he not only hopes to go on acting, he 'needs' the work, he says. But he is 'profoundly happy that writing comes into the equation'. What dreams does he have for future roles? He would love to play Iago one day, he says. </p> <p>In the meantime, he is more than happy to settle for Ayckbourn who, in House and Garden , takes theatrical virtuosity to extremes, running two plays in two theatres simultaneously, with the same cast commuting to and fro between auditoria. Haig describes Ayckbourn as 'when on form, the greatest comic writer around'. And he relishes the character he plays, who he describes as 'angry, stupid, endearing and very funny'. </p> <p>When he was in his teens, Haig was thrown out of his public school, Rugby, because of a persistent inability to adhere to minor school rules. The letter home read: 'He must completely reform his character and appearance.' This sounds like career advice to me. Haig has been doing exactly as he was told ever since, on stage at least. In every way, his former headmaster should be proud of him. </p> <p>\u0095 The Good Samaritan opens on 6 July at Hampstead Theatre (020 7722 9301)</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Donald Cammell's Wild Side</strong> (112 mins, 18) Directed by Donald Cammell; starring Christopher Walken, Anne Heche, Joan Chen, Steven Bauer </p> <p><strong> Beyond the Mat</strong> (103 mins, 15) Directed by Barry Blaustein; starring Terry Funk, Jake Roberts, Mick Foley </p> <p><strong> Kikujiro</strong> (122 mins, 12) Directed by Takeshi Kitano; starring Beat Takeshi, Yusuke Sekiguchi </p> <p><strong> The Best Man</strong> (121 mins, 15) Directed by Malcolm D. Lee; starring Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut </p> <p><strong> Three to Tango</strong> (99 mins, 15) Directed by Damon Santostefano; starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott </p> <p>Like William Burroughs, British film-maker Donald Cammell was the scion of an immensely rich family (the Cammell Laird shipbuilders) who reacted violently against his respectable background. Both lived outrageously unconventional lives of drugs, orgies and diabolical dabbling, and produced extravagant, deliberately provocative works concerned, often mystically, with bisexuality and the perverted exercise of power. Unlike Burroughs, who killed his wife, Cammell killed himself, dying in Hollywood in 1996 at the age of 62. </p> <p>Cammell's first film, Performance , co-directed with Nicolas Roeg, is one of the most remarkable to emerge from a British studio and encapsulates the culture of Swinging London at its most seductively corrupt. He was forced by Warner Brothers to re-edit it drastically and he only completed three more pictures - the SF curiosity Demon Seed (Julie Christie impregnated by a computer), the mystic thriller White of the Eye (serial killer loose in the Arizona desert) and Wild Side , which was chopped up by its producers and sent straight to cable TV in 1995. It was the contemptuous treatment of this last film that proved the last straw, as it were, for Cammell, but he was still hoping to regain control of it when he shot himself. Now his editor and friend, Frank Mazzola, with the help of Channel 4 and Tartan Films, has restored the director's cut, and it is being shown under the somewhat tautologous title of Donald Cammell's Wild Side. It could as easily be called 'Christopher Walken on the Wild Side', for in that most volatile of American actors Cammell found a perfect exponent of his dangerous art. Walken plays an out-of-control financial crook, Bruno, the world's biggest money launderer, on whom the federal authorities have planted a psychotic undercover agent, Tony (Steven Bauer), as his chauffeur. A beautiful Los Angeles banker, Alex Lee (Anne Heche), is moonlighting as a $1,000-a-night call-girl to pay off her mortgage. She services the sexually voracious Bruno, is raped by Tony and then blackmailed by the Feds. Walken sends his Chinese wife Virginia (Joan Chen) to Alex's bank as part of a gigantic scam and the two women fall passionately in love. </p> <p>The film is from start to finish absolutely crazy, full of baroque dialogue and over-the-top performances. On one level it's a power game between an unlikely unhinged quartet, on another it's an orgy in serial form. It is often queasily risible, as when the financier prepares to bugger his chauffeur in front of Alex to demonstrate his superiority, and makes the intended victim roll the condom on for him as he smokes a cigar. Yet like all Cammell's work, Wild Side is oddly compelling - riveting in the sense that you feel nailed to a post as you watch it. The editing is disconcerting, the interiors claustrophobic, and Cammell uses to considerable emblematic effect the township of Long Beach, where the immaculate three-funnelled Queen Mary is isolated in an industrial seaside wasteland. In a curious reference back to the London of the 1960s, the heroine's nasty boss is called Rachman, presumably after the property racketeer involved in the Profumo scandal. </p> <p>Wrestling has produced writers as diverse as Brian Glover, Steve Tesich and John Irving, but it's never been taken seriously the way boxing is and there's little in Beyond the Mat, a documentary by Saturday Night Live writer Barry W. Blaustein, to persuade us otherwise. As conducted by the multi-million-dollar World Wrestling Federation and its small-time rivals, professional wrestling is a branch of showbiz and the circus. But however commercialised and phoney the sport, its participants get badly hurt (it's almost as dangerous as rodeo-riding) and strive to retain their self-respect. Most retire penniless and crippled; a few never give up; one of them, Jesse Ventura, made it to the Governor's mansion in Minnesota.

      "bodyText": "Donald Cammell's Wild Side (112 mins, 18) Directed by Donald Cammell; starring Christopher Walken, Anne Heche, Joan Chen, Steven Bauer Beyond the Mat (103 mins, 15) Directed by Barry Blaustein; starring Terry Funk, Jake Roberts, Mick Foley Kikujiro (122 mins, 12) Directed by Takeshi Kitano; starring Beat Takeshi, Yusuke Sekiguchi The Best Man (121 mins, 15) Directed by Malcolm D. Lee; starring Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut Three to Tango (99 mins, 15) Directed by Damon Santostefano; starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott Like William Burroughs, British film-maker Donald Cammell was the scion of an immensely rich family (the Cammell Laird shipbuilders) who reacted violently against his respectable background. Both lived outrageously unconventional lives of drugs, orgies and diabolical dabbling, and produced extravagant, deliberately provocative works concerned, often mystically, with bisexuality and the perverted exercise of power. Unlike Burroughs, who killed his wife, Cammell killed himself, dying in Hollywood in 1996 at the age of 62. Cammell's first film, Performance , co-directed with Nicolas Roeg, is one of the most remarkable to emerge from a British studio and encapsulates the culture of Swinging London at its most seductively corrupt. He was forced by Warner Brothers to re-edit it drastically and he only completed three more pictures - the SF curiosity Demon Seed (Julie Christie impregnated by a computer), the mystic thriller White of the Eye (serial killer loose in the Arizona desert) and Wild Side , which was chopped up by its producers and sent straight to cable TV in 1995. It was the contemptuous treatment of this last film that proved the last straw, as it were, for Cammell, but he was still hoping to regain control of it when he shot himself. Now his editor and friend, Frank Mazzola, with the help of Channel 4 and Tartan Films, has restored the director's cut, and it is being shown under the somewhat tautologous title of Donald Cammell's Wild Side. It could as easily be called 'Christopher Walken on the Wild Side', for in that most volatile of American actors Cammell found a perfect exponent of his dangerous art. Walken plays an out-of-control financial crook, Bruno, the world's biggest money launderer, on whom the federal authorities have planted a psychotic undercover agent, Tony (Steven Bauer), as his chauffeur. A beautiful Los Angeles banker, Alex Lee (Anne Heche), is moonlighting as a $1,000-a-night call-girl to pay off her mortgage. She services the sexually voracious Bruno, is raped by Tony and then blackmailed by the Feds. Walken sends his Chinese wife Virginia (Joan Chen) to Alex's bank as part of a gigantic scam and the two women fall passionately in love. The film is from start to finish absolutely crazy, full of baroque dialogue and over-the-top performances. On one level it's a power game between an unlikely unhinged quartet, on another it's an orgy in serial form. It is often queasily risible, as when the financier prepares to bugger his chauffeur in front of Alex to demonstrate his superiority, and makes the intended victim roll the condom on for him as he smokes a cigar. Yet like all Cammell's work, Wild Side is oddly compelling - riveting in the sense that you feel nailed to a post as you watch it. The editing is disconcerting, the interiors claustrophobic, and Cammell uses to considerable emblematic effect the township of Long Beach, where the immaculate three-funnelled Queen Mary is isolated in an industrial seaside wasteland. In a curious reference back to the London of the 1960s, the heroine's nasty boss is called Rachman, presumably after the property racketeer involved in the Profumo scandal. Wrestling has produced writers as diverse as Brian Glover, Steve Tesich and John Irving, but it's never been taken seriously the way boxing is and there's little in Beyond the Mat, a documentary by Saturday Night Live writer Barry W. Blaustein, to persuade us otherwise. As conducted by the multi-million-dollar World Wrestling Federation and its small-time rivals, professional wrestling is a branch of showbiz and the circus. But however commercialised and phoney the sport, its participants get badly hurt (it's almost as dangerous as rodeo-riding) and strive to retain their self-respect. Most retire penniless and crippled; a few never give up; one of them, Jesse Ventura, made it to the Governor's mansion in Minnesota. Blaustein, a fan since childhood, follows them around, watching them perform, hearing their confused life stories, meet ing their sad families. There is fascinating material here, but it's one of those personal documentaries where 'personal' often seems a synonym for rambling and self-indulgent. With Kikujiro, writer-director-actor Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano turns aside from his usual stylised gangster films to make a gentle road movie that resembles a Wallace Beery picture of the 1930s.

But possibly the oddest is Cluck!, a wondrously erudite, tongue-in-cheek study of chickens on the screen, written in 1980 by Jon-Stephen Fink and Mieke van der Linden. The authors' rating system of chicken-stars went from one (Elementary Incident, e.g. Patton) to four (Awesome Consequence, e.g. The Gold Rush, Freaks), and if they are preparing a new edition they will have little hesitation in putting Chicken Run into the top category. </p> <p>This fine family entertainment is the first feature-length film from Aardman, the animation studio based in Bristol that has been dazzling us for 20 years with its feats of clay. This one is co-directed by Peter Lord, co-founder of Aardman, and Nick Park, the creator of Wallace and Gromit and winner of Oscars for Creature Comforts, The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave, which opened nearly five years ago and was loosely inspired by Brief Encounter. Chicken Run is a very close parody of the prisoner-of-war camp genre, especially The Great Escape. In this case, however, the PoWs are Plasticine chickens and the camp is a farm in Yorkshire surrounded by barbed wire, policed by vicious guard dogs and run by the ferocious Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) whose jack-booted resemblance to Irma Grise of Belsen infamy is slightly mitigated by her dim husband who looks like Wallace's black-sheep brother. In contrast to the not dissimilar Babe, there are no decent humans here. </p> <p>The camp's escape officer is Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha in the manner of her imperturbable Saffie in Absolutely Fabulous) and the movie begins with a lively montage of ingenious escape attempts. Between each of them Ginger is thrown into the coal-bin cooler where, like Steve McQueen in The Great Escape, she bounces a baseball. The movie takes on a darker shade when a hen is executed by Mrs Tweedy for failing to lay eggs (we see the shadow of the falling axe), and it threatens to become positively black when the Tweedies decide to switch from producing eggs to manufacturing chicken pies, thus turning the farm into an extermination camp. </p> <p>But Park and his associates know that while swans can be tragic, hens can only be comic. So they endeavour to make us care about their poultry, but avoid easy pathos and seek to keep sentimentality at bay. </p> <p>This isn't an allegory in the tradition of The Parliament of Fowls or Animal Farm, and there are no uplifting, heartrending songs in the Disney manner. The only musical interlude is a jive session the hens have with Rocky, a flying Rhode Island rooster from the States (Mel Gibson) who has escaped from a circus and landed in the camp. Rocky provides a foil for Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), the ageing cock-of-the-walk nostalgically obsessed with his days in the RAF, and some love interest for Ginger. </p> <p>More important, Ginger gets him to start a flying school for a mass escape by air. This hilariously disastrous enterprise is observed by a pair of black-marketeer rats (Timothy Spall, Phil Daniels) who mock the hens' antics with lines such as 'Birds of a feather flop together' and 'Poultry in motion'. In fact, except for refraining from references to getting laid, there is not a single chicken joke or pun that goes unused, and I now even feel bad about writing 'e.g.'. </p> <p>Flying the coop using your own wings would have been the inspirational way out, but the Aardman people wisely reject it. Instead they opt for a flying machine of the sort built in Colditz and run up by the stranded survivors in Flight of the Phoenix. This gives Park the chance to create another eccentric contraption of a Heath-Robinson or Roland Emmett sort. </p> <p>Stalag Luft III would have had trouble containing inmates who could transform a string of fairylights into a flarepath and use the ratchets of a deck-chair to create a take-off ramp. Naturally Mac, the camp's resident engineer, is, like Star Trek 's Scotty, from north of the border. </p> <p>The film flags slightly from time to time, but for most of the way it is prodigally and prodigiously inventive, both visually and verbally.

      "byline": "Daniel Whitaker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The film industry, that well-spring of cynicism, is not the most obvious place to go looking for salvation. But Walter Salles, director of the much feted Central Station and an emblematic figure within the Brazilian film industry, is an optimistic man. </p> <p>'What we all look for is the possibility to rewrite in one way or another our own story,' says Salles, speaking from his Videofilmes studio in Rio de Janeiro. You hope his words of new beginnings might be true about life. They are certainly true of Brazil's film industry, triumphantly back on the world scene after a long hiatus. </p> <p>There's a hot rash of Brazilian films screening across London in various festivals over the coming months. In this veritable cine-carneval Salles's work will be among films testifying to the power and breadth of what has been shot in Brazil - most of which has been cruelly denied to audiences in this country. Love stories of the wealthy, like Baretto's seductive Ipanema-set Bossa Nova , or of the poor, like veteran director Carlos Diegues's tragic Orfeu , will be shown alongside tense tales of the southern badlands, like Beto Brant's acclaimed debut Belly Up . There are takes on what it means to be black (Macunaima), or of Japanese (Gaijin) or Italian (O Quadrilho) origin in perhaps the world's most successful melting pot. And also a generous helping from the Cinema Novo of the 1960s, when Brazilian directors kept pace with Italian neo-realists like Fellini. </p> <p>This month sees the National Film Theatre showing 24 Brazilian films while the Barbican runs another dozen, all from the 1990s. Then, in September, the indefatigable Eva Tarr will launch her 11th annual Latin American Film Festival, first at her Metro cinema in W1 then around the UK, again with a focus on Brazil. 'You leave a Brazilian film feeling alive,' says Tarr. </p> <p>Away from the screen, an unprecedented wave of Brazilian rhythms, photography, theatre and dance will also serve as background throughout the summer. The excuse is the country's 500th birthday, which has seen big Brazilian companies overjoyed to score PR points by sponsoring international cultural tours. Back in South America's largest country, some of the reflection is darker, focusing on a society that produces the world's largest gap between rich and poor and enough real-life violence that no local director feels the urge to glamorise it as Western gangster chic. </p> <p>But while their country's enormous problems are treated with unfailing realism, Brazilian films do emanate a steady faith in the prospect of redemption. Salles sees it as the idealism of youth in a nation still preoccupied with discovering its identity: 'How can you be cynical in a moment like this?' </p> <p>And he sees film as a means to change things, even though 'the targets are not so easily identifiable' as they were in the clear-cut military dictatorship years of the 1970s and 80s. 'The day I start to believe that there are no inter-relations between art and society, I will stop making films,' he declares. </p> <p>Salles is not alone. Brazilian films, whatever their overt theme, do tend to focus on changing the way people see each other.

Inventive disrespect for genres is combined with characterisations and narratives that pull you in.

      "bodyText": "The film industry, that well-spring of cynicism, is not the most obvious place to go looking for salvation. But Walter Salles, director of the much feted Central Station and an emblematic figure within the Brazilian film industry, is an optimistic man. 'What we all look for is the possibility to rewrite in one way or another our own story,' says Salles, speaking from his Videofilmes studio in Rio de Janeiro. You hope his words of new beginnings might be true about life. They are certainly true of Brazil's film industry, triumphantly back on the world scene after a long hiatus. There's a hot rash of Brazilian films screening across London in various festivals over the coming months. In this veritable cine-carneval Salles's work will be among films testifying to the power and breadth of what has been shot in Brazil - most of which has been cruelly denied to audiences in this country. Love stories of the wealthy, like Baretto's seductive Ipanema-set Bossa Nova , or of the poor, like veteran director Carlos Diegues's tragic Orfeu , will be shown alongside tense tales of the southern badlands, like Beto Brant's acclaimed debut Belly Up . There are takes on what it means to be black (Macunaima), or of Japanese (Gaijin) or Italian (O Quadrilho) origin in perhaps the world's most successful melting pot. And also a generous helping from the Cinema Novo of the 1960s, when Brazilian directors kept pace with Italian neo-realists like Fellini. This month sees the National Film Theatre showing 24 Brazilian films while the Barbican runs another dozen, all from the 1990s. Then, in September, the indefatigable Eva Tarr will launch her 11th annual Latin American Film Festival, first at her Metro cinema in W1 then around the UK, again with a focus on Brazil. 'You leave a Brazilian film feeling alive,' says Tarr. Away from the screen, an unprecedented wave of Brazilian rhythms, photography, theatre and dance will also serve as background throughout the summer. The excuse is the country's 500th birthday, which has seen big Brazilian companies overjoyed to score PR points by sponsoring international cultural tours. Back in South America's largest country, some of the reflection is darker, focusing on a society that produces the world's largest gap between rich and poor and enough real-life violence that no local director feels the urge to glamorise it as Western gangster chic. But while their country's enormous problems are treated with unfailing realism, Brazilian films do emanate a steady faith in the prospect of redemption. Salles sees it as the idealism of youth in a nation still preoccupied with discovering its identity: 'How can you be cynical in a moment like this?' And he sees film as a means to change things, even though 'the targets are not so easily identifiable' as they were in the clear-cut military dictatorship years of the 1970s and 80s. 'The day I start to believe that there are no inter-relations between art and society, I will stop making films,' he declares. Salles is not alone. Brazilian films, whatever their overt theme, do tend to focus on changing the way people see each other. John King, author of a forthcoming book on Latin American cinema, Magical Reels, and one of the organisers of the NFT series, points out how the focus has shifted from the overtly political message of Cinema Novo to a more psychological and complex approach today. Yet still most films from Brazil are moral fables, saccharine-free.

      "body": "<p>George Clooney's friends have a favourite story about him. Richard Kind - the bulky actor who plays Paulie, the naive, hapless, panicky press secretary in Spin City - was staying over at Clooney's house for a while. This happens a lot: Clooney has eight spare bedrooms so his mates can hide out if they've been thrown out by their wives. </p> <p>This time Kind brought a tiny kitten with him and started growing worried because there was nothing in the litter tray when he returned from work each day. He was so concerned he started feeding the poor kitten laxatives, but the tray was still empty. </p> <p>One day he walked into the bathroom to find a massive - you might say human-sized - deposit in the tray. Kind screamed: 'Oh, my god Kitty!' loud enough to be heard halfway across LA. Just before he could take the cat to the vet and ask for an explanation of this freak of nature, Clooney owned up... </p> <p>There are several ways to react to this story. One is disgust that Clooney could be so puerile. Another is bemusement at the idea of a suave, millionaire film star sneaking around, clearing up after a cat and then defecating in a litter tray. But Clooney's friends prefer to see it this way: it demonstrates the dedication to the point of absurdity that distinguishes the true practical joker. </p> <p>What Clooney's friends think matters because his life seems to be built around them. He calls them The Boys, his core group of eight. They've each got a bedroom in his house, sometimes just so they can stay after all-night poker, or when they've got some more serious crisis. And while they're there they can shoot hoops on his basketball court, watch movies in the screening room and drink Guinness on draught. </p> <p>And when none of them is around, Clooney shares his space with his potbellied pig, Max, and his two dogs. Sometimes a woman manages to negotiate this male enclave for a while, but not at the moment. And Clooney, a divorced man, swears he'll never get married again. </p> <p>Adam Sandler, the master of idiot comedy and just about as far as you can get from Clooney on screen, has a similar set-up. The difference is that there's something reclusive about Sandler's life, which seems to be conducted solely with his close friends. Sandler doesn't even speak to the press. Clooney, on the other hand, is happy to let journalists - that is the non-tabloid variety - hang out with him in his house. And if they don't do the interview there, he'll go out drinking with them: he's a beer man. And consequently the press love him. Stars these days tend to be prickly and oversensitive, or therapised and unnervingly confessional. Clooney's different: he's just relaxed, good copy. Ask him about the rumours that he's having an affair with Mark Wahlberg and he'll say: 'That must be my longest Hollywood relationship.' </p> <p>It's not all quips and practical jokes. He's got a serious side, including the interest in politics he inherited from his fiercely liberal father Nick, who Clooney claims used to tell him off for not going out with black girls. He thinks Jimmy Carter was a much underrated president. And he got involved in a campaign against a Chicago TV station that hired Jerry Springer to comment on the news. Clooney, who has known Springer all his life, was deeply concerned by this dip in journalistic ethics, and let everyone know. </p> <p>These strongly held opinions come coated in the famous charm. You could see it at Cannes this year. Ever since President Reagan's Libya obsession had Sylvester Stallone running scared from the festival in fear of a terrorist attack there have been mutterings about the end of the affair between Cannes and Hollywood.

But then, that's Clooney all over. These days he is the perfect film star in almost every way. The only thing he can't always do is the one that counts most - get punters into the cinema. His films tend to be medium-size hits at best. Conventionally, his new film, The Perfect Storm, would be seen to be the great test. Based on a true story about a doomed fishing boat, it has ambitious special effects and a summer opening: all the elements that show that the studio is expecting a hit. But in a typical move Clooney has suggested that it doesn't stand a chance in the early summer box office clash with Mel Gibson in The Patriot . </p> <p>Gibson, as it happens, was the first choice to play the skipper in The Perfect Storm , a fact that Clooney's all too willing to discuss - just as he told everyone that his role in Three Kings was intended for Clint Eastwood.

His own rule was that Ross could only grieve for a patient a couple of times a season: any doctor affected more often than that would crack up soon enough. </p> <p>But his TV stardom was slow to transfer to the big screen. This mystified people. It's no great puzzle why most of the Friends stars have struggled to convince on the big screen, but Clooney looked like an old-fashioned movie star. So he succeeded Val Kilmer in the rubber suit for Batman &amp; Robin (1997), the movie that seems to have killed off the series. He was paired with Michelle Pfeiffer in One Fine Day (1996) a romantic comedy that on paper looked like a certain hit, but wasn't. And he was matched with Nicole Kidman for The Peacemaker (1997), directed by ER veteran Mimi Leder. That failed to do much either. </p> <p>For all the goodwill, Clooney looked like he was going to have to stick to TV. At which point Steven Soderbergh, a director who seemed to have completely self-destructed, came to the rescue. Although it wasn't a big hit, Out Of Sight showed that Clooney - especially in his scenes with Jennifer Lopez - really did have that mysterious quality that stars used to have in the Forties. </p> <p>By the time Three Kings came out, Clooney had left ER. Again, the film was only a middling success, but, again, the reviews were great, Clooney was excellent and was very proud of the film's political complexity, even if he did get in a punch-up with director David O. Russell. As Clooney's friends tell it, the tension came because, as usual, Clooney had made friends with the crew. And Russell, who had never made an action movie before, started getting panicked by all the helicopters and noise and was taking it out on the crew and the extras. Clooney stepped in, and Russell head-butted him. But he still thinks that Russell did a good job. </p> <p>So film crews like him, the Coen brothers like him and magazines such as People like him. The South Park guys love him too: he played Sparky the Gay Dog. So maybe The Perfect Storm will finally justify that $12 million pay cheque. And if not, then he's busy producing Wahlberg's next movie, Metal God . And he'll probably do some more live TV following Failsafe, the Cold War drama he organised and starred in that was screened in the US in April. </p> <p>And then there's Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the legendary but actually rather dismal rat-pack movie. Soderbergh will direct, while Clooney is producing and playing Danny Ocean, the Sinatra role. He has also roped in Julia Roberts, Michael Douglas, Bill Murray and possibly Bruce Willis to do the other parts for peanuts. How did he manage that?

      "bodyText": "George Clooney's friends have a favourite story about him. Richard Kind - the bulky actor who plays Paulie, the naive, hapless, panicky press secretary in Spin City - was staying over at Clooney's house for a while. This happens a lot: Clooney has eight spare bedrooms so his mates can hide out if they've been thrown out by their wives. This time Kind brought a tiny kitten with him and started growing worried because there was nothing in the litter tray when he returned from work each day. He was so concerned he started feeding the poor kitten laxatives, but the tray was still empty. One day he walked into the bathroom to find a massive - you might say human-sized - deposit in the tray. Kind screamed: 'Oh, my god Kitty!' loud enough to be heard halfway across LA. Just before he could take the cat to the vet and ask for an explanation of this freak of nature, Clooney owned up... There are several ways to react to this story. One is disgust that Clooney could be so puerile. Another is bemusement at the idea of a suave, millionaire film star sneaking around, clearing up after a cat and then defecating in a litter tray. But Clooney's friends prefer to see it this way: it demonstrates the dedication to the point of absurdity that distinguishes the true practical joker. What Clooney's friends think matters because his life seems to be built around them. He calls them The Boys, his core group of eight. They've each got a bedroom in his house, sometimes just so they can stay after all-night poker, or when they've got some more serious crisis. And while they're there they can shoot hoops on his basketball court, watch movies in the screening room and drink Guinness on draught. And when none of them is around, Clooney shares his space with his potbellied pig, Max, and his two dogs. Sometimes a woman manages to negotiate this male enclave for a while, but not at the moment. And Clooney, a divorced man, swears he'll never get married again. Adam Sandler, the master of idiot comedy and just about as far as you can get from Clooney on screen, has a similar set-up. The difference is that there's something reclusive about Sandler's life, which seems to be conducted solely with his close friends. Sandler doesn't even speak to the press. Clooney, on the other hand, is happy to let journalists - that is the non-tabloid variety - hang out with him in his house. And if they don't do the interview there, he'll go out drinking with them: he's a beer man. And consequently the press love him. Stars these days tend to be prickly and oversensitive, or therapised and unnervingly confessional. Clooney's different: he's just relaxed, good copy. Ask him about the rumours that he's having an affair with Mark Wahlberg and he'll say: 'That must be my longest Hollywood relationship.' It's not all quips and practical jokes. He's got a serious side, including the interest in politics he inherited from his fiercely liberal father Nick, who Clooney claims used to tell him off for not going out with black girls. He thinks Jimmy Carter was a much underrated president. And he got involved in a campaign against a Chicago TV station that hired Jerry Springer to comment on the news. Clooney, who has known Springer all his life, was deeply concerned by this dip in journalistic ethics, and let everyone know. These strongly held opinions come coated in the famous charm. You could see it at Cannes this year. Ever since President Reagan's Libya obsession had Sylvester Stallone running scared from the festival in fear of a terrorist attack there have been mutterings about the end of the affair between Cannes and Hollywood. But Cannes allowed Clooney to sweep it off its feet. The French like their Hollywood stars in the classic mould, and Clooney certainly has a touch of Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart about him. In direct contrast to Bruce Willis, scowling as critics jeered at a rough cut of Armageddon, Clooney had the wisdom to come to Cannes with a festival sure thing, the Coen brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou?

      "body": "<p>Since the discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, the treatment of stomach ulcers has changed significantly. This bug can embed itself in the walls of the stomach, exposing the stomach lining to acid attacks and causing gastritis, which, when this occurs frequently enough, can provide the ideal conditions for a stomach ulcer to develop. Many gastroenterologists believe that Helicobacter pylori is responsible for the majority of stomach ulcers, which in most cases can be countered with the appropriate antibiotics. A patient of mine had been suffering from indigestion for two years before she finally admitted to herself that the root of her problem had to be something other than her erratic eating habits and stress, although these certainly didn't help. A visit to the GP resulted in a stomach ulcer being diagnosed. </p> <p>Although many people are worried about taking antibiotics, a single course can eradicate the majority of stomach ulcers without increasing the risk of developing a resistance to antibiotics in the longer term. However, as a practitioner, I am well aware that there are those who just don't like, or are unable to stomach, antibiotics. There are also some people who simply don't respond to the antibiotics. But thankfully, some new scientific research appears to offer an alternative to taking medication for stomach problems. </p> <p>Dr Peter Molan MBE, an associate professor in biochemistry at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, has been researching the healing properties of honey. He has found that when honey comes into contact with bodily moisture, the glucose oxidase enzyme (which is introduced into the honey by bees) slowly releases hydrogen peroxide. Although we more commonly associate hydrogen peroxide with bleaching hair, in this instance it acts as an antiseptic agent. Dr Molan and his research team also recently discovered that some, but not all, types of Manuka honey contain a second natural antibacterial component. This component, which is referred to as UMF, has been proved to be an effective antidote to such 'superbugs' as Staphylococcus aureus and Helicobacter pylori. </p> <p>New Zealand bees produce Manuka honey from the flowers of the Manuka tree, which has long been used in traditional Maori folk medicine. In laboratory tests, UMF Active Manuka honey has been shown to inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori . It has to be said, however, that not all gastroenterologists are convinced that honey destroys Helicobacter pylori completely, but at present it seems that people who are suffering from stomach ulcers caused by this bacterium and others blighted with indigestion or digestive complaints may experience some relief after taking it. </p> <p>The message that honey is good for your health is hardly new: we all know how soothing hot water laced with honey and lemon can be if we have sore throats, and I always recommend that children recovering from surgical throat procedures eat ice cream with a dollop of honey on it. You may be surprised to read that some doctors report successfully enlisting the aid of honey for treating serious skin conditions such as burns. The scientific explanation lies with honey's antibacterial, tissue-nourishing and growth-stimulating properties. Honey's osmotic effect draws a thin film of moisture from the body to the surface of the skin, thereby creating a barrier between the wound and any dressing. The honey also acts as a natural and gentle catalyst that speeds up the healing process and minimises scarring. </p> <p>I do have a few caveats, however. Firstly, the popular belief that honey is more natural and therefore healthier than table sugar, sucrose or glucose isn't entirely true. Like all foods, honey can be healthy when eaten in moderation, but may also have some downsides. Dieters should know that honey contains the same number of calories as other types of sugar, which means that biscuits and other foods made with honey can cause weight gain. Because honey can cause blood-sugar levels to rise quickly, diabetics should regard honey as cautiously as any other natural sweetener, while many of the children I treat for energy-level disturbances can become just as irritable after eating a honey sandwich as a bar of chocolate. Eating too much honey on an empty stomach tends to aggravate the systems of sugar-sensitive individuals, so it's best to cushion your stomach with some fibre first, perhaps by following a main meal consisting of vegetables, wholegrains or fresh fruit with a dessert that incorporates honey. Finally, honey can erode tooth enamel. The practice of dipping a dummy in honey to keep a baby sweet is a real no-no: not only can it encourage babies to develop an overly sweet tooth and rot their teeth before they appear, the bacterial content of honey is far too challenging for a baby's immune system, if they're under one year old. </p> <p>On the plus side, honey's concentrated sugar content makes it a very useful food for people who are trying to gain weight, perhaps while recuperating from a major illness. Whether added to a milky drink, dribbled over rice pudding or spread on hot toast, honey can provide a much-needed calorie boost, along with mouthwatering sweetness. Use honey carefully - with medical guidance if necessary - either to help to relieve indigestion or simply as an indulgent treat. But watch this space: there's a great deal more that bees can offer us than their stings. </p> <p> \u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books</p>",

And while the new regulation will not mean that pension funds are obliged to operate an ethical investment policy, many fund managers are waking up to the fact good environmental management is in their own financial interests. </p> <p>The Prudential is adopting an ethical policy for the management of its \u00a371bn UK portfolio - not because of any moral crusade about the environment, says the company's Andrew Collis, 'but because we believe that... an appropriate environmental policy is a good indication of how well managed that company is'. </p> <p>Already three of the biggest funds, BT, British Coal and the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), have declared their intention to operate an ethical investment policy. With assets of nearly \u00a320bn, the USS is the third biggest pension fund in the country and invests in more than 2,000 British companies, including controversial names such as BAe, Rio Tinto and British American Tobacco. </p> <p>This has resulted in the USS being the subject of a campaign by some of the scheme's members, who have formed Ethics For USS to lobby the USS to adopt a more stringent ethical policy. Their campaigning paid off late last year when the USS announced that it was to adopt an ethical investment policy that was to be run by new staff. </p> <p>However, six months on Jess Worth, from Ethics For USS, is disappointed at the lack of action from the fund: 'While we're really encouraged that the USS has decided to take its social and environmental responsibilities seriously, it seems to be making slow progress, and therefore we remain to be convinced that this new policy will have a major impact.' </p> <p>In practice, the regulation will probably result in fund managers operating a policy of engagement with companies in their portfolios. This means that, as a major shareholder in a company, an institution will look to encourage it to act in a more ethically responsible way through active dialogue. This would involve a great many things, such as producing comprehensive social and environmental reports and the introduction of environmental management systems. </p> <p>The policy of engagement is in direct contrast to the ethical investment policy of negative screening, which involves disinvesting from those companies that don't live up to certain ethical and environmental criteria. Negative screening, which characterised ethical investing in the 1980s - largely as a result of the anti-apartheid campaign - was the reason behind the pension fund industry's initial hostility to the Government's new regulation. Pension fund managers were opposed to the idea of having to disinvest from companies. </p> <p>However, the Government has bent over backwards to reassure the industry that negative screening was Old Labour thinking, and that positive engagement is the order of the day. </p> <p>Rob Harrison from Corporate Critic, the business ethics website, is sceptical, however, about the long-term impact that an engagement-only policy is likely to have. 'When the regulation was first being discussed with both a negative screening and engagement component, the pension industry was predicting, among other things, the collapse of both the arms and tobacco industries. Since negative screening was dropped, the industry now supports it, as clearly it no longer believes that engagement alone will change anything.' </p> <p>Despite this, Harrison concedes that the fact that the Government is regulating the pension fund industry at all is a useful first step towards overhauling corporate ethical behaviour. </p> <p>Apart from the fact that the regulation could lack any real teeth, the other fear is of a tidal wave of greenwash from the pension fund industry. 'It is going to be a bit of a mess to begin with,' accepts Peter Webster from Eiris, the ethical investment research group. 'There will be more words than action to begin with, but then the industry will begin to regulate itself by introducing proper standards to measure these words against actions.' </p> <p>Jess Worth is in no doubt, though, about the campaigning opportunities that the regulation presents. 'Major institutional shareholders such as pension funds have a direct line of influence right into the boardrooms of huge corporations in a way that other types of campaigns don't, and it's an area where there's real potential.' </p> <p>\u0095 Friends of the Earth has produced an information pack to encourage pension holders to make their pension fund more ethical: (0207) 490 1555.

'When the regulation was first being discussed with both a negative screening and engagement component, the pension industry was predicting, among other things, the collapse of both the arms and tobacco industries. Since negative screening was dropped, the industry now supports it, as clearly it no longer believes that engagement alone will change anything.' Despite this, Harrison concedes that the fact that the Government is regulating the pension fund industry at all is a useful first step towards overhauling corporate ethical behaviour. Apart from the fact that the regulation could lack any real teeth, the other fear is of a tidal wave of greenwash from the pension fund industry. 'It is going to be a bit of a mess to begin with,' accepts Peter Webster from Eiris, the ethical investment research group. 'There will be more words than action to begin with, but then the industry will begin to regulate itself by introducing proper standards to measure these words against actions.' Jess Worth is in no doubt, though, about the campaigning opportunities that the regulation presents. 'Major institutional shareholders such as pension funds have a direct line of influence right into the boardrooms of huge corporations in a way that other types of campaigns don't, and it's an area where there's real potential.' \u0095 Friends of the Earth has produced an information pack to encourage pension holders to make their pension fund more ethical: (0207) 490 1555.

'You can only be arro gant after you succeed,' he says. 'I learnt that at EuroDisney when we were very arrogant when we opened. It was like, \"We Americans are going to teach you Europeans how to do business.\" It took three years to turn it round.' </p> <p>He understands the media's interest in the Dome but has been surprised by its intensity.

But the UK's long-hours culture is less attractive to other Europeans. Isabelle Martin, a catering company administrator who is also French, says: 'The assumption is that you'll be more productive if you work longer hours but I doubt that. </p> <p> 'People in France put work in a different place in their lives.

But I enjoy working hard and as I come from a small town I love the feeling of making it in a big city like London where it's so competitive.' </p> <p> More than half of the UK's workers from abroad are based in London and most of the remainder are elsewhere in south-east England. Sally Marullo, who edits Employment Europe , which monitors the labour market, questions the assumption that these numbers will increase. 'The internet will cut both ways,' she says. 'The traditional idea of upping sticks and moving for work will go. There will be easier ways to achieve the same result.' Gerbeau says the UK's employment laws helped him take prompt action to lessen the Dome's losses, but Marullo believes the attraction of low regulation can be overestimated.</p> <p> 'I'm sure it's a factor for some types of business. It's cheaper and easier to set up business here than in most other parts of Europe. But equally, once you're used to work ing in a more regulated environment you just get on with it. France is currently the most popular country for inward investment, particularly from Japan.' </p> <p> Gerbeau is proud to be French - he represented his country as a professional ice hockey player - but he is glad that globalisation is blurring the line between nations over business. 'The idea of a 100 per cent French company will go,' he says. 'France Telecom, a very French company, has just taken over Orange, and this sort of thing is going to change French corporate culture for the better.' </p> <p> Isabelle Martin, at the catering company, is less sure. 'I don't feel labour is valued in UK,' she says. 'Clients often complain about our four-hour minimum charge for waiters; but would they give up their weekends to travel miles and work into the small hours for just \u00a330, let alone less?'

      "bodyText": "Customers of Tesco's bank will soon be able to pay money and cheques into their accounts at the supermarket checkout while doing the weekly shop. Tomorrow, Britain's biggest supermarket group will finally unveil its expected move to take personal finance transactions at the till. The measure will be seen as an important weapon to counter the growing number of high street bank branch closures. It also comes as the Government plans to allow the Post Office to operate a banking service for the financially excluded. Tesco will be the first supermarket to offer a 'banking' checkout service. This will be seen as a huge boost to its savings business. It is thought that Individual Savings Account revenues in particular will benefit. But hard on the heels of Tesco's new checkout plan will come speculation that it will shortly offer customers a current account. Tesco Financial Services, a joint venture between the supermarket and Royal Bank of Scotland, currently offers loans, mortgages, Isas and various insurance products. Tesco sees personal finance as a huge growth area. It has more than 1.5 million personal finance customers and aims to double that in the next few years. Its personal finance division has moved into month-by-month profit. In March it became the first supermarket chain to sell motor insurance at all its 633 shops and 326 petrol stations nationwide. Last February, Tesco launched an online service for its instant access savings customers. Sainsbury's said it has no plans at present to offer a similar scheme.",

Golden rule one is don't panic. </p> <p>Golden rule two is know your enemy. Basically, subsidence is damage to a property's foundations caused by ground movement as a result of a change in soil moisture levels. It is most likely to happen in areas with clay soil, and it is most likely to strike in London and the South East. According to insurer Direct Line, one in 50 houses in these areas has suffered in the 25 years since insurance companies began keeping records, and 75 per cent of claims are for properties built on clay. </p> <p>We live on the ground floor of a Victorian house with mature gardens in north London, on a great big hill of clay. Perfect. </p> <p>So how do you tell the difference between the real monster and a bit of natural movement soon remedied with a tube of Polyfilla and a lick of paint? Well, there's the pencil trick, but there are other clues.

It seemed our house was sliding down the hill so fast it would soon be propping up the local bar. </p> <p>The following week a young chap stopped by and vigorously hammered monitoring studs on either side of every crack. He measured the width between them, rubbed his chin, and went away. He came again to measure them six weeks later - and every six weeks for almost 18 months. Golden rule three: develop the patience of a saint - you're going to need it. </p> <p>Our situation was complicated by the fact that we, and the owners of the other two flats in the house, are leaseholders. This meant no decision, however minor, could be made without the freeholder being consulted. He was, he said, determined to 'protect his interests'. Our policy had a \u00a31,000 excess, shared between the flats. So we each paid \u00a3330 in advance - to the freeholder - before anything could proceed. </p> <p>He appointed a firm of consulting engineers and quantity surveyors who were to be the project managers. Investigations proper began slowly in autumn 1998. </p> <p>Damaged drains can often be contributors to subsidence (Direct Line estimates that one in five claims are a result of leaks causing soil erosion). So exploratory bore holes were drilled to the front and back of our property. Yes, the drains were worn; yes, there was evidence of root invasion; no, our policy would not cover the cost because it came under that stalwart clause, 'wear and tear'.

Golden rule four: Even if you are fully insured, accept it's going to cost you. </p> <p>I began to fret about the garden, whether we would lose the ivy, the jasmine, and the virginia creeper on the back of the house that turns a spectacular scarlet in autumn. </p> <p>And what about the remedial work? A woman from the quantity surveyor, who specialises in the repair of old houses, had talked worryingly at one stage of dismantling the bay, complete with sash windows and stained glass. It might have to be underpinned and rebuilt. </p> <p>Luckily, these turned out to be worst-case scenarios. The understanding and treatment of subsidence have improved in leaps and bounds over the past few years, and underpinning, as well as destroying gardens, is now accepted as the absolute extreme - sometimes exacerbating the situation. Golden rule 5: don't despair until the final verdict is in. </p> <p>An arboriculturalist was sent for. He identified the trouble-making shrubs and trees and, much to our relief, recommended pruning by between a third and a half, depending how close to the house they grew. Cutting more might cause heave - where moisture no longer needed by roots would swell the soil under the house, causing more problems. </p> <p>After that it was simply a case of getting quotes and agreeing one.

      "bodyText": "The solicitor's advice is probably right. If, however, your notice period would take you beyond the 12-month threshhold, you could sue for breach of contract for your notice period and for being denied the opportunity to bring an unfair dismissal claim. This is a way of bringing an unfair dismissal claim - for which you need a year's service - by the back door. The maximum you could get in an employment tribunal for breach of contract is \u00a325,000. The other possibility would be to bring a claim on sex, race or disability grounds if one of those elements was involved in the complaint. Workers get immediate rights to claim unfair dismissal if they are are discriminated against, if they are whistleblowers, because of union membership or if a health and safety issue is involved. So, in short, you are probably best off looking for another job and putting the issue behind you. Under the law, employers can fire you for totally unfair reasons during your first year. \u0095 Legal advice from Lewis Silkin \u0095 Problem at work?

But Dominic Cork - returning to the side from the wilderness - showed just the required mettle. What a way to celebrate the 100th Test at Lord's.</p> <p>A full house at headquarters was racked with tension throughout.

Graeme Hick made a now-typical cameo of 15 before he steered Walsh into Lara's hands at first slip.

Lara snaffled it and appealed for the catch without knowing if it was fair or not, but White survived the trial by television. Not for long - he looked far from comfortable against the three balls he faced before a dubious inside edge from the fifth ball of the over put him out of his misery. 140 for 6: the match swinging back towards West Indies. </p> <p>Enter Dominic Cork. The hero of two days ago took two successive fours off Walsh's next over - one all-run - but then Knight edged a ball from Rose that went across him into the gloves of Jacobs. 149 for 7. Caddick, yesterday's main man, joined Cork and the latter's single took England to the next milestone accompanied by the latest St John's Wood Roar. It was redoubled for Caddick's exquisite cut through cover point for four. The pair took England within 28 before the return of Ambrose signalled Caddick's demise, leg before. Darren Gough strode out and the pair clearly meant business. Cork carted a six into the Grandstand off Rose and added a four two balls later to put England back on track; Gough was the support for Cork's headline act.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Mark Ramprakash was England's only casualty in a rain-truncated morning session of just 9.5 overs. Having managed to avoid his second successive Lord's Test pair against West Indies, he chopped a fuller ball from Courtney Walsh on to his stumps to leave England 3 for 1. Vaughan (41) and Atherton (45) rode their luck in the face of some superb bowling from Curtly Ambrose (13-8-13-0 at one stage), but once they had seen him off they found the support bowling of Franklyn Rose and Reon King easier to handle. Runs came chiefly on the leg side as the Roses partnership put on 92 for the second wicket - England's first fifty-partnership of the series. </p> <p>After a morning session when runs were few and far between, the afternoon was positively bountiful. Walsh's first ball went for four leg-byes, then Atherton edged between slip and gully. Vaughan, still on 0, survived a big appeal for caught behind but John Hampshire wasn't convinced. It was a Snickometer job - and even then it was hard to say if the noise was ball on bat or bat on pad. Vaughan was fortunate to survive; it was that sort of day. The arrival of the support bowlers confidence started to ooze through the Michaels as they moved past 50 in the 22nd over. On 53 they registered England's first fifty-partnership of the series; on 55 they sailed smugly past West Indies' second-innings total.</p> <p>King replaced Curtly and another battle was won, but even though the weather and the scoreboard were improving in tandem, there was still a sense that England might yet throw it away with the loss of a wicket or two.

      "body": "<p>Andy Caddick stirred from his torpor, stretched and bowled his side back into the second test at a time when all but the most unhinged English optimist would have deemed the match beyond redemption. </p> <p>Thirteen overs on the reel, each and every one packed with snarling, animal aggression brought him five prime West Indian wickets for 16, all wickets coming for seven runs in a one ball fewer than 10 of the overs. What had he had for tea? Rocket fuel?</p> <p>For someone who recently would not have felt inclined to say boo to Julian Clary for fear of a poke in the eye, the transformation from the insipid character of the first innings was startling.</p> <p>Once he followed through down the pitch to stand eyeball to eyeball with the great Ambrose - one of the few able to do so without recourse to a step-ladder - and so far has lived to tell the tale although it would have been wise to get his affairs in order last night.</p> <p>Caddick's marvellous effort and similar response from Darren Gough and Dominic Cork saw West Indies, in their second innings, humbled in a fraction over two hours and inside 27 overs for just 54, the lowest score they have ever made against England and only two more than their lowest ever in Tests, the 51 made against Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie in Port of Spain fifteen months ago.</p> <p>Only Ridley Jacobs, with 12, reached double figures yesterday. It left England eight overs to negotiate in pursuit of 188 to complete what would be an astounding win, and Mike Atherton and Mark Ramprakash duly negotiated seven balls before the light closed in and a remarkable day that had seen 21 wickets fall came to a conclusion.</p> <p>Today, then, is as big as it gets, with not just the match but the entire series hanging in the balance. For two decades and more it has been the absolute belief within the West Indies side that no matter how few runs their own batsmen score the bowlers can always dismiss the opposition for fewer.</p> <p>But to pull this one round the Twin Tormentors, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh together with the young pretenders Reon King and Franklyn Rose will need to pull out all the stops. Perhaps they will draw strength from other matches in Trinidad. Against Zimbabwe earlier in the year they successfully defended 99 in the final innings but more pertinently, when they sent England packing for 46 when Atherton's 1994 tourists required 193 to win.</p> <p>The latter is too much etched on the England psyche and too close in context to this game for comfort and badly needs exorcising.</p> <p> Against that, Alec Stewart would be missing a trick if he did not bring to his teams attention the West Indies travails in New Zealand last winter when in Hamilton, in the very first innings of the series, Sherwin Campbell and and Adrian Griffith added 276 for the first wicket only to see the Kiwis triumph by nine wickets.</p> <p>For West Indies to lose here, from 161 for one, given that memory, could set them back to where they were, while England know that the chance is now there for someone to make their name.</p> <p>The same number of wickets as fell yesterday did so in a days' play against New Zealand at Edgbaston last year, but that was a different pitch.</p> <p>This sort of batting carnage is less readily explained although the Lord's groundsman Mick Hunt will have been biting his fingernails to the quick.

      "bodyText": "Andy Caddick stirred from his torpor, stretched and bowled his side back into the second test at a time when all but the most unhinged English optimist would have deemed the match beyond redemption. Thirteen overs on the reel, each and every one packed with snarling, animal aggression brought him five prime West Indian wickets for 16, all wickets coming for seven runs in a one ball fewer than 10 of the overs. What had he had for tea? Rocket fuel? For someone who recently would not have felt inclined to say boo to Julian Clary for fear of a poke in the eye, the transformation from the insipid character of the first innings was startling. Once he followed through down the pitch to stand eyeball to eyeball with the great Ambrose - one of the few able to do so without recourse to a step-ladder - and so far has lived to tell the tale although it would have been wise to get his affairs in order last night. Caddick's marvellous effort and similar response from Darren Gough and Dominic Cork saw West Indies, in their second innings, humbled in a fraction over two hours and inside 27 overs for just 54, the lowest score they have ever made against England and only two more than their lowest ever in Tests, the 51 made against Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie in Port of Spain fifteen months ago. Only Ridley Jacobs, with 12, reached double figures yesterday. It left England eight overs to negotiate in pursuit of 188 to complete what would be an astounding win, and Mike Atherton and Mark Ramprakash duly negotiated seven balls before the light closed in and a remarkable day that had seen 21 wickets fall came to a conclusion. Today, then, is as big as it gets, with not just the match but the entire series hanging in the balance. For two decades and more it has been the absolute belief within the West Indies side that no matter how few runs their own batsmen score the bowlers can always dismiss the opposition for fewer. But to pull this one round the Twin Tormentors, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh together with the young pretenders Reon King and Franklyn Rose will need to pull out all the stops. Perhaps they will draw strength from other matches in Trinidad. Against Zimbabwe earlier in the year they successfully defended 99 in the final innings but more pertinently, when they sent England packing for 46 when Atherton's 1994 tourists required 193 to win. The latter is too much etched on the England psyche and too close in context to this game for comfort and badly needs exorcising. Against that, Alec Stewart would be missing a trick if he did not bring to his teams attention the West Indies travails in New Zealand last winter when in Hamilton, in the very first innings of the series, Sherwin Campbell and and Adrian Griffith added 276 for the first wicket only to see the Kiwis triumph by nine wickets. For West Indies to lose here, from 161 for one, given that memory, could set them back to where they were, while England know that the chance is now there for someone to make their name. The same number of wickets as fell yesterday did so in a days' play against New Zealand at Edgbaston last year, but that was a different pitch. This sort of batting carnage is less readily explained although the Lord's groundsman Mick Hunt will have been biting his fingernails to the quick. He need not worry. The surface was as dry as it could be on the first day and the although it has quickened up noticeably, the bounce has re mained true and the lateral movement from the seam certainly not excessive. A contributory factor has been the blanket of haze, which has lent encouragement to the swing bowlers and kept the pitch fresher than it might have been under sunlight. Techniques on both sides, against the ball moving even minimal amounts at pace have been exposed, however, and West Indies towards evening yesterday were unable to cope with Caddick's rib-tickling bounce. Not for a long time has an England short leg become such a predatory fielder and today it will be the high bounce of Walsh and Ambrose that will test the resolve of the England batsmen. Already, Campbell's 82 and Wavell Hinds' 59 made before tea on the first day, may prove to be the decisive innings of the match with no one else since reaching 30. Indeed apart from Nick Knight, who made 34 in the second innings at Edgbaston, no England batsman has reached even that in three innings this series. Knight, should he bat today, will do so encumbered by a right index finger damaged when attempting to catch a screamer of a catch at third slip off Gough. While the evening carnage was unfolding he was in the casualty unit having an Xray which revealed \" no major fracture\" whatever that means. The West Indies bowlers may well have felt they had done enough with the ball to put the game beyond reach. At the outset, Ambrose was irresistible, probing, giving nothing away, and making inroads as Ramprakash, Michael Vaughan and Graeme Hick were drawn into error, the latter bowled leaden footed after a calculated assault on Rose's opening over that brought him four boundaries at a time when runs were like gold dust. Untypically too, Atherton was drawn into some inept bathanging at Walsh and was caught at the wicket. Hick's riposte and a later partnership of 35 between Stewart (28) and Craig White (25) provided the only respite from the torture. Walsh and Ambrose finished with four wickets apiece and if Ambrose deserved more then his superb partner, conceded little until Gough, premeditating, swung him lustily over the square leg fence. The last-wicket stand Gough shared with a remarkably composed and organised Matthew Hoggard was just sufficient in the circumstances to come into the irritating category.",

      "body": "<p>Walter Matthau, the foghorn-voiced movie villain who became a master of crotchety comedy with his Oscar-winning The Fortune Cookie and followed with The Odd Couple, Grumpy Old Men and many other hits, died Saturday morning of a heart attack. He was 79. </p> <p>Matthau was pronounced dead at 1:42am, shortly after being brought into St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, said hospital spokeswoman Lindi Funston. </p> <p>Often cast as a would-be con man foiled by life's travails, Matthau bellowed complaints against his tormentors and moved his lean, 6-foot-3 frame in surprising ways. </p> <p>Said his frequent costar, Jack Lemmon: \"Walter walks like a child's windup toy.\" </p> <p>Matthau's performance as the shyster brother-in-law of Lemmon in The Fortune Cookie won him the Academy Award as best supporting actor of 1966. He was twice nominated for best actor: as the cantankerous oldster in Kotch, 1971 (directed by Lemmon); and as the feuding vaudeville partner of George Burns in The Sunshine Boys, 1975. </p> <p>The Odd Couple provided the role that established Matthau's stardom. In 1965 he appeared in New York as the slobby sportswriter Oscar Madison in Neil Simon's play. Art Carney was the fastidious photographer, Felix Unger, who shared an apartment with Madison after both had been divorced. </p> <p>Matthau repeated the role in the 1968 film, with Lemmon as Felix. They reprised their roles 30 years later in the 1998 film Odd Couple II.</p> <p>\"Every actor looks all his life for a part that will combine his talents with his personality,'' Matthau told Time magazine in 1971. \"The Odd Couple was mine. That was the plutonium I needed. It all started happening after that.'' </p> <p>The actor could be as whimsically eccentric in interviews as he was on the screen. Reporters had to exercise caution in separating fact from his flights of fancy. </p> <p>In responding to a form for current biography, he reported that his father had been an Eastern Orthodox priest in czarist Russia who ran afoul with church authorities by preaching the infallibility of the pope. His father was actually a Kiev pedlar. </p> <p>Matthau declared that he had married the former Carol Wellington-Smythe Marcus. His wife was really Carol Marcus, who had been twice married to playwright William Saroyan. </p> <p>\"That's my defense mechanism against pompous and ludicrous questions,'' Matthau explained. When he filled out his Social Security form in 1937, he listed his middle name as Foghorn. He never corrected it. </p> <p>Some of the facts about the actor's early life seem accurate. He was born Walter Matuchanskayasky on October 1, 1920, in New York City to impoverished Russian-Jewish immigrants. </p> <p>The father left home when Walter was three. Walter and his older brother, Henry, lived with their mother, a garment worker, in a series of cold-water flats on the lower East Side. </p> <p>Young Walter showed a dramatic bent early, reading Shakespeare at 7 and reciting poems in school assemblies at 8. He was introduced to Yiddish plays at 11, when he sold soft drinks at 2nd Avenue theaters. He made occasional appearances onstage at 50 cents a performance. </p> <p>He was already 6-feet tall at 10 and weighed 90 pounds. \"When I drank cherry soda, I looked like a thermometer,'' he once cracked. </p> <p>Graduating from Seward Park High School during the Depression, he took government jobs - as a forester in Montana, gym instructor for the WPA, boxing coach for policemen. In the second world war he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and served as radio cryptographer in a heavy bomber unit in Europe. </p> <p>Matthau ended the war a sergeant with six battle stars and a fistful of money from poker winnings. Legends of his gambling followed him throughout his life. While making a TV series in Florida before his movie stardom, he lost $183,000 betting on spring-training baseball games. </p> <p>The actor himself made no effort to quash the legends and even contributed to them. In middle age he estimated his lifetime gambling losses at $5m.</p> <p>After release from the Air Corps in October 1945, Matthau enrolled in the dramatic workshop at New York's New School. Among his fellow students: Gene Saks, Rod Steiger, Harry Guardino, Tony Curtis. He stayed three years, living on the GI Bill and playing in regional stock during the summer. </p> <p>Matthau's first Broadway role came at the age of 28 when he was hired as understudy for the role of an 83-year-old English bishop in Anne of the Thousand Days, starring Rex Harrison. </p> <p>When the aged English actor playing the role became ill, Matthau went onstage without a rehearsal. He liked to tell the story of how the surprised Harrison looked at him and uttered an expletive. Matthau related: \"People in the audience began muttering to each other: 'Did he say Oh, spit!?\"' </p> <p>A series of flop plays followed, then Matthau hit a lucky streak with Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, Once More with Feeling and A Shot in the Dark. Hollywood took notice. </p> <p>His first film, The Kentuckian starring and directed by Burt Lancaster in 1955, cast him as a villain, and more heavy roles followed. Among the early films: King Creole (Elvis Presley), A Face in the Crowd (Andy Griffith), Lonely Are the Brave (Kirk Douglas), Charade (Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn). </p> <p>The Odd Couple and The Fortune Cookie elevated Matthau to stardom, and he enjoyed a wide variety of roles for more than 30 years. He appeared in action thrillers such as The Taking of Pelham One Two Three and The Laughing Policeman, and portrayed a US Supreme Court justice in First Monday in October. He even did a musical, Hello Dolly! costarring with Barbra Streisand, with whom he publicly feuded. </p> <p>He was always identified with comedy, something that rankled him. </p> <p>\"When people come up to me and say, 'Aren't you that comedian who's in the movies?' I want to throw up,'' he once complained. \"I throw up a lot.'' </p> <p>Matthau was often teamed with Lemmon, always as adversaries though they were best friends offscreen. Their films included: The Front Page, Buddy Buddy, Grumpier Old Men, Out to Sea.'</p> <p>He was most recently on screen with Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and Lisa Kudrow in Hanging Up, which was released in the UK in April. </p> <p>Matthau was married to Grace Geraldine Johnson from 1948 until their divorce in 1958. They had two children, David and Jenny. He married Carol Marcus in 1959, and they had one son, Charles, who became a film-maker, and directed his father in The Grass Harp in 1996. </p> <p>The actor survived several serious health setbacks during his career. While making The Fortune Cookie in 1966, he suffered a serious heart attack. His doctor attributed it to smoking three packs a day and constant worry about gambling, and told him to give up both. Matthau stopped smoking. </p> <p>In 1976, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in freezing Minnesota weather for Grumpy Old Men in 1993, he was hospitalized for double pneumonia. In December 1995 he had a colon tumor removed; it tested benign. </p> <p>He was also hospitalized in May 1999 for more than two months after another bout with pneumonia. </p> <p>Matthau attributed his various illnesses to his eating habits: \"If you eat only celery and lettuce, you won't get sick....

Since taking up his present post, Miles has been actively re-branding the group which sells cars from nearly new to five-years old - mostly ex-lease and rentals - at \"supermarket\" sites around the country. CarLand logbook: Originally the Concept group; employs 880 staff; 22,000 cars; \u00a3170m turnover; sites at Lakeside, Chertsey, Enfield, Cannock, Manchester and Glasgow with four more planned. \"It's very much a weekend business with most sales done on Saturdays and Sundays. We are a one-stop shop with finance and after-sales services and we adopt a 'drive away today' approach.\" Must-have qualities: \"CarLand as a company and the motor trade in general are fast-moving businesses which produce real pressure but offer the chance to progress quickly.\" Bottom rung Dominic Bovington Aged 27 Marketing executive CarLand Bottom rung A temp job with CarLand led to a staff post for former history and English student Dominic Bovington. \"When I left Exeter University I had no idea of what I wanted to do,\" he says. He thought about journalism but started work with a computer company - staying five years and becoming its transport co-ordinator. \"After that, I joined a recruitment agency but went temping again and found myself in CarLand's marketing section. This became permanent in May.\" Current role: Dominic collects the stats which form a weekly report on the performance of CarLand's ad campaigns in the press, magazines, TV and direct marketing. He is also computerising the marketing section's operations. Likes most? \"You can have an idea one day and see it in action the next.\" Dominic sees his next move in terms of consolidation. \"I want to build on the enormous learning curve I'm on.\" Tip for entrants: \"Graduates lacking a focused plan, but interested in areas such as the law or accountancy, will find lots of business opportunities with companies like CarLand.\" Useful links www.carland.co.uk",

The problem, he believes, is that older people in general are more difficult to pigeonhole. \"A lot of companies haven't quite found a way of assessing mature candidates,\" he explains. \"It's partly ageism. There are often misconceptions about older people fitting in and if the person is looking for a complete career change after their degree, employers can find it hard to believe that they're willing to start again from scratch.\" </p> <p>Graduate recruitment schemes and even application forms, he points out, also tend to be designed with younger graduates in mind. \"It's all very well asking someone in their 20s what they like to do in their spare time but if you ask a single mother of three who's just completed a degree part-time, she'll say, 'What spare time?'

I wouldn't have had the same discipline to study when I was younger and because I'm older, I've actually lived through some of the things we studied on the course. It's given me greater understanding.\" </p> <p>Despite his qualification and length of service, Atterbury still hasn't been promoted to management level. \"I'm disappointed,\" he says, \"especially as the company sponsored my degree. I think ageism comes into it but to be honest, I think they just don't know what to do with a middle-aged graduate. I couldn't join their graduate recruitment programme because that would mean moving to a different part of the country. I'm settled here and I've got a mortgage. Also, I'm a lot older than most graduates and I wouldn't really fit in.\" </p> <p>Many mature graduates find themselves similarly disillusioned when their new qualification fails to land them a dream job, says Gilleard. \"Unfortunately having a degree isn't a guarantee of anything these days. A lot of large companies don't have a hierarchical structure any more, so there are fewer management positions available. And some companies have early retirement policies which get in the way of hiring older people. </p> <p>\"Things are changing but it's a slow process,\" he continues. \"Employers are beginning to realise that we need a more tailored approach to accommodate more diverse applicants. But the most important thing is for people to take responsibility for their own career. There's nothing to be gained from bleating about your situation or you become a victim.\" </p> <p>Mature graduates, he advises, need to be doubly pushy to overcome people's preconceptions. \"You've got to market yourself properly.

But the fact remains that we are exposed to more information than any other generation. </p> <p>According to Richard Reeves, director of futures at the Industrial </p> <p>Society, this newspaper alone contains more data than the average 17th century person would have encountered during their entire lifetime. </p> <p>And it doesn't stop there. We are constantly being bombarded (and bombarding others) with all manner of multimedia messages. There are voicemails, emails, pagers, faxes, and any number of phone calls received from any number of fixed-line, analogue, digital - and now the ubiquitous Wap phone. </p> <p>There's internal post, external post, trade journals, specialist magazines and unlimited news services - available all day, every day if you are not into sleeping. Oh, and there's the internet as well. </p> <p>Gallup and the Institute For The Future recently calculated the number of communications an average British worker receives in an ordinary week. It numbers well over a 1,000. </p> <p>It is no wonder that in its annual Messaging Study, corporate mail specialists Pitney Bowes found that by the time some professions have responded to all of this information the best part of their day has already gone, with the \"real work\"being pushed into evenings and weekends. </p> <p> Medical research suggests the impact of all this is unhealthy. Information fatigue syndrome, as it has been called, can affect us physically and emotionally. Occupational psychologist professor Cary Cooper says it can cause eye strain, increased stress and RSI and can bring about tensions in our home life and personal relationships. </p> <p> According to David Lewis, author of Information Overload , the situation is not going to go away. So it is vital, he says, that we become better at managing it. </p> <p>So where do you start? It sounds basic, but learn to identify what really is important. Some items will scream out their relevance. Others will mumble their irrelevance. But distinguishing the vital from the marginal is not always obvious or easy. \"It helps, though, if you can be clear about the key responsibilities and objectives of your job\", says John Caunt in his book 30 Minutes To Manage Information Overload . \"Use them as a mental checklist against which you can match whatever information comes your way.\" You won't always make the right decision. But at least you'll be filtering out some of the \"data smog\", as David Shenk puts it in a book of the same name. </p> <p>Once you do clear a path for yourself, you need to move swiftly through what is still in front of you. So, be ruthless and systematic with each piece of information that you have decided to keep. Assign one of these four actions to it: </p> <p><strong> 1. </strong> Deal with immediately </p> <p><strong> 2.</strong> Deal with on a designated date </p> <p><strong> 3.</strong> Delegate to another person </p> <p><strong> 4.</strong> Deposit into some sort of logical retrieval system. </p> <p> To speed this process up further, look at developing improved information handling skills. These include scanning, speed reading, summarising, maximising your concentration span and expanding your memory capacity. The authors of Handling Information Overload In a Week point out that you should apply these skills to all sources of printed material - from company memos to annual reports to social emails. </p> <p>However efficient you become at managing information overload, whether the stuff is tangible or not, it will never stop coming at you if you don't block off some of the sources. Remove your name from mailing lists that have not yielded anything worthwhile. Cancel subscriptions to periodicals that have not produced much value in the past six months. </p> <p> Be discriminating with your details; don't just give them away to organisations or individuals who may just end up sending you junk. When sending emails, set an example as to how you'd like to be treated by 'cc-ing' only those people who actually need to be included. Also, if a reply is not required, indicate as much. This, says John Caunt, avoids the cycle of receiving unnecessary returns that you can then feel obliged to respond to, and on it goes. </p> <p>But addressing all this only goes part way to solving the problem. To completely deal with your information overload, you have to master that most overloaded of all information sources: the internet. We're all guilty of surfing, getting distracted by intriguing links and curious search results. Half an hour later we've led ourselves to an interesting but rather irrelevant destination. </p> <p> To get the most out of the web - at least when it comes to work related inquiries - you need to be focused and disciplined. It's boring, I know. But then so is working late because you didn't manage your time properly. It's best to keep your searches narrow and specific. It's best, too, to know when to stop looking. Remember the 80:20 rule where you get 80% of your results from 20% of your efforts. </p> <p>Now, more than ever, we live in an information age. And Wilde would probably maintain that we have still not become any wiser for it. Perhaps the most we can do is become wise about how we manage it. </p> <p> <strong>Still buried under a pile of email?</strong></p> <p>If you still find yourself deluged with information, it may be that you simply have far too much to do. If so, talk to your boss. To ensure the discussion goes well, author John Caunt suggests these dos and don'ts: </p> <p>Do raise the issue at an appropriate time - that is, when you are not up against it </p> <p>Do show that you understand your job's objectives </p> <p>Do show that you have already tried to overcome the problem </p> <p>Don't give the impression that you're just trying to get out of doing </p> <p>something </p> <p>Don't come across as either combative or apologetic </p> <p>Don't be bullish; be ready to reach a compromise</p>",

We're all guilty of surfing, getting distracted by intriguing links and curious search results. Half an hour later we've led ourselves to an interesting but rather irrelevant destination. To get the most out of the web - at least when it comes to work related inquiries - you need to be focused and disciplined. It's boring, I know. But then so is working late because you didn't manage your time properly. It's best to keep your searches narrow and specific. It's best, too, to know when to stop looking. Remember the 80:20 rule where you get 80% of your results from 20% of your efforts. Now, more than ever, we live in an information age. And Wilde would probably maintain that we have still not become any wiser for it. Perhaps the most we can do is become wise about how we manage it. Still buried under a pile of email? If you still find yourself deluged with information, it may be that you simply have far too much to do. If so, talk to your boss. To ensure the discussion goes well, author John Caunt suggests these dos and don'ts: Do raise the issue at an appropriate time - that is, when you are not up against it Do show that you understand your job's objectives Do show that you have already tried to overcome the problem Don't give the impression that you're just trying to get out of doing something Don't come across as either combative or apologetic Don't be bullish; be ready to reach a compromise",

      "body": "<p>For some, at least, it is all over now, bar the signing on the dotted line and wondering if they have made the right career decision. But at least they've got themselves a job. </p> <p>The graduate fair season is well underway, having started as far back as June 7 at Nottingham, and early reports suggest that for most graduates going to a fair has proved a successful move. </p> <p>Manchester, which this year had the largest number of exhibitors of all the fairs, says its event was considered a great success. More than 160 companies went on the head hunt at the Armitage Centre and all of them had jobs on offer - in fact, it was one of the conditions of entry. </p> <p>Graduates had even greater choice this year because the organisers arranged for different companies to set out their stalls on the two days. Manchester University Careers Service's Jan Hewitt says: \"We were extremely pleased. We had lots of wonderful comments from the exhibitors about the quality of students who attended.\" </p> <p> Organisers of graduate fairs are always concerned that the events will attract late-comers and no-hopers but with the change in the structure of the academic year, more of the 'high-flyers' are waiting until their second set of exams is over before they start on the serious business of finding a job. </p> <p>With more than 6,000 students going through the doors on the two days, number crunching is still going on but Hewitt says the feeling from students who turned up was positive. </p> <p>\"They believed it was a very useful format for meeting companies face to face.\" </p> <p>The average number of students that companies saw on the two days was 35 each and last week the first round of interviews for candidates was well under way. </p> <p>Birmingham, which ran its fair on June 21 and 22 also reports good feedback with an estimated 8,000 students turning up to a show which boasted more than 100 exhibitors. </p> <p>The fair is a joint enterprise between Birmingham and Aston universities and attracts specialist employers like pharmaceutical companies because of the range of courses studied in the city. </p> <p>Organisers Venture Marketing's Donald Nell says: \"There was a free coach service from around the country and at least 2,000 people made use of that this year.\" </p> <p>Like other fairs, Birmingham is open to all graduates and Nell estimates that at least half of the hopefuls through the doors at the NEC were from universities outside the city. </p> <p>As well as the exhibitors there were added-value attractions like the CV clinic which Birmingham University's careers service adviser Richard Maynard says was very popular.

      "bodyText": "For some, at least, it is all over now, bar the signing on the dotted line and wondering if they have made the right career decision. But at least they've got themselves a job. The graduate fair season is well underway, having started as far back as June 7 at Nottingham, and early reports suggest that for most graduates going to a fair has proved a successful move. Manchester, which this year had the largest number of exhibitors of all the fairs, says its event was considered a great success. More than 160 companies went on the head hunt at the Armitage Centre and all of them had jobs on offer - in fact, it was one of the conditions of entry. Graduates had even greater choice this year because the organisers arranged for different companies to set out their stalls on the two days. Manchester University Careers Service's Jan Hewitt says: \"We were extremely pleased. We had lots of wonderful comments from the exhibitors about the quality of students who attended.\" Organisers of graduate fairs are always concerned that the events will attract late-comers and no-hopers but with the change in the structure of the academic year, more of the 'high-flyers' are waiting until their second set of exams is over before they start on the serious business of finding a job. With more than 6,000 students going through the doors on the two days, number crunching is still going on but Hewitt says the feeling from students who turned up was positive. \"They believed it was a very useful format for meeting companies face to face.\" The average number of students that companies saw on the two days was 35 each and last week the first round of interviews for candidates was well under way. Birmingham, which ran its fair on June 21 and 22 also reports good feedback with an estimated 8,000 students turning up to a show which boasted more than 100 exhibitors. The fair is a joint enterprise between Birmingham and Aston universities and attracts specialist employers like pharmaceutical companies because of the range of courses studied in the city. Organisers Venture Marketing's Donald Nell says: \"There was a free coach service from around the country and at least 2,000 people made use of that this year.\" Like other fairs, Birmingham is open to all graduates and Nell estimates that at least half of the hopefuls through the doors at the NEC were from universities outside the city. As well as the exhibitors there were added-value attractions like the CV clinic which Birmingham University's careers service adviser Richard Maynard says was very popular. He sees graduate fairs as a chance for students who are uncertain about what career to pick to do some window shopping. \"People are using fairs for a variety of purposes and to test things out a bit,\" says Maynard. \"They like the chance to have a discussion with someone on how to present themselves. \"Employers felt it was worthwhile. They saw a reasonable number of people of good quality.\" Unusually, Birmingham is organised so that first interviews can take place on the spot. This year the six interview rooms were fully booked by companies which found enough good prospects to carry on with the hiring process. \"Some of the second-round interviews were taking place last week.\" says Nell.

      "body": "<p>Should you be reckless, feckless, fearless or a fool, yet capable of running like the wind after a night of wild abandon, there is only one place worth heading for this week, Pamplona in northern Spain, where the nine-day festival of San Fermin begins on Thursday. </p> <p>Described by Ernest Hemingway (who started the whole cult with his writings) as a \"wonderful nightmare\", San Fermin is of course best known for the encierro, the running of the bulls. Starting each morning at eight and finishing three minutes later, this consists of six snorting behemoths stampeding some 800 metres through the narrow streets of Pamplona from the church of Santo Domingo to the bullring, accompanied by hundreds of the world's most prized lunatics. During the day you can easily spot the latter, parading in their ripped T-shirts. </p> <p>As for the rest of us, after the cool refinement of the Guggenheim in Bilbao (two hours' drive away) the festival of San Fermin is still well worth a one- or two-night stopover. Even though Pamplona itself is no beauty, the nightly street parties and corridas , or bull fights, are played out in an atmosphere that, for me, forms a link between the ritual barbarity and spectacle of the Colosseum and the now defunct football terrace culture of Europe, pre-hooliganism; with boccadillas instead of burgers and barely a whiff of danger (to humans, at any rate). Call it licensed licentiousness or designer disorder if you must, but don't expect to be called for breakfast. </p> <p>I arrived half-way through last year's fiesta, and via the tourist office found a \u00a365 room (including parking, vital in the central area) in a gloomy but immaculate pension off the Plaza de la Cruz. The two old sisters who ran the place immediately tried to overcharge me. When I corrected their sums the dominant one pronounced me to be \" Muy listo !\" Very smart. What she was really saying, for her sister's benefit was, \"Just our luck, a Jew who can add up.\" </p> <p>Hoping to even the score, she said: \"You'll never get a ticket to the bullfight now. Never. The bullfights in Pamplona, it's like the World Cup. Sold out months ago.\" </p> <p>But she'd forgotten. I was muy listo . Outside the bullring (less ornate than the ones in Madrid or Seville but large enough for 20,000), I played the usual watching and waiting game, seeing who was buying, who was selling. But I didn't want just any ticket. Mine had to be for the andanada de sol ; that is, the cheap seats on the sol or sunny side of the bullring's upper tier, where the penas , or social clubs, gather with their booze and brass bands. </p> <p>Many of their members wear variations of the official uniform of San Fermin; white shirts and trousers set off rather rakishly by a scarlet panuelo , or neckerchief, and a red faja , or sash, tied round the waist; not dissimilar to the garb of the Young Communist League and, in common with so many of Pamplona's \"traditions\", a relatively recent adoption. More recent still is the San Fermin \"underpants race\", which starts at 3am in the city centre, with breaks for champagne and prizes for the dirtiest knickers. You get the picture. </p> <p>After quizzing various types who looked as if they knew their tauromachian onions (mostly Australians plus a few sober chaps from Sussex, wearing BHS casuals and unbranded trainers), I finally paid 3,000 pesetas to a tout, twice the official price but still cheaper than watching Premiership football. </p> <p>And off I went, an English lamb to the Sanfermines slaughter; an innocent with 19 years' experience of visiting and writing about stadiums; a tentative adventurer who had been to bullfights and bunfights all over the world. Had felt the hot breath of the mob, in Manchester, in Mexico, in Milan. </p> <p>But the next three hours at the Plaza de Toros in Pamplona? No, this was different. </p> <p>Nowadays, being drunk and disorderly would bar one's admittance to most stadiums. In most parts of the world, taking any glass bottle into a sports venue is forbidden (except at English cricket, where the gatemen search you only to check on the vintage). In Pamplona, my single bottle of plonk - my one, oh-so-daring, aren't I being naughty with my little 70cl accompaniment - was enough to mark me out as a total mummy's boy. </p> <p>The pena pals in Section 11 could hardly have been more welcoming, nevertheless. \" Inglaterra ?\" they asked, making room amid the travelling off-licence strewn across the concrete benches. I don't mean bottles here, by the way; I'm talking buckets. Big buckets. Actually, vats. All full to the brim with sangria and another popular local lubricant, calimocho - a mix of rough Rioja and Coke, designed to keep you happy and peppy and a little bit burpy all at the same time. </p> <p>By the time the first bull had met his maker - an act met with silence from the aficionados below us, owing, quite literally, to its clumsy execution by the matador - my paltry bottle was empty, my back drenched from showers of sangria, and my hat covered in flour. But it could have been worse. In other sections the lads were throwing yellow dye and soggy fruit. </p> <p>Strangers' arms and even stranger armpits soon locked me in their clawing, intimate embrace. Shoulders entwined, swaying left, swaying right. Rowing forward, rowing back. Standing up, crouching down. Each time to a chant. \" Las Chicas, Las Chicas, yeh, yeh, yeh .\" This matador has cojones . That one's mother is a puta . Long Live San Fermin. Fuck the Madrile\u00f1os . Hijos de Putas , the lot of them. To the left, a brass band. To the right a brass band. \"Yeh, yeh, yeh.\" </p> <p>Stereophonic discordance and the microwave sun were soon making me pig sick and roasted in the middle, until at last my compa\u00f1eros turned their attention to some girls newly arrived in our section. </p> <p>\" Chicitas !\" went up the cry. And in T-shirts! </p> <p>In an instant, cups, bottles and beakers were refilled and then emptied with ferocious precision until hardly a dry bosom remained in the aisle. </p> <p>But then came another diversion. From the vomitory down to our right, up popped up the head of a diminutive, elderly Japanese man, wielding an expensive camera, a tripod and an inquisitive expression. I'm not sure what the Spanish is for \"sitting duck\". But it hardly mattered since the lads immediately tried to engage him in Japanese. </p> <p>\"Ka-mi-ka-ze, ka-mi-ka-ze!\" they chanted, before unleashing their own Pearl Harbor in bucket loads. I saw the man glance up in our direction, open mouthed, at the exact moment before a wave of sangria cruelly lashed his torso. A knife-wielding assassin leaping out of a potted palm could hardly have provoked in him a more startled expression. </p> <p>\" Ol\u00e9 !\" cried the aficionados, applauding the matador now in the ring. (I really should have been paying more attention, though I knew the score. It read, Humans 3, Bulls 0.) </p> <p>Back in our bibulous bedlam, meanwhile, the Japanese man saw his chance and with surprising agility managed to duck and weave like an infantryman dodging fire, along the aisle into the safety of the next vomitory, down to our left. A lull ensued. </p> <p>But only momentarily, for a few seconds later, from out of the vomitory on our right, up popped another head. That of a diminutive, ageing Japanese woman. The wife. This time I had to look away as the bombardment was renewed. Poor woman. Poor man. Such tales of Europe they would take home with them. Such barbarity they had encountered. Such disrespect for the elderly. Such dry-cleaning bills. </p> <p>And then it was time for the merienda (the half-time break). We fell back onto our concrete benches. </p> <p>Next to me, a leary-eyed man of 50 or so with a cold-box the size of a small car, pulled out an unmarked bottle and winked in delight. A sideways flick of his wrist and my plastic cup ranneth over. </p> <p>I stared unsteadily down into its oily depths as my new amigo began to toast \" La Reina Ay-lee-za-bet !\" Another mouthful of alcohol and my head would have spun away. </p> <p>\" La Reina !

From beneath the sleeves of his kushma protruded bundles of fragrant charapu\u00f1amemba leaves. Rows of tiny gold and coloured beads circled his neck. On his chest, a long string of peccary and jaguar teeth jaggedly proclaimed his prowess as a hunter. Parrot feathers speared his nose and earlobes. His crown, a multi-coloured flurry of toucan, macaw and humming-bird plumes, cascaded down his back beneath an iridescent band of green and blue beetle wings. He looked splendid. </p> <p>Anastasio is an elder of the Cof\u00e1n, one of the smallest of the five indigenous groups that live in the Cuyabeno Reserve - 650,000 hectares of virgin rainforest deep in the heart of the Ecuadorian jungle. </p> <p>No theme park, this. It had taken us six steaming and juddering hours from Quito by plane, bus and powerboat to reach this untouched corner of the world. We had slalomed for three hours across the bubbling brown waters of the Aguarico river, avoiding the submerged trees and shallows of the dry season: 120km of snaking brown bordered by dense, relentless, hypnotic green, to our \"hotel\" - a converted river boat; a haven with a bar and cold beer. </p> <p>We gathered round in the 40C heat, sweltering and ridiculous in protective long trousers and gumboots while Anastasio anointed us, Indian-style, with decorative red dye from the atoche plant. Thus prepared for our jungle trek, we set off, Anastasio pausing to collect a machete and replace his head-dress with a filthy Nike baseball cap. </p> <p>Not for the first time, I wondered what an arachnophobe such as myself (phobe, for that matter, of all things creeping or slithering) was doing in a jungle. There is, after all, little to do here other than admire nature in her miraculous diversity. I thought of the deadly f er de lance and coral snakes (hence, the wellies); of the tree boas that lie camouflaged in the branches and drop on to their prey . . . </p> <p>Too late: we were already beneath the thick green canopy that dulled the sun, gingerly picking our way in single file through the tangle of roots, stepping over fallen trees, avoiding towering termite nests and trailing lianas, and pausing to give right of way to the serried ranks of leaf-cutter ants that marched beneath their green parasols with military discipline. </p> <p>Jaguars were sighted seven times here in the last year. More commonly, this is the stomping ground of the world's largest rodent, the capybara, as well as monkeys, tapir, armadillo and peccary (a local version of wild boar with inverted incisors), which are hunted for food. </p> <p>Anastasio showed us the canalete tree, from which blowpipes are made. Soon, he stopped again, hacking with his machete at a palm which, within seconds, he had whittled down to a needle-fine dart. The reddish bark of a nearby tree yielded curare, the poison with which the dart would be tipped. But, explained Anastasio with his gappy grin, it takes a lot of puff to kill a monkey at 50 metres with a 2m blow pipe. Training is required. So at 14, boys are taken into the forest and made to gorge on emetic plants. Vomiting, we are told, strengthens the diaphragm. Overhead, squirrel monkeys screeched on cue, and a pair of macaws took flight. </p> <p>The multifarious uses to which flora is put is a revelation - from clothing and household utensils to medicine. To the unearthly ostinato of screaming pihas and howler monkeys, Anastasio pointed out some of the 2,500 species of curative plants - among these, cordia nodosa , which when boiled makes an all-purpose anti-snake-bite serum, brownea, which is used as a contraceptive, and the pungent bark of a tree that saved the Cofans from a measles epidemic brought by missionaries. </p> <p>We stopped beneath a massive capok tree, whose roots are considered the home of the Gods. Here the shamans come to take the hallucinogenic ayahuasca and consort with the spirits. It is also the home of the devil Cocuya and children are warned to keep away. </p> <p>Anastasio told us how two of his grandchildren ventured too close to the capok and were found dead. He shrugged philosophically: \"Cocuya took them.\" So much for the teaching of the missionaries. </p> <p> T here are 526 species of birds in the Napo basin alone. The best way to spot them is by floating silently down-river, neck craned heavenward. Silvestro, an Indian of the Quichua tribe sporting a T-shirt with the legend \"Death Ride\", was to be our guide through the dappled backwaters of the Cuyabeno, beneath which lurk cayman, sting-ray and piranha. We transferred to his catamaran: two dug-out canoes ingeniously joined by rows of benches, and propelled by his four daughters, an apocalyptic paddle at each point of our craft. </p> <p>As we floated through the reflected trees the only sounds were those of our own ripples, the distinctive glissando of the oropendola bird and Silvestro's shrieks of excitement as he spotted a rare harpy eagle. A balletic school of pink dolphin accompanied us into a tranquil pool, at which Silvestro's four daughters suddenly jumped overboard, leaving us rudderless. Come and swim, they said, the water's lovely. Oh, and by the way, this is the Lagoon of the Anacondas . . . </p> <p>It doesn't come much wilder than this; not with hot-and-cold running water, anyway. Safely back on our floating hotel as the light began to fade, the barman prepared a mosquito-repelling cocktail of pisco sour, and the insects prepared to burst into their nocturnal song. Their sounds were so beautiful that even I began to look forward to this nightly eruption of bug life. As aversion therapy goes, I would count this a major success.</p>",

But, explained Anastasio with his gappy grin, it takes a lot of puff to kill a monkey at 50 metres with a 2m blow pipe. Training is required. So at 14, boys are taken into the forest and made to gorge on emetic plants. Vomiting, we are told, strengthens the diaphragm. Overhead, squirrel monkeys screeched on cue, and a pair of macaws took flight. The multifarious uses to which flora is put is a revelation - from clothing and household utensils to medicine. To the unearthly ostinato of screaming pihas and howler monkeys, Anastasio pointed out some of the 2,500 species of curative plants - among these, cordia nodosa , which when boiled makes an all-purpose anti-snake-bite serum, brownea, which is used as a contraceptive, and the pungent bark of a tree that saved the Cofans from a measles epidemic brought by missionaries. We stopped beneath a massive capok tree, whose roots are considered the home of the Gods. Here the shamans come to take the hallucinogenic ayahuasca and consort with the spirits. It is also the home of the devil Cocuya and children are warned to keep away. Anastasio told us how two of his grandchildren ventured too close to the capok and were found dead. He shrugged philosophically: \"Cocuya took them.\" So much for the teaching of the missionaries. T here are 526 species of birds in the Napo basin alone. The best way to spot them is by floating silently down-river, neck craned heavenward. Silvestro, an Indian of the Quichua tribe sporting a T-shirt with the legend \"Death Ride\", was to be our guide through the dappled backwaters of the Cuyabeno, beneath which lurk cayman, sting-ray and piranha. We transferred to his catamaran: two dug-out canoes ingeniously joined by rows of benches, and propelled by his four daughters, an apocalyptic paddle at each point of our craft. As we floated through the reflected trees the only sounds were those of our own ripples, the distinctive glissando of the oropendola bird and Silvestro's shrieks of excitement as he spotted a rare harpy eagle. A balletic school of pink dolphin accompanied us into a tranquil pool, at which Silvestro's four daughters suddenly jumped overboard, leaving us rudderless. Come and swim, they said, the water's lovely. Oh, and by the way, this is the Lagoon of the Anacondas . . . It doesn't come much wilder than this; not with hot-and-cold running water, anyway. Safely back on our floating hotel as the light began to fade, the barman prepared a mosquito-repelling cocktail of pisco sour, and the insects prepared to burst into their nocturnal song. Their sounds were so beautiful that even I began to look forward to this nightly eruption of bug life. As aversion therapy goes, I would count this a major success.",

      "body": "<p>It's a sad fact that mountain bikes sold in this country never negotiate anything more demanding than a kerb or canal bank, yet across the Channel is some of the finest off-roading in the world, and you don't even have to ride up any mountains to enjoy it. </p> <p>Increasing numbers of ski resorts in both the Alps and the Pyrenees now allow mountain bikers to use their lifts in the summer to enjoy the fun of descending without the agony of climbing. And you don't even have to be a particularly brilliant or committed mountain biker to enjoy the high life. </p> <p>For instance, there are more than 70km of marked trails running down from the Pyrenees resort of Superbagn\u00e8res to the spa town of Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon, south-west of Toulouse. These are graded in a similar fashion to ski runs, from \"easy\" green - some are used by family and novice groups - to the progressively harder blue, red and black runs, which may involve some climbing - \"some\" meaning anything from 280m to 900m. </p> <p>There's nothing comparable in the UK - the size of the mountains, the summer climate allowing you to ride at altitudes of almost 2,000m on a good day in shorts and T-shirt, and descents that seem to go on forever. </p> <p>As for safety concerns, accidents are not as common as you might expect. On my last visit to the Pyrenees, out of 11 bikers blasting down the trails for three days we had only one casualty, the result of a fall after a tree root inexplicably leapt out of the ground and into the path of an oncoming front wheel. </p> <p>On this particular visit, I was staying with Pyractif, a small company based just north of Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon, in the village of Bertren. Their routes are generally aimed at experienced and fit mountain bikers, although as Steve Mead, who runs Pyractif with his wife Brenda, says, \"We will take beginners as long as we can fit them in with others of a similar ability.\" </p> <p>Steve and Brenda are committed mountain bikers who moved to the Pyrenees from the Midlands eight years ago. They run guided holidays on the trails around their home. </p> <p>Experienced mountain bikers may balk at the idea of being guided, but the local maps show many potential trails that may turn out to be impassable (too steep, too rocky, too boggy). So having a guide is the only sure-fire way of ensuring you get to ride all day on the best routes. A local guide book is another option, provided you can read French and there's one available for the area - which isn't always the case. </p> <p>Pyractif does not focus just on downhilling. The first day starts easily enough from the ski station at Superbagn\u00e8res and features an afternoon of hurtling downhill, but the following days require you to pay your dues - great trails, brilliant descents, but you have to climb to get to them. </p> <p>The highlight (or possibly the low point, depending on your point of view) comes with an ascent of the 1,349m Col de Mente, a 10km climb that regularly features in the Tour de France. The Tour riders ascend it in around 35 minutes - it took me an hour longer, but then I did have the excuse of being on a heavier, knobbly-tyred mountain bike. Arriving at the top, drenched in sweat and gasping like an Everest mountaineer, it was good to know that from here the only way was down. </p> <p>Swooping through pine-scented forests on pristine single track, scraping around hairpin dirt tracks in a cloud of dust, splashing through streams and even stopping occasionally to admire the peaks and glaciers that delineate the Spanish border was summed up by a companion, who described it as \"like being on a huge fairground ride - only better, and cheaper\". </p> <p><strong> The resort</strong><br> </p> <p> There's a ski lift from the centre of Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon up to Superbagn\u00e8res (Ffr25 per ride with bike), which is open every day from June 18 - September 10, and weekends only from September 16 - October 15. You can pick up a small \"piste map\" of the mountain-bike trails free from the lift kiosk, but it gives only a vague idea of the routes. You have to watch for way-markers once you're on the trails, but these are easy to follow. </p> <p>There's also a free Guide des Circuits de VTT (Velo Tout Terrain) available from the Tourist Office at 18, all\u00e9e d'Etigny, Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon (0033 561 792 121) or at Superbagn\u00e8res (0033 561 793 636) but again, this is not particularly easy to follow and you need to understand French to use it. </p> <p>It would be a mistake, however, to think that every route here is full-on downhill - many do involve a certain amount of climbing, but this is negligible in comparison to the descending. Typical route distances are from 14km-21km, 90% or more of which will be downhill. Do enough of this and your upper body will be aching the next day if you're not used to it. Forearms and shoulders in particular take a hammering, soaking up the bumps and bounces. </p> <p>One of the great things about biking here is that virtually every route finishes in Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon, which allows you to stop for lunch at one of the many street caf\u00e9s, or for a quick beer before hopping back on the lift. </p> <p>There are also plenty of good-value restaurants in Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon, and we also ate in the small town of Loures-Barousse near Bertren, where an excellent five-course meal with wine at the friendly Le Terminus restaurant costs Ffr95. </p> <p>After a ride, soothe away the rigours of life in the saddle at Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon's thermal baths, where you can enjoy every thing from lounging around in the somewhat smelly, sulphurous water to a much-needed massage. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> Superbagn\u00e8res sits in a col beneath 3,000m peaks, the summits of which are snow-covered year-round. There are superb views down to Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon and of the surrounding countryside. </p> <p>The area is often visited by the Tour de France (this year, stage 11 begins at nearby Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre). The region is on the border, so a trip to Spain is easy, while Andorra is also within reach. </p> <p><strong> The gear</strong><br> </p> <p> You'll need a good-quality mountain bike to handle the trails - look at \u00a3350 upwards as a minimum starting price for a decent model. Ideally, you should have full suspension to soak up the bumps and reduce the beating your upper body can take after several long descents. </p> <p>There's an English-speaking bike shop in Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon (Liberty Cycles, 82, avenue Mar\u00e9chal Foch) if you need spares or repairs. Bikes with front suspension can be hired from Virgule 7, 4 place du Comminges, Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon (0033 561 790 197). </p> <p>You'll also need a helmet, cycling gloves to prevent grazing your hands if you fall, padded cycling shorts (for obvious reasons), a fleece top and leggings, and a waterproof/windproof top - even in summer the weather can be cold and wet in the mountains. </p> <p>Cycle shoes are useful as they provide a more stable platform for your feet, and most experienced riders will have \"clip-in\" pedals that give them more control over the bike, although they can be tricky to extricate yourself from if you have a fall. </p> <p>You'll also need to carry plenty of drinking water, especially if you choose to ascend as well as descend the mountains. In summer, it can be hot and you need to ensure you don't suffer from dehydration. Ensure that you drink regularly before, during and after your ride. </p> <p>A tool kit, puncture repair kit and spare inner tubes are also vital as punctures are common in this terrain. It's also worth taking a basic first-aid kit and sun cream.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first law of public houses states that, more often than not, the quality of a hostelry is inversely proportional to its location. In other words, the riverside pub is rarely the best bar in town. That said, the inns and taverns that line the Thames from Gloucestershire to the East End of London are invariably worthy of study for their historical associations. And what better way to study them than at first hand? Beginning with the Thames Head Inn at Kemble near Cirencester, Mark Turner meanders from Cotswolds to Docklands, stopping off at more than 150 pubs along the way. These range from stone-roofed coaching inns to stuccoed gin palaces. It is a narrative peopled with monarchs and eccentrics, boatmen and bankers, dockers and seamen. And alongside it are the author's excellent photographs, which provide a visual feast.",

      "body": "<p>They say the classic way to arrive in Las Vegas is by road at night, getting the full blast of the neon glow in the desert. But flying in daytime is hard to beat. After hundreds of miles of baking wilderness and badlands, within a circle of bone-dry mountains, rise the glinting ramparts of Sin City, a collection of giant playthings tossed out on to the desert floor. </p> <p>I flew in with Virgin on its first direct flight from London to Las Vegas, Wedding Capital of the world. My son was to be married by Elvis and I was feeling emotional. </p> <p>Even without my personal agenda, Vegas is a transfixing experience. It's like the first time in America over again, stepping into an unashamedly weird movie set you've known for years. </p> <p>It's a grown-up's Disneyworld. Themed hotels create cartoon worlds - Caesar's Rome, the Pharoahs' Egypt, New York's New York, a full volcanic eruption, a gondola ride along the Grand Canal in Venice, a view from Paris' Eiffel Tower over elegant Tuscan dancing fountains. </p> <p>A coach guide said proudly \"Where else in the world can you see Paris and Rome and Venice and medieval England?\" </p> <p>Someone grunted: \"Europe?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, but all in one place.\" Can't argue with that. </p> <p>This time we stayed in the nouveau gentility of the Four Seasons, promoting itself as a casino-free haven of peace for the discerning. </p> <p>Far from savoring the serenity, I was overwhelmed by it as I hit the elevator. Whisked up serenely to the 39th floor in a golden box that whispered like a desert wind. I couldn't stop myself breaking into Gram Parsons' apocalyptic Sin City - \"This old town's filled with sin/ It'll swallow you in/ If you've got some money to burn/ Take it home right away/ You've got three years to pay/ Even Satan is waiting his turn.\" </p> <p>I relished the final fitting lines: \"On the 31st floor, a gold-plated door/ Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain.\" </p> <p>Went down well with my wealthy elevator chums. </p> <p>For all its serenity, the Four Seasons has a back door into Mandalay Bay's casino. With hard-to-find exit signs, no windows and no clocks, it is easy to lose yourself, your sense of time, and your money in the casinos. </p> <p>They pump them full of oxygen to keep you awake. They bring you free drinks whether you are on the high-roller tables or the nickel slot machines. So you stay bright enough to lift your hand and throw your money away, and drunk enough not to care. Brilliant. </p> <p>In Rio's casino, a carnival salsas away in galleons sailing over your head as you mindlessly feed the slots. </p> <p>I've never won at gambling. Last year, I backed the loser in a two-horse race. But in the casino capital of the world, I had to check my luck. I heard that the slots in Paris paid the best, but I never made it out of Binion's in time. </p> <p>They cleared me out in three hours. Time for a stroll downtown, to see the Fremont Street lightshow and the classic old Vegas neon Cowboy, more the real Vegas than the theme-park arrivistes down the Strip. </p> <p>There are two ways of eating in Vegas, in expensive restaurants or in the fabled buffets. As you might have guessed, Vegas is Buffet Capital of the world. Round Table buffet in Excalibur, Pharoah's Pheast in the Luxor - these are massive affairs with mountains of everything from sushi to Mongolian hot-pot, fantasy food, shrimp the size of your fist, steaks as big as your head, four kinds of melons, 20 kinds of berries. You can eat yourself stupid for $9 to $14. </p> <p>Me, I like the oxygen bars like Breathe where you strap on nasal cannulae for higher-than-casino levels of God's own energy. </p> <p>Vegas is also statistics capital of the world, some more meaningless than you could imagine, like two talk ing camels in the Luxor pyramid who said: \"If you unravelled all the telephone wires in the Luxor, they would stretch to the moon.\" Can we believe this? </p> <p>One statistic is indisputable. Forty million people came to Vegas last year, many, like my son Mat, to get married. No wonder there are Wedding Chapels round every corner, in every hotel. No wonder you can get married in a helicopter over the Strip, down the Grand Canyon, in your car in a drive-through chapel, or sky-diving, hurtling desert-wards with a para-minister. </p> <p>June is wedding month of the year. White-veiled brides are ducking through the hotel casinos. Rebecca, my prospective daughter-in-law, insisted the only way she'd marry Mat was if Elvis conducted the service in Vegas. </p> <p>So here we all were with the happy couple and little Duncan, nearly one year old, packed into the white superstretch limo, duded out in serious pink and black polyesters and sky-blue Crimplenes. We were ready for the young peoples' moment of destiny with The King, the Elvis himself who had married Oasis' Noel Gallagher. </p> <p>Our package included limo and video, three songs and 24 poses by Elvis. We went for white Vegas flared rather than black leather Elvis. More matrimonial. More apt. </p> <p>The Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel sits by the Thunderbird Motel. Outside was the pink Cadillac convertible with Elvis number plates. Our man was taking no prisoners. </p> <p>Suddenly Elvis was there. He was a great, if skinny version of the megacolon burger boy of the later Vegas years. He is Ron DeCar, \"the most sought after soloist in the Las Vegas wedding industry\". With a fine black-quiffed mullet, state-of-the-art Elvis jumpsuit and a big mouthful of orthodontics, Ron couldn't lose. \"Thank you very much,\" he kept saying to the previous party in rich Elvisian tones. </p> <p>After a run through we're ready. Now, you readers may cavil about dignity and suchlike, but let me tell you there was nothing more inspiring than walking my boy down the aisle, both in contrasting pink and black - Elvis's favourite colours - with gold Elvis shades and Elvis up there singing: \"Wise men say/ Only fools rush in . . .\" </p> <p>You see, pertinent again, fools do rush in. Vegas always on the button. Aptness capital of the world. The wedding vows rolled off Elvis's tongue: \"You promise never to wear your blue suede shoes in the rain. And to be each other's Teddy Bear.\" </p> <p>\"I'm gonna tear it up, Elvis,\" said Mat. </p> <p>\"And you promise never to spend a Blue Christmas apart.\" </p> <p>Elvis was rocking. Smiling and sneering simultaneously, he broke into an unsolicited version of Hawaian Wedding Song. He seemed to enjoy his rich baritone as much as we did. His leg shook. We were swaying along, shouting encouragement to him and the young couple. </p> <p>After the vows, Elvis did his two-pronged stage point at each of them, passed the rings, and then uttered the magic words: \"By the powers invested in me by The King, Uh, I now pronounce you man and wife, man.\" </p> <p>This moment transcended its own virtual reality. My gold shades moistened from inside. </p> <p>Suddenly, Elvis lashed into Viva Las Vegas, and everyone danced and sang mightily round the newly weds. </p> <p>In the Bridal Room, a real minister rattled off a 40-second \"by the powers vested in me\" wedding and Mat paid her, adding a $5 tip. </p> <p>\"You tip ministers here?\" </p> <p>\"You do in Vegas,\" said Mat. </p> <p>Elvis sidled over to me with a free wedding cake, a frothy confection of white, peach and green. \"I want them to have this, sir. Thank you very much.\" I thanked Elvis for his cake and posed with him by the Cadillac. </p> <p>Time for the reception, and as luck would have it Rebecca's friend is daughter of a high roller who let us use his stupendous suite at Caesar's Palace which had just been savagely downsized to . . . five jacuzzis. It was perfect Vegas opulence, just like a movie set. In fact, needless to say in this town, it was a movie set, hence it's title: the \"Rainman\" suite. </p> <p>When you're rich everything is free, so our man wasn't paying a penny for this extravagance. As a valued high-roller, $20,000 a pop, he was an RFB, paying for no Room, Food or Beverage, pampered by Caesar's Palace to an imperial extreme. </p> <p>Two vast billboards on the Wedding Capital's Strip caught my eye: \"Vasectomy Reversal - Money Back Guarantee\", \"Free Viagra: Consultation $4.95\". Apt again. All covered. </p> <p>Vegas doesn't disappoint, but words are meagre, insipid things to describe this madness. Drumming my fingers between my lips and burbling would better cover it. </p> <p>I'm going back. </p> <p>Nothing can be as emotional as this weekend but there's much more to see. </p> <p>I've always maintained it's better to have bad taste than to taste bad. Vegas makes this flesh. Wet 'n Wild water park poses the quintessential Vegas question: \"Ever wonder what it feels to be flushed down the toilet?\" Their answer is a huge 45mph salad spinner whose centre opens and sucks you out. They call it the Royal Flush. Says it all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They say the classic way to arrive in Las Vegas is by road at night, getting the full blast of the neon glow in the desert. But flying in daytime is hard to beat. After hundreds of miles of baking wilderness and badlands, within a circle of bone-dry mountains, rise the glinting ramparts of Sin City, a collection of giant playthings tossed out on to the desert floor. I flew in with Virgin on its first direct flight from London to Las Vegas, Wedding Capital of the world. My son was to be married by Elvis and I was feeling emotional. Even without my personal agenda, Vegas is a transfixing experience. It's like the first time in America over again, stepping into an unashamedly weird movie set you've known for years. It's a grown-up's Disneyworld. Themed hotels create cartoon worlds - Caesar's Rome, the Pharoahs' Egypt, New York's New York, a full volcanic eruption, a gondola ride along the Grand Canal in Venice, a view from Paris' Eiffel Tower over elegant Tuscan dancing fountains. A coach guide said proudly \"Where else in the world can you see Paris and Rome and Venice and medieval England?\" Someone grunted: \"Europe?\" \"Yes, but all in one place.\" Can't argue with that. This time we stayed in the nouveau gentility of the Four Seasons, promoting itself as a casino-free haven of peace for the discerning. Far from savoring the serenity, I was overwhelmed by it as I hit the elevator. Whisked up serenely to the 39th floor in a golden box that whispered like a desert wind. I couldn't stop myself breaking into Gram Parsons' apocalyptic Sin City - \"This old town's filled with sin/ It'll swallow you in/ If you've got some money to burn/ Take it home right away/ You've got three years to pay/ Even Satan is waiting his turn.\" I relished the final fitting lines: \"On the 31st floor, a gold-plated door/ Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain.\" Went down well with my wealthy elevator chums. For all its serenity, the Four Seasons has a back door into Mandalay Bay's casino. With hard-to-find exit signs, no windows and no clocks, it is easy to lose yourself, your sense of time, and your money in the casinos. They pump them full of oxygen to keep you awake. They bring you free drinks whether you are on the high-roller tables or the nickel slot machines. So you stay bright enough to lift your hand and throw your money away, and drunk enough not to care. Brilliant. In Rio's casino, a carnival salsas away in galleons sailing over your head as you mindlessly feed the slots. I've never won at gambling. Last year, I backed the loser in a two-horse race. But in the casino capital of the world, I had to check my luck. I heard that the slots in Paris paid the best, but I never made it out of Binion's in time. They cleared me out in three hours. Time for a stroll downtown, to see the Fremont Street lightshow and the classic old Vegas neon Cowboy, more the real Vegas than the theme-park arrivistes down the Strip. There are two ways of eating in Vegas, in expensive restaurants or in the fabled buffets. As you might have guessed, Vegas is Buffet Capital of the world. Round Table buffet in Excalibur, Pharoah's Pheast in the Luxor - these are massive affairs with mountains of everything from sushi to Mongolian hot-pot, fantasy food, shrimp the size of your fist, steaks as big as your head, four kinds of melons, 20 kinds of berries. You can eat yourself stupid for $9 to $14. Me, I like the oxygen bars like Breathe where you strap on nasal cannulae for higher-than-casino levels of God's own energy. Vegas is also statistics capital of the world, some more meaningless than you could imagine, like two talk ing camels in the Luxor pyramid who said: \"If you unravelled all the telephone wires in the Luxor, they would stretch to the moon.\" Can we believe this? One statistic is indisputable. Forty million people came to Vegas last year, many, like my son Mat, to get married. No wonder there are Wedding Chapels round every corner, in every hotel. No wonder you can get married in a helicopter over the Strip, down the Grand Canyon, in your car in a drive-through chapel, or sky-diving, hurtling desert-wards with a para-minister. June is wedding month of the year. White-veiled brides are ducking through the hotel casinos. Rebecca, my prospective daughter-in-law, insisted the only way she'd marry Mat was if Elvis conducted the service in Vegas. So here we all were with the happy couple and little Duncan, nearly one year old, packed into the white superstretch limo, duded out in serious pink and black polyesters and sky-blue Crimplenes. We were ready for the young peoples' moment of destiny with The King, the Elvis himself who had married Oasis' Noel Gallagher. Our package included limo and video, three songs and 24 poses by Elvis. We went for white Vegas flared rather than black leather Elvis. More matrimonial. More apt. The Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel sits by the Thunderbird Motel. Outside was the pink Cadillac convertible with Elvis number plates. Our man was taking no prisoners. Suddenly Elvis was there. He was a great, if skinny version of the megacolon burger boy of the later Vegas years. He is Ron DeCar, \"the most sought after soloist in the Las Vegas wedding industry\". With a fine black-quiffed mullet, state-of-the-art Elvis jumpsuit and a big mouthful of orthodontics, Ron couldn't lose. \"Thank you very much,\" he kept saying to the previous party in rich Elvisian tones. After a run through we're ready. Now, you readers may cavil about dignity and suchlike, but let me tell you there was nothing more inspiring than walking my boy down the aisle, both in contrasting pink and black - Elvis's favourite colours - with gold Elvis shades and Elvis up there singing: \"Wise men say/ Only fools rush in . . .\" You see, pertinent again, fools do rush in. Vegas always on the button. Aptness capital of the world. The wedding vows rolled off Elvis's tongue: \"You promise never to wear your blue suede shoes in the rain. And to be each other's Teddy Bear.\" \"I'm gonna tear it up, Elvis,\" said Mat. \"And you promise never to spend a Blue Christmas apart.\" Elvis was rocking. Smiling and sneering simultaneously, he broke into an unsolicited version of Hawaian Wedding Song. He seemed to enjoy his rich baritone as much as we did. His leg shook. We were swaying along, shouting encouragement to him and the young couple. After the vows, Elvis did his two-pronged stage point at each of them, passed the rings, and then uttered the magic words: \"By the powers invested in me by The King, Uh, I now pronounce you man and wife, man.\" This moment transcended its own virtual reality. My gold shades moistened from inside. Suddenly, Elvis lashed into Viva Las Vegas, and everyone danced and sang mightily round the newly weds. In the Bridal Room, a real minister rattled off a 40-second \"by the powers vested in me\" wedding and Mat paid her, adding a $5 tip. \"You tip ministers here?\" \"You do in Vegas,\" said Mat. Elvis sidled over to me with a free wedding cake, a frothy confection of white, peach and green. \"I want them to have this, sir. Thank you very much.\" I thanked Elvis for his cake and posed with him by the Cadillac. Time for the reception, and as luck would have it Rebecca's friend is daughter of a high roller who let us use his stupendous suite at Caesar's Palace which had just been savagely downsized to . . . five jacuzzis. It was perfect Vegas opulence, just like a movie set. In fact, needless to say in this town, it was a movie set, hence it's title: the \"Rainman\" suite. When you're rich everything is free, so our man wasn't paying a penny for this extravagance. As a valued high-roller, $20,000 a pop, he was an RFB, paying for no Room, Food or Beverage, pampered by Caesar's Palace to an imperial extreme. Two vast billboards on the Wedding Capital's Strip caught my eye: \"Vasectomy Reversal - Money Back Guarantee\", \"Free Viagra: Consultation $4.95\". Apt again. All covered. Vegas doesn't disappoint, but words are meagre, insipid things to describe this madness. Drumming my fingers between my lips and burbling would better cover it. I'm going back. Nothing can be as emotional as this weekend but there's much more to see. I've always maintained it's better to have bad taste than to taste bad. Vegas makes this flesh. Wet 'n Wild water park poses the quintessential Vegas question: \"Ever wonder what it feels to be flushed down the toilet?\" Their answer is a huge 45mph salad spinner whose centre opens and sucks you out. They call it the Royal Flush. Says it all.",

Advantage has created a common site with links to individual members (www.advantage4travel.com). In this way, each will benefit from a central pool of expertise. Customers accessing it will be directed to their local consortium agent, who will earn commission from most online bookings. But they will also be able to enter the specific kind of holiday they want - and be connected to a specialist. They will receive e-mail advising them of special deals in their field of interest and eventually bid for flights and holidays at auction. The risks of consumers arranging their own holidays on the internet was also addressed at the conference. Yet it may prove to be one of the small agent's strongest lifelines. Consumer organisations are often scathing about the lack of knowledge displayed by some agency counter staff. Holidaymakers who have had their fingers burned at the keyboard may take a more charitable view.",

The savings ratio - the proportion of income not spent - has fallen to only 3.8%, the lowest since 1988. The economy is out of kilter.

Grant is not being celebrated so much as commiserated with. This is the Hugh Grant arrested on Hollywood Boulevard in 1995 and held up to public ridicule, his police mugshot flashed around the world, after he was caught in a car with Divine Brown - a Hugh Grant who looks disconcertingly older than in his films, and very tired.

The painter puts a famous face on canvas, translating the voyeuristic look we fix on celebrity into art. Its history can be tracked through the 19th and early 20th centuries in painters like Degas and Sickert, who painted royalty glimpsed in the street and copied their faces from photographs.

Yet she has more in common with Warhol than portraiture in which the subtle light of the studio is blasted away by the camera flash. Kilimnik and Warhol are both American artists with eastern European affinities: Warhol's parents were Belarussian and Kilimnik says that hers were Russian, although much of her background is unclear. For both, the idea of an icon has more than casual significance. Kilimnik's portraits, like Warhol's, look as if they belong in a private shrine. They capture the madness of fandom - the illusion that we know this person - by tapping into the devotional use of icons in orthodox Christianity. </p> <p>This portrait is painted in what appears to be a naive, amateur style, as if Kilimnik were an untrained, obsessive fan of Grant.

The down-at-heel aesthetic matches Kilimnik's reading of Grant as someone who, though wealthy outside, is massively overdrawn inside. Our perception of Grant - at least until the Grant-Hurley breakup, in which she gets her portrait with a big snake done by glamour photographer David LaChapelle while he gets this melancholy tribute - has long been at odds with his image in America, which is irrevocably, tragicomically, tied to his arrest on Hollywood Boulevard and subsequent chatshow apologies. Kilimnik's art is about cultural displacement, Russian memories in high school, Europe transplanted across the Atlantic, and she empathetically seems to recognise the same displacement in Hugh Grant.

So how come, whenever the bedroom-eyed, tattoo-friendly actor isn't making crime dramas, he's doing football (The Program), baseball (Major League 2), track (Higher Learning) or something or other sporty? Now Epps is co-starring with newcomer Sanaa Lathan in Love &amp; Basketball, the tale of two childhood friends who follow their passions for the game, and one another, through troubled collegiate and professional careers.

Seemingly, the producers were concerned that John Woo's highly anticipated sequel to Brian de Palma's unbelievably complicated but hugely entertaining Mission: Impossible was a bit hard to follow. Now that the finished product has been released, it's possible to report that the sequel, at the very least, has a story line that makes sense. It's klunky, it's goofy, it's repetitive and it has holes big enough to drive the entire United States Marine Corps through, but at least it can be followed. Thank heavens for small mercies. And industrious editors.</p> <p>M:I2 is the kind of movie that intelligent, self-respecting critics (there are seven of us, globally) hate to review. Because it is a summer blockbuster, because it is already a mammoth hit in the United States, and because, despite its faults, it is generally quite an engaging film, it seems almost churlish to say anything negative about it. Thus, let me preface my remarks by stating that while M:I2 is not nearly as good as the original, it is not a dud like last year's Wild, Wild West or The Phantom Menace. But it's no Gladiator.</p> <p>This time out, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is forced to abbreviate a rock-climbing vacation in order to save the world in general and Australia in particular from a lethal virus that has fallen into the hands of fiendish villains. </p> <p>Well, in fact, the fiendish villains, though very, very cruel, are such ninnies that they have only secured one half of the virus, and need the other half in order to bring the world to its knees. In exchange for returning their half of the virus, or all of the virus, or some combination thereof, the villains are demanding the nice round sum of \u00a337 million.</p> <p>Well, at first they are. But then they decide that they don't really want the \u00a337 million per se, so much as they want the right to buy \u00a337 million worth of stock options in the corporation that has manufactured the virus, so that they can seize control of the company and become fabulously wealthy and even more dangerous and unpleasant. Throughout the film, the villains always seem a bit on edge, perhaps because their fiendish plot is so complicated that they themselves cannot keep the details straight. Fortunately, Hunt can, which is one reason he is so likeable.</p> <p>As in Mission: Impossible and John Woo's own Face/Off, both Cruise and his adversaries are constantly using clever disguises to switch identities. As a result, one can never tell whether Cruise is really Ethan Hunt, or whether the man who gets beaten to a pulp is in fact Tom Cruise or a henchdude disguised as Tom Cruise, or whether anybody in the film is the person that they claim to be. </p> <p>This is one of the gaping holes in the plot. Since the villains are trying to blackmail the head of the virus-making corporation into turning over the half of the virus that they don't have, it is not entirely clear why one of them doesn't simply put on a fake face and pretend to be the beleaguered CEO and walk right into company headquarters and stick the virus into his attache case and walk back out again. It is also unclear why the unspeakable forces of pure, unadulterated evil are asking for a measly \u00a337 million when \u00a33 billion and complete dominion of New South Wales seems a more appropriate asking price. But never mind.</p> <p>In Mission: Impossible, Cruise was constantly seen interacting with other members of his team, and this gave the film a certain pacing and variety and humour. In M:I2, his colleagues have a much smaller, less interesting role, basically manning computers and piloting helicopters and not adding anything special to the film. The love interest this time out is Thandie Newton, here cast as a fantastically gifted pickpocket and safe-cracker who was once romantically involved with Dougray Scott but who is now romantically involved with Cruise.</p> <p>Newton doesn't have a whole lot to do; she mostly staggers around Australia waiting to die, which is about par for the course for actresses in John Woo movies. The film never really explains how the same woman could fall in love with a man as debonair and clever and virtuous as Cruise and as seedy and sadistic and inept as Scott. Nor why a law enforcement official (Cruise) would get so emotionally involved with a world-class thief who probably cannot be trusted, as criminals often have defective moral character and many other personality flaws. But never mind.</p> <p>Because Mission: Impossible was a thriller and M:I2 is an action film, it's a great relief when the tangled threads of the plot finally coalesce and Cruise can start killing people. In a way, it's almost a shame that Woo had to even bother with a plot, because all anybody really wants to see in John Woo movies is some good-looking guy - or John Travolta - cavorting on a motorcycle, plunging through plate-glass windows, just generally raising hell.</p> <p>As with Face/Off, the last half-hour of the film is infinitely more entertaining than the huge build-up that precedes it, particularly if you enjoy highly stylised violence as much as I do. M:I2 has no scene as memorable as the sequence where a suspended Cruise sneaks into CIA headquarters to hack into the agency's computers, and as a villain, Scott is certainly no Jon Voight. Still, after the disaster of Eyes Wide Shut and his curious second banana work in Magnolia, it's nice to see Tom Cruise back doing what he does best. Nobody does better teeth work than Tom Cruise.

It says Welcome Home Our Hero.</p> <p> Brandon was arrested before the England Romania match.

When the van was full, it was driven to a police station. Brandon was pushed towards a holding cell, where he and 40 others stood until daybreak. Brandon was not allowed to phone the Ludlows, his family (and anyway, it would have been a futile exercise since the Ludlows' phone had been cut off by BT for non-payment). </p> <p> Peggy Ludlow is threatening to sue the Belgian prime minister as soon as she finds out who he is. As she was preparing the party food, she said, \"Adrian, our Brandon is the only one of my kids who ain't a hooligan. Our Brandon's always been a strange kid, you know, reading books for pleasure and talking about things that none of the rest of us are interested in.\" </p> <p> She told me that Brandon only went to the match for research purposes.

Glenn and William are very excited, as they have been watching the rioting in Charleroi avidly.</p> <p> In fact, they have shown more interest in the fighting on the streets than they have shown in the football on the pitch. Mrs Wormington talked to me as I ironed one of her vast, full-skirted summer frocks. According to her, certain sections of young Englishmen have always behaved like Barbarians when they have travelled abroad as a group. She said, \"How do you think we managed to capture all them foreign countries. It weren't the limp-wristed brigade what done it and coloured the map pink.\" </p> <p> She insisted on wearing a hat to the Ludlows' party, seemingly under the impression that it was Ludlow Castle she was going to rather than the front room of a council house. I had a very interesting talk to Brandon, who is indeed a sensitive, intelligent, young man. He reminded me of my younger self, before I became trapped in single fatherhood and the endless round of domestic duties (which now includes caring for a nonagenarian). Over Mother's Pride and Kraft processed cheese sandwiches, we discussed his ordeal. Brandon said that his night in the cells was only made tolerable by the fact that a barrister had also been arrested and had happened to have a copy of last week's Spectator magazine on him. This same barrister kept trying to get his fellow hooligans to chant Boris Johnson's name, but few joined in and eventually he gave up and went to sleep, but only after confessing to Brandon a particularly lurid sexual fantasy that included Petronella Wyatt and Bruce Anderson. </p> <p> After a heated discussion with Vince Ludlow about Mrs Worthington's habit of banging on the party wall with an orthopaedic shoe every time the Ludlows enjoyed sexual congress, I took my family home. </p> <p><strong> Sunday, June 25 </strong></p> <p> Brandon came round as promised to read my manuscript of Sty! I dare not let it out of my sight. A lot of work has gone into the first three chapters. Brandon looked up after the first few pages and said that he thought it was a mistake to call my pig hero Lucifer, as it set up false Mephistophelean expectations in the reader. I could have done without such stinging criticism but I have to concede that Brandon has a point. While waiting for the washing machine to finish its cycle, I re-christened Lucifer and call him Peter. It is amazing what a difference this has made to the tone. It now reads like a children's book. I may subtitle it A Farm Yard Allegory. Watch out, Harry Potter. Peter Pig is on the way!</p>",

      "body": "<p>One pithy definition of the difference between comedy and tragedy, sometimes attributed to that gangster of the comic, Mel Brooks, goes like this. \"Tragedy is if I cut my finger; comedy is if you walk into an open sewer and die.\" Tragedy is subjective; comedy is objective, it requires distance. The comic is no less serious, indeed it can deal with the darkest stuff of life. But, for the spectator, the ethics are different. We suffer with the tragic hero and we laugh at the comic fool. Somewhere between the two lies irony - which requires the self-immersion of tragedy and the detachment of comedy. Irony, you could say, is conscience. But first and foremost, it is an attitude - the attitude of the clown who has no narrative of his own. All Shakespeare's fools are ironists, but even he didn't always know what to do with them - what do you do with the person who has no narrative? Lear's fool, for example, disappears unaccountably half way through the play. </p> <p>All of which is a way of saying that the actor, John Cusack, is our latterday Fool, our ironist - the closest thing we have to the Shakespearian clown: odd, edgy, inexpressibly funny, wry, charming, sweetly evasive. And tall - six foot three. He wasn't tall as a kid. As a kid he was short. \"The ages two to 15 I spent at different stages of shortness. I didn't become a tall person until I was 16.\" The same age, incidentally, that he became an actor. In the ensuing 17 years, he has made 44 films. That's a hell of a lot of films. \"But I only like eight of them.\" He talks like this, in these kind of abrupt, eccentric rhythms, arms swinging loosely by his side, eyes fixed in a wide-eyed glare. Even sitting he is tall. How would he describe the kind of characters he likes to play. \"Er. Confused. Morally ambiguous.\" Well, I say to him, at least you are clear about that. \"Am I?\" he says. \"I don't know.\" </p> <p>And that's it. The end of the interview. I don't mean the end of the conversation but the end of these roles we are playing - interviewer and interviewee. Journalist and film star. He doesn't like it; more than this, he declines it. It's his choice. Wading through a mound of opaque cuttings about him, I came across a story from 1992 in the Los Angeles Herald, where he was interviewed with his close mate Tim Robbins, soon after Robbins made his political satire Bob Roberts. Cusack has a cameo role in the film - playing a sort of satirical jester, in fact. The idea, the journalist's idea, was that they were going to talk about their friendship, the films they have made together, going way back to 1985 when, both unknowns, they made the slight but charming romantic comedy The Sure Thing. Except that Robbins and Cusack had a different idea. They wanted to talk about \"the importance of wearing good shoes\". The indignant journalist laid into them both in print for refusing to talk about movies. For being unprofessional. For refusing, in other words, to play the parts he had assigned them. </p> <p>Of course, what they were up to was a piss take. He does the same thing to me when he asks me about my marriage. \"Do you cheat on each other?\" But he is also making a serious point. Actors, of course, play roles for a living. But all of us, and all the time, play roles in life and we have choices about how we play and what we play. Unthinkingly to play a part - to say this is not me, this is just what I do for a job, is morally irresponsible. This sounds a bit heavy. Cusack put it better, that is, more lightly, in the film he co-wrote, Grosse Point Blank, which deals hysterically with exactly this subject. (You could make the case that all his films since GPB are about this. Is this me, or is this an alias? Who am I?) </p> <p>In <strong>Grosse Point Blank</strong> he plays the morally-numbed professional killer, Martin Blank, who undergoes a spiritual crisis when he returns to his childhood town to kill someone and, while there, to attend his high-school reunion with his erstwhile love, played by Minnie Driver. It could have been merely elegant, arch, a film that evoked precisely the emotional blankness that it set out to satirise. To work it required a performance of outsize eccentricity from Cusack - and it got it. And not just from John, but also from his sister Joan Cusack, who plays his secretary in the film with an explosive battiness rarely seen. It's extremely funny and, as he says, serious. \"I grew up fascinated by people in the Reagan administration, their ethics, their mercenary values. People who plan wars and then go home to their wives and their kids. How do they live? I thought one way of looking at this was to play around with the killer genre. Some people got it. For some it worked just as entertainment.\" </p> <p>For Cusack, the moral aspect and the creative aspect of film making are the same thing - visible in the choices he makes about the kind of films he wants to do. Some are overtly political, such as <strong>Bob Roberts</strong> and the more recent <strong>The Cradle Will Rock</strong>, in which he played Nelson Rockefeller. But the majority, and probably the best, of his work, consists of comparatively small-scale portraits of guys - often loners, certainly misfits - people with a jumble of identities trying to figure out who they are: <strong>Being John Malkovich</strong> is the apotheosis of this. \"The most original piece of writing I have ever read, brilliant.\" Closely followed by High Fidelity, his latest film, adapted from the novel by Nick Hornby and about a bunch of guys who put on attitudes as easily as they put on their beloved records, and then wonder why love doesn't linger. </p> <p><strong>High Fidelity</strong> is the perfect film for what Cusack is trying to do with his acting - which is lightheartedly, easily, in his friendly, nervy way, to explore what it is in each of us that inhibits us from being ourselves. Nick Hornby must be delighted with it, it's better than the book because the movie can do what the novel couldn't and play the songs. Cusack again co-wrote the screenplay with his Grosse Point Blank mates DeVincentis and Steve Pink. \"I liked the book and thought it would make a good film because it seemed to me it captured something that no one had done in movies, which is to show how people experience music autobiographically. How, over the years, songs become markers of experience.\" As he says, how we use music to interpret a situation, a particular song, a particular mood. Change the song and you change the mood. Put the song on and you put on the mood. Then take it off. </p> <p>\"It's something we, guys, have all done. Made tapes for girls, trying to impress them, to meet them on a shared plane of aesthetics. Read them someone else's poetry because they do poetry better than you could do it, because you're too awkward to do it. It seemed to me that Nick just nailed how men's minds work when we're trying to sort out what we do with women. And, of course, it's funny.\" It's not about anything very much, except what's going on in the characters' minds. There's no great plot, not a lot of narrative. But then, as he says, \"There are lots of people who don't have extraordinary things happen to them and who still live quite intense lives.\" </p> <p>Maybe he is not a star. Or not a star in the Tom Cruise mould. \"People are always telling me, 'You should do more of this, more of that. Why aren't you more of a star. You could be more successful?' But it's all relative. It all depends on your definition of success. Is High Fidelity or Being John Malkovich a success? Both films will probably make money for the people who made them. But neither of them, in total, will make what Con Air made in its opening weekend - $200 million.\" <strong>Con Air</strong> was a dreadful action movie, featuring Nicolas Cage, that Cusack did for the money. Not again. \"I am rich enough.\" He knows what he is doing. And in the process of doing it, he has invented a new screen character - a guy equivocal, screwed up and yet decent. \"The man with question marks in his eyes\", as Pauline Kael once wrote of him, the man who is prepared to admit, \"I don't know.\" An Everyman for our time. </p> <p>His decency he gets from his parents - his mum a teacher, his dad a documentary film-maker, both Irish by descent and Catholic. Cusack went to church until he was 16, then gave it up. \"A recovering Catholic, yes.\" He grew up, the fourth of five, in Evanston, an upper-middle-class suburb of Chicago - and now has his own place in Chicago as well as in Los Angeles. Don't know where he gets the screwiness from, probably his parents again, a kind of madcap wildness runs in the family - you see it, too, in his sister Joanie, also a wonderful actor. They have worked together in a number of movies, including High Fidelity. Does he help her out? \"Don't be ridiculous. She helps me out.\" How? \"By being in the movies. She's so great.\" (His older sister, Ann, and his brother, Bill, also act. Only his little sister Suzy doesn't.) </p> <p>His dad, he says, was hysterically funny. \"Still is. Very silly.\" Very silly and very committed - to his marriage, which has lasted 40 years, and to his faith, which, though I can't pretend to know what form this takes, can be inferred from his long-standing friendship with Daniel and Philip Berrigan: Philip, a former Jesuit priest, Daniel, a practising Jesuit who now works in an Aids hostel in New York. Both the brothers are devout pacifists, with long histories of peace protests, and have been imprisoned many times. In 1968, when John Cusack would have been two, they caused a national furore, inspiring nationwide demonstrations, when they broke into army offices and burned draft papers in protest against the Vietnam war. </p> <p>Cusack says he remembers in his childhood, around the family dinner table, stories of their activism, their incarcerations. \"Their commitment is mind boggling. I think Phil is in prison again, he got six years for ripping apart a warhead, which, when you're in your 70s, is not so good.\" So, a family of good people, used to thinking about issues. Parents who encouraged their children to think for themselves, not to accept what they were told. In the model of the Berrigans, it was shown to them that there is no external authority, not even the moral authority of the church, which should not be questioned. The Catholic Church renounced Philip Berrigan and he was excommunicated when he married a former nun. </p> <p>A definition of good faith is making choices and accepting responsibility for those choices. So Cusack chose what to keep of Catholicism, \"I like that some of it has stayed with me. That it's given me a conscience.\" The rest, \"the mindless ritual\", he chucked away. Too much Catholicism? \"I don't think so, no. I don't tend to think in terms of a moral authority - be a good boy, do good things - more in terms of what feels right.\" Which means that you have to watch yourself, he says: \"I don't want to be buffeted by the foul, exploitative winds blowing around.\" And: \"A lot about this life I lead is crazy. Having this emperor's card, being able to get in anywhere, meet anyone. Knowing that just about any girl you can think of you can probably get on the phone. Because you have a sort of name.\" It's very tempting, he says, and quite frightening. And the way to resist it? \"Well,\" he says, \"that's what High Fidelity is all about.\" </p> <p>When he was small, and short, he wanted to be an athlete, \"a boxer\" - not as unlike acting as it may appear, similar dedication to discipline, though a more fanatical subordination of the self. And a sense of brotherhood. He enjoys this. In England he is travelling with two mates, one of them Jeremy Piven, also an actor, whom he has known since childhood and whose parents ran The Piven Theatre Workshop, where he first started to act, aged eight. (Piven gives the cameo as the estate agent in Grosse Point Blank.) </p> <p>By the age of 10, he'd given up wanting to be an athlete, \"and decided to do what I was best at, acting\". Pragmatic, too. He was always like this. \"At school, I'd get into trouble, but I was smart about the trouble I got into. I liked to stir things up, but I always kept an escape hatch.\" His dad put him in a couple of commercials. And then, from the age of 16 in 1982 up until 1988 - when he was in John Sayles's political allegory Eight Men Out, based on the 1919 World Series baseball scandal - Cusack played little and then bigger parts in an assortment of teen movies. </p> <p>Of that generation of \"brat-pack\" actors, River Phoenix is dead; Rob Lowe's career was ruined by a sex scandal; Ditto Charlie Sheen. Cusack didn't make those sorts of mistakes. No sex scandals, unless you count Minnie Driver saying he was mean to her. \"Minnie gets cross with everyone. Anyway, I wasn't mean, I was very nice to her. We're good pals. I just think she should learn that certain sorts of candour are not smart.\" </p> <p>And he was smart, too, about drugs. \"Sure, there were wild times heading off to Lake Tahoe, out of our minds on magic mushrooms. Drug adventures. The ages 19 to 27 were pretty crazy.\" Then he stopped. \"I figured I needed other ways to be wild that weren't so physically taxing.\" In 1990, he appeared in The Grifters, directed by Stephen Frears, who also directs High Fidelity, and in one move he turned his image around. The part was still, in a sense, a version of the lovelorn reject, but, opposite Anjelica Huston playing his mother Lily, the pair of them competing con artists, he found a callousness to match his wry charm, an equipoise between vice and virtue - the part, in one way or another, that he has been playing around with ever since, making, on average, three and, more recently, four films a year. </p> <p>Forty four films, the majority in the past 12 years, and he's only just 34. That's a vast amount of work. </p> <p>Sure, Eastwood and De Niro, both of them prolific, have made, respectively, 70 and 66 films, but that is in careers spanning, in Eastwood's case, four, and in De Niro's case three times as long as Cusack's. The only actor who can touch him in the numbers game is Kevin Spacey, 41 films in 14 years. And it's probably also the case that Spacey is the only actor of his generation in Hollywood who can touch him in terms of energy, intellect, speed of thought - registered in lightning nerve-end responses. And, of course, irony - that Cheshire Cat smile Spacey has. Jack Nicholson, the Joker, age aside, would be another obvious contender. </p> <p>Both Cusack and Spacey are what are termed \"character\" actors, which means nothing except in Hollywood, where it suggests you are not \"a star\" - ie, you don't get offered \"vehicle parts\". Nicholson, naturally, has never been anything other than a star. Maybe since his Oscar, Spacey, too, is \"a star\", but somehow I doubt it - like Cusack, he enjoys playing the margins too much. Anyway, what all three have in common is personality. They remind you that what \"stardom\" consists of is personality. It's in the spaces, the gaps actors create to do what they want to do and not what they have been told to do. It's when acting is not merely a performance, a part being played. </p> <p>Cusack and Spacey worked together, once, in Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil, directed by Eastwood, and Cusack didn't like the end result. Competitiveness? \"No. We weren't competitive. I just think they should have gone back to the editing room.\" But then, it didn't work when Arthur Penn put Nicholson opposite Brando in The Missouri Breaks. </p> <p>So. Cusack is 34 and he is not married. \"Not married, no.\" He has girlfriends? \"Sure.\" Not gay? \"Never been gay.\" The turn the conversation is taking is in response to him saying Gladiator is a film about repressed homosexuality. And me saying, \"Who cares? Russell Crowe is gorgeous. Who cares if it's gay or not gay, so long as it's about sex.\" I think it's fair to say that on sex we diverge. If I were a man, I tell him, I'd definitely be gay. \"No you wouldn't.\" Why not? \"Because women are great.\" But gays have better sex lives, more decadent sex lives. \"You can be decadent and straight. You just pay a higher price. If you are decadent and straight you are thought of as some kind of a pig.\" </p> <p>Would he like to get married? Put it another way. In his fantasy, is he married? \"I'm not as interested in being married as in coming to some sort of clarity about the whole thing.\" Which sounds a bit constipated, but then, as he says, it's not an easy subject. Complicated, in fact. \"Don't you think?\" Is he one of those men who falls in love all the time. \"Not at all. I've been in love maybe two or three times in my life.\" A leaver? \"No, so far they have been mutual leavings.\" Kids? \"Yeah. That'd be good. But I'd want to be with someone I could stay with long enough for the kids to grow up.\" Maybe you've got to stop thinking so much, I say. \"Yes,\" he says. \"But that's complicated, too, isn't it?\" </p> <p>He wants what we all want. He wants kids, he wants love. He wants what his parents had before anyone ever asked them to define what it is that they have. He wants that effortless business of being yourself. And the question is how do you get to it from where we are? It's a bit like that Irish joke. How do you get to X? \"Well,\" says the Irishman. \"I wouldn't start from here.\" </p> <p>Cusack is a great actor, and he's funny. Soon, he will be at that place where no one can touch him. Actors with his kind of charisma, whom the camera loves, really who can't do much wrong, are rare. And, of course, every performance he gives compounds this. I don't know how you shore up your identity against this sort of onslaught. Except that he's ready for it and he welcomes it. He doesn't know what it is. At least he knows who he is. </p> <p>It's funny how sex is so different from success. Sex is something you can see, hold in your gaze, sex is reassuring. When he talks about sex, about girls, it's concrete. \"Nobody wants to be that guy, aged 45, in a bar, picking up the 21-year-old girl. Then you're moving into the most-pathetic-man-in-the-world scenario.\" Yet, when he talks about work, success, it's abstract. Success is... and so many clich\u00e9s subside. </p> <p>He is complicated, he says. Complicated in the sense that can make you intriguing as an actor but not always fun as a partner. \"Contradictory, if you like. Someone who may have instincts to be faithful but who also has instincts to cheat. Someone that may be loyal, honest, and yet want to get what they want. Impulses that clash.\" A perfectly nice ordinary if complicated guy, in other words. </p> <p>It is probably true that John Cusack is more interesting than any of the parts he has yet played. But maybe that's inevitable. You could say he's lucky to have found the number of films that he has which suit, well enough, his persona. For me, his unwillingness to settle into a pattern, this strange quixotic resistance that he has, keeps me interested. Of course, it's his job. But it's also the mark of the man and of the actor. Because, as he says, no part that any of us plays, in art or in life, can ever be, or will ever be, definitive </p> <p>\u0095 High Fidelity opens on July 21.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One pithy definition of the difference between comedy and tragedy, sometimes attributed to that gangster of the comic, Mel Brooks, goes like this. \"Tragedy is if I cut my finger; comedy is if you walk into an open sewer and die.\" Tragedy is subjective; comedy is objective, it requires distance. The comic is no less serious, indeed it can deal with the darkest stuff of life. But, for the spectator, the ethics are different. We suffer with the tragic hero and we laugh at the comic fool. Somewhere between the two lies irony - which requires the self-immersion of tragedy and the detachment of comedy. Irony, you could say, is conscience. But first and foremost, it is an attitude - the attitude of the clown who has no narrative of his own. All Shakespeare's fools are ironists, but even he didn't always know what to do with them - what do you do with the person who has no narrative? Lear's fool, for example, disappears unaccountably half way through the play. All of which is a way of saying that the actor, John Cusack, is our latterday Fool, our ironist - the closest thing we have to the Shakespearian clown: odd, edgy, inexpressibly funny, wry, charming, sweetly evasive. And tall - six foot three. He wasn't tall as a kid. As a kid he was short. \"The ages two to 15 I spent at different stages of shortness. I didn't become a tall person until I was 16.\" The same age, incidentally, that he became an actor. In the ensuing 17 years, he has made 44 films. That's a hell of a lot of films. \"But I only like eight of them.\" He talks like this, in these kind of abrupt, eccentric rhythms, arms swinging loosely by his side, eyes fixed in a wide-eyed glare. Even sitting he is tall. How would he describe the kind of characters he likes to play. \"Er. Confused. Morally ambiguous.\" Well, I say to him, at least you are clear about that. \"Am I?\" he says. \"I don't know.\" And that's it. The end of the interview. I don't mean the end of the conversation but the end of these roles we are playing - interviewer and interviewee. Journalist and film star. He doesn't like it; more than this, he declines it.

Forty four films, the majority in the past 12 years, and he's only just 34. That's a vast amount of work. Sure, Eastwood and De Niro, both of them prolific, have made, respectively, 70 and 66 films, but that is in careers spanning, in Eastwood's case, four, and in De Niro's case three times as long as Cusack's. The only actor who can touch him in the numbers game is Kevin Spacey, 41 films in 14 years. And it's probably also the case that Spacey is the only actor of his generation in Hollywood who can touch him in terms of energy, intellect, speed of thought - registered in lightning nerve-end responses. And, of course, irony - that Cheshire Cat smile Spacey has. Jack Nicholson, the Joker, age aside, would be another obvious contender. Both Cusack and Spacey are what are termed \"character\" actors, which means nothing except in Hollywood, where it suggests you are not \"a star\" - ie, you don't get offered \"vehicle parts\". Nicholson, naturally, has never been anything other than a star. Maybe since his Oscar, Spacey, too, is \"a star\", but somehow I doubt it - like Cusack, he enjoys playing the margins too much. Anyway, what all three have in common is personality. They remind you that what \"stardom\" consists of is personality. It's in the spaces, the gaps actors create to do what they want to do and not what they have been told to do. It's when acting is not merely a performance, a part being played. Cusack and Spacey worked together, once, in Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil, directed by Eastwood, and Cusack didn't like the end result. Competitiveness? \"No. We weren't competitive. I just think they should have gone back to the editing room.\" But then, it didn't work when Arthur Penn put Nicholson opposite Brando in The Missouri Breaks. So. Cusack is 34 and he is not married. \"Not married, no.\" He has girlfriends? \"Sure.\" Not gay? \"Never been gay.\" The turn the conversation is taking is in response to him saying Gladiator is a film about repressed homosexuality. And me saying, \"Who cares? Russell Crowe is gorgeous. Who cares if it's gay or not gay, so long as it's about sex.\" I think it's fair to say that on sex we diverge. If I were a man, I tell him, I'd definitely be gay. \"No you wouldn't.\" Why not? \"Because women are great.\" But gays have better sex lives, more decadent sex lives. \"You can be decadent and straight. You just pay a higher price. If you are decadent and straight you are thought of as some kind of a pig.\" Would he like to get married? Put it another way. In his fantasy, is he married? \"I'm not as interested in being married as in coming to some sort of clarity about the whole thing.\" Which sounds a bit constipated, but then, as he says, it's not an easy subject. Complicated, in fact. \"Don't you think?\" Is he one of those men who falls in love all the time. \"Not at all. I've been in love maybe two or three times in my life.\" A leaver? \"No, so far they have been mutual leavings.\" Kids? \"Yeah. That'd be good. But I'd want to be with someone I could stay with long enough for the kids to grow up.\" Maybe you've got to stop thinking so much, I say. \"Yes,\" he says. \"But that's complicated, too, isn't it?\" He wants what we all want. He wants kids, he wants love. He wants what his parents had before anyone ever asked them to define what it is that they have. He wants that effortless business of being yourself. And the question is how do you get to it from where we are? It's a bit like that Irish joke. How do you get to X? \"Well,\" says the Irishman. \"I wouldn't start from here.\" Cusack is a great actor, and he's funny. Soon, he will be at that place where no one can touch him. Actors with his kind of charisma, whom the camera loves, really who can't do much wrong, are rare. And, of course, every performance he gives compounds this. I don't know how you shore up your identity against this sort of onslaught. Except that he's ready for it and he welcomes it. He doesn't know what it is. At least he knows who he is. It's funny how sex is so different from success. Sex is something you can see, hold in your gaze, sex is reassuring. When he talks about sex, about girls, it's concrete. \"Nobody wants to be that guy, aged 45, in a bar, picking up the 21-year-old girl. Then you're moving into the most-pathetic-man-in-the-world scenario.\" Yet, when he talks about work, success, it's abstract. Success is... and so many clich\u00e9s subside. He is complicated, he says. Complicated in the sense that can make you intriguing as an actor but not always fun as a partner. \"Contradictory, if you like. Someone who may have instincts to be faithful but who also has instincts to cheat. Someone that may be loyal, honest, and yet want to get what they want. Impulses that clash.\" A perfectly nice ordinary if complicated guy, in other words. It is probably true that John Cusack is more interesting than any of the parts he has yet played. But maybe that's inevitable. You could say he's lucky to have found the number of films that he has which suit, well enough, his persona. For me, his unwillingness to settle into a pattern, this strange quixotic resistance that he has, keeps me interested. Of course, it's his job. But it's also the mark of the man and of the actor. Because, as he says, no part that any of us plays, in art or in life, can ever be, or will ever be, definitive \u0095 High Fidelity opens on July 21.",

The prime minister and home secretary want to regain control of that agenda.</p> <p>Here was a tough solution to appeal to the Daily Mail and Sun, even if it sounded half-baked and unworkable. The problem has been made more urgent by the looming rise in crime figures, after three years of falling ones, further highlighted by the much-publicised claim on US television this week that Britain is a very violent place.</p> <p>But this was a speech with an avowed vision far grander than all that. The private Mr Blair takes his religion seriously, but nowadays he is wise enough to avoid making public theological pronouncements even when he succumbs to an invitation from the dissident Catholic theologist Hans K\u00fcng.</p> <p>He was also mindful of the pitfalls of overtly partisan speeches to non-political audiences and must have wondered whether Tubingen might turn nasty - another Women's Institute fiasco. So he devoted just two paragraphs to Europe and one reference to the Tories.</p> <p>Mr Blair explained his vision of how communities - local, national and international - can mitigate the \"breakneck speed and continuous change\" that globalisation creates and most people find hard to cope with. He spoke of education, drugs, the daily grind of two-job families, of elderly parents and divorce. Acknowledging the price of growing affluence, he said: \"It is a world with a paradox at ther heart of it: greater individual freedom, yet greater interdependence.\"</p> <p>Part of his aim was to persuade the wider audience in Europe that the Blairite third way can reconcile tradition and modernisation, the heresies of left and right, one hostile to capitalism and family values, the other fearful of immigrants, yet slaves to market forces.</p> <p>At the heart of his philosophy, Mr Blair explained, was \"the modern idea of community\" and his belief in the equality of individual worth - \"not equality of income or outcome, or simply equality of opportunity, rather it affirms our equal right to dignity, liberty, freedom from discrimination as well as economic opportunity\".</p> <p>That is a short step from emphasising both what Labour is doing on public services and what it expects by way of responsibility from individuals themselves, \"the covenant at the heart of modern civil society\", he called it.</p> <p>The main thrust is enough to enrage his critics on both left and right, too bland and consensual for their tastes, too prone to avoid real differences of interest that will not be easily reconciled.</p> <p>The fact that No 10 saw fit to drop a gimmicky idea for fining Saturday night drunks into such a speech suggests that his promise to the WI - not to over-spin stories or \"fight for every headline\" -has already been discarded. We suspected it might be.</p>",

Another obvious explanation, the MP conceded, was that the prime minister is embarrassed about the appalling reputation abroad of English football hooligans during Euro 2000 - he mentioned them in T\u00fcbingen yesterday - and wanted to show he is taking the problem seriously at home. There is also the little matter of William Hague, who has been running off with the law- and-order headlines lately. The prime minister and home secretary want to regain control of that agenda. Here was a tough solution to appeal to the Daily Mail and Sun, even if it sounded half-baked and unworkable. The problem has been made more urgent by the looming rise in crime figures, after three years of falling ones, further highlighted by the much-publicised claim on US television this week that Britain is a very violent place. But this was a speech with an avowed vision far grander than all that. The private Mr Blair takes his religion seriously, but nowadays he is wise enough to avoid making public theological pronouncements even when he succumbs to an invitation from the dissident Catholic theologist Hans K\u00fcng. He was also mindful of the pitfalls of overtly partisan speeches to non-political audiences and must have wondered whether Tubingen might turn nasty - another Women's Institute fiasco. So he devoted just two paragraphs to Europe and one reference to the Tories. Mr Blair explained his vision of how communities - local, national and international - can mitigate the \"breakneck speed and continuous change\" that globalisation creates and most people find hard to cope with. He spoke of education, drugs, the daily grind of two-job families, of elderly parents and divorce. Acknowledging the price of growing affluence, he said: \"It is a world with a paradox at ther heart of it: greater individual freedom, yet greater interdependence.\" Part of his aim was to persuade the wider audience in Europe that the Blairite third way can reconcile tradition and modernisation, the heresies of left and right, one hostile to capitalism and family values, the other fearful of immigrants, yet slaves to market forces. At the heart of his philosophy, Mr Blair explained, was \"the modern idea of community\" and his belief in the equality of individual worth - \"not equality of income or outcome, or simply equality of opportunity, rather it affirms our equal right to dignity, liberty, freedom from discrimination as well as economic opportunity\". That is a short step from emphasising both what Labour is doing on public services and what it expects by way of responsibility from individuals themselves, \"the covenant at the heart of modern civil society\", he called it. The main thrust is enough to enrage his critics on both left and right, too bland and consensual for their tastes, too prone to avoid real differences of interest that will not be easily reconciled. The fact that No 10 saw fit to drop a gimmicky idea for fining Saturday night drunks into such a speech suggests that his promise to the WI - not to over-spin stories or \"fight for every headline\" -has already been discarded. We suspected it might be.",

      "bodyText": "The inventor of the \"virtual video recorder\" yesterday said he wanted to settle with the entertainment industry after his start-up company received a $10m writ for copyright infringement. David Simon, 40, a software programmer, closed down his website RecordTV.com, which allowed users to record television shows and watch later at their convenience, after lawyers for a dozen media groups, including Time Warner and Disney, alleged that he was stealing their shows. \"I don't want to be the figurehead or a martyr,\" Mr Simon told the Guardian. \"I am a guy with two kids, a mortgage and a regular job. I just want to settle.\" He has become the latest target of a media and entertainment industry keen to destroy all web-based \"attacks\" on its legal rights. Earlier this month, the US recording industry asked the federal court to shut down online music-sharing service Napster. This time it is the Motion Picture Association of America which has trained its sights on RecordTV.com. \"David Simon, willingly and knowingly, has built a business based on offering its customers access to valuable, stolen property,\" said Jack Valenti, president and chief executive of the MPAA. Last November, Mr Simon used not much more than a cable feed and a few computers equipped with television tuner cards in his Los Angeles home to record episodes of Pokemon on his PC for his daughter. A few months later, RecordTV.com was born - and by March was attracting some 100,000 users and up to 2m hits a day. The ease with which Mr Simon produced his website contradicted the industry view that the quality of the internet was not up to \"video streaming\" popular programmes. However good the technology, it may not be enough to save Mr Simon. \"We have no funding and are just trying to reach a settlement,\" he said. The future of the website, which sports a picture of the founder as well as a biography mentioning his love of running 15 miles a day, is based as much on raising some money as pacifying the media moguls.",

And the river Memel (Klaipedia in Lithuanian) is now more than 300 miles from German territory. It was once the northern frontier of East Prussia, part of the vast territories in the east taken as a prize of war in 1945 when more that 12m people were driven out of lands east and south of the Oder which had been German since the middle ages.</p> <p>Very few Germans now expect a revision of frontiers, and so what Ottinger sang could be dismissed as a convivial and trivial gaffe. Germany no longer stretches from Etsch to Memel.

Antique patriotic songs can be harmless enough.</p> <p>There is less of an excuse for Kohl, not long retired as the longest-serving postwar chancellor but now mired in scandal. He was proved to have accepted clandestine political donations when in office, was very heavily fined, and has been trying to raise money to pay the fine. When one Social Democrat suggested this fundraising should be shunned, Kohl said he was reminded of the boycott of Jewish shops in the 30s: \"I have already experienced this as a child.\" As Michel Friedman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany said, this grotesquely thick-skinned comparison \"trivialises the persecution of the Jewish community in the Third Reich\".</p> <p>Still, even Kohl's vulgar outburst was not significant: unlike the award of the important Konrad Adenauer prize to Nolte. The most conspicuous of rightwing nationalist historians, he was at the centre of the Historikerstreit of the 80s. In that \"battle of historians\", he argued that the German army in 1945 had been defending civilisation, and that the Germans at that time should be seen as victims rather than unique villains, as they had so often been portrayed.</p> <p>He has also claimed that Hitler's anti-semitism had a \"rational core\", since Nazism was \"the strongest of all counter-forces\" to Bolshevism, which had wide Jewish support. It was the communists who pioneered mass murder, Nolte argues, and Hitler was a mere novice at the feet of Lenin and Stalin. Awarding the prize seemed intended to show that these are now mainstream views. It was presented to him by another well-known historian, Horst Moller, director of the Institute for Contemporary History, who defended Nolte against what he called \"hate-filled and defamatory attacks\". Something is going on here.</p> <p>What is going on is partly a reaction to that earlier exercise in coming to terms, which sometimes took the form of national self-flagellation and international denunciation, or what Nolte calls the \"collective accusation\" against Germany ever since Hitler. It would have been surprising if there had been no form of revisionism at all, and not everything Nolte says is totally wrong. For too long there was a double standard in historical judgment - what has been called an asymmetry of indulgence between crimes of right and left. Hitler's murder of millions was intolerably and incomparably wicked, Stalin's murder of even more millions was just one of those things.</p> <p>But Nolte doesn't leave it at that. He insists on making claims which are ever more extreme, not to say insulting. Some go beyond polemical exaggeration, and when you read him you might wonder whether, as his compatriots would say, Professor Nolte has all the cups in his cupboard.</p> <p>At the least, he is eccentric with chronology. Hitler's Jew-hatred was fermented in Vienna before the first world war, and could scarcely have been a reaction to the October revolution of 1917, a revolution which would not have taken place without a war which Germany wanted and Russia didn't. And, although there plainly was a vicious circle of violence in the 20th century, the idea that Hitler needed to take lessons in genocide from anyone is frankly bizarre.</p> <p>Even when Nolte says, truly enough, that the German people suffered terribly in the last years of the war, from bombing, hunger and ethnic cleansing, not only hate-filled defamers may be inclined to ask who's talking. If Germany hadn't taken Europe into two terrible wars, her borders would indeed still stretch \" bis an die Memel \" and millions of Germans would today still live in East Prussia and Silesia.</p> <p>Tabloid Hun-bashers say that the Germans are eternal barbarians and aggressors. As someone who knows and likes the country, I would gently suggest that the true German problem - not fully come to terms with, if Nolte and Kohl are anything to go by - isn't self-aggrandisement or self-assertion but self-pity.</p>",

For too long there was a double standard in historical judgment - what has been called an asymmetry of indulgence between crimes of right and left. Hitler's murder of millions was intolerably and incomparably wicked, Stalin's murder of even more millions was just one of those things. But Nolte doesn't leave it at that. He insists on making claims which are ever more extreme, not to say insulting. Some go beyond polemical exaggeration, and when you read him you might wonder whether, as his compatriots would say, Professor Nolte has all the cups in his cupboard. At the least, he is eccentric with chronology. Hitler's Jew-hatred was fermented in Vienna before the first world war, and could scarcely have been a reaction to the October revolution of 1917, a revolution which would not have taken place without a war which Germany wanted and Russia didn't. And, although there plainly was a vicious circle of violence in the 20th century, the idea that Hitler needed to take lessons in genocide from anyone is frankly bizarre. Even when Nolte says, truly enough, that the German people suffered terribly in the last years of the war, from bombing, hunger and ethnic cleansing, not only hate-filled defamers may be inclined to ask who's talking. If Germany hadn't taken Europe into two terrible wars, her borders would indeed still stretch \" bis an die Memel \" and millions of Germans would today still live in East Prussia and Silesia. Tabloid Hun-bashers say that the Germans are eternal barbarians and aggressors. As someone who knows and likes the country, I would gently suggest that the true German problem - not fully come to terms with, if Nolte and Kohl are anything to go by - isn't self-aggrandisement or self-assertion but self-pity.",

      "body": "<p> The first publisher of Wisconsin Death Trip was an underground newspaper called Take Over. I worked there - if you choose to call what I did work - as a political collage maker while I studied American history in graduate school at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Take Over had made a name for itself by publishing a fabricated story about a murder committed at a huge meat processing plant, downwind from the state capital, across the highway from the city's sewage treatment plant.</p> <p> The paper claimed that the dead man's body had been disposed of by blending it with the other meat that left the plant's renowned hot-dog production line. The plant called a news conference to deny the story but since the worker - who had never existed - had vanished, the plant found it difficult to prove a negative and the paper's reputation was made, and so followed that first fabrication with something even less plausible: \"Nixon Invades Cambodia\" was the 12 inch headline. </p> <p>Unfortunately, two weeks after we reported it, President Nixon actually did send US troops across the border. No-one would print the paper, let alone advertise in it. Eventually we found printer 60 miles away who would print the thing after hours - as long as no-one found out. A coalition of wholesale marijuana dealers, known as the Midwest Dealers Association, tithed themselves to pay for printing costs. The paper's politics, combined with its funding sources, provided the police with sufficient cause to spy on it, paid informants, installed wiretaps, and infiltrated agents to keep watch over our daily lives. </p> <p>The result was that one day, when a fellow I barely knew finished laying out a page and got in his car to drive off to firebomb an insurance company, he was followed by an unmarked convoy of Red Squad detectives. They didn't even give him a chance to light a match before they tried to arrest him. The boy ran. The police ran after him - all the way to his apart ment where he pulled a gun and shot and wounded a police officer.</p> <p> The cops probably would have killed him, except he was white and his mother taught at the university. I ended up at the University of Wisconsin because I thought I wanted to study European social history. I'd graduated from Columbia College in New York City in 1967, one year before the anti-Vietnam student demonstrators occupied its buildings. When I first told my friends I was leaving to study in Wisconsin, a few asked me where Wisconsin was.</p> <p> I answered that, to the best of my knowledge, it was near Wyoming since, as everyone knew, the states were arranged alphabetically, east to west, from A to Z. It felt like the end of the alphabet once I arrived in Madison, the state capital. The place was beautiful; the women were stunning, but the New York Times arrived two days late, and it was impossible to see more than one new movie a week, let alone the three a day I was used to in New York. </p> <p>Worse than that, my professor was a mincing little man with a dachshund who insisted that for starters, we read and translated Martin Luther's letters to the German princes. I had one book of photographs with me - an anthology of black and white images called The Photographer's Eye, published by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Several images in it - one in particular, of an old lady standing by a fence - had captions which identified them as coming from the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.</p> <p> I was so bored that I went looking for them; what I blundered into changed my life. The society kept all its photographs in something called the department of iconography whose offices were up a flight of marble stairs, down a dim, chilly corridor, off a foyer that overlooked the carved plaster columns and Palladian windows of the society's main reading room.</p> <p> As I opened the door, I heard the music: Janis Joplin, soft, sweet, low and desperate, thrumming like a cat. There was one light on in the whole place, a buttermilk saucer of it, pooled on the secretary's desk. She lay across it, head cradled in her arms. \"Take it. Take another little piece of my heart,\" Janis sang. </p> <p>The curator of the place - its founder and director - was an old man named Paul Vanderbilt. He had a little bit of white hair and a scraggly white beard, but his lips and eyes were as sweet and soft as a boy's. \"Yes, yes\", he said. \"We have those pictures. But we have quite a few others, too. Marsha,\" he said, \"would you mind turning on the lights, please?\"</p> <p> When Marsha did, I realised how much I didn't know. The room was lined with filing cabinets; bank after bank of steel shelves in parallel lines ran into the depths of the space. I had walked into my first photographic archive. That afternoon, Paul and I began a conversation that continued, one day to the next, for four years. Some days, I thought he was Prospero; some days, Polonius; some days, Lear.</p> <p> In fact, he was Hess's Master of the Glass Bead Game. He knew about tacit meanings and the language of things; he understood the syntax of juxtapositions, inferences, and ambiguities; he could recite 1,000 word sentences coiled inside a single, frozen moment. </p> <p>Outside, in what passed for the real world, people, well known and otherwise, were getting shot to death in their beds, or in hotel kitchens, or in the backseats of convertibles, or on their way to their motel rooms. Half a world away, we were turning a whole country into a cratered charnel house. I told the professor with the dachshund that I had other things to do.</p> <p> I declared myself a student of American history, settled into my conversations with Paul, and began to read everything and anything my professors wanted me to know about US foreign and domestic policy. One day, Paul asked me if I'd ever heard of August Sander or seen any of his work. </p> <p>\"Of course\", I said. \"Not as much as I'd like, though.\" Sander had been a portrait photographer in Cologne. After the first world war, he'd decided to systematically photograph the entire human race, type by type, trade by trade, class and caste. He'd printed his portraits on photographic paper engineered to reproduce everything he saw in fine grained, flawless detail.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the Nazis had their own ideas of what constituted the human race and destroyed the printing plates of Sanders' book. Twenty five years after the second world war, Sanders' great images were just being printed and published again. </p> <p>\"Well,\" said Paul, \"if you like Sanders, you might want to look at these.\"</p> <p> \"These\" were 3,000 images made at the very end of the 19th century by a man named Charles Van Schaick, the town photographer of a Wisconsin county seat called Black River Falls. Those images eventually became the images of Wisconsin Death Trip.</p> <p> It was the eyes of the people in the pictures that did it to me. Their gaze; their long, slow, steady gaze. Since I was an earnest young historian, I began to investigate the history of the town where Van Schaick worked. </p> <p>As I began to list the data sources - diaries, newspaper on microfilm, state statistics - I asked Paul if I could make slides of some of the images.</p> <p> \"And why?\" he asked. </p> <p>I'd started a film society, I told him. We were showing things like Bunuel's Le Chien Andalou, but it was all on 16mm, and in between reels, we needed something to entertain the audience. I thought the slides would amuse people.</p> <p> \"Fine\", he said. So, in between eyeballs being slit and men with movie cameras riding trollies, I showed slide sequences of Van Schaick's portraits. I read as many farm diaries from the area around Black River Falls as I could stand. \"Rain today. Too wet to plant,\" was all that happened.</p> <p> I made my notes and went on to the town's newspaper. I spooled the first reel of microfilm that had been made of it, and began to read the state and local news columns. In between the church supper announcements and the birth and betrothal notices, the murders and suicides and the ghosts began to appear. I looked up and away from the screen.</p> <p> The microfilm reading room was a cold, dark, low-ceiling vault, quiet except for the sound of chairs shifting across its marble floor, and the whine of motor- drives winding microfilm.</p> <p> \"Jesus!\" I whispered.</p> <p> \"No-one ever told me about this stuff.\"</p> <p> The \"stuff\" kept coming, issue after issue. Arsons, epidemics, infanticides, suicides, bankruptcies.</p> <p> \"Ah, my God,\" I thought, \"I've stumbled into a madhouse.\" Not so, though. The state statistics showed the place had normal rates for everything - mental and physical health; infant mortality, commercial activity and crop production. Worse yet, the craziness was being reported from all across the region.</p> <p> I settled into a rhythm: I attended lectures, spoke up at seminars, talked with Paul - and read microfilm. Reel after reel of it. Flat, uninflected chronicles of suffering, suffering everywhere. At the end of the day, I'd stagger out into the light, go home, get loaded, and read Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five.</p> <p> \"So it goes,\" said Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim. </p> <p>\"So it goes.\" I'd stumbled into a holocaust without Jews, buried in the history of the heartland of the United States, at the end of an era that everyone kept calling the Gay Nineties.</p> <p> Half my friends were academics; half were artists, subversives, and outcasts. Every one of us knew that something had gone wrong with our country. The academics sat in classrooms and libraries, poring over documents like medical researchers, trying to discover the origins of the outbreak that was killing everyone.</p> <p> The outcasts and revolutionaries I knew - the dope dealers and ideologues and outlaw bikers, the larcenous poets and whole-earth farmers and hermit-girl truck drivers - were evenly divided between those who wanted to bring down the walls, and those who wanted to head for the hills before anyone lit the first match. And me? All I wanted to do was make a movie.</p> <p> Back in New York, I'd spent a quarter of my life in the dark, in theatres like the New Yorker, and the Thalia, and the Carnegie Hall Cinema. I'd read and re-read Eisenstein and Poduvkin. I'd even worked as an assistant when my best buddy - a cinematographer who'd learned his craft in the porn industry - began making 16mm, short, dramatic films of his own.</p> <p> It would take too long to tell you exactly how it happened, but two years after I saw the first faces from Black River Falls, I met a young guy in New York who worked as an apprentice film editor for a production company. He and his uncles were all that were left of a big family of Dutch diamond cutters who'd been rubbed out by the Nazis. Since a lot of my relatives had gone up the chimney too, we had something to talk about. </p> <p>He introduced me to a guy who was getting rich making commercials that panned across packs of cigarettes and soda bottles as if they were as big as trees or buildings. For the price of three file clerks' annual salaries, the guy said he'd make a five-minute movie of all Van Schaick's pictures. I didn't have the money. </p> <p>Even if I'd had it, I wasn't sure that five minutes of fluid-mounted macro zooms would do the trick. That's why I made a book. Please understand, though: the book I made, I made as if it were a movie. A strange kind of movie, of course, more like a perpetual motion machine with no moving parts than a John Ford western.</p> <p> The book was made to move rhythmically and incrementally, like a Gamelan concert; it relied on the viewer/reader to decipher - and participate in - its coded progressions as if they were elements of a collage built like a raga.</p> <p> John Cage and William Burroughs were as much its godfathers as Max Ernst and John Heartfield. Minor White and Ralph Gibson's photo sequences had as much an influence as Bob Dylan's Blonde On Blonde and John Wesley Harding. James Marsh is an artist. He found the book and the book found him. He made Wisconsin Death Trip into the movie it was. </p> <p>\u0095 James Marsh's Arena film Wisconsin Death Trip, adapted form Michael Lesy's book (University of New Mexico Press, $29.95), will be shown tomorrow night at 10.10pm</p>",

Located in a swanky area but the place itself is not overly plush. The reception area looks like the secretary's office at a decent comprehensive. What are the rooms like? Delightful. Very spacious and tastefully decorated. Decent air conditioning would help for the rare flashes of British summer, but otherwise there is a very helpful side room if the whirring fan gets too much. The bed test Big enough, comfy enough. The bathroom test Nothing glamorous, everything functioning. The Marks &amp; Spencer of bathrooms. The restaurant Understated. An identical number of notches up from Blackpool B&amp;B as it is down from Claridge's. The lounge Full of people and papers and chat - exactly as it should be. What is there to see within walking distance? Most of central London, particularly Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. What is there to see within a 10-minute drive? All of central London, although central London being what it is you'd be better walking. How much a night? Small doubles \u00a3120; double/ twin \u00a3150; suite \u00a3195. Would you go back? Yes, if I lived out of town and was feeling flush.",

Having gone in, I nearly never came out again. The cooking was a revelation - clean flavours, oomphy spicing, dead sexy in every department. It left the mouth and the man feeling fresh and fizzing. Since then ... well, let's just say, as with most things in life, there is more disappointment than there is fulfilment, so you can understand why I responded to the siren call of Alwaha, dragging Daphnis and Chlo\u00eb in my wake. </p> <p>Alwaha lies on the corner of Westbourne Grove and one of its side streets. Westbourne Grove is a curiosity. It manages to combine a scruffy, exotic loucheness with a series of restaurants unparalleled in London for their range and oddity. Greek, Chinese, caff and Malaysian, Indian and Austrian, Iranian and modern British (sic), all jostle hugger-mugger for custom. </p> <p>Alwaha is at the respectable end of the spectrum. While perhaps not in the forefront of contemporary restaurant design, it certainly has greater appeal than Chez Marcelle. It shares the latter's taste for pine, but keeps it a modest, natural shade, rather than Marcelle's Day-glo orange. There's quite a lot of greenery, but the overall impression is smart, decent, serious, an impression confirmed by the prices. </p> <p>Not that Alwaha is expensive. It's not dirt-cheap, certainly, but given the general price range in London these days there's not much to click your teeth at. I zeroed in on the set lunch at \u00a318, which promised a range of hot and cold dishes for a first course, a mixed grill and a pudding. You might say that \u00a318 for three courses doesn't strike you as being bargain-basement stuff. Nor is it, but there is enough food to eat yourself to a standstill, and of a standard that shames many places that charge twice as much. </p> <p>The bill for the three of us was a princely \u00a373.75, including a modest bottle of Chteau Kefraya - a Lebanese ros\u00e9 of impeccable cut - coffees, waters, orange juices and cover charge, plus a kingly array of tabbouleh, warak inab, hummus shawarma, moutabal, fattoush, foul moukala, moussakat batinjan, batata harra, jawaneh meshwiyh, kibbah maklieh, kallaj bil jiben, not to mention my kebab and the exquisite, pistachio-stuffed, syrup-sodden pastries for pudding. </p> <p>Don't the very names send drifts of the flavours of spices and herbs wafting through the brain? They are an incantation to indulgence. Somehow, vine leaves stuffed with rice, herbs and spices, fried aubergine with chickpeas, onions, aubergines and spices, and grilled chicken wings in garlic sauce don't have quite the same evocative magic. </p> <p>Of course, names aren't everything. There's many a menu that seduces the eye and imagination, only to prove a severe disappointment when you get around to eating the dishes of choice. That does not apply to Alwaha. The place wasn't exactly full to bursting that lunch-time - there was only one other table occupied - but the kitchen wasn't sending out any tired old rubbish. Each dish carried the authentic hallmark of proper middle-eastern cooking - peppy spices, singing herbs, shining flavours, health and happiness in every mouthful, not a stale note, not a sloppy detail in evidence, even in the standard items. The hummus had an unctuous, velvet texture to it, and a subtle, slightly piquant flavour that slithered around the mouth. The tabbouleh sparkled, the proportion of parsley to burghul about 1,000,000:1, as it should be. The kallaj bin jiben is a kind of Lebanese pizza, small but packing a punch through the use of melted halloumi cheese. The kebabs were models of grilled meats. And so on and so on. Each dish had a list of virtues enough for an entire review. </p> <p>That's why \u00a373.85 - \u00a344.75, if you strip out the non-food items - seems a reasonable sum to to me.

He said: \"Europe is not a conspiracy against Britain.

The main task facing the French is vital but not glamourous: to push through the reforms needed to ensure that creaking decision-making machinery will work when new members from the emerging democracies of eastern Europe join in coming years. Between now and the Nice summit in December, French ministers must persuade, cajole and bargain with their EU partners on a narrow but extremely difficult agenda. The key items contrast starkly with the ambitious vision of a Europe led by a bold Franco-German \"pioneer group\" sketched out by President Jacques Chirac in Berlin on Tuesday. True, the new treaty that enshrines the latest changes will not match the scope of the Maastricht agreement of 1992, which launched the single currency project. But without success in Nice, paralysis will surely set in. French officials know this is not a moment for grandstanding: there is already embarrassment in Paris at the glaring difference between their Gaullist president - keen to ally with Germany - and his centre-left prime minister, Lionel Jospin. \"If the 15 [member states] do not meet this challenge, all the other speculations, proposals, reflections and orientations will not have a leg to stand on,\" the foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, warned.

The peacekeepers were on their way from the western town of Masiaka to join a UN convoy at nearby Mile 91 when they were attacked with guns and a rocket-propelled grenade, UN force commander Major-General Vijay Kumar Jetley said. It was not immediately clear who had launched the attack, about 80 miles from the capital, Freetown. The peacekeepers returned fire. One Jordanian was killed and four injured, Gen Jetley said. UN peacekeepers from Nigeria were moving yesterday to reinforce Mile 91, where about 50,000 people have gathered after fleeing rebel attacks on surrounding villages, said a UN spokesman, Manoel de Almeida de Silva, in New York. The attack came as 21 Indian UN troops returned to Freetown after being held for weeks at an eastern base of the Revolutionary United Front.",

      "body": "<p>David Copeland's terrifying campaign ended on a still night in a Hampshire town as the dead and the maimed were still being counted from the wreckage of the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho. Seven unarmed officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad knocked on the door of a semi-detached house in Sunnybank Road, Cove, and heard a voice call out: \"Give me a minute.\"</p> <p>Copeland was half-dressed when he opened the front door. He seemed to be half-expecting the visit. He rubbed his eyes and mumbled: \"Yeah, they were all down to me. I did them on my own.\"</p> <p>Any doubts the officers may have had disappeared when Copeland led them upstairs to his bedroom. Two Nazi flags were hanging on a wall, alongside a macabre collage of photos and newspaper stories.</p> <p>The theme was bomb blasts. There were pictures of victims from explosions in Omagh and at the Olympics in Atlanta - and in the middle of this homage to bloodshed, was a poster of Hitler.</p> <p>On his way to Charing Cross police station for questioning, Copeland sang at the top of his voice. He seemed jubilant. He was also very eager to give detectives a de tailed account of how he made and planted the three devices. But there was one issue he could not explain convincingly, and it became the crux of the trial at the Old Bailey. Why?</p> <p>What had really driven him to murder? Was it, as his lawyers claimed, severe mental illness? Or was his hatred of ethnic minorities and the gay community motivated by ego and evil?</p> <p>There is little in Copeland's background to explain how he became so hateful. Born on May 15, 1976, at the Great Middlesex hospital in Isleworth, he was the second of three sons - his brother John is three years older, Paul is four years younger.</p> <p>His parents, Stephen and Caroline, moved the family to a detached neo-Georgian house in Yateley, when he was 10.</p> <p>Mrs Copeland, who has reverted to her maiden name Woolard following divorce, said David was the quietest of her boys. \"He was very, very gentle, and, out of all my children, the most sensitive, loving and caring. He was never naughty.\"</p> <p><b> Introverted</b><br></p> <p>Copeland studied at Yateley comprehensive and passed seven GSCEs. His friends thought he was a little introverted, but said he was not aggressive or racist.</p> <p>He is small - 5ft 3in - and was occasionally pushed around by other pupils, but he was not bullied. One contemporary, Richard Travers, said: \"He seemed harmless. He didn't seem to have a problem with any of the black kids in our year. He didn't show any sort of violent behaviour.\"</p> <p>After leaving school at 16, Copeland drifted into a few jobs - roofing, fencing, working in McDonalds. He tried to start a band, listened to heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, and experimented with drink and drugs.</p> <p>There were also brushes with the police - Copeland has three minor convictions for common assault, making off without payment and criminal damage. \"I put it down to immaturity and rebelliousness, nothing else,\"said Mr Copeland, an engineer.</p> <p>He believes the turning point in his son's life came on his brother's 16th birthday five years ago. After a row with his wife, she walked out and never returned. The following morning, he told his sons.</p> <p>\"Maybe this triggered his mental illness. Immediately afterwards, he became very angry and very drunk. He never talked about her leaving him and he wouldn't see her.\"</p> <p>Ms Woolard, 47, believes her ex-husband blames her because he is still bitter about their divorce.</p> <p>\"On a prison visit, I asked David if my leaving affected him. And he said 'No, mum'.\"</p> <p>She added: \"There was no reason for him to hate people. He didn't know anyone, as far as I'm aware, who was homosexual. There weren't many black people at his school. All I can think is that, when he finally left home to live in London something must have happened.</p> <p>\"Something was going on in his head. He must have been so lost and unhappy to have done as he's done.\"</p> <p>Copeland himself never mentioned the divorce as having any significance; it seems his phobias set root long before his mother left. He told the police his hatred of gay men stemmed from childhood and was a reaction to his parents thinking he was homosexual.</p> <p>He recalled how when he was 13 they sang the theme tune to the Flintstones, and seemed to emphasise the lyrics ... \"we'll have a gay old time.\"</p> <p>He was appalled that his mother had then asked him if he wanted to confide any secrets. His parents say the episode is a figment of his imagination. Mr Copeland remembered an occasion when his son, then 19, was challenged about his sexuality by his grandmother. She asked him: \"What's up with you, David? Do you like boys, because you haven't got a girlfriend.\"</p> <p>That was the only time the subject of his sexuality was raised. Copeland vowed never to speak to his grandmother again.</p> <p>After his arrest, Copeland claimed he had been having violent and sadistic dreams from the age of 12. He had thought about killing his classmates and had wanted to be reincarnated as an SS officer surrounded by sex slaves. Later, he said he read biographies of Hitler and became privately obsessed with the idea of becoming famous.</p> <p>The explosion in Centennial Park during the Atlanta Olympics, in 1996, seems to have been pivotal. As he watched news reports from the scene, he wondered why nobody had bombed the Notting Hill carnival. He couldn't get the idea out of his head and woke up months later vowing to do it himself. \"I am the first domino,\" he said to one psychiatrist. \"Everything else will fall.\"</p> <p>In 1997 he moved to east London to work with his father as an engineer's commissioning assistant on the Jubilee extension line. In May, he joined the British National Party and attended two meetings, including one which was ambushed by the Anti-Nazi League.</p> <p>Four months later he rang the party's administration office to cancel his subscription and denounced the BNP for refusing to countenance a \"paramilitary struggle\".</p> <p>A year later, Copeland joined the National Socialist Movement, thought to be the political wing of Combat 18. He was recruited by the movement's self-styled leader, Tony Williams, and appointed Hampshire organiser.</p> <p>It was a grand title for a small job - there were only a dozen members, and the organisation collapsed completely after his arrest.</p> <p>Copeland saw his doctor twice in 1998 and was prescribed mild anti-depressants to help him cope with anxiety attacks. He told his GP he was \"losing his mind.\"</p> <p>Nobody doubts Copeland was suffering from some form of depression before the bombing campaign, but the severity of the condition was contested.</p> <p>Five psychiatrists who assessed him when he was on remand at Broadmoor high security hospital concluded he had been suffering from a paranoid schizophrenic illness for several years. One of them, Dr Paul Gilluley, said the visions Copeland spoke of as a teenager were consistent with the first stages of a schizophrenic condition. The Flintstones anecdote was, he said, a sure sign of delusional belief. Some of Copeland's other pronouncements - he claimed he was Jesus and swore God would rescue him - were proof he had lost all rationality.</p> <p>But the retrospective diagnosis was challenged by prosecutors, who were under pressure not to concede to his pleas of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibilty from the victims of those who died and were injured. When Copeland was arrested, he insisted to a psychiatric nurse that he had \"logically and rationally\" planted the devices.</p> <p>Another consultant psychiatrist who examined him, Philip Joseph, concluded that Copeland was not suffering from schizophrenia when he started the campaign, but had a less serious personality disorder.</p> <p>Concerns that some psychiatrists had exaggerated his condition were heightened when the crown discovered Copeland had been writing to a woman, Patsy Scanlon, while on remand. In one of several letters he sent between May and December 1999, he told Scanlon that he couldn't believe he had fooled so many experts over his illness.</p> <p>Copeland didn't know Scanlon was not a penfriend. Scanlon wasn't even a woman. His correspondence had been with a man called Bernard O'Mahoney, who had sold the letters for a substantial sum to the Mirror newspaper.</p> <p>Whatever his mental state, a year after the Centennial Park bomb Copeland began planning his own terror campaign by downloading The Terrorist's Handbook during a visit to a cyber cafe in Victoria, central London.</p> <p>The manual was too complex and in June 1998 he took a second document, How to Make Bombs, Part 2, from the web. This one had simple instructions for building a \"pipe bomb\".</p> <p>The materials he needed were easy to find. He bought fireworks from two shops in Farnborough, alarm clocks for timing devices, tupperware boxes and hundreds of 6in nails from different hardware stores. Copeland experimented with smaller devices, sneaking out of his house late at night to detonate them on a local common.</p> <p>With a primed bomb taped to the inside of a new Head sports bag, Copeland took a train to Waterloo station and then a taxi to Brixton on Saturday, April 17. He had never been to the area before and walked up and down the busy High Street for more than an hour, scouting around its stores and markets. He was surprised so many white people lived there.</p> <p>He finally left the bag against the front of the Iceland shop on the corner of Electric Avenue and took a taxi back to Waterloo. The black bag was spotted by nearby street traders, who looked inside and wondered if it was a device of some kind. Minutes later a man took the bomb out of the bag and rested it on a waist-high stack of wooden pallets. Crucially, the bag was taken away from the scene and recovered intact.</p> <p>Just as the police arrived at 5.25pm, the bomb exploded. Fifty people were injured, including two who lost an eye.

      "bodyText": "David Copeland's terrifying campaign ended on a still night in a Hampshire town as the dead and the maimed were still being counted from the wreckage of the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho. Seven unarmed officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad knocked on the door of a semi-detached house in Sunnybank Road, Cove, and heard a voice call out: \"Give me a minute.\" Copeland was half-dressed when he opened the front door. He seemed to be half-expecting the visit. He rubbed his eyes and mumbled: \"Yeah, they were all down to me. I did them on my own.\" Any doubts the officers may have had disappeared when Copeland led them upstairs to his bedroom. Two Nazi flags were hanging on a wall, alongside a macabre collage of photos and newspaper stories. The theme was bomb blasts. There were pictures of victims from explosions in Omagh and at the Olympics in Atlanta - and in the middle of this homage to bloodshed, was a poster of Hitler. On his way to Charing Cross police station for questioning, Copeland sang at the top of his voice. He seemed jubilant. He was also very eager to give detectives a de tailed account of how he made and planted the three devices. But there was one issue he could not explain convincingly, and it became the crux of the trial at the Old Bailey. Why? What had really driven him to murder? Was it, as his lawyers claimed, severe mental illness? Or was his hatred of ethnic minorities and the gay community motivated by ego and evil? There is little in Copeland's background to explain how he became so hateful. Born on May 15, 1976, at the Great Middlesex hospital in Isleworth, he was the second of three sons - his brother John is three years older, Paul is four years younger. His parents, Stephen and Caroline, moved the family to a detached neo-Georgian house in Yateley, when he was 10. Mrs Copeland, who has reverted to her maiden name Woolard following divorce, said David was the quietest of her boys. \"He was very, very gentle, and, out of all my children, the most sensitive, loving and caring. He was never naughty.\" Introverted Copeland studied at Yateley comprehensive and passed seven GSCEs. His friends thought he was a little introverted, but said he was not aggressive or racist. He is small - 5ft 3in - and was occasionally pushed around by other pupils, but he was not bullied. One contemporary, Richard Travers, said: \"He seemed harmless. He didn't seem to have a problem with any of the black kids in our year. He didn't show any sort of violent behaviour.\" After leaving school at 16, Copeland drifted into a few jobs - roofing, fencing, working in McDonalds. He tried to start a band, listened to heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, and experimented with drink and drugs. There were also brushes with the police - Copeland has three minor convictions for common assault, making off without payment and criminal damage. \"I put it down to immaturity and rebelliousness, nothing else,\"said Mr Copeland, an engineer. He believes the turning point in his son's life came on his brother's 16th birthday five years ago. After a row with his wife, she walked out and never returned. The following morning, he told his sons. \"Maybe this triggered his mental illness. Immediately afterwards, he became very angry and very drunk. He never talked about her leaving him and he wouldn't see her.\" Ms Woolard, 47, believes her ex-husband blames her because he is still bitter about their divorce. \"On a prison visit, I asked David if my leaving affected him. And he said 'No, mum'.\" She added: \"There was no reason for him to hate people. He didn't know anyone, as far as I'm aware, who was homosexual. There weren't many black people at his school. All I can think is that, when he finally left home to live in London something must have happened. \"Something was going on in his head. He must have been so lost and unhappy to have done as he's done.\" Copeland himself never mentioned the divorce as having any significance; it seems his phobias set root long before his mother left. He told the police his hatred of gay men stemmed from childhood and was a reaction to his parents thinking he was homosexual. He recalled how when he was 13 they sang the theme tune to the Flintstones, and seemed to emphasise the lyrics ... \"we'll have a gay old time.\" He was appalled that his mother had then asked him if he wanted to confide any secrets. His parents say the episode is a figment of his imagination. Mr Copeland remembered an occasion when his son, then 19, was challenged about his sexuality by his grandmother. She asked him: \"What's up with you, David? Do you like boys, because you haven't got a girlfriend.\" That was the only time the subject of his sexuality was raised. Copeland vowed never to speak to his grandmother again. After his arrest, Copeland claimed he had been having violent and sadistic dreams from the age of 12. He had thought about killing his classmates and had wanted to be reincarnated as an SS officer surrounded by sex slaves. Later, he said he read biographies of Hitler and became privately obsessed with the idea of becoming famous. The explosion in Centennial Park during the Atlanta Olympics, in 1996, seems to have been pivotal. As he watched news reports from the scene, he wondered why nobody had bombed the Notting Hill carnival. He couldn't get the idea out of his head and woke up months later vowing to do it himself. \"I am the first domino,\" he said to one psychiatrist. \"Everything else will fall.\" In 1997 he moved to east London to work with his father as an engineer's commissioning assistant on the Jubilee extension line. In May, he joined the British National Party and attended two meetings, including one which was ambushed by the Anti-Nazi League. Four months later he rang the party's administration office to cancel his subscription and denounced the BNP for refusing to countenance a \"paramilitary struggle\". A year later, Copeland joined the National Socialist Movement, thought to be the political wing of Combat 18. He was recruited by the movement's self-styled leader, Tony Williams, and appointed Hampshire organiser. It was a grand title for a small job - there were only a dozen members, and the organisation collapsed completely after his arrest. Copeland saw his doctor twice in 1998 and was prescribed mild anti-depressants to help him cope with anxiety attacks. He told his GP he was \"losing his mind.\" Nobody doubts Copeland was suffering from some form of depression before the bombing campaign, but the severity of the condition was contested. Five psychiatrists who assessed him when he was on remand at Broadmoor high security hospital concluded he had been suffering from a paranoid schizophrenic illness for several years. One of them, Dr Paul Gilluley, said the visions Copeland spoke of as a teenager were consistent with the first stages of a schizophrenic condition. The Flintstones anecdote was, he said, a sure sign of delusional belief. Some of Copeland's other pronouncements - he claimed he was Jesus and swore God would rescue him - were proof he had lost all rationality. But the retrospective diagnosis was challenged by prosecutors, who were under pressure not to concede to his pleas of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibilty from the victims of those who died and were injured. When Copeland was arrested, he insisted to a psychiatric nurse that he had \"logically and rationally\" planted the devices. Another consultant psychiatrist who examined him, Philip Joseph, concluded that Copeland was not suffering from schizophrenia when he started the campaign, but had a less serious personality disorder. Concerns that some psychiatrists had exaggerated his condition were heightened when the crown discovered Copeland had been writing to a woman, Patsy Scanlon, while on remand. In one of several letters he sent between May and December 1999, he told Scanlon that he couldn't believe he had fooled so many experts over his illness. Copeland didn't know Scanlon was not a penfriend. Scanlon wasn't even a woman. His correspondence had been with a man called Bernard O'Mahoney, who had sold the letters for a substantial sum to the Mirror newspaper. Whatever his mental state, a year after the Centennial Park bomb Copeland began planning his own terror campaign by downloading The Terrorist's Handbook during a visit to a cyber cafe in Victoria, central London. The manual was too complex and in June 1998 he took a second document, How to Make Bombs, Part 2, from the web. This one had simple instructions for building a \"pipe bomb\". The materials he needed were easy to find. He bought fireworks from two shops in Farnborough, alarm clocks for timing devices, tupperware boxes and hundreds of 6in nails from different hardware stores. Copeland experimented with smaller devices, sneaking out of his house late at night to detonate them on a local common. With a primed bomb taped to the inside of a new Head sports bag, Copeland took a train to Waterloo station and then a taxi to Brixton on Saturday, April 17. He had never been to the area before and walked up and down the busy High Street for more than an hour, scouting around its stores and markets. He was surprised so many white people lived there. He finally left the bag against the front of the Iceland shop on the corner of Electric Avenue and took a taxi back to Waterloo. The black bag was spotted by nearby street traders, who looked inside and wondered if it was a device of some kind. Minutes later a man took the bomb out of the bag and rested it on a waist-high stack of wooden pallets. Crucially, the bag was taken away from the scene and recovered intact. Just as the police arrived at 5.25pm, the bomb exploded. Fifty people were injured, including two who lost an eye. Nine people needed surgery to have nails removed and 28 suffered serious cuts. One of the injured was a baby. Two days later Copeland was in a cafe in Stratford, east London, taking a break from work with his father and a few colleagues. Someone mentioned the bomb and declared a madman was on the loose. \"Dave didn't look taken aback or stressed or suspicious,\" said Mr Copeland. \"He behaved perfectly normally and joined in the general agreement. There was nothing to suggest he'd done anything wrong.\" The explosion stunned Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, which launched an investigation codenamed Operation Marathon. Although nobody had claimed responsibility, deputy assistant commissioner Alan Fry, who was leading the hunt, was uncertain about the motivation. Race was one possibility, others included a link to the war in Kosovo, animal rights extremists or a feud between rival drug gangs. Forensic analysis of the device, which was packed with 1,500 nails, did little to help his evaluation. Hoaxes Two days later, anonymous calls to the incident room claimed the explosion was the work of Combat 18, the White Wolves, the English National Party and the English Liberation Army. Mr Fry knew the calls were probably hoaxes. Combat 18 had been heavily infiltrated and little was known about the White Wolves. Tension grew when threatening letters signed WW were sent to high profile black and Asian community leaders, including the MP Oona King. Copeland later criticised the \"thugs who were trying to steal his glory\". Detectives began scanning closed circuit telelvision coverage coverage of Brix ton and sent hundreds of hours of footage to the FBI to help them isolate individuals. There was an appeal for witnesses on Crimewatch - the last show presented by Jill Dando - and on the following Saturday, there was a reconstruction at the scene.

But it wasn't on my mind to cause that kind of thing.' \"I said 'For Christ's sake, explosives tend to have that effect on people.' And he replied 'I know. I'm sorry. But it was an accidental byproduct of what I was trying to say.' Exactly what that was, I just don't know.\"",

      "body": "<p> Nicholas Stern. The name has the right sort of ring to it for the chief economist at the World Bank. Hard, severe, unbending all the ingredients you would expect from an organisation that has been at the sharp end of the anti-globalisation protests of the past year. It is the sort of name Dickens might have chosen for an economist working his way through rows of figures oblivious to the poverty going on all around him.</p> <p>Sad to say then that Nick Stern fails to conform to type. For a start, he does not look the part. An amiable, gentle man, he looks all wrong for someone who will doubtless soon be branded as the desiccated calculating machine at the bank that likes to say no. What is more, he is no ivory tower number-cruncher, but has a hands-on knowledge of the developing world that reads like a Cook's tour of the globe; India, China, Mexico, Kenya, Russia. Finally, he has a sense of humour. As a season ticket holder at Wimbledon football club, he has needed it.</p> <p>Yet Stern, who takes up his post on Monday, has had three big problems to face as he has prepared to make the step across the Atlantic from the London School of Economics to Washington. </p> <p>The first is the brother problem. Stern's elder brother, Richard, is the bank's vice-president for human resources, and the bank's president James Wolfensohn had to use his prerogative to override the bank's rules against nepotism to hand him the job. The bank's staff association said the offer should have been withdrawn.</p> <p>\"They are understandable concerns,\" says the 54-year-old academic. \"My appointment was recommended unanimously by an independent group that looked at all possible candidates. There is still some concern, but I think that will settle down.\"</p> <p>Has he been damaged by the row? \"I don't think so. The staff association has not questioned my ability to do the job, nor said my brother had any role.\"</p> <p><strong>The Stiglitz factor</strong></p> <p>Problem number two has been the Joe problem. Joe is Joe Stiglitz, Stern's predecessor as the bank's chief economist and a man who made powerful enemies with his devastatingly biting attacks on the so-called Washington consensus, a view of the world driven by the free-market dogmas of the International Monetary Fund, Wall Street and the US treasury.</p> <p> Officially, Stiglitz resigned from the bank: unofficially the story is that his head was demanded by the US treasury secretary, Larry Summers. It also seems that James Wolfensohn, the bank's president, wanted someone with a slightly lower profile as Stiglitz's replacement.</p> <p> Stern is suitably diplomatic. \"I first met Joe in Kenya back in 1969. He is an intellectual giant and his contribution to economics has been absolutely outstanding. He brought understanding and leadership to the World Bank.</p> <p>But if you look at the chief economists down the years they have all been different. The independence of a chief economist is a valuable thing, but that independence comes with a real responsibility. You are the chief economist of the bank and you cannot forget that.</p> <p>However, The furore over his appointment will almost certainly die down and memories of Stiglitz will fade in time. More significant than both is problem number three, the globalisation problem, which has come bubbling to the surface over the past year.</p> <p>The bank's staff was badly shaken by the protests in April, when the police had to seal off a square mile of downtown Washington and bus officials through lines of demonstrators to allow the spring meeting of the IMF and the bank to go ahead. </p> <p>\"I think the anti-globalisation protests are an important development\", said Stern, \"but there are many strands to it. There are a number of different groups and there isn't a coherent set of alternative policies being advanced.</p> <p>\"It's not very clear what they are arguing for, but on the other hand a concern for development and poor countries is very healthy. There have been periods when concern in advanced countries for people in poor countries has not been what it should be.\"</p> <p>Stern says the anti-globalisation arguments lack coherence. </p> <p>\"The record in raising living standards and opening to trade is very clear. If they [the protesters] argue that opening to trade damages the poor I think they are simply wrong. If they argue that market reforms are bad for growth I think they are broadly speaking wrong.\"</p> <p>So how do officials in Washington feel when the protesters say that the Bank is contributing to global poverty? </p> <p>\"The concern to reduce poverty is something that has driven the bank since at least the early 70s. The bank is explicit about combating poverty. Jim Wolfensohn has made it clear that that is the priority. People who have worked 20 years at the bank and devoted their lives to reducing poverty are understandably perturbed by the suggestion that they are doing something else.\" </p> <p>Where he says the bank differs from the past is in its acceptance that markets alone are not enough for strong development but have to be supported by good governance and healthy social and political institutions. </p> <p>\"Is growth important? Yes. Is it exclusively important? No.\"</p> <p>Stern was born and raised in London after the war. His socialist father fled to Britain from Germany after the Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in November 1938 and was interned and shipped to Australia for two years, before returning home in 1942. </p> <p>Born in 1946, Stern was the middle of three brothers, with a much younger sister. He went to school at Latymer, was brought up in Brentford and now lives in Wimbledon. </p> <p>\"My London roots are deep\", he said.</p> <p>After three years studying maths at Cambridge, he swapped to economics, where he came under the wing of the young James Mirrlees, now one of Britain's nobel prize-winning economists. After that, Stern did the circuit of the UK's economics establishments. He then had a spell at Oxford in the 1970s, where Peter Mandelson was one of his students, a period as professor at Warwick, and finally moved to the LSE - where his mother had studied sociology - in 1986.</p> <p>Like many others from the 1960s generation, he caught the travel bug early. He watched England win the 1966 World Cup final on a Black Sea camp site in Sochi during a swing through eastern europe and the middle east and had his first taste of extreme poverty in Ethiopia the following year. From that was spawned the lifelong interest in development economics, which started with a study of the problems of growing tea on small holdings in Kenya in 1969.</p> <p>He says that the biggest academic experience of his life has been a long-running study of the Indian village of Palanpur, which he worked from 1974. In the subsequent 20 years he visited the village most years. Stern says he saw the problems of development at first hand - the haphazard delivery of public services, the schemes for the poor that never materialised, the discrimination against people from poorer castes. Yet he is now optimistic about India's future.</p> <p> \"The country has been growing by 7% a year for the last six years and I think we will become increasingly aware of the real awakening in India.\"</p> <p>It's been going on for some time but it's now gelling.</p> <p>\"The same optimism applies to China, where Stern spent five months teaching in a university in 1988, during the flowering of the student movement that was brutally suppressed in Tianenmen square a year later. </p> <p>\"The growth in China has been phenomenal. You can see it in the way people live their lives the consumer durables, the phones, the increase in life expectancy. But it's got some tough years ahead. What China has to face now is the growth of a big private sector.\"</p> <p><strong>Africa concerns</strong></p> <p>So what then of Africa, the continent that always seems to lag behind the rest? </p> <p>\"Africa is obviously deeply worrying. When I went there for the first time in the 60s countries were emerging from the period of independence and it seemed full of optimism. What has happened is much more chaotic and difficult.\"</p> <p>Stern says that post-apartheid South Africa is going to play a pivotal role and says he is deeply deeply impressed with the new regime. </p> <p>\"The country has enormous strengths and can be a very powerful influence in showing what can be done in an inclusive society with a strong business climate.\"</p> <p>Towards the end of 1993, Stern left the LSE to become chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. By the autumn of last year he decided to return to academia, only to be wooed back into development economics by Jim Wolfensohn. Why? Reeling off a list of former Bank chief economists, Stern says it was an offer he could not refuse.</p> <p>\"This is the biggest group of people by far working on development. It is something that has consumed me all my life. It was a chance to help set the policy ideas of the most important development institution there is. It was just not possible to say no.\"</p>",

      "trailText": "The Hague on TV is merely the latest construct of his handlers",
      "byline": "Mark Lawson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Both the BBC and the House of Commons use the title Question Time for their most important sessions of political debate. The usual wisdom is that William Hague is best at the Question Time chaired by Betty Boothroyd, while Tony Blair most convinces in the version hosted by David Dimbleby. But the consensus also holds that performance in the padded black chair has more impact on the electorate than answers given on the green leather benches.</p> <p>So Thursday's hour-long edition of BBC1's Question Time - with Hague as the only guest - was the most significant test yet of the skills and opinions of a man who, as Dimbleby noted with commendable evenness, \"believes he may be in Downing Street a year from now\".</p> <p>It can't have helped Hague's nerves that the first two questions concerned the circumstances in which he might hand over to Michael Portillo, either voluntarily or unwillingly. It is a measure of the Conservative problem that since at least 1988, the leader at any given time has been measured against the alternative charisma of a colleague. Thatcher was stalked by Heseltine; Major by Thatcher and Redwood among others. Now Hague, the first Tory leader to skip free of Thatcher's shadow, finds another spectre beside him. Admittedly the BBC built this up by placing the vice-presidential questions first. I don't want to sound Tebbitite about it, but was it really fair to begin the programme by questioning Hague's political legitimacy?</p> <p>Perhaps the producers were placing the least boring material in the foreground. It must be rare for a 60-minute interview with a party leader to produce no newspaper headlines at all. But, if England's openers played a bat as straight as Hague's on Question Time, the West Indies wouldn't have taken a wicket yet this summer. Though uneasy when pressed on immigration policy by non-white questioners, he pulled back from his recent hissy populism on Europe and the right to murder burglars.</p> <p>Tony Blair spent the two years before the 1997 election being as boring as possible on television. This was a deliberate attempt to avoid giving hostile newspapers lines to twist which might frighten the horses of Middle England. But Blair was offering himself as a more cautious alternative to a regime seen as having over-reached itself. When the main voter dissatisfaction with Blair is inaction, it is hard to see what Hague gains by offering himself as a stabiliser. His populist rhetoric may have been unpleasant but it was at least an alternative.</p> <p>Hague's main distance tactic - a disparaging reference to \"focus groups\", which he claimed not to use - showed that he's trying to position himself as a spin-homeopath, making no use of the media doctors who surround Blair. But this position is ridiculous. In his short time as party leader, Hague has been successively repackaged according to theories of what might appeal to media and voters.</p> <p>Watching his Question Time performance, it seemed to me that Hague has - like Margaret Thatcher before him - been receiving vocal coaching. Because he doesn't use focus groups, it can't have been those who took against his Yorkshire growl, so presumably it was a friend: he seemed deliberately to be pitching his voice higher and softer. Hague also seemed to be copying the most unfortunate of New Labour's TV tactics: the sudden smile (as practised with equal inefficiency by Gordon Brown and John Prescott), which attempts to show that strong questioning is welcome.</p> <p>In fact, Mr Hague's image-makers should take him away to have a brass neck fitted if they intend to continue his claims to be the enemy of political spin. The Hague seen on TV is merely the latest construct of his handlers, who are currently trying keep-the-pound speeches and a No 1 haircut.</p> <p>Ah, the hair.

      "bodyText": "Both the BBC and the House of Commons use the title Question Time for their most important sessions of political debate. The usual wisdom is that William Hague is best at the Question Time chaired by Betty Boothroyd, while Tony Blair most convinces in the version hosted by David Dimbleby. But the consensus also holds that performance in the padded black chair has more impact on the electorate than answers given on the green leather benches. So Thursday's hour-long edition of BBC1's Question Time - with Hague as the only guest - was the most significant test yet of the skills and opinions of a man who, as Dimbleby noted with commendable evenness, \"believes he may be in Downing Street a year from now\". It can't have helped Hague's nerves that the first two questions concerned the circumstances in which he might hand over to Michael Portillo, either voluntarily or unwillingly. It is a measure of the Conservative problem that since at least 1988, the leader at any given time has been measured against the alternative charisma of a colleague. Thatcher was stalked by Heseltine; Major by Thatcher and Redwood among others. Now Hague, the first Tory leader to skip free of Thatcher's shadow, finds another spectre beside him. Admittedly the BBC built this up by placing the vice-presidential questions first. I don't want to sound Tebbitite about it, but was it really fair to begin the programme by questioning Hague's political legitimacy? Perhaps the producers were placing the least boring material in the foreground. It must be rare for a 60-minute interview with a party leader to produce no newspaper headlines at all. But, if England's openers played a bat as straight as Hague's on Question Time, the West Indies wouldn't have taken a wicket yet this summer. Though uneasy when pressed on immigration policy by non-white questioners, he pulled back from his recent hissy populism on Europe and the right to murder burglars. Tony Blair spent the two years before the 1997 election being as boring as possible on television. This was a deliberate attempt to avoid giving hostile newspapers lines to twist which might frighten the horses of Middle England. But Blair was offering himself as a more cautious alternative to a regime seen as having over-reached itself. When the main voter dissatisfaction with Blair is inaction, it is hard to see what Hague gains by offering himself as a stabiliser. His populist rhetoric may have been unpleasant but it was at least an alternative. Hague's main distance tactic - a disparaging reference to \"focus groups\", which he claimed not to use - showed that he's trying to position himself as a spin-homeopath, making no use of the media doctors who surround Blair. But this position is ridiculous. In his short time as party leader, Hague has been successively repackaged according to theories of what might appeal to media and voters. Watching his Question Time performance, it seemed to me that Hague has - like Margaret Thatcher before him - been receiving vocal coaching. Because he doesn't use focus groups, it can't have been those who took against his Yorkshire growl, so presumably it was a friend: he seemed deliberately to be pitching his voice higher and softer. Hague also seemed to be copying the most unfortunate of New Labour's TV tactics: the sudden smile (as practised with equal inefficiency by Gordon Brown and John Prescott), which attempts to show that strong questioning is welcome. In fact, Mr Hague's image-makers should take him away to have a brass neck fitted if they intend to continue his claims to be the enemy of political spin. The Hague seen on TV is merely the latest construct of his handlers, who are currently trying keep-the-pound speeches and a No 1 haircut. Ah, the hair. The great political columnist Alan Watkins has long maintained that, since the blip of Churchill who had other qualities, the English have always voted for the main party leader with the most impressive head of hair. Hence Margaret Thatcher's Boadicean helmet did for the exposed scalps of Callaghan and Kinnock. In 1997, choosing between two comb-users, the electorate favoured Blair's bouncy brown over Major's flat grey. According to this theory, John Smith would never have been prime minister and William Hague never can be as long as the many trichological consultants rumoured to be in touch with No 10 hold back the peep-through genes from his bald dad tugging at the prime minister's roots. The problem for the hirsute Mr Watkins is that scalp fashion has recently changed dramatically. Mr Hague is the first bald party leader to run in a culture of elective-slaphead men, in which footballers and pop stars deliberately shave off impressive barnets. Therefore the distinction between the smooth men and the hairy men is theoretically less. Mr Hague's scalp doctors have played to this by shaving back the stubbornly fluffy bits at the sides. He does look better, if somewhat butch. But - judging from his biggest TV test - Hague's problem will not be his shiny scalp but the sparseness of his policies.

Since then, Mr Terry claims his operation has been repeatedly postponed. A spokeswoman for Mr Terry's local health authority, West Hertfordshire, said the delay was not a question of finance.",

The deputy prime minister and the architect are due to meet shortly.</p> <p>In an unexpected, shorter and punchier report recently, Lord Rogers made clear the government had to move \"faster and further\". More controversially, he urged ministers to divert funds from rich parts of England to poorer cities in order to relieve \"stressed out\" urban areas. The report warned: \"There is no ducking this highly contentious issue.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, interviewed by the BBC, Lord Rogers said there had been too little effort across Whitehall to put his recommendations into practice.</p> <p>He added: \"We would have liked to have had more funding. I have to say that whereas John Prescott, I think, is doing his best, there is no real realisation of the problems across [Whitehall] departments. We are calling on the prime minister to say it is cross-departmental. It is no good putting money into education and hospitals if you can't get to the area and everybody wants to leave.\"</p> <p>He further raised the temperature of the debate by indicating that time was running out for some cities. \"We do live in some of the worst cities in Europe and unfortunately we really are at the bottom of the ladder even though we are very wealthy,\" he added.</p> <p>Nick Raynsford, the housing minister, defended the government's record, saying that Lord Rogers's report required coordinated action by several departments. \"I think Lord Rogers is being a little bit unfair because some of the recommendations have been implemented,\" he added.</p> <p>In fact, new planning guidelines recently issued by Mr Raynsford have been widely welcomed as a move towards encouraging city rebuilding. These tell developers to exam ine recycled, or \"brownfield\" land, before considering \"greenfield\" building.</p> <p>But the House Builders' Federation, representing the big builders, defended Lord Rogers last night. \"Many 'brownfield' sites are expensive to buy and even more expensive to clean up,\" it said. \"The government must understand that public subsidy is the only way of making these sites viable.\"</p>",

Crucially, ministers were urged to provide a range of low-tax incentives for developers and local councils in special urban priority areas to encourage regeneration - and it appears that Mr Prescott has now lost that battle with the Treasury. The deputy prime minister and the architect are due to meet shortly. In an unexpected, shorter and punchier report recently, Lord Rogers made clear the government had to move \"faster and further\". More controversially, he urged ministers to divert funds from rich parts of England to poorer cities in order to relieve \"stressed out\" urban areas. The report warned: \"There is no ducking this highly contentious issue.\" Yesterday, interviewed by the BBC, Lord Rogers said there had been too little effort across Whitehall to put his recommendations into practice. He added: \"We would have liked to have had more funding. I have to say that whereas John Prescott, I think, is doing his best, there is no real realisation of the problems across [Whitehall] departments. We are calling on the prime minister to say it is cross-departmental. It is no good putting money into education and hospitals if you can't get to the area and everybody wants to leave.\" He further raised the temperature of the debate by indicating that time was running out for some cities. \"We do live in some of the worst cities in Europe and unfortunately we really are at the bottom of the ladder even though we are very wealthy,\" he added. Nick Raynsford, the housing minister, defended the government's record, saying that Lord Rogers's report required coordinated action by several departments. \"I think Lord Rogers is being a little bit unfair because some of the recommendations have been implemented,\" he added. In fact, new planning guidelines recently issued by Mr Raynsford have been widely welcomed as a move towards encouraging city rebuilding. These tell developers to exam ine recycled, or \"brownfield\" land, before considering \"greenfield\" building. But the House Builders' Federation, representing the big builders, defended Lord Rogers last night. \"Many 'brownfield' sites are expensive to buy and even more expensive to clean up,\" it said. \"The government must understand that public subsidy is the only way of making these sites viable.\"",

Only 11% felt ministers had handled the problem \"well\" or \"about right\". Some 45% felt the government had handled it \"poorly\".</p> <p>However, 39% believe the trouble would have happened whatever the government had tried to do.</p> <p>Some 44% support the current legal position under which the passports of hooligans who have been convicted of football-related offences can be confiscated to stop them travelling abroad to international matches.</p> <p>But 48% of those polled say ministers should go further and allow the police to confiscate the passports of those who are only suspected of being involved in football-related violence, even if they have not been convicted of any offence.</p> <p>\u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,061 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between June 23 and June 26.

      "bodyText": "England's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup appeared on the brink of collapse yesterday following a controversial report by Fifa, world football's governing body, showing that English football facilities are way below those of two rival countries hoping to stage the tournament. The report comes just five days before Fifa chooses the country to host the tournament and was drawn up by an inspection team which visited English football grounds late last year. The report claims that facilities in England are below those of Germany and South Africa, the two countries considered favourties for the tournament, leading to accusations from organisers of England's bid that there is a political agenda behind Fifa's criticisms. Former sports minister Tony Banks, who has been working on England's bid, which has cost almost \u00a310m and involved travel around the world, said the report was an insult to football in this country and that Fifa was actively working to promote the Germans. The English bid has been headed by former World Cup winners Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst. Brazil and Morocco also hope to stage the tournament but their facilities have been ranked below England's. Mr Banks said: \"Yes, I have seen that report. We have very reliable information that ... they have rated South Africa as being superior in terms of football facilities to England. \"Now quite frankly I don't believe even in South Africa that they believe that, and certainly the rest of the world won't believe that. \"It's all par for the course for the Fifa inspection team, but if this is true of course, they probably believe that Elvis Presley is alive and living on the moon.\" England's officials are in Luxembourg addressing delegates from Uefa, European football's governing body, who have eight votes on the 24-member Fifa executive, which will decide the host country for 2006. Mr Banks added: \"We've got some problems on our hands because we have clearly got the Uefa machine working for Germany and the Fifa machine working for South Africa.\" Ironically, the damning report on English football facilities comes as a Guardian/ICM poll shows that barely a majority of the British public backs the 2006 bid. The survey also found that the staging of football's premier event is still very much a male passion. While a clear majority of men - 56% to 37% - want to see England stage the World Cup, more women - 47% to 42% - want it staged elsewhere. The poll shows that those most enthusiastic for the game remain overwhelmingly the skilled working class who quite strongly want to see the tournament staged in England. C1 voters - broadly the lower middle class and skilled working class - split 57% to 37% in favour of staging the tournament. Support for the bid is weakest among upper middle class voters - in the AB social class - who are 48% to 42% against. The poll found little support for the government's handling of violence by England fans during Euro 2000. Only 11% felt ministers had handled the problem \"well\" or \"about right\". Some 45% felt the government had handled it \"poorly\". However, 39% believe the trouble would have happened whatever the government had tried to do. Some 44% support the current legal position under which the passports of hooligans who have been convicted of football-related offences can be confiscated to stop them travelling abroad to international matches. But 48% of those polled say ministers should go further and allow the police to confiscate the passports of those who are only suspected of being involved in football-related violence, even if they have not been convicted of any offence. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,061 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between June 23 and June 26. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

Speaking to reporters afterwards, he said: \"Honestly, I think anyone who wanted to attend could attend, and that's fine.\"</p> <p>Also present was the chancellor, Gordon Brown, chairman of the Diana memorial committee which steered the \u00a31.7m playground and \u00a31.3m memorial walk in the royal parks through endless disputes with supporters who wanted more, opponents who wanted less, and local residents who wanted nothing at all in their park. He said: \"This is a day for talking to the children, and that's what I'm going to do.\"</p> <p>Rosa Monckton, one of the princess's closest friends, said: \"I don't want anything written to detract from this day, and I am sure that members of the royal family will visit in private now that it is open.\"</p> <p>Her five-year-old daughter Domenica, the princess's last goddaughter, performed the opening ceremony. She has Down's syndrome and has had years of speech training. Her mother repeated her words to the crowd, but there was no need. Her \"I open this garden for godmother Diana\" was perfectly clear. The microphone clipped to the front of her dress just picked up the warm \"Well done!\" whispered by the chancellor.</p> <p>It was left to the arts minister, Alan Howarth, to say passionately: \"This is something which seems to me very pri vate, very sensitive, and perhaps painful, inevitably provoking memories of [the princes'] mother. I think her sons are entitled to grieve in their own manner. The Prince of Wales had long-standing engagements. He is a wonderful servant of his country, employed today on public duties. I would very strongly suggest that no one should venture any criticism of him.\"</p> <p>As the stilted interviews went on and on, Emily Weldon, seven, looking longingly at the rocks, the fountains, the golden sand and the pirate galleon, lost her temper. \"Tell those cameras to go away and let us play!\" she shouted, and eventually they did.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Kensington Gardens yesterday it was the regrets rather than the acceptances which were noted: the Prince of Wales was busy in Dorset, his sons had considered it carefully and decided not to come, and Buckingham Palace man aged to give the impression that the other royals had been too polite to attend the opening of a spectacular new playground - the first public memorial to Diana, Princess of Wales - in case they were gatecrashing. The young princes presumably decided to stay away for fear their mother's life would be commemorated much as it was lived, in an unlovely media circus. In the event it was a day of good behaviour and polite words through clenched teeth from the grown-ups, and whoops of glee from the children who had not realised there was anything sensitive about the opening of the playground. Earl Spencer, who memorably vowed at his sister's funeral to keep her spirit alive in the princes, first turned down the invitation, and then apparently agreed to come only when he realised he would not be meeting any of her former in-laws. Yesterday he stood with his arms around his four children throughout the speeches on the eve of what would have been Diana's 39th birthday, praising her playfulness, kindness, and love of children. Speaking to reporters afterwards, he said: \"Honestly, I think anyone who wanted to attend could attend, and that's fine.\" Also present was the chancellor, Gordon Brown, chairman of the Diana memorial committee which steered the \u00a31.7m playground and \u00a31.3m memorial walk in the royal parks through endless disputes with supporters who wanted more, opponents who wanted less, and local residents who wanted nothing at all in their park. He said: \"This is a day for talking to the children, and that's what I'm going to do.\" Rosa Monckton, one of the princess's closest friends, said: \"I don't want anything written to detract from this day, and I am sure that members of the royal family will visit in private now that it is open.\" Her five-year-old daughter Domenica, the princess's last goddaughter, performed the opening ceremony. She has Down's syndrome and has had years of speech training. Her mother repeated her words to the crowd, but there was no need. Her \"I open this garden for godmother Diana\" was perfectly clear. The microphone clipped to the front of her dress just picked up the warm \"Well done!\" whispered by the chancellor. It was left to the arts minister, Alan Howarth, to say passionately: \"This is something which seems to me very pri vate, very sensitive, and perhaps painful, inevitably provoking memories of [the princes'] mother. I think her sons are entitled to grieve in their own manner. The Prince of Wales had long-standing engagements. He is a wonderful servant of his country, employed today on public duties. I would very strongly suggest that no one should venture any criticism of him.\" As the stilted interviews went on and on, Emily Weldon, seven, looking longingly at the rocks, the fountains, the golden sand and the pirate galleon, lost her temper. \"Tell those cameras to go away and let us play!\" she shouted, and eventually they did.",

      "bodyText": "Three years after Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule, Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive who was hand picked by Beijing to lead the region, faces a crisis in public confidence. Fewer than one in four Hongkongers said that they were satisfied with the performance of Mr Tung's government in a poll published yesterday, the eve of the handover's anniversary. Ironically, Mr Tung received a huge pat on the back only last week from Beijing when top Chinese leaders told a visiting delegation of Hong Kong tycoons that he was doing a good job. The Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, said that Mr Tung had shown \"wisdom and capability to govern under a complicated situation\" and urged the territory's business community to support him. But testimonials of this type have not impressed the Hong Kong public who have taken to the streets to draw attention to a wide range of complaints, while the legislative council (LegCo) defied Mr Tung by passing a vote of no confidence in two senior housing officials earlier this week. Wednesday's censure vote followed a series of scandals about faulty construction work in public projects, and anxiety about depressed property prices and a shortage of low-income housing. One of the officials, the housing authority chairwoman, Rosanna Wong, resigned in spite of an earlier vow by Mr Tung that she would remain at her post. Five separate rallies last weekend brought out demonstrators in a wave of anger against government policies on doctors' salaries, social welfare restructuring, urban renewal policies and the right of some mainland Chinese to live in Hong Kong, as well as on housing. In short, as the political temperature starts to rise ahead of September's LegCo elections, Mr Tung is beginning to pay a heavy price for Hong Kong's lack of public accountability. \"I hoped the government would not be so reluctant to face a new political culture,\" commented Tsang Yok-sing, leader of the pro-government Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, who surprisingly voted for the censure. \"Whether you like it or not, it has already arrived.\" Critics say that the appointed housing officials were scapegoats, sacrificed to quell the disquiet caused by Mr Tung's reluctance to introduce a ministerial system which would take responsibility for the government's mistakes. The region has inherited from Britain a government system where the chief executive (formerly the governor) is approved by the parent country and rules through an appointed executive council answerable to no one. Attempts by the last British governor, Chris Patten, to make LegCo a fully elected body were frustrated by Beijing. Its powers, as under the British, are strictly limited; Mr Tung's administration is only obliged to give an annual policy address, answer questions from legislators and seek their approval for spending plans. The legislators - of whom only a third are directly elected - cannot legislate except with government consent. The voting system has been devised to make it impossible for a private member's bill to succeed without the approval of the mainly pro-government legislators, chosen by special-interest \"functional constituencies\". But in the censure vote the traditionally docile Liberal party swung the balance. The Liberal party chief, James Tien, said his party favoured a ministerial system and demanded a \"culture of accountability\". In this September's LegCo elections, the number of directly elected members will rise modestly, to 24 from 20, out of the 60 seats. The functional constituencies will continue to hold 30 seats, with the remaining six chosen by an election committee. In some ways fears that Hong Kong might lose interest in politics have been dispelled by the current storm. It appears to show that even though the pro-reform Democratic party has been losing ground, public concern about Hong Kong's political future has become widespread.",

Pensioners and tourists are already flocking to a visitor centre in Lernacken where they can drink cold beer and gaze at the bridge as it dips gently towards Denmark.</p> <p>The proud Danes, used to seeing hoards of Swedes make the 45-minute ferry crossing to stock up on cheap beer in Copenhagen, believe that the traffic will all be one way.</p> <p>It is already a bit like the Calais booze cruises, with alcohol-starved Swedes loading cheap Danish beer into wheelbarrows, one said.</p> <p>\"Until now we haven't had much to do with them, apart from selling them cheap beer,\" a sceptical Copenhagen resident said.</p> <p>\"The Swedes have a stiff upper lip like the Brits. Why would we want to go over there? Everything is expensive in Sweden, you can't drink, the Swedes are boring and there's nothing to do.\"</p> <p>But Sven-Eric Soder of the Swedish foreign ministry says the bridge will bring benefits to both countries.</p> <p>\"The consumer will be the winner, because it will be easier to travel. Clothes and shoes are cheaper in Denmark and it's cheaper to buy a car there. But it's cheaper to go to the dentist's in Sweden.</p> <p>\"Fifty years ago it took three hours to cross Oresund. Today it takes three quarters of an hour, and now it will take just 10 minutes. I think the bridge is wonderful and beautiful. It looks like it has always been there.\"</p> <p>Erik Pedersen, a Swedish pensioner, who lives near the bridge, agreed. \"We love it and we really need it. Slowly we will become nearer to each other. I will take the train to visit Copenhagen to relax and shop.\"</p> <p>But Lizbet Nielson, a Swedish pensioner at the Lernacken visitor centre, regretted that the journey to Copenhagen would now be so short that she would not have enough time to drink a beer. \"It will be okay with the train but you won't be able to enjoy a beer.</p> <p>But detractors are few. \"The people living here are really proud of it: 99% of people are in favour,\" a Dane visiting Sweden said.</p> <p>Bengt Falk, a Swedish pensioner, gazing at the bridge through his binoculars, saw it as an important indicator of the growing importance of Europe's regions.</p> <p>\"They've been talking about this bridge for almost a hundred years, but it's better late than never. It's incredibly important for the regions. Regions are becoming more important than countries.\"</p> <p>There is a certain irony in the project, which has not been lost on the Danes. Southern Sweden, or Scania, once belonged to Denmark and only became part of Sweden in 1658 after a bloody battle.</p> <p>This, said Mette Kragholm, who works at the bridge exhibition centre, was making the otherwise apathetic Danish public more interested in making the crossing.</p> <p>\"There is an idea that we're taking back Scania, but we're going to do it peacefully this time.\"</p> <p>But the Swedes, she said, still had more to gain from the bridge than the Danes.</p> <p>\"Sweden will be empty on Sunday, because they'll all be over here.\"</p>",

The project, it is said, will regenerate southern Sweden, create a dynamic economic area of 3.5m people to rival other European powerhouses, and bring together 11 universities and 130,000 students. \"The Swedes need a metropolis since their own capital is 600km [375 miles] away,\" said Henrik Koster, manager of the bridge exhibition centre on the Danish side. \"We want to be good competitors with Hamburg and Amsterdam, and if we link the two together we can have something good. It's funny that we are one of the smallest countries in the world and that we have built this. \"People ask me how how we can afford to spend so much money on a bridge, and I say because we can, because we're stinking rich,\" he jokes. Enthusiasm for the project has so far been much greater on the Swedish side. Pensioners and tourists are already flocking to a visitor centre in Lernacken where they can drink cold beer and gaze at the bridge as it dips gently towards Denmark. The proud Danes, used to seeing hoards of Swedes make the 45-minute ferry crossing to stock up on cheap beer in Copenhagen, believe that the traffic will all be one way. It is already a bit like the Calais booze cruises, with alcohol-starved Swedes loading cheap Danish beer into wheelbarrows, one said. \"Until now we haven't had much to do with them, apart from selling them cheap beer,\" a sceptical Copenhagen resident said. \"The Swedes have a stiff upper lip like the Brits. Why would we want to go over there? Everything is expensive in Sweden, you can't drink, the Swedes are boring and there's nothing to do.\" But Sven-Eric Soder of the Swedish foreign ministry says the bridge will bring benefits to both countries. \"The consumer will be the winner, because it will be easier to travel. Clothes and shoes are cheaper in Denmark and it's cheaper to buy a car there. But it's cheaper to go to the dentist's in Sweden. \"Fifty years ago it took three hours to cross Oresund. Today it takes three quarters of an hour, and now it will take just 10 minutes. I think the bridge is wonderful and beautiful. It looks like it has always been there.\" Erik Pedersen, a Swedish pensioner, who lives near the bridge, agreed. \"We love it and we really need it. Slowly we will become nearer to each other. I will take the train to visit Copenhagen to relax and shop.\" But Lizbet Nielson, a Swedish pensioner at the Lernacken visitor centre, regretted that the journey to Copenhagen would now be so short that she would not have enough time to drink a beer. \"It will be okay with the train but you won't be able to enjoy a beer. But detractors are few. \"The people living here are really proud of it: 99% of people are in favour,\" a Dane visiting Sweden said. Bengt Falk, a Swedish pensioner, gazing at the bridge through his binoculars, saw it as an important indicator of the growing importance of Europe's regions. \"They've been talking about this bridge for almost a hundred years, but it's better late than never. It's incredibly important for the regions. Regions are becoming more important than countries.\" There is a certain irony in the project, which has not been lost on the Danes. Southern Sweden, or Scania, once belonged to Denmark and only became part of Sweden in 1658 after a bloody battle. This, said Mette Kragholm, who works at the bridge exhibition centre, was making the otherwise apathetic Danish public more interested in making the crossing. \"There is an idea that we're taking back Scania, but we're going to do it peacefully this time.\" But the Swedes, she said, still had more to gain from the bridge than the Danes. \"Sweden will be empty on Sunday, because they'll all be over here.\"",

      "bodyText": "The British director of the Montserrat volcano observatory has resigned, adding to Britain's difficulties in handling the Caribbean island's protracted crisis. Simon Young has refused a new contract because his recently born daughter is barred for health reasons from living on the island, partly devastated by the active Soufriere Hills volcano. Since Zoe was born three months ago he has commuted by helicopter from the nearby island of Antigua. He told Radio Montserrat that he had been unable to reach agreement on a new contract with the British Geological Survey, which takes over the management of the observatory from the Department for International Development (DfID) today. \"They will not allow my baby to even spend one evening on Montserrat, because they believe that the volcanic ash may pose some long-term threat to her health,\" he said. He was \"very disappointed\" to be leaving, especially since the volcano was expected to become more active. The 5,000 or so Montserratians who remain on the island live in the safe north; two thirds of the island remains an \"exclusion zone\", including the capital, Plymouth, which has been virtually destroyed by volcanic activity. A spokesman for the DfID, which funds the observatory, said the rule that expatriates' children under the age of 12 must not live on the island was introduced in late 1997, at the height of the crisis, because there was no paediatrician on the island, and no facilities for night flying. In March the island's chief medical officer, Dr Colin Avery, suggested to the DfID that it might be advisable to seek a second opinion about the ban. \"If expatriate babies and children under 12 are not allowed on island,\" he wrote in a letter leaked to the Montserrat Reporter in April, \"why are we not advising the government of Montserrat to evacuate all children under 12 years?\" A mission due to visit the island in August will reassess standards of health care, especially paediatric provision. The heliport is being improved, but the work does not seem to have any priority.

On trial for ransacking a half-built McDonald's restaurant in the southern French town of Millau last August, Mr Bov\u00e9 and nine fellow members of his Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne small farmers' union could face five years in prison and fines of up to \u00a350,000. But that did not seem the main concern of the estimated 30,000 protesters crammed into the small town, more than doubling its population. \"Even if it rains, we'll carry on partying,\" one small crowd of demonstrators chanted to the rhythm of a bass drum. Others outside the courthouse carried large banners saying \"The World is Not for Sale\" - the title of Mr Bov\u00e9's book, which has become a bestseller in France. He has turned his trial into a huge anti-globalisation party, featuring concerts by French rock bands, a feast to promote traditional French food and more than a dozen public debates led by intellectuals and activists. But justice officials insisted that the happy gathering would not influence the outcome of the two-day trial. \"There is no question of taking French justice hostage,\" said the court president, Fran\u00e7ois Mallet. \"What happens in the street does not interest this court.\" Mr Bov\u00e9 and his friends trashed the McDonald's restaurant as part of a symbolic protest against America's decision to impose crippling import duties on a variety of emblematic French goods including Roquefort cheese, for which Millau is famous, Dijon mustard and foie gras. The US move, itself a retaliation for the European Union's decision to ban imports of hormone-treated beef, sparked anger among France's traditional farmers and provided a focus for growing Gallic misgivings about the power of American multinationals, the inequality of world trade, and the dangers of industrialised food. The moustachioed activist, a veteran of protests in the Pacific against French nuclear testing, has become almost as well known in America as he is in France after leading protests against November's world trade talks in Seattle. The US magazine Business Week recently named him one of the top 50 people helping to shape the new Europe. His popularity is due in part to his capacity to boil complex issues down to pithy protest statements. Asked once why he didn't resolve his differences by having McDonald's put Roquefort on cheeseburgers, he replied: \"That would be like selling holy water in a sex shop.\" In front of the McDonald's restaurant they dismantled almost a year ago, a small group of sheep farmers set up a stand where visitors could buy a slice of pungent Roquefort cheese, a glass of wine and a sticker denouncing globalisation, all for \u00a31.

The Western Cape nature conservation board hopes a recent change in the weather will keep the spill away from the island and save them from the nightmare of having to evacuate the penguins. So far only small patches of oil have washed up on the southern shore of the 220-hectare (550-acre) island, six miles off the coast, which normally has a population of 55,000 adult penguins and six humans. About 1,300 oily penguins have been rescued and sent to the mainland for rehabilitation and there are thought to be at least 1,000 more contaminated birds, according to the reserve manager, Anton Wolfaardt.

      "bodyText": "Carlos Ghosn has a reputation as a corporate hard man. Even before his appointment last year as Renault's choice to run Nissan - surely the toughest job in the motor industry - he was known as \"le cost killer\". Mr Ghosn has already shown the Japanese his mettle. At a shareholders meeting this month he confronted a group of sokaiya - racketeers who try to drag out shareholder meetings in the hope management will pay them off-head on. Mr Ghosn will face tougher battles as he tries to change Nissan's corporate culture and bring the car company back into black. He was born in Brazil and educated in France at the Ecole Polytechnique and then at the Ecole des Mines de Paris. He joined Michelin in 1978 and held posts in manufacturing and research and development in France before he ran the tyre maker's business in Brazil and then in North America. In 1996 he joined Renault as an executive vice-president where his approach quickly brought him the soubriquet \"le cost killer\". \"He has a reputation for being ruthless in the way in which he carries out tasks,\" said one industry executive. In 1999 Renault bought a 36.8% stake in Nissan and sent Mr Ghosn to Japan to turn the business round. Initially he was appointed chief operating officer but was appointed president this month.",

      "bodyText": "Zetters is planning to reinvent itself as an international online financial spread-betting operation after a decline in its core football pools business. The company is understood to have applied to the financial services authority for regulatory clearance to compete with bookies IG Index and City Index by offering punters the chance to bet on a range of stock market prices. Chief executive Tony Wollenberg said Zetters was also talking to potential partners in the US and Far East about tapping \"vast\" overseas gaming markets. He hopes that making Zetters available through the internet, digital television and handheld web access devices will attract people who do not use betting shops. Bets placed on share price changes, interest rate moves and index levels are among the fastest-growing areas of the bookmaking industry. That has led IG Index to seek a \u00a3115m flotation next month. However, Mr Wollenberg warned that Zetters might relocate to an offshore tax haven if the government refused to reduce the betting levy. The declining popularity of football pools was reflected in full-year results to March 31. Turnover fell by \u00a35m to \u00a310.42m, pre-tax profit slipped from \u00a31.54m to \u00a31.14m.

There were more than 280 participants from 13 nations, although no women competed. The events were open to everyone - there were no national teams - and silver medals were awarded to the winner of each event. </p> <p>The next three Olympics, in Paris (1900), St Louis (1904) and London (1908) saw the Games revert to little more than a side-show and all three were staged as part of larger trade exhibitions. Because of the first world war no Games were staged from 1912 to 1920, but from 1924 on, apart from another gap because of the second world war, the Games were held every four years, growing in strength, sophistication and, often, controversy. </p> <p>Although there are few precedents for this sale in the UK, there are some guidelines.

But he was also a member of a silver medal winning four by 100 metres relay team, which was run in 42 seconds, a British record which stood for 28 years. </p> <p>The collection includes his silver medal, along with other medals awarded to Abrahams, including a participation medal for the 1948 London Olympics and an Academie des Sports gold medal awarded in 1925 in recognition of his athletic achievements. </p> <p>Although Abrahams' career was tragically cut short when he broke a leg as a result of a long-jump accident in 1925, he maintained life-long links with the sport as an administrator and patron. His collection is estimated to realise \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000, which would compare favourably with mementoes of a footballer of similar stature. </p> <p>There is probably nothing in football, cricket or golf to match the Olympic flame. The continual burning of the flame throughout the Games was introduced at the Amsterdam Games in 1928, and the torch relay from Olympia in Greece to the host city was introduced at the Berlin Games in 1936. A number of Olympic torches are on offer at the sale.

Sports posters in general and skiing posters in particular have become very popular in the past two or three years. The third Games, in St Louis 1904, were held in conjunction with the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition. An Alphonse Mucha poster advertising the Exhibition is offered at the sale for \u00a36,000 to \u00a38,000. Mucha was, of course, a well-known lithographer and this is about the right price range. </p> <p>Trawling through the catalogue you will find some wonderful lithographs and silk-screen prints from the 1964 Tokyo Olympiad, starting at around \u00a3500. I suspect that if there is a market for Olympic memorabilia it will centre on posters and prints. </p> <p> For further information telephone Christie's South Kensington: 020-7321-3120; <a href=\"http://www.christies.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.christies.com</a></p>",

Trawling through the catalogue you will find some wonderful lithographs and silk-screen prints from the 1964 Tokyo Olympiad, starting at around \u00a3500. I suspect that if there is a market for Olympic memorabilia it will centre on posters and prints. For further information telephone Christie's South Kensington: 020-7321-3120; www.christies.com",

      "body": "<p>Spare a thought for the descendants of Harry Askham this week as more than thirty members of the Moores family share out the proceeds from the sale of the Littlewoods football pools business. </p> <p>Trevor Hemmings, the entrepreneur who owns Blackpool Tower, is paying \u00a3161m for the group's leisure operations: pools, spot-the-ball and scratchcards. </p> <p>Harry Askham worked as a telegraphist in Manchester with John Moores in 1923 when the pair were setting up the pools business. They decided not to use their own names for fear of losing their day jobs and agreed to call the company Littlewoods. The business had an unpromising beginning: the first dividend was just \u00a32.12s and the operation lost money. Harry Askham lost heart and sold out - the business equivalent of filling in a winning combination and then not bothering to post the coupon. </p> <p>Cecil Moores then joined his brother and by the end of the 1928 football season, the company had begun to turn in the kind of profits that made its founder a millionaire by the late 1930s. It was a brilliant business: counting the money and checking coupons was left to local collectors. Littlewoods hardly had to do a thing, so operating costs were minimal; owning the pools was a licence to print money. </p> <p>But the pools have suffered since the National Lottery was launched - with the group losing 70% of its pools turnover in the past five years. Last year it accounted for only \u00a3300m of Littlewoods' \u00a32.3bn turnover, and the group recently reported a 60% fall in pre-tax profits. </p> <p>Until the lottery came along Littlewoods' pools business pulled in more than six million punters every week. For two and a half hours - from kickoff to classified re sults - every Saturday they were on tentherhooks. As Tony Hancock said in one of his sketches: \"Two and a half hours time! I can't wait that long without knowing! I'd be a quivering mass of disintegrated nerve tissue, lying on the floor twitching away in a pile of fag-ends and finger nails!\" </p> <p>Selling the pools leaves Littlewoods free to concentrate on home shopping and high street stores, and the company is interested in acquiring up to 20 sites from C&amp;A, which is pulling out of the UK after years of heavy losses. </p> <p>Barry Gibson, chief executive, said the strategy of combining retail and catalogue stores had been working \"extremely well\" and the company was looking for sites in towns where it was not represented. Two years ago Littlewoods sold 19 stores to Marks &amp; Spencer - which has since admitted that many of its problems stemmed from ill-timed expansion. </p> <p><strong> New strategy</strong><br> </p> <p> Last November, the company launched its new strategy, which will re-establish the Littlewoods name as the core brand. Market research findings highlighted many strengths associated with the name, customers trusting it to deliver quality at an affordable price. The Index catalogue shopping brand will move under the Littlewoods banner and trials of store fascias combining the two are already underway. The aim is to broaden its appeal to a newer, younger audience while building on relationships with existing customers. </p> <p>Shares in the company - still privately held - are spread among 30 family members: socialites and socialists, family loyalists and self-styled realists. Their boardroom connections have faded in recent years. Only one member of the clan remains on the board: James Suenson Taylor, son of Sir John's daughter, Lady Grantchester. </p> <p>But the business has had more than its share of dramas. The search for Sir John's successor had the hallmarks of the US television soap opera Dynasty - even down to a granddaughter named Alexis. One son, John junior, opted instead for cattle breeding; a nephew, Nigel, widely tipped as his successor, was killed in a car crash. </p> <p>Another son, Peter, who had worked in the arts before joining the business, took over as chairman in 1977. He was ousted when profits dived - and Sir John returned to the helm at the age of 84. But the founder's brilliance had its drawbacks: so much of the company's managerial talent and power was concentrated in himself. For almost 60 years John Moores man aged Littlewoods in his own autocratic way. Staff were left in no doubt as to who controlled the company. Even senior executives had to clock on. Members of his family were treated the same way: he fired his nephew Timothy, aged 19, for eloping with a window dresser. </p> <p>The Moores stretched their corporate brand and enhanced the family's philanthropic reputation by pouring millions into Merseyside charities, football and other sports, education and the arts. When Liverpool polytechnic made the leap to university status, few quibbled when it took the name of John Moores University - acknowledging his status as Merseyside's greatest post-war benefactor. </p> <p><strong>The fax</strong></p> <p><strong> In the high street</strong> Littlewoods sales are \u00a32.5bn a year from 5m sq ft of selling space. It is Britain's third-largest clothing retailer and fifth-largest non-food retailer </p> <p><strong> The stores</strong> More than 280, under three fascias: Littlewoods, Littlewoods Catalogue Discount Stores and Index, the catalogue store. Not many people know Index is part of Littlewoods, so the stores are being rebranded Littlewoods Index; 54 have been opened within larger Littlewoods stores </p> <p><strong> By mail order</strong> Be an agent for Janet Fraser, Burlington, Peter Craig and John Moores. Oh, and Littlewoods. If your back doesn't collapse under the weight of the catalogues. Index Extra cuts out the agent and is now Britain's largest direct home shopping catalogue </p> <p><strong> Treble chance</strong> The first pools coupons were handed out in 1923. Of 4,000 distributed, only 35 were returned, with bets totalling \u00a34 7s 6d. The payout was \u00a32 12s 0d and the season brought losses of \u00a3600. By 1954, the pools were the seventh-largest business in Britain, employing 23,000 people</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spare a thought for the descendants of Harry Askham this week as more than thirty members of the Moores family share out the proceeds from the sale of the Littlewoods football pools business. Trevor Hemmings, the entrepreneur who owns Blackpool Tower, is paying \u00a3161m for the group's leisure operations: pools, spot-the-ball and scratchcards. Harry Askham worked as a telegraphist in Manchester with John Moores in 1923 when the pair were setting up the pools business. They decided not to use their own names for fear of losing their day jobs and agreed to call the company Littlewoods. The business had an unpromising beginning: the first dividend was just \u00a32.12s and the operation lost money. Harry Askham lost heart and sold out - the business equivalent of filling in a winning combination and then not bothering to post the coupon. Cecil Moores then joined his brother and by the end of the 1928 football season, the company had begun to turn in the kind of profits that made its founder a millionaire by the late 1930s. It was a brilliant business: counting the money and checking coupons was left to local collectors. Littlewoods hardly had to do a thing, so operating costs were minimal; owning the pools was a licence to print money. But the pools have suffered since the National Lottery was launched - with the group losing 70% of its pools turnover in the past five years. Last year it accounted for only \u00a3300m of Littlewoods' \u00a32.3bn turnover, and the group recently reported a 60% fall in pre-tax profits. Until the lottery came along Littlewoods' pools business pulled in more than six million punters every week. For two and a half hours - from kickoff to classified re sults - every Saturday they were on tentherhooks. As Tony Hancock said in one of his sketches: \"Two and a half hours time! I can't wait that long without knowing! I'd be a quivering mass of disintegrated nerve tissue, lying on the floor twitching away in a pile of fag-ends and finger nails!\" Selling the pools leaves Littlewoods free to concentrate on home shopping and high street stores, and the company is interested in acquiring up to 20 sites from C&amp;A, which is pulling out of the UK after years of heavy losses. Barry Gibson, chief executive, said the strategy of combining retail and catalogue stores had been working \"extremely well\" and the company was looking for sites in towns where it was not represented. Two years ago Littlewoods sold 19 stores to Marks &amp; Spencer - which has since admitted that many of its problems stemmed from ill-timed expansion. New strategy Last November, the company launched its new strategy, which will re-establish the Littlewoods name as the core brand. Market research findings highlighted many strengths associated with the name, customers trusting it to deliver quality at an affordable price. The Index catalogue shopping brand will move under the Littlewoods banner and trials of store fascias combining the two are already underway. The aim is to broaden its appeal to a newer, younger audience while building on relationships with existing customers. Shares in the company - still privately held - are spread among 30 family members: socialites and socialists, family loyalists and self-styled realists. Their boardroom connections have faded in recent years. Only one member of the clan remains on the board: James Suenson Taylor, son of Sir John's daughter, Lady Grantchester. But the business has had more than its share of dramas. The search for Sir John's successor had the hallmarks of the US television soap opera Dynasty - even down to a granddaughter named Alexis. One son, John junior, opted instead for cattle breeding; a nephew, Nigel, widely tipped as his successor, was killed in a car crash. Another son, Peter, who had worked in the arts before joining the business, took over as chairman in 1977. He was ousted when profits dived - and Sir John returned to the helm at the age of 84. But the founder's brilliance had its drawbacks: so much of the company's managerial talent and power was concentrated in himself. For almost 60 years John Moores man aged Littlewoods in his own autocratic way. Staff were left in no doubt as to who controlled the company. Even senior executives had to clock on. Members of his family were treated the same way: he fired his nephew Timothy, aged 19, for eloping with a window dresser. The Moores stretched their corporate brand and enhanced the family's philanthropic reputation by pouring millions into Merseyside charities, football and other sports, education and the arts. When Liverpool polytechnic made the leap to university status, few quibbled when it took the name of John Moores University - acknowledging his status as Merseyside's greatest post-war benefactor. The fax In the high street Littlewoods sales are \u00a32.5bn a year from 5m sq ft of selling space. It is Britain's third-largest clothing retailer and fifth-largest non-food retailer The stores More than 280, under three fascias: Littlewoods, Littlewoods Catalogue Discount Stores and Index, the catalogue store. Not many people know Index is part of Littlewoods, so the stores are being rebranded Littlewoods Index; 54 have been opened within larger Littlewoods stores By mail order Be an agent for Janet Fraser, Burlington, Peter Craig and John Moores. Oh, and Littlewoods. If your back doesn't collapse under the weight of the catalogues. Index Extra cuts out the agent and is now Britain's largest direct home shopping catalogue Treble chance The first pools coupons were handed out in 1923. Of 4,000 distributed, only 35 were returned, with bets totalling \u00a34 7s 6d. The payout was \u00a32 12s 0d and the season brought losses of \u00a3600. By 1954, the pools were the seventh-largest business in Britain, employing 23,000 people",

      "bodyText": "Crackdown: Gordon Brown is targeting tax and benefits fraud If you have any dark secrets from the taxman you may now be drinking at the last chance saloon, as this week the government announced tough new measures to tackle the black economy. From January 1 2001, anyone with untaxed income - from the odd bit of moonlighting to a full-time job paid in cash - could face up to seven years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. Legislation has been presented to Parliament in Gordon Brown's mounting drive to clamp down on tax and benefits cheats, although there is a chance to \"come clean\" in the six months before the new measures take effect. These moves follow a report by Lord Grabiner QC which concluded that billions of pounds are being lost through dishonesty. The Revenue finds it difficult to prosecute tax evasion under the existing common law, and only a few dozen cases are tried each year. Normally the taxman must be content with a financial settlement, typically involving payment of six years' tax plus interest and a penalty, which has done little to stem the tide of evasion. Grabiner ruled out a tax amnesty, saying it would be unfair to those who have paid their taxes and would not necessarily work; thousands might volunteer to benefit from the amnesty, but then go back to their previous bad habits. But he did suggest a \"carrot and stick\" approach, which is now being implemented. A new hotline has been set up, offering confidential advice to anyone who would like to put their affairs in order before the new law bites.

Yes, it's that time of year again.</p> <p>For people working in events catering summer is their busiest time. Yet it's far from being just a seasonal thing. Throughout the year, corporate hospitality is a \u00a3750m industry firing on all cylinders.</p> <p>\"It's such a booming area,\" says florist Victoria Sullivan. \"Ten years ago I was busy in the summer. Now there's no let up all year round.\" Ms Sullivan has been working with Silwood Park Nurseries to prepare and maintain the flowers for Wimbledon fort night. Before the tournament started, Silwood ordered 20,000 stems of flowers, including roses, delphiniums, scabious and lilies to adorn public areas and corporate marquees.</p> <p>\"More and more companies are using freelances,\" she says. \"When you're working on something like Ascot or Wimbledon you can do 16- or 17-hour days. If any of the roses droop at Wimbledon they have to be replaced at three in the morning.\"</p> <p>Being freelance can be precarious at times, although Ms Sullivan has had her moments of glory: she arranged the flowers for Diana Ross's wedding on Lake Geneva. She trained with Constance Spry 20 years ago but says that floristry has changed a lot since she started out.</p> <p>\"You used to have to work your way up. Nowadays, you can be at art college and it's enough just to like flowers. Colour sense is much more important than formal training.\"</p> <p>Yet many people are still getting into the bucks' fizz and canape business through the college route. \"Up to 60% of our graduates are going into event catering,\" says Angela Maguire, programme director at the School of Hospitality, Leisure and Tourism at Westminster College, famous for training the likes of Jamie Oliver, Ainsley Harriot and Anthony Worrall Thompson. \"The work is so interesting and varied and the big companies are offering competitive salaries and training.\"</p> <p>By big companies, Ms Maguire is referring to the likes of Sodexho or Compass - huge multi-tasking machines which are not only in the business of corporate hospitality, but also cater for hospitals, schools and year-round corporate contracts.</p> <p>\"It isn't about food anymore,\" admits Lynne Morrison, director of training at Sodexho UK. \"Our heritage is in being a food provider, but we're in so many other things now.\"</p> <p>As a catering graduate, you could join the \"executive\" training programme at Sodexho, perhaps becoming a district manager responsible for up to 15 corporate contracts, although, as Ms Morrison explains, as companies acquire and merge, the market can shrink, as two clients often become one.</p> <p>But one recent graduate of the Westminster College School of Hospitality, Anne Nielsen, whose final dissertation was based on predicting the future of events catering, thinks that she would prefer to work for a smaller company. \"There are so many opportunities,\" she admits. \"Catering brands are growing: there are really good companies like Mosimann's and Rhubarb.\" And, she points out: \"The bigger companies are driven by cost cutting.\"</p> <p>One person who found the cost-cutting too much to bear was motivated to start his own company. Frank McCartney used to work for Sodexho and had been responsible for running the entire catering operation at Wimbledon for many years. In January 1999, together with Martin Joyce and Colin Botting, he set up the company FMC. They were able to retain the much-coveted All England Club as a client by virtue of the fact that if the Wimbledon contract were taken over and run by people who hadn't done it before, it might have been a recipe for strawberry hell.</p> <p>During Wimbledon fortnight, Mr McCartney takes on 1,500 staff (during the rest of the year he has a core staff of 32) all of whom are employed by FMC directly: they never use agencies. It's a logistical mindbender, but Frank McCartney, who is calm and softly spoken, has it all under control.</p> <p>Three days before the start of the tournament, as lorries deliver their loads of Pimms to the labyrinth under court number one, Mr McCartney has time to stop for a chat with former star Christine Trueman before explaining how the 1,500 FMC uniforms - complete with discreet logo and strawberry motif - get washed every day. A night shift has been set up to deal with the hulling of 27,000 kilos of strawberries, and, as he explains, things have changed since he started out with Lyons in 1968.</p> <p>\"People are much more discerning now,\" he says, \"Although I'm still surprised when some people ask for coronation chicken.\" A passion for food and an interest in people should come before an interest in finances; a desire to have fun is what attracts so many people to working with FMC during Wimbledon fortnight.</p> <p>Frank McCartney has stories about how, for many of the students he employs, it's an opportunity to find love under the canvas; other perks include the opportunity to watch tennis on the outside courts during breaks and a two-week binge of star spotting.</p> <p>Just as catering has gone up a notch, so have the environments in which big organisations entertain their clients. This year at Wimbledon, IMG has a tent which is clean and symmetrical and has opted for spotlights on wires rather than chandeliers. Flat screened television monitors are built into the walls for punters who can't tear themselves away from the bar to find their front row seat in Centre Court.</p> <p>Black and Edgington, the company which supplies the tents at Wimbledon isn't in the \"peg and pole market\", and other marquee suppliers report that just as smoked duck and goats cheese nibbles have crept on to the menus, it's time to do away with frilly tents.</p> <p>\"It's all flat linings and calico now,\" says Maggie Pepper of Peppers' Marquees. \"We don't do any of those horrible ruched linings.\" Peppers employs 25 people on a permanent basis and that can go up to 70. \"It's very stressful,\" Ms Pepper says. \"We're up against deadlines and the weather. Wind and rain are bad news when you're putting up tents and you're often working for people who are very hyped-up about their party.\"</p> <p>Boarded floors, carpets, and air conditioning are now pretty standard in the tent business, be it \"peg and pole\" or clear or free-span. Some companies, such as Purvis in Edinburgh, do still supply traditional tents, but to demonstrate how the market has no limits, you can now get your mitts on a pukka Mongolian yurt (available for hire from an office in Islington), which has a chestnut and hazel coppice frame and can squeeze in up to 500.</p> <p>One company that has set itself apart from the crowd and has proved that you can dish up perfectly risen gruyere souffles sitting on a bed of wild mushrooms for no less than 400 people is Rhubarb Food Design. Founded four years ago by Lucy Gemmell and Martin Clare, Rhubarb caters for high-profile clients such as the Princes Trust, John Cleese, David Linley Furniture and the Elton John Aids Foundation.</p> <p>\"You don't have to have bog standard white plates and it doesn't have to be the same old thing,\" says Ms Gemmell, who has an Aladdin's cave of brightly coloured, starry crockery, goblets and cutlery to choose from.</p> <p>When it comes to recruitment, Ms Gemmell is unsurprisingly unstructured. \"We look for people who can have as much fun organising a party as the client will have attending the party,\" she says.</p> <p>\"In what we do, qualifications are not important,\" she adds, admitting that she only has one O-level (Religious Education) to her name. With 25 full-time people and a host of freelances, Ms Gemmell says that it is all down to personality and flair. \"And remembering that it's a party and not a spreadsheet. That's the essence of it.\"</p> <p><b> Yurt place or mine: You can now hire Mongolian-style yurts, which can hold up to 500 people, for your summer bash</b></p>",

Frank McCartney used to work for Sodexho and had been responsible for running the entire catering operation at Wimbledon for many years. In January 1999, together with Martin Joyce and Colin Botting, he set up the company FMC. They were able to retain the much-coveted All England Club as a client by virtue of the fact that if the Wimbledon contract were taken over and run by people who hadn't done it before, it might have been a recipe for strawberry hell. During Wimbledon fortnight, Mr McCartney takes on 1,500 staff (during the rest of the year he has a core staff of 32) all of whom are employed by FMC directly: they never use agencies. It's a logistical mindbender, but Frank McCartney, who is calm and softly spoken, has it all under control. Three days before the start of the tournament, as lorries deliver their loads of Pimms to the labyrinth under court number one, Mr McCartney has time to stop for a chat with former star Christine Trueman before explaining how the 1,500 FMC uniforms - complete with discreet logo and strawberry motif - get washed every day. A night shift has been set up to deal with the hulling of 27,000 kilos of strawberries, and, as he explains, things have changed since he started out with Lyons in 1968. \"People are much more discerning now,\" he says, \"Although I'm still surprised when some people ask for coronation chicken.\" A passion for food and an interest in people should come before an interest in finances; a desire to have fun is what attracts so many people to working with FMC during Wimbledon fortnight. Frank McCartney has stories about how, for many of the students he employs, it's an opportunity to find love under the canvas; other perks include the opportunity to watch tennis on the outside courts during breaks and a two-week binge of star spotting. Just as catering has gone up a notch, so have the environments in which big organisations entertain their clients. This year at Wimbledon, IMG has a tent which is clean and symmetrical and has opted for spotlights on wires rather than chandeliers. Flat screened television monitors are built into the walls for punters who can't tear themselves away from the bar to find their front row seat in Centre Court. Black and Edgington, the company which supplies the tents at Wimbledon isn't in the \"peg and pole market\", and other marquee suppliers report that just as smoked duck and goats cheese nibbles have crept on to the menus, it's time to do away with frilly tents. \"It's all flat linings and calico now,\" says Maggie Pepper of Peppers' Marquees. \"We don't do any of those horrible ruched linings.\" Peppers employs 25 people on a permanent basis and that can go up to 70. \"It's very stressful,\" Ms Pepper says. \"We're up against deadlines and the weather. Wind and rain are bad news when you're putting up tents and you're often working for people who are very hyped-up about their party.\" Boarded floors, carpets, and air conditioning are now pretty standard in the tent business, be it \"peg and pole\" or clear or free-span. Some companies, such as Purvis in Edinburgh, do still supply traditional tents, but to demonstrate how the market has no limits, you can now get your mitts on a pukka Mongolian yurt (available for hire from an office in Islington), which has a chestnut and hazel coppice frame and can squeeze in up to 500. One company that has set itself apart from the crowd and has proved that you can dish up perfectly risen gruyere souffles sitting on a bed of wild mushrooms for no less than 400 people is Rhubarb Food Design. Founded four years ago by Lucy Gemmell and Martin Clare, Rhubarb caters for high-profile clients such as the Princes Trust, John Cleese, David Linley Furniture and the Elton John Aids Foundation. \"You don't have to have bog standard white plates and it doesn't have to be the same old thing,\" says Ms Gemmell, who has an Aladdin's cave of brightly coloured, starry crockery, goblets and cutlery to choose from. When it comes to recruitment, Ms Gemmell is unsurprisingly unstructured. \"We look for people who can have as much fun organising a party as the client will have attending the party,\" she says. \"In what we do, qualifications are not important,\" she adds, admitting that she only has one O-level (Religious Education) to her name. With 25 full-time people and a host of freelances, Ms Gemmell says that it is all down to personality and flair. \"And remembering that it's a party and not a spreadsheet. That's the essence of it.\" Yurt place or mine: You can now hire Mongolian-style yurts, which can hold up to 500 people, for your summer bash",

Mr McHenry doesn't believe that demand for psychometric tests will slacken off and retains an almost evangelical approach to his chosen field. \"My deep knowledge of the theory of testing has given me the desire to make a difference in the workplace,\" he says. \"We are getting a lot of interest in our work from the US. The UK has the most advanced testing published that we have seen but we can't be complacent. There's still a lot more work to be done.\" So next time you go for a job, watch out for the new improved brain measurers - and remember who's responsible.",

      "body": "<p>Each year the Management Consultancies Association holds an awards ceremony to highlight the best consultancy projects by member firms in the UK in the previous 12 months.</p> <p>The 1999 winner in the category of e-consulting was a unique partnership from Horwath Consulting and the charity Cards for Good Causes. Not only was it the first time that an e-consulting award had been made, but it was also the first time in the history of the competition that a prize had been given to a consultancy working with a client in the not-for-profit sector.</p> <p>The client, Cards for Good Causes, founded in 1959, is owned by 28 well-known charities. In 1998 it sold more than \u00a35m worth of Christmas cards via traditional outlets of churches and church halls.</p> <p>As with every other sector, the marketplace for charities selling their products online is becoming very competitive. By the summer of 1999 US-based organisations were already offering Christmas cards for sale on the internet. It was crucial for Cards for Good Causes to stay ahead of its competitors and be market leader in this field.</p> <p>At the same time, Horwath Consulting was keen to add value to its existing clients, many of whom are in the not-for-profit sector, by promoting original web-based consulting solutions. Both parties agreed in September 1999 that a new website co-ordinating the 28 suppliers of cards and connecting them directly with their customers had to be in place by November.</p> <p>People buying online products, even Christmas cards, are usually pressed for time and the site had to reflect this. Michael Caudrey, managing director at Horwath, says: \"It was essential that the selection and purchase of cards should take no more than two clicks of the mouse\".</p> <p>Nor was there any point in using expensive technology which would put off average customers by excessive download times. Design had to be crisp and individual cards easily viewable. As Cards for Good Causes points out, 90% of card purchase decisions are made on the basis of what individual cards look like. Fewer than 10% of customers are loyal to a particular charity.</p> <p>Clearly, as the demand for Christmas cards is seasonal, the design, implementation and success of the project were time-critical. Horwath was able to keep to the deadline and the site was functional from early November.</p> <p>Traditionally, cards have only been sold for cash. Over the web, credit card payments had to be practical. But because of the time pressures and the fact that banks have traditionally been slow in setting up credit card payment facilities it was decided to outsource the payment system to a third-party bureau service. The charity plans to deal directly with the banks next year and save on the transaction costs associated with outsourcing.</p> <p>Having a well-designed, operative and effective website is not enough. As Mike Caudrey explains: \"There are two popular misconceptions about the internet: the first is that if you build a website, people will come and visit it; the second is that search engines are effective.\" Unfortunately, there are around 60m websites in cyberspace and many of the leading search engines are either simply not able to keep pace with the exponential growth of the Net or will only accept money to move the site to the top of any search list.</p> <p>Having a modest budget, Horwath turned down the more expensive internet advertising route. Instead it relied on a PR hook by inviting media celebrities associated with the various charities involved to the official launch of the site, as well as arranging an online auction on lastminute.com of a Christmas card signed by rock group Queen.</p> <p>A number of related addresses to <a href=\"http://www.cardsforcharity.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cardsforcharity.co.uk</a> were also registered so that users were automatically re-directed from a number of sites like www. cardsforgoodcauses.com and several others. Clearly this helps with the flow of visitors who are trying to guess the proper site address.</p> <p>Cards for Good Causes was delighted with the effective and rapid response of Horwath to the original proposition. Horwath believes that the site is a good model for a future trend: charities working together to provide a single point of contact to the public. It was a good experience for the consultants too, as Caudrey explains: \"It was great to work on a project where we had to deliver very tangible results and, at the same time, help so many good causes.\"</p> <p>The feeling of win-win permeates the project as Judith Rich, CEO of Cards for Good Causes sees: \"Against enormous time pressures and with a seemingly endless list of things to bring together, I was delighted with Horwath's expertise and their pragmatic, let's-make-it-happen approach.\"</p> <p>Last year the number of cards sold by the group was up by more than 10%. Horwath believes the vast majority of that was due to sales over the internet. This year, at the first Christmas of the new millennium, both charity and consultancy believe this success will be built on from a market leading position. In its 40th anniversary year Cards for Good Causes is in good shape to face up to the e-economy.</p> <p>Will White is deputy director of the Management Consultancies Association.

Nor was there any point in using expensive technology which would put off average customers by excessive download times. Design had to be crisp and individual cards easily viewable. As Cards for Good Causes points out, 90% of card purchase decisions are made on the basis of what individual cards look like. Fewer than 10% of customers are loyal to a particular charity. Clearly, as the demand for Christmas cards is seasonal, the design, implementation and success of the project were time-critical. Horwath was able to keep to the deadline and the site was functional from early November. Traditionally, cards have only been sold for cash. Over the web, credit card payments had to be practical. But because of the time pressures and the fact that banks have traditionally been slow in setting up credit card payment facilities it was decided to outsource the payment system to a third-party bureau service. The charity plans to deal directly with the banks next year and save on the transaction costs associated with outsourcing. Having a well-designed, operative and effective website is not enough. As Mike Caudrey explains: \"There are two popular misconceptions about the internet: the first is that if you build a website, people will come and visit it; the second is that search engines are effective.\" Unfortunately, there are around 60m websites in cyberspace and many of the leading search engines are either simply not able to keep pace with the exponential growth of the Net or will only accept money to move the site to the top of any search list. Having a modest budget, Horwath turned down the more expensive internet advertising route. Instead it relied on a PR hook by inviting media celebrities associated with the various charities involved to the official launch of the site, as well as arranging an online auction on lastminute.com of a Christmas card signed by rock group Queen. A number of related addresses to www.cardsforcharity.co.uk were also registered so that users were automatically re-directed from a number of sites like www. cardsforgoodcauses.com and several others. Clearly this helps with the flow of visitors who are trying to guess the proper site address. Cards for Good Causes was delighted with the effective and rapid response of Horwath to the original proposition. Horwath believes that the site is a good model for a future trend: charities working together to provide a single point of contact to the public. It was a good experience for the consultants too, as Caudrey explains: \"It was great to work on a project where we had to deliver very tangible results and, at the same time, help so many good causes.\" The feeling of win-win permeates the project as Judith Rich, CEO of Cards for Good Causes sees: \"Against enormous time pressures and with a seemingly endless list of things to bring together, I was delighted with Horwath's expertise and their pragmatic, let's-make-it-happen approach.\" Last year the number of cards sold by the group was up by more than 10%. Horwath believes the vast majority of that was due to sales over the internet. This year, at the first Christmas of the new millennium, both charity and consultancy believe this success will be built on from a market leading position. In its 40th anniversary year Cards for Good Causes is in good shape to face up to the e-economy. Will White is deputy director of the Management Consultancies Association.

But they said there seemed little prospect of a speedy resolution to the crisis that began on April 23 when members of the Abu Sayyaf Muslim separatist group seized the holiday-makers from the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan and took them to the remote Philippine island of Jolo. Amid all the bickering, the health of some of the hostages continues to deteriorate; Abu Sayyaf's commander, Galib Andang, said yesterday that one of the two South African hostages, Monica Strydom, had suffered a miscarriage two days ago. The others were said to be \"not in good condition\". The captives have been split up and the non-Asians have not seen a doctor for more than two weeks. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, said yesterday that his government was still supporting the efforts of the Philippine president, Joseph Estrada, to free the South Africans, eight Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two Finns, two Filipinos and one Lebanese. \"You can't simply negotiate outside of the ambit of the Philippine government because it is in the Philippines' territory,\" the foreign minister said. \"So at the end of the day, it is the Philippines that has to be involved.\" Germany's ambassador to the Philippines, Wolfgang Goettelmann, said he had \"assured the Philippine government we have full confidence in them and their efforts\". Speculation about back-room deals and multi-track negotiations began at the weekend when Abu Sayyaf suddenly released one Malaysian \"as a sign of good faith\", amid reports that Malaysian businessmen and diplomats had been involved. On Wednesday the Philippine vice-president, Gloria Arroyo, issued a controversial statement after meeting the French, German and Finnish foreign ministers in Poland. She said the ministers told her that the Malaysian's release \"has put pressure on their governments to likewise effect the release of their nationals using back channels\".

I admire Mr Sutherland and his previous performances, especially in the film, The Day of the Locust, are what drew me to the theatre. But I found this simply a bad play. Had it not been for my respect for the actor I would have left at the interval. We who put ourselves before the public take risks every time we do so. We should be able to accept the penalties that accompany risk-taking. Larry Adler London",

      "trailText": "<p>The readers' editor on... plagiarism and just borrowing</p>",
      "byline": "Ian Mayes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Naturally, we are all against plagiarism, the most tainting of journalistic sins. The Oxford Dictionary definition of the verb, to plagiarise, is accompanied by the following cautionary quotation from Hazlitt, \"If an author is once detected in borrowing, he will be suspected of plagiarism ever after.\" It is something lived down with difficulty. It leaves its mark not only on the plagiarist but also, unfairly perhaps (or perhaps not, we shall come to that), on the publication that provides the platform for it. </p> <p>The OED definition itself is, \"plagiarise: [to] take over and use as one's own (the thoughts, writings, inventions etc, of another person), [to] copy improperly or without acknowledgement.\" Journalists reserve the word only for major unacknowledged rifling of another's original work and refrain from using it for the minor uncredited borrowings that go on in journalism all the time. That would bring it too close to home. The two things, however, are at opposite ends of the same scale, a fact that should discourage feelings of self-righteousness when plagiarism is exposed, usually but not always because the author of the original work has complained. </p> <p>Plagiarists, at their worst, are distinguished from their colleagues by their greed (some would say by their carelessness in failing to cover their tracks). When they raid the fridge they scoop up more than they can carry or eat, with a cry of \"Mine.\" The others snack lightly and depart, taking care to sweep up the crumbs. </p> <p>The situation is clearly set out in an American publication, Media Law by Ralph L Holsinger (2nd edition, McGraw-Hill), where he says, \"Every reporter borrows from the work of other reporters. Reporters working on newspapers in areas served by more than one paper are asked by their editors to follow up stories clipped from competing publications... It's part of the game, and as long as a reporter doesn't take too much, too often, all is well.\" </p> <p>It is my impression, however, that the media are developing in a way and at a pace which make plagiarism more, rather than less, likely to occur. It would be interesting to poll journalists with the question: do you think the amount of original journalism has grown in proportion to the increased space available to it? Has it been able to keep up with the physical expansion of newspapers? Or is the main growth taking place in the area of the quick cuttings job? </p> <p>Journalists at the Guardian (I do not know that it is any different elsewhere) are often put under pressure to follow up a story, or to produce a piece, with no opportunity to make any inquiries of their own. Over-reliance on cuttings and now, even more to the point, the ease of electronically cutting and pasting from the internet, may be not simply attractive options, but the only options open to hard-pressed journalists in certain circumstances. Sometimes another day on a story that might have waited would have been a better option, and certainly better for the journalist's self-esteem. </p> <p>One experienced journalist with whom I was discussing this suggested that instinct should tell us when we have crossed the line. The alarm bells do not always ring. One journalist had plagiarism thrust upon her in the form of a conspicuous passage from another newspaper written into her own by-lined story by an editor without consulting her and with no acknowledgement to the other newspaper. Despite the fact that we owned up to it immediately, it took a little effort to free the writer whose byline appeared on the printed piece from the unwarranted slur on her reputation. </p> <p>To put it in perspective, in the two and a half years that I have been the readers' editor of the Guardian, I can recall only three or four complaints about the kind of excessive and unacknowledged borrowing that we might reasonably call plagiarism. </p> <p> Journalists have to ask themselves not only whether what they are doing actually infringes copyright law but whether it is ethical; to put it another way, whether they are being fair to the author of the original work, whether they would be happy if someone else were making similar unacknowledged use of their work. The question the journalist is too often encouraged to ask is, \"Can we get away with it?\" </p> <p>This is not journalism but anti-journalism. If you create a climate in which the cuttings job flourishes, then you have prepared fertile ground for plagiarism. A good thing for us all to remember, perhaps, is that if the availability of the internet makes it easier to appropriate the result of someone else's labours, it also makes it much more likely that we shall be found out. We do not want a journalist browsing the Guardian's website to discover passages of his own embedded in a piece of ours. </p> <p>Journalists are theoretically independent inquirers dispatched on behalf of the rest of us to find out what is going on. We trust them to tell us in their own words. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

      "bodyText": "Naturally, we are all against plagiarism, the most tainting of journalistic sins. The Oxford Dictionary definition of the verb, to plagiarise, is accompanied by the following cautionary quotation from Hazlitt, \"If an author is once detected in borrowing, he will be suspected of plagiarism ever after.\" It is something lived down with difficulty. It leaves its mark not only on the plagiarist but also, unfairly perhaps (or perhaps not, we shall come to that), on the publication that provides the platform for it. The OED definition itself is, \"plagiarise: [to] take over and use as one's own (the thoughts, writings, inventions etc, of another person), [to] copy improperly or without acknowledgement.\" Journalists reserve the word only for major unacknowledged rifling of another's original work and refrain from using it for the minor uncredited borrowings that go on in journalism all the time. That would bring it too close to home. The two things, however, are at opposite ends of the same scale, a fact that should discourage feelings of self-righteousness when plagiarism is exposed, usually but not always because the author of the original work has complained. Plagiarists, at their worst, are distinguished from their colleagues by their greed (some would say by their carelessness in failing to cover their tracks). When they raid the fridge they scoop up more than they can carry or eat, with a cry of \"Mine.\" The others snack lightly and depart, taking care to sweep up the crumbs. The situation is clearly set out in an American publication, Media Law by Ralph L Holsinger (2nd edition, McGraw-Hill), where he says, \"Every reporter borrows from the work of other reporters. Reporters working on newspapers in areas served by more than one paper are asked by their editors to follow up stories clipped from competing publications... It's part of the game, and as long as a reporter doesn't take too much, too often, all is well.\" It is my impression, however, that the media are developing in a way and at a pace which make plagiarism more, rather than less, likely to occur. It would be interesting to poll journalists with the question: do you think the amount of original journalism has grown in proportion to the increased space available to it? Has it been able to keep up with the physical expansion of newspapers? Or is the main growth taking place in the area of the quick cuttings job? Journalists at the Guardian (I do not know that it is any different elsewhere) are often put under pressure to follow up a story, or to produce a piece, with no opportunity to make any inquiries of their own. Over-reliance on cuttings and now, even more to the point, the ease of electronically cutting and pasting from the internet, may be not simply attractive options, but the only options open to hard-pressed journalists in certain circumstances. Sometimes another day on a story that might have waited would have been a better option, and certainly better for the journalist's self-esteem. One experienced journalist with whom I was discussing this suggested that instinct should tell us when we have crossed the line. The alarm bells do not always ring. One journalist had plagiarism thrust upon her in the form of a conspicuous passage from another newspaper written into her own by-lined story by an editor without consulting her and with no acknowledgement to the other newspaper. Despite the fact that we owned up to it immediately, it took a little effort to free the writer whose byline appeared on the printed piece from the unwarranted slur on her reputation. To put it in perspective, in the two and a half years that I have been the readers' editor of the Guardian, I can recall only three or four complaints about the kind of excessive and unacknowledged borrowing that we might reasonably call plagiarism. Journalists have to ask themselves not only whether what they are doing actually infringes copyright law but whether it is ethical; to put it another way, whether they are being fair to the author of the original work, whether they would be happy if someone else were making similar unacknowledged use of their work. The question the journalist is too often encouraged to ask is, \"Can we get away with it?\" This is not journalism but anti-journalism. If you create a climate in which the cuttings job flourishes, then you have prepared fertile ground for plagiarism. A good thing for us all to remember, perhaps, is that if the availability of the internet makes it easier to appropriate the result of someone else's labours, it also makes it much more likely that we shall be found out. We do not want a journalist browsing the Guardian's website to discover passages of his own embedded in a piece of ours. Journalists are theoretically independent inquirers dispatched on behalf of the rest of us to find out what is going on. We trust them to tell us in their own words. \u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

      "body": "<p>David Sylvester's influence on the post-war British art world is unparalleled, as art critic, installer and curator of exhibitions, and as an administrator. He wrote his first article about drawing for Tribune in 1942 when he was only 18. Now aged 75 - think Orson Welles for both his profile and effortless projection of rumbling gravitas - he has just published the definitive account of his friend Francis Bacon's career and staged an exhibition of his work in Dublin. </p> <p>In the intervening years his role as confidant, adviser, interpreter and arbiter of taste has made Sylvester's contribution to shaping the artistic landscape unique. Because of his efforts the Tate has in its collection whole swathes of work that it could not possibly afford to buy today. It was he who almost singlehandedly alerted a hostile British artistic establishment to the importance of post-war American artists. He has sat for Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon and worked for Henry Moore. If anyone prepared the ground for the explosion of interest in contemporary art over the last decade it was David Sylvester. </p> <p>\"David is the only sacred monster that has ever existed in the English art world,\" says the artist Howard Hodgkin. \"He has that kind of grandeur.\" Tate director Nicholas Serota first met him in the early 70s and says they have remained close. \"He was a powerful influence in making me think internationally and has been enormously encouraging in terms of trying to acquire work for the collection. He is an incredible treasure for Britain.\" </p> <p>The usually tight-lipped collector and gallery owner Charles Saatchi makes an exception for Sylvester and throws the dictionary at him. \"David Sylvester is charming, crotchety, effusive, enigmatic, opinionated, receptive, vivacious, languid, sharp, romantic, perceptive and cuddly. He is the finest installer of art exhibitions in the land and his writing is so delicious he should be doing cook books.\" </p> <p>With the recent opening of Tate Modern - categorised as Britain at last making its peace with modern art - this should be Sylvester's moment. For long periods his has been a lonely voice speaking up for the merits of modern and contemporary art. Now is his vindication. But far from celebrating the acceptance of contemporary art into the mainstream of British cultural life, Sylvester finds himself made gloomy by the prospect. \"One really doesn't want to be in a gallery with more than a few people. This is the great problem with art. A big audience is no good for it.\" </p> <p>His friends speak of an Eeyore-like temperament, edging towards melancholy. Added to this, in recent years his health has not been good. He had a heart attack in the early 90s and was diagnosed with cancer of the colon in 1998, for which he has recently undergone surgery. He also has diabetes. </p> <p>But his glomy outlook and objections to the ongoing art boom come from neither physical nor psychological motivations. Sylvester's vision of what art is for, and its place in the culture, simply has nothing to do with latterday notions of Cool Britannia, people's art galleries or the veneration of \"access\". Last month he launched a devastating attack on the recent thematic hanging of the collection in Tate Britain - \"like serving up a dish in which roast beef is side by side with grilled sole\" - and he is appalled at the thought of the one-out-one-in admission system recently needed to regulate the massive crowds at the 19,000-capacity Tate Modern on London's Bankside. </p> <p>\"At these huge exhibitions, like the Monet in London, or the Vermeer in the Hague, they are so packed there is no pleasure in going to them.\" But what about the benefits of being exposed to great art? \"The whole education argument is crap.\" Encouraging a new generation of art lovers? \"I hate museums cluttered up with children. I was turned onto art by a simple black and white reproduction and that was enough,\" he continues. \"I am all in favour of taking films and reproductions of art into schools and of decent television programmes. But one doesn't necessarily have to sit in front of masterpieces.\" </p> <p>Fellow art critic Richard Dorment says this is typical of Sylvester. \"David would have loved to celebrate unambiguously the opening of the Tate but he says what he thinks needs to be said. He is in nobody's pocket and the fact that he doesn't like the new Tate gallery is an example because he deeply likes and admires its director Nicholas Serota.\" Serota acknowledges that he doesn't pull his punches. \"But friends like that you always need. He is always refreshing to talk to. He constantly questions what artists are doing and his own judgment.\" </p> <p>Sylvester's stance is that the most effective way for a society to consume its fine art is not through better access to galleries but through diffusion via the applied arts. \"I don't think it matters a fuck whether people go and look at Mondrian or not, because they live among furniture and wallpaper and cars and everything else that has been influenced by an earlier moment in the fine arts. Even if fine art has a tiny audience of rich people, ultimately it affects the whole of society, and that is where it really validates itself socially.\" Television commercials are a prime example. \"They are unbelievably brilliant and exciting and they come out of avant garde film making. You just do not need millions of people going to museums. You already have many more millions living in environments created by the followers of the artists in the museums. That is the role of art in society.\" </p> <p>Sylvester was born in 1924 in Hackney. His parents owned an antique shop in Chancery Lane and another shop selling silver. He and his younger sister were mostly brought up by nannies, although during the 1930s the family struggled financially and \"the maid's room suddenly became the lodger's\". He recalls his father as a rather conventional man, while his mother was a more hedonistic figure who went to the ballet and the theatre and was a ballroom dancer of professional standard. \"She liked her fun and would go off to Paris for a few days whenever she felt like it.\" </p> <p>The family had originated in Russia and Poland, and when David was a child \"like many Jewish families\" in London they left the east end for north west London. His father was a prominent Zionist - Sylvester himself now has an increasingly rabbinical appearance and demeanour - although he preferred spending his time with gentiles. Near the end of their lives Sylvester's mother said to him that \"your father's tragedy was that he was an anti-Semite\". </p> <p>The art dealer Leslie Waddington compares Sylvester to Isaiah Berlin: \"he has one of those wonderful Jewish renaissance minds. It is a rarity in English life.\" Sylvester says he was \"dragged along \" by his parents' Judaism but did not engage with it. In his early 20s he was on the verge of converting to Catholicism but pulled back at the last moment. \"It still seems a very civilised thing to be,\" he says. \"I admit I have broken two or three noses in my time but I don't really believe in revenge. The idea of turning the other cheek as given in the Sermon on the Mount still seems a notion of extraordinary beauty.\" </p> <p>His first school was Vernon House prep in Brondesbury, London. At 13 he went on to University College School in Hampstead whose alumni include four-minute miler Roger Bannister, former Tate director Alan Bowness, and Paul Dacre, editor of the Daily Mail . \"Vernon House was where I received all my education,\" he says. \"UCS was just masturbation.\" At 15 he was asked to leave, before he had taken his school certificate. He spent a year buying and selling gold and silver to jewellers. \"I made more money than I ever have since.\" </p> <p>Coming from a family that dictated if he wasn't top of the class it was a disgrace, he cultivated his ambitions elsewhere. First he wanted to be a cricketer. When he realised he wouldn't be good enough he turned to jazz. \"I wanted to be a composer and arranger. I listened to records in school, starting in 1934. I missed Duke Ellington at the London Palladium but did see Coleman Hawkins at the Phoenix Theatre.\" His introduction to art came at 17 when he saw a black and white reproduction of Matisse's La Danse. Jazz was put to one side as he painted 10 hours a day for a year before he realised, \"I was no good at it\". </p> <p>Then, at 18, he submitted on spec an article on drawing to Tribune. It was published and soon after they asked him to review a French painting on loan to the National Gallery. He began to write regularly for the magazine under the mentorship of the literary editor George Orwell, although the editor, Aneurin Bevan, found his style too \"heavy with Latinisms\". </p> <p>He had now embarked on a writing career, but it was war-time and the services called. He failed a medical for the army and became a teacher instead. \"It was absolutely 'Decline and Fall'. I didn't even have the school certificate but they were desperate for masters. I loved teaching. I knew the mistakes made by people who taught me so I tried to be more understanding.\" </p> <p>He started writing a book about the psychology of art and after the war nearly reactivated his academic career when he won a scholarship to Trinity College Cambridge to read moral sciences - philosophy and psychology. He chose the college because Wittgenstein was still teaching there, but before Sylvester even started he knew it was another career that was beyond him, and he didn't take up his place. He did think he could write about art, however. Over the next half century he produced a stream of art journalism and broadcasting, wrote about sport and films, and produced key books on Henry Moore, Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Giacometti. He is the only non-artist to be awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale but still admits to a lack of confidence about writing. </p> <p>His friend Grey Gowrie, the former arts minister, says he can spend hours on the phone agonising over a single word or phrase. \"If I didn't know better I would think I had a heavy breather,\" says Gowrie. \"There can be what seems like 20 minute silence before he declares, 'it's David'. You assume he is going to announce imminent bankruptcy or news of a death, but it's usually a prelude to a fascinating discussion.\" </p> <p>Sylvester has had two abortive sessions of analysis and says he has \"wept on the couch at things that have been done to my writing by American editors. They have totally destroyed the rhythm of the prose and changed the meaning.\" Precise meaning is everything in a critical approach that is based on a scrupulous, obsessive attention to the work at hand. The art historian Frances Spalding has noted his, \"dogged examination of his own sensations in front of art. Though he is often acute on the relationship between a work and the period in which it was made, he is less interested in history than physical presence; it is the impact a painting or sculpture makes on us that he tries to catch - how it affects the head, heart and guts.\" </p> <p>Sylvester says his \"fate was sealed\" after watching Arsenal ver sus West Bromwich Albion in 1935. Arsenal won 4-1 and he went home and wrote a report on it. \"That's been my life; seeing aesthetic experiences, other people doing the work, and then completing the experience by writing about it. The way I write is a bit like St Teresa of Avila writing about being fucked by God. I do try to describe the actual experience of looking at the work. \" </p> <p>A piece written about an installation by the American minimalist sculptor Richard Serra at the Tate in 1992 typifies this approach. The work consisted of two large steel blocks and Sylvester describes his experience as he approaches the work. He first thinks that the blocks are the same height and then, as he gets closer, he realises that this is an illusion. But how many other critics would then point out that what he had described only applied to people between five foot six and six feet tall? This is not mere pedantry but part of an intriguing observation about the subjectivity of our response to art. Serra says Sylvester has the ability to ask questions that other people don't. </p> <p>Sylvester has maintained close links with artists ever since he visited Paris in 1948, where he met Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Picasso's dealer. Kahnweiler secured him an introduction to Giacometti whose work was then, \"the one thing that seemed to matter\". Sylvester became close to Giacometti and started writing about him. It is a sign of his assiduousness/prevarication that a book did not actually appear until 1994. </p> <p>He briefly toyed with the idea of becoming a dealer himself because he so much admired Kahnweiler, but abandoned it when he realised that when a dealer sells something to a customer for a profit, \"he genuinely feels he has done the customer a favour. I, on the other hand, felt as if I was somehow taking advantage of the buyer. But I suppose my primary emotion about every thing is guilt.\" He says he really would have liked to work for a rich person with a small private museum where he could do all the buying and installing. \"I love using my eye to choose things and to install things. And I think it would have been rather good for anyone who asked me to do it as well.\" </p> <p> In 1950 he met his wife-to-be, Pamela Briddon, a schoolteacher who was then a student at London University. They had three daughters, Catherine, who has two children and who Sylvester describes as, \"a very good potter\"; Naomi, who works as a publicist for a publisher; and Xanthe, who has one child and is a freelance sub-editor who worked for many years for Time Out. Pamela enjoyed art but was not as keen on contemporary work as her husband. They lived in a flat in Putney where Sylvester was a keen gardener, cultivating roses particularly. The three girls had to share a bedroom and Pamela, increasingly fed up with the lack of space, would take the children off on month-long camping holidays to Spain. When Sylvester bought a larger house in Wandsworth he kept the flat as his office. The marriage gradually came to an end over a period of years, with minimal trauma, say his children, as he spent more and more time at the flat and less in the new house. They eventually divorced in the early 80s. </p> <p>He also has a daughter from a relationship with the novelist Shena Mackay, conducted while she was married to someone else. Cecily Brown was born in 1969 and now lives in New York where she is an acclaimed artist. </p> <p>Sylvester says he is \"neurotically preoccupied\" with his daughters and is proud that he has good relationships with them. He had first met Mackay when she worked in his parents' shop. Cecily didn't know he was her father until she was 22. She used to see a lot of him but when they started going to art galleries together and she called him her best friend he began to feel uncomfortable. \"I went to an analyst with Shena to discuss how to tell the family. We didn't want it to be too much of a shock to her sisters or to my daughters. I do most things wrong in my life but with regard to the timing of telling Cecily I think I did quite well.\" </p> <p>From the mid 80s until late 90s his partner was the art historian Sarah Whitfield. He is still close to Whitfield and says he was virtually a step-father to her daughters Saskia and Sophie. \"But now I'm just a lonely old bachelor,\" he says. \"Sarah says it suits me.\" </p> <p>His career as installer of exhibitions came about because of his relationship with Henry Moore, about whom he had written a couple of articles for the Burlington magazine. Moore asked to meet him and Sylvester became his secretary, but says, \"it didn't work too well because while there was a pile of letters to be answered we would get involved in some aesthetic discussion\". In 1951 the Tate staged a Moore exhibition which he was invited to curate. He had visited Wakefield with Moore, who had shared some ideas as to how sculpture should be shown. \"Choosing and installing that exhibition excited me more than anything and it remains to this day the thing I like doing best.\" Sylvester's reputation as an installer extends beyond painting and sculpture. He has also been acclaimed for exhibiting Islamic carpets. \"I don't feel I have a talent for writing, but when installing I feel at home in the way that someone who drives racing cars feels at home behind the wheel.\" </p> <p>His approach hasn't changed much over 50 years. He likes to provide lots of space around works and acknowledges a tendency towards symmetry. It was once pointed out to him that at two separate sculpture shows he had, unconsciously, used exactly the same configuration. \"This was my natural rhythm. I don't like my prose style but I do like my installations. If you're writing you see your own personality crystallised on paper and it is a horrible sight. But with an installation there is somebody else's great work and you don't look at the installation but at the work itself. But that work is combined with your rhythms.\" </p> <p>He made his name as a writer in the 1950s and says one of his prime motivations was to counter the influence of John Berger, who was then setting the art critical agenda in the New Statesman.</p> <p> \"He was a brilliant writer, a compelling personality and a great force. I always envied his writing but I felt he was wrong,\" says Sylvester. Berger says now that they were \"very fierce opponents\", but while Sylvester didn't have an artist's eye, \"he did have a collector's eye, and was one of the first people to realise what was new about very many artists and to explain it\".</p> <p> Sylvester objected to what he saw as Berger's promotion of a popular but \"retrogressive\" movement by some painters and sculptors as \"back to the figure\". In a satirical article Sylvester postulated a \"Kitchen Sink School\" of painters, noting that \"the graveyard of artistic reputations is littered with the ruins of expressionistic painters whose youthful outpourings once took the world by storm.\" The label was almost instantly co-opted to describe the groundbreaking drama and fiction of the period. </p> <p>Speaking up for modern art then was hazardous. Sylvester faced editorial pressure but says what sustained him was the force of his own physical experiences with art. \"It was as if people were attacking fucking but you knew you enjoyed fucking. It was as simple as that. I got the most tremendous physical excitement from looking at modern art.\" </p> <p>His habitual self-criticism and insistence on treating work on its merits as he sees it has meant he has never become boxed into critical positions. It was only in the 1980s that he changed his mind and decided that Picasso was a greater artist than Matisse. Howard Hodgkin once recalls him writing about a sculptor in the early 60s. \"David said he was 'probably a very great artist'. A little while later he wrote about his next exhibition saying 'I thought he was the greatest English sculptor under 35 with red hair, but I was wrong'. The man's career never recovered. It might be completely apocryphal but it's still true somehow.\" </p> <p>Alongside Sylvester's distaste for what he sees as recent populist developments in art he retains a faith in strong centralised institutions. \"The BBC was a very enlightened patron of modern art. My talks with American artists in the 60s are invaluable documents. The interviews with Francis Bacon came from the BBC. We even did an interview with Giacometti in French. The treatment of art on television is now at a much lower intellectual level than it was in the 1950s.\" He dismisses anti-elitist arguments and complains that delegating power to the Arts Council regions has weakened arts administration. \"There is an elite. But it is not rooted in class or wealth or privilege. At any one time there are only five or six people who can really spend public money well, be they right, left or centre.\" </p> <p>Sylvester's politics were formed in the aftermath of the second world war. \"I was to the left of the Labour Party but that changed after Czechoslovakia in 1948 [when the communists took control]. I didn't even wait for Hungary in '56. I saw that you can't get into bed with the communists without getting clap.\" He has since voted Labour, Liberal and Conservative, and briefly even had high hopes for the SDP. He says he is probably still a Gaitskellite because he maintains a belief in nationalisation, but Grey Gowrie sees him as a singular sort of floating voter.</p> <p> \"At the last election he said, 'I'm in an absolute rage. They've redrawn the boundaries and I don't want to vote Tory but I suppose I'm going to have to vote for Al Clark.' I said to him that it was a human right not to vote for Al Clark but David said, 'the problem is he is such a fucking good writer.' He might not have done it in the end but he did make me laugh.\" </p> <p>Sylvester admits to voting Conservative in the 60s, when he lived in Putney, just to stop a man who would have been arts minister in a Labour government. But his politics and artistic leanings had been exploited some years earlier when he had been invited on a State Department-sponsored trip to America in 1960. In an odd sideshow to the cold war the CIA was covertly sponsoring the cultural magazine Encounter and promoting abstract expressionism as an example of western freedom. Sylvester is untroubled that he might have been used. \"Jolly good for them. But no-one ever told me what to write or say.\" </p> <p>His introduction to the American art scene coincided with his arrival in Paris.

      "bodyText": "David Sylvester's influence on the post-war British art world is unparalleled, as art critic, installer and curator of exhibitions, and as an administrator. He wrote his first article about drawing for Tribune in 1942 when he was only 18. Now aged 75 - think Orson Welles for both his profile and effortless projection of rumbling gravitas - he has just published the definitive account of his friend Francis Bacon's career and staged an exhibition of his work in Dublin. In the intervening years his role as confidant, adviser, interpreter and arbiter of taste has made Sylvester's contribution to shaping the artistic landscape unique. Because of his efforts the Tate has in its collection whole swathes of work that it could not possibly afford to buy today. It was he who almost singlehandedly alerted a hostile British artistic establishment to the importance of post-war American artists. He has sat for Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon and worked for Henry Moore. If anyone prepared the ground for the explosion of interest in contemporary art over the last decade it was David Sylvester. \"David is the only sacred monster that has ever existed in the English art world,\" says the artist Howard Hodgkin. \"He has that kind of grandeur.\" Tate director Nicholas Serota first met him in the early 70s and says they have remained close. \"He was a powerful influence in making me think internationally and has been enormously encouraging in terms of trying to acquire work for the collection. He is an incredible treasure for Britain.\" The usually tight-lipped collector and gallery owner Charles Saatchi makes an exception for Sylvester and throws the dictionary at him. \"David Sylvester is charming, crotchety, effusive, enigmatic, opinionated, receptive, vivacious, languid, sharp, romantic, perceptive and cuddly. He is the finest installer of art exhibitions in the land and his writing is so delicious he should be doing cook books.\" With the recent opening of Tate Modern - categorised as Britain at last making its peace with modern art - this should be Sylvester's moment. For long periods his has been a lonely voice speaking up for the merits of modern and contemporary art. Now is his vindication. But far from celebrating the acceptance of contemporary art into the mainstream of British cultural life, Sylvester finds himself made gloomy by the prospect. \"One really doesn't want to be in a gallery with more than a few people. This is the great problem with art. A big audience is no good for it.\" His friends speak of an Eeyore-like temperament, edging towards melancholy. Added to this, in recent years his health has not been good. He had a heart attack in the early 90s and was diagnosed with cancer of the colon in 1998, for which he has recently undergone surgery. He also has diabetes. But his glomy outlook and objections to the ongoing art boom come from neither physical nor psychological motivations. Sylvester's vision of what art is for, and its place in the culture, simply has nothing to do with latterday notions of Cool Britannia, people's art galleries or the veneration of \"access\". Last month he launched a devastating attack on the recent thematic hanging of the collection in Tate Britain - \"like serving up a dish in which roast beef is side by side with grilled sole\" - and he is appalled at the thought of the one-out-one-in admission system recently needed to regulate the massive crowds at the 19,000-capacity Tate Modern on London's Bankside. \"At these huge exhibitions, like the Monet in London, or the Vermeer in the Hague, they are so packed there is no pleasure in going to them.\" But what about the benefits of being exposed to great art? \"The whole education argument is crap.\" Encouraging a new generation of art lovers? \"I hate museums cluttered up with children. I was turned onto art by a simple black and white reproduction and that was enough,\" he continues. \"I am all in favour of taking films and reproductions of art into schools and of decent television programmes. But one doesn't necessarily have to sit in front of masterpieces.\" Fellow art critic Richard Dorment says this is typical of Sylvester. \"David would have loved to celebrate unambiguously the opening of the Tate but he says what he thinks needs to be said. He is in nobody's pocket and the fact that he doesn't like the new Tate gallery is an example because he deeply likes and admires its director Nicholas Serota.\" Serota acknowledges that he doesn't pull his punches. \"But friends like that you always need. He is always refreshing to talk to. He constantly questions what artists are doing and his own judgment.\" Sylvester's stance is that the most effective way for a society to consume its fine art is not through better access to galleries but through diffusion via the applied arts. \"I don't think it matters a fuck whether people go and look at Mondrian or not, because they live among furniture and wallpaper and cars and everything else that has been influenced by an earlier moment in the fine arts. Even if fine art has a tiny audience of rich people, ultimately it affects the whole of society, and that is where it really validates itself socially.\" Television commercials are a prime example. \"They are unbelievably brilliant and exciting and they come out of avant garde film making. You just do not need millions of people going to museums. You already have many more millions living in environments created by the followers of the artists in the museums. That is the role of art in society.\" Sylvester was born in 1924 in Hackney. His parents owned an antique shop in Chancery Lane and another shop selling silver. He and his younger sister were mostly brought up by nannies, although during the 1930s the family struggled financially and \"the maid's room suddenly became the lodger's\". He recalls his father as a rather conventional man, while his mother was a more hedonistic figure who went to the ballet and the theatre and was a ballroom dancer of professional standard. \"She liked her fun and would go off to Paris for a few days whenever she felt like it.\" The family had originated in Russia and Poland, and when David was a child \"like many Jewish families\" in London they left the east end for north west London. His father was a prominent Zionist - Sylvester himself now has an increasingly rabbinical appearance and demeanour - although he preferred spending his time with gentiles. Near the end of their lives Sylvester's mother said to him that \"your father's tragedy was that he was an anti-Semite\". The art dealer Leslie Waddington compares Sylvester to Isaiah Berlin: \"he has one of those wonderful Jewish renaissance minds. It is a rarity in English life.\" Sylvester says he was \"dragged along \" by his parents' Judaism but did not engage with it. In his early 20s he was on the verge of converting to Catholicism but pulled back at the last moment. \"It still seems a very civilised thing to be,\" he says. \"I admit I have broken two or three noses in my time but I don't really believe in revenge. The idea of turning the other cheek as given in the Sermon on the Mount still seems a notion of extraordinary beauty.\" His first school was Vernon House prep in Brondesbury, London. At 13 he went on to University College School in Hampstead whose alumni include four-minute miler Roger Bannister, former Tate director Alan Bowness, and Paul Dacre, editor of the Daily Mail . \"Vernon House was where I received all my education,\" he says. \"UCS was just masturbation.\" At 15 he was asked to leave, before he had taken his school certificate. He spent a year buying and selling gold and silver to jewellers. \"I made more money than I ever have since.\" Coming from a family that dictated if he wasn't top of the class it was a disgrace, he cultivated his ambitions elsewhere. First he wanted to be a cricketer. When he realised he wouldn't be good enough he turned to jazz. \"I wanted to be a composer and arranger. I listened to records in school, starting in 1934. I missed Duke Ellington at the London Palladium but did see Coleman Hawkins at the Phoenix Theatre.\" His introduction to art came at 17 when he saw a black and white reproduction of Matisse's La Danse. Jazz was put to one side as he painted 10 hours a day for a year before he realised, \"I was no good at it\". Then, at 18, he submitted on spec an article on drawing to Tribune. It was published and soon after they asked him to review a French painting on loan to the National Gallery. He began to write regularly for the magazine under the mentorship of the literary editor George Orwell, although the editor, Aneurin Bevan, found his style too \"heavy with Latinisms\". He had now embarked on a writing career, but it was war-time and the services called. He failed a medical for the army and became a teacher instead. \"It was absolutely 'Decline and Fall'. I didn't even have the school certificate but they were desperate for masters. I loved teaching. I knew the mistakes made by people who taught me so I tried to be more understanding.\" He started writing a book about the psychology of art and after the war nearly reactivated his academic career when he won a scholarship to Trinity College Cambridge to read moral sciences - philosophy and psychology. He chose the college because Wittgenstein was still teaching there, but before Sylvester even started he knew it was another career that was beyond him, and he didn't take up his place. He did think he could write about art, however. Over the next half century he produced a stream of art journalism and broadcasting, wrote about sport and films, and produced key books on Henry Moore, Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Giacometti. He is the only non-artist to be awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale but still admits to a lack of confidence about writing. His friend Grey Gowrie, the former arts minister, says he can spend hours on the phone agonising over a single word or phrase. \"If I didn't know better I would think I had a heavy breather,\" says Gowrie. \"There can be what seems like 20 minute silence before he declares, 'it's David'. You assume he is going to announce imminent bankruptcy or news of a death, but it's usually a prelude to a fascinating discussion.\" Sylvester has had two abortive sessions of analysis and says he has \"wept on the couch at things that have been done to my writing by American editors. They have totally destroyed the rhythm of the prose and changed the meaning.\" Precise meaning is everything in a critical approach that is based on a scrupulous, obsessive attention to the work at hand. The art historian Frances Spalding has noted his, \"dogged examination of his own sensations in front of art. Though he is often acute on the relationship between a work and the period in which it was made, he is less interested in history than physical presence; it is the impact a painting or sculpture makes on us that he tries to catch - how it affects the head, heart and guts.\" Sylvester says his \"fate was sealed\" after watching Arsenal ver sus West Bromwich Albion in 1935. Arsenal won 4-1 and he went home and wrote a report on it. \"That's been my life; seeing aesthetic experiences, other people doing the work, and then completing the experience by writing about it. The way I write is a bit like St Teresa of Avila writing about being fucked by God. I do try to describe the actual experience of looking at the work. \" A piece written about an installation by the American minimalist sculptor Richard Serra at the Tate in 1992 typifies this approach. The work consisted of two large steel blocks and Sylvester describes his experience as he approaches the work. He first thinks that the blocks are the same height and then, as he gets closer, he realises that this is an illusion. But how many other critics would then point out that what he had described only applied to people between five foot six and six feet tall? This is not mere pedantry but part of an intriguing observation about the subjectivity of our response to art. Serra says Sylvester has the ability to ask questions that other people don't. Sylvester has maintained close links with artists ever since he visited Paris in 1948, where he met Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Picasso's dealer. Kahnweiler secured him an introduction to Giacometti whose work was then, \"the one thing that seemed to matter\". Sylvester became close to Giacometti and started writing about him. It is a sign of his assiduousness/prevarication that a book did not actually appear until 1994. He briefly toyed with the idea of becoming a dealer himself because he so much admired Kahnweiler, but abandoned it when he realised that when a dealer sells something to a customer for a profit, \"he genuinely feels he has done the customer a favour. I, on the other hand, felt as if I was somehow taking advantage of the buyer. But I suppose my primary emotion about every thing is guilt.\" He says he really would have liked to work for a rich person with a small private museum where he could do all the buying and installing. \"I love using my eye to choose things and to install things. And I think it would have been rather good for anyone who asked me to do it as well.\" In 1950 he met his wife-to-be, Pamela Briddon, a schoolteacher who was then a student at London University. They had three daughters, Catherine, who has two children and who Sylvester describes as, \"a very good potter\"; Naomi, who works as a publicist for a publisher; and Xanthe, who has one child and is a freelance sub-editor who worked for many years for Time Out. Pamela enjoyed art but was not as keen on contemporary work as her husband. They lived in a flat in Putney where Sylvester was a keen gardener, cultivating roses particularly. The three girls had to share a bedroom and Pamela, increasingly fed up with the lack of space, would take the children off on month-long camping holidays to Spain. When Sylvester bought a larger house in Wandsworth he kept the flat as his office. The marriage gradually came to an end over a period of years, with minimal trauma, say his children, as he spent more and more time at the flat and less in the new house. They eventually divorced in the early 80s. He also has a daughter from a relationship with the novelist Shena Mackay, conducted while she was married to someone else. Cecily Brown was born in 1969 and now lives in New York where she is an acclaimed artist. Sylvester says he is \"neurotically preoccupied\" with his daughters and is proud that he has good relationships with them. He had first met Mackay when she worked in his parents' shop. Cecily didn't know he was her father until she was 22. She used to see a lot of him but when they started going to art galleries together and she called him her best friend he began to feel uncomfortable. \"I went to an analyst with Shena to discuss how to tell the family. We didn't want it to be too much of a shock to her sisters or to my daughters. I do most things wrong in my life but with regard to the timing of telling Cecily I think I did quite well.\" From the mid 80s until late 90s his partner was the art historian Sarah Whitfield. He is still close to Whitfield and says he was virtually a step-father to her daughters Saskia and Sophie. \"But now I'm just a lonely old bachelor,\" he says. \"Sarah says it suits me.\" His career as installer of exhibitions came about because of his relationship with Henry Moore, about whom he had written a couple of articles for the Burlington magazine. Moore asked to meet him and Sylvester became his secretary, but says, \"it didn't work too well because while there was a pile of letters to be answered we would get involved in some aesthetic discussion\". In 1951 the Tate staged a Moore exhibition which he was invited to curate. He had visited Wakefield with Moore, who had shared some ideas as to how sculpture should be shown. \"Choosing and installing that exhibition excited me more than anything and it remains to this day the thing I like doing best.\" Sylvester's reputation as an installer extends beyond painting and sculpture. He has also been acclaimed for exhibiting Islamic carpets. \"I don't feel I have a talent for writing, but when installing I feel at home in the way that someone who drives racing cars feels at home behind the wheel.\" His approach hasn't changed much over 50 years. He likes to provide lots of space around works and acknowledges a tendency towards symmetry. It was once pointed out to him that at two separate sculpture shows he had, unconsciously, used exactly the same configuration. \"This was my natural rhythm. I don't like my prose style but I do like my installations. If you're writing you see your own personality crystallised on paper and it is a horrible sight. But with an installation there is somebody else's great work and you don't look at the installation but at the work itself. But that work is combined with your rhythms.\" He made his name as a writer in the 1950s and says one of his prime motivations was to counter the influence of John Berger, who was then setting the art critical agenda in the New Statesman. \"He was a brilliant writer, a compelling personality and a great force. I always envied his writing but I felt he was wrong,\" says Sylvester. Berger says now that they were \"very fierce opponents\", but while Sylvester didn't have an artist's eye, \"he did have a collector's eye, and was one of the first people to realise what was new about very many artists and to explain it\". Sylvester objected to what he saw as Berger's promotion of a popular but \"retrogressive\" movement by some painters and sculptors as \"back to the figure\". In a satirical article Sylvester postulated a \"Kitchen Sink School\" of painters, noting that \"the graveyard of artistic reputations is littered with the ruins of expressionistic painters whose youthful outpourings once took the world by storm.\" The label was almost instantly co-opted to describe the groundbreaking drama and fiction of the period. Speaking up for modern art then was hazardous. Sylvester faced editorial pressure but says what sustained him was the force of his own physical experiences with art. \"It was as if people were attacking fucking but you knew you enjoyed fucking. It was as simple as that. I got the most tremendous physical excitement from looking at modern art.\" His habitual self-criticism and insistence on treating work on its merits as he sees it has meant he has never become boxed into critical positions. It was only in the 1980s that he changed his mind and decided that Picasso was a greater artist than Matisse. Howard Hodgkin once recalls him writing about a sculptor in the early 60s. \"David said he was 'probably a very great artist'. A little while later he wrote about his next exhibition saying 'I thought he was the greatest English sculptor under 35 with red hair, but I was wrong'. The man's career never recovered. It might be completely apocryphal but it's still true somehow.\" Alongside Sylvester's distaste for what he sees as recent populist developments in art he retains a faith in strong centralised institutions. \"The BBC was a very enlightened patron of modern art. My talks with American artists in the 60s are invaluable documents. The interviews with Francis Bacon came from the BBC. We even did an interview with Giacometti in French. The treatment of art on television is now at a much lower intellectual level than it was in the 1950s.\" He dismisses anti-elitist arguments and complains that delegating power to the Arts Council regions has weakened arts administration. \"There is an elite. But it is not rooted in class or wealth or privilege. At any one time there are only five or six people who can really spend public money well, be they right, left or centre.\" Sylvester's politics were formed in the aftermath of the second world war. \"I was to the left of the Labour Party but that changed after Czechoslovakia in 1948 [when the communists took control]. I didn't even wait for Hungary in '56. I saw that you can't get into bed with the communists without getting clap.\" He has since voted Labour, Liberal and Conservative, and briefly even had high hopes for the SDP. He says he is probably still a Gaitskellite because he maintains a belief in nationalisation, but Grey Gowrie sees him as a singular sort of floating voter. \"At the last election he said, 'I'm in an absolute rage. They've redrawn the boundaries and I don't want to vote Tory but I suppose I'm going to have to vote for Al Clark.' I said to him that it was a human right not to vote for Al Clark but David said, 'the problem is he is such a fucking good writer.' He might not have done it in the end but he did make me laugh.\" Sylvester admits to voting Conservative in the 60s, when he lived in Putney, just to stop a man who would have been arts minister in a Labour government. But his politics and artistic leanings had been exploited some years earlier when he had been invited on a State Department-sponsored trip to America in 1960. In an odd sideshow to the cold war the CIA was covertly sponsoring the cultural magazine Encounter and promoting abstract expressionism as an example of western freedom. Sylvester is untroubled that he might have been used. \"Jolly good for them. But no-one ever told me what to write or say.\" His introduction to the American art scene coincided with his arrival in Paris. After going to a jazz club to see Charlie Mingus he was introduced to Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Philip Guston. He later made contact with Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. He says that, broadly speaking, over the last 40 years his primary interest has been contemporary American art. He is currently editing his interviews with artists over this period. He has at the same time managed to produce, with Sarah Whitfield, the definitive five-volume catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Magritte, not an artist you would normally associate him with. It was a monumental project and while he says he does love the work, \"the fact remains that I spent years of my life, like Swann, on someone who was not my type\". Someone who very much was his type was Francis Bacon. Sylvester first wrote about Bacon in the late 1940s and they soon became friends. Sylvester was his self-appointed Boswell and undertook a series of landmark interviews in the 50s and 60s. The show currently on in Dublin is the fifth he has staged of Bacon's work. His new book about Bacon is dedicated to the composer Harrison Birtwistle who says that Sylvester's conversations with Bacon are among the most interesting things written on creativity. Birtwistle has dedicated a piece of music to Sylvester and says he is having a, \"sort of intellectual love affair with David.

      "body": "<p> The peak of tolerance is most readily achieved by those who are not burdened with convictions. - Alexander Chase </p> <p>Tolerance is a rare and important virtue. It has its limits, but they are usually drawn too tightly and in the wrong places. Consider last week's decision by Judge Mariano Fernando Bermejo of Madrid, who refused an application by the city's police chief to order prostitutes in the Casa de Campo to put on more clothes. The prostitutes there are scantily clad in suspenders, basques and the briefest of mini-skirts, which the police chief claimed is indecent; but the judge ruled that as this is the uniform of their profession, they are entitled to wear it. </p> <p>Here is a Daniel come to judgment indeed. The ruling is tolerance itself, and would have been applauded by history's greatest prophet of this virtue, John Stuart Mill. In his seminal On Liberty, he wrote, \"Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.\" </p> <p>The remark carries a number of significant implications. It defines an intolerant person as one who wishes others to live as he thinks they ought, and who seeks to impose his practices and beliefs upon them. It says that the human community benefits by permitting a variety of ways of life to flourish, because they represent experiments in dealing with the human condition from which much might be learned. </p> <p>And it iterates the premise that no one has the right to tell another how to be or to act, provided that it does no harm to others. These are the tenets of liberalism, a word of malediction among those who fear that unless a tight grip is kept on human thoughts and instincts, earth will break open and demons will rise. </p> <p>Tolerance is, however, not only the mark but the paradox of liberalism. For liberalism enjoins tolerance of opposing viewpoints, and allows them to have their say, leaving it to the democracy of ideas to decide which shall prevail. The result is too often the death of toleration itself, because those who live by hard principles and uncompromising views in political, moral and religious respects always, if given half a chance, silence liberals, because liberalism, by its nature, threatens the hegemony they seek to impose. </p> <p>To the question, \"Should the tolerant tolerate the intolerant?\" the answer should therefore be a resounding \"No\". Tolerance has to protect itself. It can easily do so by saying that anyone can put a point of view, but no one can force another to accept it. The only coercion should be that of argument, the only obligation should be to honest reasoning. Helen Keller said that \"the highest result of education is tolerance,\" and she is right; one can be confident that in most cases the unbiased reasonings of an informed mind will come out in favour of what is good and true. </p> <p>Intolerance is a psychologically interesting phenomenon because it is symptomatic of insecurity and fear. Zealots who would, if they could, persecute you into conforming with their way of things, might claim to be trying to save your soul despite yourself, but are really doing it because they feel threatened. The Taliban force women to wear veils, to stay at home, and to give up education and work, because they are afraid of women's freedom. The old become intolerant of the young when alarmed by youth's insouciance towards what they have long known and held dear. Fear begets intolerance, and intolerance begets fear: the cycle is a vicious one. </p> <p>But tolerance and its opposite are not only, or even invariably, forms of acceptance and rejection respectively. One can tolerate a belief or a practice without accepting it oneself. What underlies tolerance is the recognition that there is plenty of room in the world for alternatives to coexist, and that if one is offended by what others do it is because one has let it get under one's skin. We tolerate others best when we know how to tolerate ourselves: learning how to do so is one aim of the civilised life. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The peak of tolerance is most readily achieved by those who are not burdened with convictions. - Alexander Chase Tolerance is a rare and important virtue. It has its limits, but they are usually drawn too tightly and in the wrong places. Consider last week's decision by Judge Mariano Fernando Bermejo of Madrid, who refused an application by the city's police chief to order prostitutes in the Casa de Campo to put on more clothes. The prostitutes there are scantily clad in suspenders, basques and the briefest of mini-skirts, which the police chief claimed is indecent; but the judge ruled that as this is the uniform of their profession, they are entitled to wear it. Here is a Daniel come to judgment indeed. The ruling is tolerance itself, and would have been applauded by history's greatest prophet of this virtue, John Stuart Mill. In his seminal On Liberty, he wrote, \"Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.\" The remark carries a number of significant implications. It defines an intolerant person as one who wishes others to live as he thinks they ought, and who seeks to impose his practices and beliefs upon them. It says that the human community benefits by permitting a variety of ways of life to flourish, because they represent experiments in dealing with the human condition from which much might be learned. And it iterates the premise that no one has the right to tell another how to be or to act, provided that it does no harm to others. These are the tenets of liberalism, a word of malediction among those who fear that unless a tight grip is kept on human thoughts and instincts, earth will break open and demons will rise. Tolerance is, however, not only the mark but the paradox of liberalism. For liberalism enjoins tolerance of opposing viewpoints, and allows them to have their say, leaving it to the democracy of ideas to decide which shall prevail. The result is too often the death of toleration itself, because those who live by hard principles and uncompromising views in political, moral and religious respects always, if given half a chance, silence liberals, because liberalism, by its nature, threatens the hegemony they seek to impose. To the question, \"Should the tolerant tolerate the intolerant?\" the answer should therefore be a resounding \"No\". Tolerance has to protect itself. It can easily do so by saying that anyone can put a point of view, but no one can force another to accept it. The only coercion should be that of argument, the only obligation should be to honest reasoning. Helen Keller said that \"the highest result of education is tolerance,\" and she is right; one can be confident that in most cases the unbiased reasonings of an informed mind will come out in favour of what is good and true. Intolerance is a psychologically interesting phenomenon because it is symptomatic of insecurity and fear. Zealots who would, if they could, persecute you into conforming with their way of things, might claim to be trying to save your soul despite yourself, but are really doing it because they feel threatened. The Taliban force women to wear veils, to stay at home, and to give up education and work, because they are afraid of women's freedom. The old become intolerant of the young when alarmed by youth's insouciance towards what they have long known and held dear. Fear begets intolerance, and intolerance begets fear: the cycle is a vicious one. But tolerance and its opposite are not only, or even invariably, forms of acceptance and rejection respectively. One can tolerate a belief or a practice without accepting it oneself. What underlies tolerance is the recognition that there is plenty of room in the world for alternatives to coexist, and that if one is offended by what others do it is because one has let it get under one's skin. We tolerate others best when we know how to tolerate ourselves: learning how to do so is one aim of the civilised life.",

Now his son is producing a whole new generation of Bushisms, and entire websites are devoted to them. Here are a few gems (reprinted from Harper's magazine): \"The senator can't take the high horse and then claim the low road\"; \"I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family\"; \"Rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?\"; \"The most important job is not to be governor, or first lady in my case.\" </p> <p>There are also \"Dubya as a second language\" lexicons, in which handcuffs are cufflinks, Balkanise becomes vulcanise, tariffs are known as terri ers and viable translates as vile. </p> <p>\u0095 Last week we went to Deal in Kent for an overnight stay. It's a pretty town, full of small Georgian terrace houses built for seafarers and what seems like more pubs per head than anywhere else in the land. Apparently these functioned as informal markets for smugglers, and may still do. Deal is almost aggressively free of activities. We saw no amusement arcades, few swings, no roundabouts.

There is a little street market selling plastic things you wouldn't want in your home, plus several wonderful fishmongers. It's all evocative of a vanished age. I crept - the only word to describe one's hunched posture through the tiny door - into a second-hand bookshop, and paid \u00a32 for an Agatha Christie first published in 1924. It seemed exactly right. </p> <p>\u0095 Here's a puzzle. Two weeks ago I went to Durham to speak in a debate. My main opponent was Martin Narey, who is the head of the prison service, a thoughtful and cultured man. In his speech he declared that one-third of all males in this country have a criminal conviction by the age of 30. I mocked this in my reply, saying the figure was obviously absurd - it doesn't include motoring offences, warnings, or mere charges - and that the students should ignore the allegation. Mr Narey insisted that it was true. </p> <p>Four days later, Jack Straw said exactly the same thing, making the point that they couldn't ban everyone with convictions from travelling to football matches, because there were so many. In any group of British men, one-third have form. He keeps repeating the figure. I remained baffled, and asked the Home Office for a breakdown. It's just a list of numbers, but it does seem to state plainly that by the time they turn 31, fully 31.5% of males have been convicted of an offence. The main ones seem to be violence against the person, burglary, robbery, theft, drugs and public order. Home Office officials as well as colleagues I respect insist that the figures are true. </p> <p>But can they be? Almost a third of the male population, actually convicted? I know I'm middle class, but offhand I can't think of anyone I know who's been convicted of a real offence, except a couple of blokes at campus demonstrations.

Whatever its strengths and weaknesses as a score, its ideology is questionable. So is its combination of Prokofiev's early, modernist techniques with the lyrical, streamlined style of his later years. </p> <p>Written in 1939 at the height of Stalin's purges, this was Prokofiev's first attempt at an explicitly Soviet theme, though it also alludes to the encroaching danger of nazism. The subject was suggested by Alexei Tolstoi, the aristocrat-turned-communist who was Stalin's favourite writer, and the finished piece is essentially a chunk of socialist propaganda. </p> <p>We are in Ukraine in 1918. The Red Army is marching south in an attempt to combat the Haydamaks, the Ukrainian nationalists who opposed bolshevism and were in cahoots with the German army, which still occupied Ukraine, even though Lenin had technically withdrawn from the war. </p> <p>The soldier Kotko, a local hero, returns home from the trenches to be caught up in the resulting mess. His fiancee Sofya's father, Tkachenko, has become a nationalist sympathiser. The members of the local soviet send a group of Germans packing; as a result the village suffers anti-communist reprisals. Kotko flees to join the partisans, and after some gung-ho heroics (including lobbing grenades into a church where the Germans are gathered) is captured and sentenced to death, though the last-minute appearance of the Red Army ensures a happy ending. </p> <p>Throughout, the libretto's stance is alarming. The collective is permanently placed before the individual. Lenin is consistently glorified. Kotko, torn between saving his beloved Sofya from the Germans and following the party line, grandly states that he can't leave his comrades. </p> <p>One wonders what Prokofiev's private thoughts on all this might have been, for the opera is uneven and shot through with lapses in inspiration. Dramatically it depends for its effect on a series of jolts in tone: it begins as a folksy comedy, turns into an impassioned love story, accelerates into the stuff of nightmare, and ends as heroic drama. Prokofiev isn't always up to capturing this multiplicity of moods. Even Valery Gergiev's impassioned conducting can't disguise the pithy sparseness and melodic paucity of the outer acts. </p> <p>The third act (of five), however, is the stuff of genius. It opens with a broad, lyrical nocturne that ranks with Romeo and Juliet as Prokofiev interweaves three contrasting love duets. The swirl into horror proceeds with unnerving speed: the Germans hang the communists and torch the village, and Prokofiev reverts to the awesome modernism of The Fiery Angel and his Second Symphony, both works proscribed in Russia at the time. Constructivist fury erupts in the orchestra and massive ostinati shred your nerves. It's an overwhelming moment, but even here things are worrying. Prokofiev's own alignment of his earlier style with the forces of evil is perplexing in the extreme. </p> <p>It's questionable whether Prokofiev's heart was in the opera when he composed it - but it certainly wasn't by the time he got to the premiere. He originally planned Semyon Kotko as a collaboration with the great avant-garde director Vselovod Meyerhold - but Meyerhold was arrested when rehearsals had barely begun, and later shot on Stalin's orders. Another director took over as Prokofiev looked on with terror, and the first performance finally took place in Moscow in 1940. The work was praised for its ideological soundness, but the later signing of the Hitler-Stalin pact signalled its withdrawal from Soviet theatres. </p> <p>Meyerhold's style was famously anti-realistic, and Yuri Alexandrov's staging for the Kirov attempts to revert to it, though the results are at times unfocused. There's little suggestion of a rural community. Instead, the set is a massive constructivist-surrealist urban war zone, across which the Haydamaks goose-step in slow motion, while the Germans rampage with flame-throwers and gas masks and the village goes up in a welter of pyrotechnics. There are occasional attempts to make communism appear dubious, which sit uneasily with the work's propagandist aspects: fiery red gowns embroidered with hammers and sickles are splattered with mud; at the end, the survivors are cramped into uniformed convention, individuality destroyed as they clutch red books. The production won every award going in Russia when it opened in St Petersburg last year. At times I found myself wondering why. </p> <p>You can't fault the performance, however, which finds the Kirov ensemble at the height of its powers. The outstanding line-up of singers is dominated by Viktor Lutsiuk's wide-eyed, clarion Kotko and the astonishing Sofya of Tatiana Pavlovskaya, her voice soaring through the ensembles with sumptuous radiance. Gennady Bezzubenkov's Tkachenko is a perfect study in slimy malignancy, and there's a terrifying performance from Irina Loskutova as Lyubka, pushed into insanity by the shock of seeing her lover hanged. In the pit, Gergiev is predictably electric - but only when Prokofiev's score allows him to be. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), till July 13.</p>",

In a show with so much lofty symbolism, it's perhaps significant that the high point comes in a beautifully painted passage of down-to-earth trees. \u0095 Kingdom of the Soul is at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (0121-303 1966), till July 30.",

As Llewellyn Rees said to Robert Morley, meeting him in the street: \"Most of my friends think I'm dead.\" \"Surely not,\" Morley replied. \"If they look closely.\" Many situation comedies pop off suddenly or hang on grimly for no obvious reason. Very much like people really. </p> <p>Heartburn Hotel did not seem to endear itself to many as it did to me. The BBC's own continuity announcer still calls it Heartbreak Hotel. It is, however, co-written by John Sullivan, who also wrote Only Fools and Horses, so it is an egg worth incubating. The main characters are Harry and Duggie. Harry (Tim Healy) is short, ebullient and obnoxious and Duggie (Clive Russell) is tall, sensitive and depressed, which may sound familiar. They are helplessly joined at the hip because Harry once saved Duggie's life in the Falklands, or says he did. </p> <p>Happy is not funny, as Charles Schultz, the Peanuts man, once said. They are entirely different conditions. You never saw people further down the pipe than the residents of Heartburn Hotel. Peering down the plughole, you seem to see their bright little eyes looking back. The place itself is a memorial to dashed hopes, being renamed Olympic Hotel in the expectation of the Games coming to Smethwick. The Torvill and Dean lounge and the Geoff Capes room all strike a poignant bong like a passing bell. </p> <p>Making the best of a bad job, as all comedies do, Harry has filled his hotel with asylum seekers, old soldiers, misfits, drunks, dossers and loonies, one of whom says pointedly: \"In my own country I was a writer. I won many awards.\" </p> <p>I have been killing time, carefully skirting the fact that the central joke of last night's episode was a lighted fart. This is not the sort of gag that shows to best advantage in the modesty of print. A lighted fart is not verbal. It's visual, not to say audible, and thermal. It's like this. Harry is estranged from his wife, Susan (Jackie Downey). When Duggie asks him why they broke up, Harry says: \"I suppose it was habits. Little things like breaking wind and setting light to it. I realised after a few years it was a bit immature. But would she stop? No way!\" </p> <p>Suddenly Susan reappears in a puff of smoke that is more like a sheet of flame. She is a big woman resembling a jet-propelled Boadicea and her tour de force, even observed through frosted glass, would not disgrace Nasa. Her stay at Heartburn Hotel is brief. She leaves with tears in her eyes. But then, as Duggie says, she has just burned her arse. This is knockabout farce of a cartoonish character seldom seen on TV. If you think lighted farts are rude, remember Lloyd George's wise advice: \"Never apologise. Say it again, and next time ruder.\" </p> <p>Now, if you'll forgive me, I'll just go and wipe the salt off my face. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Brookside (Channel 4) someone else has appeared in a thunder flash, lashing his wee tail: Callum, fresh from murdering his brother and sister-in-law for their gangland empire, is pressing his psychotic suit on Lindsey. There is something about our Linds that is catnip to criminals. She looks wonderful in black fishnet stockings, which is a good start, of course, and she seems to have a natural gift for the job. It was our Linds who, when a former husband was being difficult about the custody of little Kylie, changed his mind with a Browning automatic. </p> <p>Callum and Lindsey's history has been a bumpy one. She had him shipped off to distant parts in a crate and he blew up her leisure club. You would be looking at them for some time before the word soulmates occurred to you. And you would be right.

      "body": "<p>Yay! That Tony Parsons novel, Man And Boy, has just dropped out of the paperback charts; after what seems like about eight years and three billion copies sold, the fruit of my much-despised first husband's brain will not be mocking me any longer whenever I step into W H Smith's for a quick copy of The Fur And Feather. Let's face it, my last two novels stiffed so badly you could have done your ironing on them; then along comes Shorty, with a book that makes Jilly Cooper look like a prime example of vanity publishing. </p> <p>I bought it the other day, at last, and found it strong stuff - Patience Strong, that is. No, really, having read the book, I can honestly report that it is not in any way autobiographical - the errant mother, Gina, is slender, beautiful and decent, while the long-suffering hero, Harry, is attractive to women, good in the sack and has all his own hair. So that rules me and Parsons right out. </p> <p>I'm actually very glad for Tony, because he really did want it so badly. (Oh and, um, because I, too, had a million-selling number-one novel, Ambition, when I was 29. And it was my first novel. Which does, I think, have the edge on getting the glory with your fifth novel, when you're 49, as Tone has). I'm only cross at myself; to think I swanned out and dumped the guy 16 years ago, leaving our bungalow in Billericay with nothing but a bottle of amyl nitrate, a g-string, a bust of Lenin and an attitude, in order to elope with my exotic Jewish lover to some millionaire's space-age pad in Hampstead! Why, if I'd stayed, I could be living the sweet life right now. But... yep, remembering that face and that voice from the last Late Review, I guess it was but a small price to pay. </p> <p>Ever since then it's been daggers drawn with every new dawn, and I suppose that, to those people who've had what is called an \"amicable divorce\" (I love that; like \"friendly fire\"), it seems a bit sad. I don't agree. I think that some people are meant to be our enemies from the start, but there's some sort of spanner in the works that makes us believe they're our nearest and dearest instead. When love turns to hate, it isn't really anything to get upset about; it's just that the truth will out. It's Nature's way of saying \"sorry\" for all the sappy things she made you do and say when you thought you were \"in love\". But now you're deep in hate, and the fun really starts. </p> <p>The awful truth is that most people are much more fun as enemies than they were as friends and/or lovers. Hatred brings out the artiste in individuals, whereas when we're in love we're all the same - one big blissed-out mess, like junkies are one and the same. If someone published your love letters, you'd want to crawl away and die, because, no matter how smart you are, they'd be some sort of variation of what Jeremy Thorpe famously wrote to Norman Scott: \"Bunnies can and will go to France!\" When you hate someone, though, you're totally yourself, hard, clean and glinting; you are, in fact, everything they loved you for in the first place. </p> <p>No matter how much sob sisters agonise about putting the romance back into a relationship, the fact remains that it is easier to put mercury back into the thermometer. The only responsible sex education for children would be the words THINGS CHANGE. Sex, with the same person, simply stops feeling like ANYTHING after a while; that is the plain and awful truth. When it comes to sex, novelty counts for so much that the straightest, simplest act of missionary intercourse with a new partner feels one thousand times dirtier, and therefore better, than the most protracted and perverted of acts with a familiar one. This is what the sexperts cannot get around; this is why the divorce rate keeps rising. Hatred brings the sparkle back: puts a spring in your step and a mote in your eye. How could I have been that stupid? When we fall out of love with someone, it gives us such a window of opportunity to look at ourselves and our delusions. </p> <p>Perhaps this is why I feel so pleased when a nice new feud is getting started; it's sort of a cross between mild sexual excitement and the feeling you get when the plane finally leaves the runway. And, like sex, I prefer it with men but I certainly don't rule women out, though it pains me to think of men gloating and thinking \"Catfight!\" </p> <p>Still, if a broad wants some, she can certainly have some; the latest contender was one Deborah Bosley, a jealous old trout who wants desperately to be a writer, but whose professional peak actually was as a waitress (sorry, Debs, \"head waitress\") at the Groucho Club, a post she left in order to shack up with a man old enough to be her granddad, Richard Ingrams. Recently she wrote a nasty letter to a newspaper about me, and I responded in kind. </p> <p> Things were just getting warm when the dirty spoilsport wrote a piece for the current New Statesman detailing her \"isolation, boredom, loneliness and long death of spirit\" as the kept woman of Ingrams in deepest Berkshire, a place not to her liking. She is also, she claims, becoming an alcoholic: \"Boredom and loneliness don't seem nearly so bad the other side of two bottles of wine a night.\" </p> <p>Don't you just hate it when people do that? Did no one inform this woman of the rules? Deborah, dear, don't make yourself look so pathetic, spineless and idle; that's my job. Our feud was shaping up so well, and now you've gone and ruined it by showing yourself not to be a worthy opponent, but instead a rather sad and confused mousewife who would make me feel a rotten bully if I were to stomp on you again. Now all you make me want to do is make you cups of tea and give you good advice. Along the lines of - there's this thing called earning your own living, Deborah, and, if you do it properly, you can live where you want. And you don't have to screw a man who looks like Victor Meldrew in order to keep a roof over your head. </p> <p>Ah well, I know my next b\u00eate noire is out there somewhere, filing their teeth and combing their feet and waiting for the call. I shall struggle on till then, but lack of a loathe object does cause life to lose a little of its zap and zest. Still, I shall comfort myself with the knowledge that there are no friends - only enemies we have yet to make.</p>",

According to www.thriveonline.com my spirituality should feel more intense and clear now, and I found a Hands-Off Introduction To Celibacy at www.bewell.com really helpful. Through them I found The Asexual Coalition web page (symbol: dandelion / motto: divide and conquer / official greeting: raise arms triumphantly and shout, 'ASEXUAL!' ), which I have joined. I look forward to my next party, where I'll use the greeting with strangers, to stop them from entertaining false illusions. So, I have made an appointment with Patrick to lose my dark, temptress locks and change my style into something chaste and subdued. The problem with giving up sex is that I already work incredibly long hours, so work can't be a substitute. Books are spiritual, but I can't get more spiritual than denying the flesh; to read now would be as self-destructive as working longer hours. That only leaves shopping (www.bezign.com). tanya@ gorgeoustanya.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time, or a year or two either side of 1655 if you need a more accurate fix, there must surely have been somebody in my shoes. All around him, he could see that a new kind of drink was catching on. It contained not a trace of alcohol, yet already it had its own culture, its own rituals and its own snobberies. There were those who swore that it was subverting the health of the nation. And there were those who whispered that soon the whole world would be drinking it.</p> <p>Yet not a single drop had passed his lips. What did it taste like? He asked his wife, but she hadn't a clue. He asked his friends, \"How did it make you feel?\" (for he had heard that people drank it chiefly for its effects), but it was evident from their vague replies that he kept the wrong sort of company. Where, then, could he sample it? That was easy, since an outlet was now on every other street.</p> <p>And so it came to pass that my imaginary forebear entered his first coffee house and, somewhat belatedly, sampled for himself the drink that was on everyone's lips. And when his head had stopped spinning, he looked around him at the new world he had just entered and wondered how so much could have been bubbling under without his ever having noticed it.</p> <p>Stepping into an off-licence to buy my very first can of \"functional energy drink\" is not in itself an eye-opening experience. I half expect the man behind the counter to wink knowingly as I hand him my \u00a31.20. Hasn't this stuff been described as everything from over-the-counter Viagra to a legal amphetamine? Don't people mix it with spirits before committing every outrageous act known to society? But he hands me my change without comment. Only later does that sense of revelation come, when I switch on my computer, summon up my favourite search engine and key in the name on the side of the can. Red Bull.</p> <p>WHOOOSH! That's the air coming out of my lungs as a high-speed lift drops me down 70 storeys and deposits me in an underground command centre whose existence I had never even suspected. Not literally, of course. But that's how I feel on entering my first energy-drink website - like a secret agent in a silly thriller who suddenly finds himself in a labyrinth of corridors and has to think quickly because he can hear footsteps approaching. Picking a door at random, I slip into the unknown.</p> <p>\"In typical Red Bull style,\" says the document that appears on my screen, \"we believe actions speak louder than words! That is why we have dedicated teams who are on the go in Red Bull Minis converted into refrigerators on wheels. The teams help consumers sprout wings just at the point when they most need a quick lift in everyday situations.\"</p> <p>It seems I'm being invited to become a \"Red Bull Sampler\" - someone who hands out free cans of drink to potential customers. \"One minute you might be in hospital sampling weary staff, the next you could be on a parachute drop zone, helping people live life to the extreme,\" says the invitation. But I make an excuse and leave.</p> <p>The next door is labelled Student High Fliers, and here they want to sign me up as a Red Bull Student Brand Manager. \"Likely tasks in the week of a Student Brand Manager may involve brainstorming ideas with the local sales teams, producing a story for the local or student press, feeding back information to Red Bull HQ on the latest drinking trends in your union bar, or writing a proposal to recommend Red Bull's involvement in a new marketing initiative on campus.\"</p> <p>It sounds exciting and dangerous - like working for MI5, or something. And there is even talk of \"complementing\" my student grant. The invitation ends with the question, \"Fancy joining this grinning bunch?\" But, alas, my student days are over.</p> <p>Passing from room to room, I quickly see that Red Bull is more than a beverage. For, like the giants of the soft-drinks world, the Cokes and the Pepsis, this single-brand Austrian company has been busy weaving its name into an entire lifestyle. Sports sponsorship leads the way, with snow-boarding, trial biking and \"extreme kayaking\" most prominent. Events have names such as Red Bull Mountain Mayhem or Red Bull Trash And Crash, and the talk is of \"endurance junkies\" and \"crowd-pumping adrenaline\", of \"hardcore water action\" and an \"explosive head-to-head contest\".</p> <p>After so much peripheral pumping and thrashing, it comes as a relief to find myself at the core of the operation at last. Here, in the relative calm of a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" page, I am invited to enquire, \"What does 'energy drink' really mean?\"</p> <p>An energy drink, says Red Bull, is a drink that \"due to its exceptional composition provides your body with extra energy during times of increased physical strain or stress\". The composition in question includes taurine, glucuronolactone and caffeine, \"as well as important vitamins and carbohydrates\". The effects of these ingredients, says the manufacturer, are \"increased physical endurance, improved reaction speed and concentration, increased mental alertness, an improved overall feeling of well-being, a stimulated metabolism and increased stamina.\" From man to superman in one sip.</p> <p>A sideways glance at a dictionary tells me that taurine is the name given to amido-ethyl-sulphonic acid, a substance obtained in 1826 from ox bile and contained in the bile of most other animals. The bovine connection clearly explains the name Red Bull, and I toy with the idea that all that extreme charging about might be down to nothing more than an excess of ox bile. But the website sets me straight.</p> <p>Frequently Asked Question: What exactly is taurine? \"Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid, which naturally occurs in the body. At times of extreme physical exertion, the body no longer produces the required amounts of taurine, and a relative deficiency results. Taurine acts as a metabolic transmitter and additionally has a detoxifying effect and strengthens cardiac contractility.\"</p> <p>Surprisingly, \"What do 'conditionally essential', 'metabolic transmitter' and 'cardiac contractility' mean in plain English?\" is not a frequently asked question, so I am left guessing. However, I do glean that the B-complex vitamins contained in Red Bull help to maintain physical stamina, and that glucuronolactone accelerates the elimination of toxic substances from the body. I also learn that the carbohydrates mentioned are almost entirely sugars in the form of glucose and sucrose, and that there is roughly the same amount of caffeine in a 250ml can of Red Bull as in a cup of filter coffee.</p> <p>Sated with science and damned statistics, I begin tunnelling out of the Red Bull complex. But, before I know it, I have been lured into a warren of smaller energy-drink websites. Something at the back of my mind - something that looks remarkably like a phone bill with my name on it - is urging me to get out, and fast. But how can I? For to pass among these dandified cans - to see the graphics and read the comments and reviews - is to pull the ring on a tinned history of popular culture in the past half decade. Battery, Bawls, Hype, Solstis, Red Devil, White Night, XTC, Jones Whoop Ass, Merlin's Energy Source . . . the names define each segment of the target audience, from under-age clubber to new-age goth, from swatting student to sweating athlete. There's something here for the frantic executive and the stressed taxi-driver, the heroic hospital doctor and the flagging ward sister. And with every can comes an implied promise. You need to get up? You want to stay up? Get this down you, and we guarantee you'll keep it up.</p> <p>While the more colourful-sounding ingredients vary - the herbs and amino acids, the vitamins and exotic plant extracts that could come as easily from a cosmetics or toiletries bottle as from a can of pop - many have at their heart a simple yet powerful blend of caffeine and sugars.</p> <p>Bawls derives its \"sweet yet spicy flavour\" from the \"legendary Guarana berry of the Amazonian Rainforest\" which contains \"a naturally occurring caffeine\", while Jones Whoop Ass \"kicks your butt\" with guarana, caffeine and ginseng. The makers of Merlin's Energy Source explain that guarana farming is a profitable way of saving the rainforest, reminding us that Merlin was \"a master of the forces of Mother Nature\" who blended herbs, roots and water \"to induce love, health, power and knowledge\".</p> <p>According to the makers of Tiger Shot, \"we have now reached the 'plus' age featuring energy-packed drinks and foods that replenish the body's need for vitamins and active substance\". Somewhere on the web-page, a pair of mannequins have jerky sex beside the words \"Sex Power\". The animation is too much for my tired computer. The screen freezes yet again and, in exasperation, I switch off and go to bed.</p> <p>The energy drink in the UK has a longer history than in any other country, thanks to a single brand that became a household name. In 1927, a Newcastle pharmacist invented a beverage that would provide sick children with glucose, the sugar that circulates in the bloodstream as \"blood sugar\" and that cells use as their main source of energy. As Glucozade - a name which was later changed to Lucozade - it was one of Britain's biggest-selling soft drinks for more than half a century.</p> <p>It was in the mid-80s that everything started to change. The first hint that something was afoot came in 1985, when Lucozade, now owned by SmithKline Beecham, used the decathlete Daley Thompson to promote the new message of \"everyday energy replacement\". A year later, serious complications began to set in.</p> <p>First, a new breed of glucose-based \"sports drinks\" started to appear, beginning with Dexters in 1986. Lucozade responded by producing its own sports drink, and so strong was the familiar name that Lucozade Sport immediately established a lead that it has maintained ever since. But hot on the heels of sports drinks came a wave of continental-style \"energy drinks\". Less dependent on glucose, and incorporating a number of other \"functional\" ingredients such as caffeine, these had been quietly brewing in Europe, where Lucozade was virtually unheard of.</p> <p>Before long, consumers' heads were buzzing - not with an excess of sugar and assorted stimulants, but with the sheer variety of different types of so-called \"smart\" drinks - drinks that purported to perform some function other than simple thirst quenching. The Lucozade name alone now appears on five different brands, sports drinks can be isotonic, hypertonic or hypotonic, and the situation gets more complicated by the week. Even the shopkeepers are confused, judging by the latest briefing to retailers published by Zenith International, a soft-drinks consultant.</p> <p>Zenith makes a stab at dividing the brands into three categories, which it names \"refreshment energy\", \"sports\" and \"functional energy\". Since 1995, says the briefing, there have been more than 40 launches, including Indigo, Lipovitan B3, Oasis Revitaliser, Red Card and various updates of Purdey's. \"The greatest focus of attention has been on whether all the non-glucose newcomers could create a coherent new segment in its own right. Lucozade's launch of Solstis in 1999 effectively acknowledged that a new segment has been created by Red Bull, making three in all.\"</p> <p>But a glance at the pie charts and bar graphs has me reaching out for a cup of good, strong coffee. Is an energy drink not a functional drink? Is a sports drink not an energy drink? I am helplessly adrift in a sea of fizz when the name Karen Hambly appears on my screen. Hambly is a sports scientist, who a couple of years back, when the market started going crazy, took it upon herself to create a web page that cut through the babble and explained in clear terms the intended functions of the different types of smart drink, and the why and when of who should be drinking them. It is the pick-me-up I am looking for.</p> <p>\"Until the last few years,\" says Hambly's document, \"the functional drinks have been geared towards replacing and maintaining either the fluid (water) or the fuel (sugars for energy) plus some of the vitamins and minerals (electrolytes) lost by the body. Generally this loss occurs during exercise and therefore most people refer to these beverages as 'sports drinks'. The sports drinks are the 'replacers and maintainers' in the functional drinks world.\"</p> <p>Sports drinks come in three types - isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic (it has to do with the strength of the solution in the drinks compared with that of your body fluids). The thrifty, says Hambly, can achieve much the same result simply by tossing a pinch of salt into a mug of warm water and then stirring in greater or lesser amounts of glucose.</p> <p>The most recent kind of functional energy drink she calls \"enhancers\", and these have nothing to do with replacing energy and fluid: \"In fact, if you want to use these drinks before, during or after exercise some brands suggest drinking equal quantities of water with their product.\"</p> <p>Enhancers are intended for use in times of increased stress or strain, which for most of us \"is more likely to be pressure at work, exams, driving, or even a heavy night out on the town, rather than intense exercise\". They work, Hambly explains, by improving concentration, mental endurance and reaction times, as well as physical endurance. And they can be divided into two groups based on their key ingredients: first come the arousers or elixirs (Hambly gives Lazarus and Purdey's as examples), and these are herbal-based, containing substances such as ginseng (\"some schools of thought put its benefits down to a placebo effect\"), but nothing at all that should keep you awake at night. And then come the stimulation drinks, \"possibly the most interesting drinks because of what they can do\".</p> <p><b> </b> Once upon a time, there was a man called Dietrich Mateschitz, and he worked for Unilever. Mateschitz frequently travelled to Asia, where he would meet local managers. After a long-haul flight, he was invariably exhausted. So his Asian friends introduced him to certain revitalising syrups that they were in the habit of consuming. Suitably revitalised, he saw a business opportunity staring him in the face.</p> <p>Mateschitz worked with a firm called TC Pharmaceuticals in Bangkok to produce a non-carbonated drink called Red Bull Kratingdaeng for sale in the Far East. He then set about formulating a fizzy but less syrupy version for the European market, and by 1987 he was ready to launch his product in his native Austria. Today, Red Bull is sold in 42 countries.</p> <p>When it came to Britain six years ago, Red Bull called itself an energy drink, but found itself up against Lucozade, the local brew. So, two years later, the word \"energy\" on British cans was changed to \"stimulation\", and the Bull never looked back. Last year, says Zenith, functional energy drinks \"literally took off\", with volume up 127% and value of sales almost trebling. Almost three quarters of those sales are of Red Bull, and single cans of the stuff actually outsold equivalent units of Coca-Cola in British supermarkets last year. \"On current trends,\" says Zenith's briefing to retailers, \"Red Bull could overtake Pepsi and Sunny Delight within three years.\" And so it goes on.</p> <p>Mateschitz is now a multi-squillionnaire, right? \"You probably wouldn't be far off,\" says Kate Broe, one of only 14 staff employed at Red Bull's modest UK headquarters on the eighth floor of a west-London office building. She met him once, at the company's HQ outside Salzburg, and mistook him for the cleaner in his jeans and T-shirt. \"He's totally unassuming,\" she says. \"And he keeps himself out of the press.\"</p> <p>Which is more than can be said for his concoction. In the few years since it appeared on British shelves, Red Bull has acquired a wild reputation with only occasional prodding from its manufacturer. Mixed with vodka (VRB), tequila (TRB) or Cockspur's rum (Cock 'n' Bull), it's powers of stimulation are regularly credited with keeping clubbers awake for longer, thereby increasing their capacity for alcohol and enhancing their proclivity for anti-social behaviour. The City of London, said one recent newspaper report, is fuelled on a high-octane blend of champagne and Red Bull, with dealers and brokers consuming prodigious quantities of \"Chambulls\" at the close of each day's business. No wonder the Police Federation talks of no-go areas.</p> <p>Alongside this self-perpetuating inferno of public awareness is an oral mythology that has grown up among Red Bull customers themselves. Take the ingredient taurine. \"Because of its name,\" says Broe, \"a lot of people think it's an extract of bull's testicles, or bile from bulls' stomachs. In fact, the glucuronolactone and the taurine we use are both pharmaceutically produced. But the minute the word of mouth dies - the minute it isn't liquid Viagra or legal cocaine - the minute it doesn't contain more caffeine than 12 espressos, then it's, like, would the last person out turn off the lights. The whole essence of Red Bull marketing isn't that we tell people what it is and why they should be drinking it. It's a word-of-mouth thing, and that's the kind of marketing you can't pay for.\"</p> <p>Broe talks a lot about \"senseful\" drinking, a word that I initially mistake for \"sensible\". But there's a subtle difference. \"It's when people play devil's advocate with themselves,\" she says. \"Okay, they're pumping alcohol into their body. But then maybe they want to mix it with natural fruit juices. Or they'll smoke 20 cigarettes a day, but it's okay because they go to the gym twice a week. You know that twisted mentality that says, 'I'm going to do it, but I might as well do it that little bit safer'? That will be the growth area. In future, people will want added value from everything they're drinking. There will be this whole pharmacy of drinks you drink because you want to wake up or you want to fall asleep or you want to be relaxed or whatever.\"</p> <p>Surprisingly, perhaps, she maintains that Red Bull never set out to be cool. \"But we had to choose fun ways to underline the brand functionality, and one of the ways that naturally happened, because of the popular culture of the time, was in terms of clubbing. These people were probably not drinking a lot of alcohol, they wanted to stay up all night, and the product just proved itself. And then they took it out of that environment and said, if it worked for me when I was clubbing it'll work for me when I'm studying, and if it worked for me when I'm studying, it'll work for me at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when I'm at work. And that's how it snowballs, slowly, slowly. But we're not out there saying, 'Come all ye nurses, you'll save more lives if you drink Red Bull.' \"</p> <p>However, lest you go charging off with the idea that all this word-of-mouth snowballing is an entirely spontaneous, uncontrolled process, listen to how Red Bull has been laying siege to one of its biggest unconquered markets - the US. \"Red Bull isn't legally available in New York,\" says Broe. \"It hasn't got a distributor. But there's some being shipped from Ireland because some of the New York club owners are from Dublin. They started giving the product just to waiters and waitresses, because they're the guys who are working all night. And one waitress had strapped the can to her tray and was walking around with it, and Demi Moore and Brad Pitt were asking, 'What's that?' The waitress told them, 'It's our drink because we're working so hard and it keeps us going. We're not selling it. It's just for us guys.' And the next thing you've got is magazines saying that Brad Pitt and Demi Moore are drinking the product, and you see it being thrown into the backs of cabs between clubs.\"</p> <p>Does she mean that the company has been deliberately restricting supplies of Red Bull to the US in order to make it seem more desirable? \"Oh yes. We really had to go for those opinion-formers to start with - the real cream of the star bars and clubs. It takes patience. If we were everywhere quickly, we would end up destroying the market. It would be a fad. But we can take our time, because we know the product works.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is convinced on that last point. I ask Ian Tokelove of the Food Commission, a body that represents consumer interests, what he thinks about the explosion of sports and energy drinks. \"You're buying into the image,\" he says. \"You're paying a lot of money for something you could make at home incredibly cheaply - for pence. But then you wouldn't get that lovely can and you wouldn't get the sexy marketing.\"</p> <p>It is certainly true that \"smart drinks\" sell at what the soft-drinks industry coyly calls \"a premium price\". The off-licence that sold me my \u00a31.20 can of Red Bull, for example, would have made around 40p on the sale, three times more than on a single can of cola. But isn't it worth paying more for a drink that improves my performance? Tokelove concedes that, to a professional athlete, a small physical effect might make the world of difference. \"But to any average member of the public, these drinks are going to have no effect on so-called performance.\"</p> <p>The main problem, he says, is that consumers don't really understand what, if anything, the various ingredients do. \"These drinks are crammed-packed full of sugar. People don't realise that when these drinks make the energy claim, what they are in fact saying is that this product is full of sugar and is therefore not necessarily good for the health. It can affect the way you behave. You will get a sugar rush - get jittery, and so on. It's basically the body trying to cope with the extra sugar.\"</p> <p>He is sceptical about the more exotic ingredients - taurine, for instance, which Red Bull's Kate Broe states is present in human breast milk, and is currently undergoing trials for its possible beneficial effects on racehorses. \"I'm quite sure that somebody somewhere will have done a small survey that has found that it does have a very small effect, which they can then blow out of all proportion,\" says Tokelove. \"But as regards rigorous scientific testing, I'm completely unaware of any. One person will say one thing and another will say another, and if you're promoting a product you will naturally pick the favourable research.\"</p> <p>An astonishing conversation that I subsequently have with a leading researcher in the field brings home to me just how hard it is to form any meaningful opinion on the question of whether this or that ingredient \"works\". Professor Jack James, head of the department of psychology at the National University of Ireland, Galway, has for some years been studying the effects of caffeine. Everybody I have spoken to so far, from sports scientist to consumer guardian, has taken for granted that, like it or not, caffeine functions as a stimulant. Does the professor accept that caffeinated drinks can therefore improve physical and mental performance? I expect him to prevaricate, but he is quite definite. \"Absolutely not,\" he says. \"If you like, I can take you through the argument.\"</p> <p>For a long time, says James, it has been generally believed that caffeine improves the ability to think quickly and clearly. \"This is a belief that has been in the scientific literature since the beginning of the 20th century. And it's a belief that is held, not unreasonably, by caffeine consumers themselves. As they will tell you, when they get up in the morning, they feel a bit sleepy and groggy, but when they have their first cup of coffee they feel ready to face the day.</p> <p>\"The scientific literature is based on many many studies which, on first impressions, would tend to support this interpretation. The classic sort of study is a double-blind challenge-type study where you have, for example, a group of subjects who will come into a laboratory to do a number of tests of their performance. They are assigned into two groups at random. One group receives caffeine and the other group receives a placebo.\"</p> <p>The subjects are all tested before taking a drink or capsule, and then some time later, and it has often been observed that the subjects who have received the caffeine perform better than the ones who did not. The obvious interpretation, and seemingly the only interpretation, says James, is that it's the caffeine that's making the difference.</p> <p>\"But there's one problem, and the problem is this. Caffeine is very widely consumed. Indeed, it's consumed by more than 80% of the population of the world on a daily basis. Hence, when the subjects are recruited, generally the majority of them will be caffeine consumers. Typically, the subjects are required to abstain from consuming any caffeine before they come into the laboratory. So they are in a period of abstinence. And we know from the pharmacological evidence that when they present in the laboratory they are in the early stages of caffeine withdrawal. So, the question then becomes: does the caffeine actually elevate performance above levels that are normal for that person, or is it just reversing the effects of withdrawal, which are, in fact, degrading their performance?\"</p> <p>When James conducted tests with subjects who were no longer suffering withdrawal symptoms, the results supported his suspicions. Caffeine does not elevate performance, he says. \"It just reverses the effects of caffeine withdrawal. If you are repeatedly exposed to caffeine, you become physically dependent on it, which means if you stop taking it abruptly, you suffer from discomfort, which encourages you to use it again.\"</p> <p>James, who abstains from both tea and coffee in the interests of his long-term health, believes that caffeine manufacturers are deliberately using energy drinks to create a new market, targeting young people. \"In previous decades, the inclusion of caffeine in drinks such as Coca-Cola was always justified by the manufacturers on the grounds that it enhanced taste. What's happening with these new drinks is a sea change. They are marketing drinks containing caffeine for its asserted pharmacological properties. The advertisements frequently use a style and language that comes from the drug culture, and I'm amazed that parents aren't up in arms about this.\"</p> <p>Something else the professor says sticks in my mind. Humans don't naturally like the bitterness of coffee, he says. But we learn to associate it with the drug on which we have become dependent. I make a mental note to remind myself, next time I slit open a fresh block of vacuum-packed coffee, that I don't really like the aroma, I only think I do. And I find myself wondering whether, if I had been introduced to caffeine through Red Bull or one of its sickly stable-mates, I wouldn't come to love the taste of energy drinks also.</p> <p>Oh, didn't I mention? I finally plucked up the courage to drink my can of Red Bull. In the interests of research, I approached it with an open mind. But somehow I couldn't entirely wipe from my brain a line I had read in a newspaper article. \"Taurine?\" said one anonymous taster on being told what he had just sampled. \"Are you sure there aren't a couple of letters too many at the start of that word?\"</p>",

The teams help consumers sprout wings just at the point when they most need a quick lift in everyday situations.\" It seems I'm being invited to become a \"Red Bull Sampler\" - someone who hands out free cans of drink to potential customers. \"One minute you might be in hospital sampling weary staff, the next you could be on a parachute drop zone, helping people live life to the extreme,\" says the invitation. But I make an excuse and leave. The next door is labelled Student High Fliers, and here they want to sign me up as a Red Bull Student Brand Manager. \"Likely tasks in the week of a Student Brand Manager may involve brainstorming ideas with the local sales teams, producing a story for the local or student press, feeding back information to Red Bull HQ on the latest drinking trends in your union bar, or writing a proposal to recommend Red Bull's involvement in a new marketing initiative on campus.\" It sounds exciting and dangerous - like working for MI5, or something. And there is even talk of \"complementing\" my student grant. The invitation ends with the question, \"Fancy joining this grinning bunch?\" But, alas, my student days are over. Passing from room to room, I quickly see that Red Bull is more than a beverage. For, like the giants of the soft-drinks world, the Cokes and the Pepsis, this single-brand Austrian company has been busy weaving its name into an entire lifestyle. Sports sponsorship leads the way, with snow-boarding, trial biking and \"extreme kayaking\" most prominent. Events have names such as Red Bull Mountain Mayhem or Red Bull Trash And Crash, and the talk is of \"endurance junkies\" and \"crowd-pumping adrenaline\", of \"hardcore water action\" and an \"explosive head-to-head contest\". After so much peripheral pumping and thrashing, it comes as a relief to find myself at the core of the operation at last. Here, in the relative calm of a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" page, I am invited to enquire, \"What does 'energy drink' really mean?\" An energy drink, says Red Bull, is a drink that \"due to its exceptional composition provides your body with extra energy during times of increased physical strain or stress\". The composition in question includes taurine, glucuronolactone and caffeine, \"as well as important vitamins and carbohydrates\". The effects of these ingredients, says the manufacturer, are \"increased physical endurance, improved reaction speed and concentration, increased mental alertness, an improved overall feeling of well-being, a stimulated metabolism and increased stamina.\" From man to superman in one sip. A sideways glance at a dictionary tells me that taurine is the name given to amido-ethyl-sulphonic acid, a substance obtained in 1826 from ox bile and contained in the bile of most other animals. The bovine connection clearly explains the name Red Bull, and I toy with the idea that all that extreme charging about might be down to nothing more than an excess of ox bile. But the website sets me straight. Frequently Asked Question: What exactly is taurine? \"Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid, which naturally occurs in the body. At times of extreme physical exertion, the body no longer produces the required amounts of taurine, and a relative deficiency results. Taurine acts as a metabolic transmitter and additionally has a detoxifying effect and strengthens cardiac contractility.\" Surprisingly, \"What do 'conditionally essential', 'metabolic transmitter' and 'cardiac contractility' mean in plain English?\" is not a frequently asked question, so I am left guessing. However, I do glean that the B-complex vitamins contained in Red Bull help to maintain physical stamina, and that glucuronolactone accelerates the elimination of toxic substances from the body. I also learn that the carbohydrates mentioned are almost entirely sugars in the form of glucose and sucrose, and that there is roughly the same amount of caffeine in a 250ml can of Red Bull as in a cup of filter coffee. Sated with science and damned statistics, I begin tunnelling out of the Red Bull complex. But, before I know it, I have been lured into a warren of smaller energy-drink websites. Something at the back of my mind - something that looks remarkably like a phone bill with my name on it - is urging me to get out, and fast. But how can I? For to pass among these dandified cans - to see the graphics and read the comments and reviews - is to pull the ring on a tinned history of popular culture in the past half decade. Battery, Bawls, Hype, Solstis, Red Devil, White Night, XTC, Jones Whoop Ass, Merlin's Energy Source . . . the names define each segment of the target audience, from under-age clubber to new-age goth, from swatting student to sweating athlete. There's something here for the frantic executive and the stressed taxi-driver, the heroic hospital doctor and the flagging ward sister. And with every can comes an implied promise. You need to get up? You want to stay up? Get this down you, and we guarantee you'll keep it up. While the more colourful-sounding ingredients vary - the herbs and amino acids, the vitamins and exotic plant extracts that could come as easily from a cosmetics or toiletries bottle as from a can of pop - many have at their heart a simple yet powerful blend of caffeine and sugars. Bawls derives its \"sweet yet spicy flavour\" from the \"legendary Guarana berry of the Amazonian Rainforest\" which contains \"a naturally occurring caffeine\", while Jones Whoop Ass \"kicks your butt\" with guarana, caffeine and ginseng. The makers of Merlin's Energy Source explain that guarana farming is a profitable way of saving the rainforest, reminding us that Merlin was \"a master of the forces of Mother Nature\" who blended herbs, roots and water \"to induce love, health, power and knowledge\". According to the makers of Tiger Shot, \"we have now reached the 'plus' age featuring energy-packed drinks and foods that replenish the body's need for vitamins and active substance\". Somewhere on the web-page, a pair of mannequins have jerky sex beside the words \"Sex Power\". The animation is too much for my tired computer. The screen freezes yet again and, in exasperation, I switch off and go to bed. The energy drink in the UK has a longer history than in any other country, thanks to a single brand that became a household name. In 1927, a Newcastle pharmacist invented a beverage that would provide sick children with glucose, the sugar that circulates in the bloodstream as \"blood sugar\" and that cells use as their main source of energy. As Glucozade - a name which was later changed to Lucozade - it was one of Britain's biggest-selling soft drinks for more than half a century. It was in the mid-80s that everything started to change. The first hint that something was afoot came in 1985, when Lucozade, now owned by SmithKline Beecham, used the decathlete Daley Thompson to promote the new message of \"everyday energy replacement\". A year later, serious complications began to set in. First, a new breed of glucose-based \"sports drinks\" started to appear, beginning with Dexters in 1986. Lucozade responded by producing its own sports drink, and so strong was the familiar name that Lucozade Sport immediately established a lead that it has maintained ever since. But hot on the heels of sports drinks came a wave of continental-style \"energy drinks\". Less dependent on glucose, and incorporating a number of other \"functional\" ingredients such as caffeine, these had been quietly brewing in Europe, where Lucozade was virtually unheard of. Before long, consumers' heads were buzzing - not with an excess of sugar and assorted stimulants, but with the sheer variety of different types of so-called \"smart\" drinks - drinks that purported to perform some function other than simple thirst quenching. The Lucozade name alone now appears on five different brands, sports drinks can be isotonic, hypertonic or hypotonic, and the situation gets more complicated by the week. Even the shopkeepers are confused, judging by the latest briefing to retailers published by Zenith International, a soft-drinks consultant. Zenith makes a stab at dividing the brands into three categories, which it names \"refreshment energy\", \"sports\" and \"functional energy\". Since 1995, says the briefing, there have been more than 40 launches, including Indigo, Lipovitan B3, Oasis Revitaliser, Red Card and various updates of Purdey's. \"The greatest focus of attention has been on whether all the non-glucose newcomers could create a coherent new segment in its own right. Lucozade's launch of Solstis in 1999 effectively acknowledged that a new segment has been created by Red Bull, making three in all.\" But a glance at the pie charts and bar graphs has me reaching out for a cup of good, strong coffee. Is an energy drink not a functional drink? Is a sports drink not an energy drink? I am helplessly adrift in a sea of fizz when the name Karen Hambly appears on my screen. Hambly is a sports scientist, who a couple of years back, when the market started going crazy, took it upon herself to create a web page that cut through the babble and explained in clear terms the intended functions of the different types of smart drink, and the why and when of who should be drinking them. It is the pick-me-up I am looking for. \"Until the last few years,\" says Hambly's document, \"the functional drinks have been geared towards replacing and maintaining either the fluid (water) or the fuel (sugars for energy) plus some of the vitamins and minerals (electrolytes) lost by the body. Generally this loss occurs during exercise and therefore most people refer to these beverages as 'sports drinks'. The sports drinks are the 'replacers and maintainers' in the functional drinks world.\" Sports drinks come in three types - isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic (it has to do with the strength of the solution in the drinks compared with that of your body fluids). The thrifty, says Hambly, can achieve much the same result simply by tossing a pinch of salt into a mug of warm water and then stirring in greater or lesser amounts of glucose. The most recent kind of functional energy drink she calls \"enhancers\", and these have nothing to do with replacing energy and fluid: \"In fact, if you want to use these drinks before, during or after exercise some brands suggest drinking equal quantities of water with their product.\" Enhancers are intended for use in times of increased stress or strain, which for most of us \"is more likely to be pressure at work, exams, driving, or even a heavy night out on the town, rather than intense exercise\". They work, Hambly explains, by improving concentration, mental endurance and reaction times, as well as physical endurance. And they can be divided into two groups based on their key ingredients: first come the arousers or elixirs (Hambly gives Lazarus and Purdey's as examples), and these are herbal-based, containing substances such as ginseng (\"some schools of thought put its benefits down to a placebo effect\"), but nothing at all that should keep you awake at night. And then come the stimulation drinks, \"possibly the most interesting drinks because of what they can do\". Once upon a time, there was a man called Dietrich Mateschitz, and he worked for Unilever. Mateschitz frequently travelled to Asia, where he would meet local managers. After a long-haul flight, he was invariably exhausted. So his Asian friends introduced him to certain revitalising syrups that they were in the habit of consuming. Suitably revitalised, he saw a business opportunity staring him in the face. Mateschitz worked with a firm called TC Pharmaceuticals in Bangkok to produce a non-carbonated drink called Red Bull Kratingdaeng for sale in the Far East. He then set about formulating a fizzy but less syrupy version for the European market, and by 1987 he was ready to launch his product in his native Austria. Today, Red Bull is sold in 42 countries. When it came to Britain six years ago, Red Bull called itself an energy drink, but found itself up against Lucozade, the local brew. So, two years later, the word \"energy\" on British cans was changed to \"stimulation\", and the Bull never looked back. Last year, says Zenith, functional energy drinks \"literally took off\", with volume up 127% and value of sales almost trebling. Almost three quarters of those sales are of Red Bull, and single cans of the stuff actually outsold equivalent units of Coca-Cola in British supermarkets last year. \"On current trends,\" says Zenith's briefing to retailers, \"Red Bull could overtake Pepsi and Sunny Delight within three years.\" And so it goes on. Mateschitz is now a multi-squillionnaire, right? \"You probably wouldn't be far off,\" says Kate Broe, one of only 14 staff employed at Red Bull's modest UK headquarters on the eighth floor of a west-London office building. She met him once, at the company's HQ outside Salzburg, and mistook him for the cleaner in his jeans and T-shirt. \"He's totally unassuming,\" she says. \"And he keeps himself out of the press.\" Which is more than can be said for his concoction. In the few years since it appeared on British shelves, Red Bull has acquired a wild reputation with only occasional prodding from its manufacturer. Mixed with vodka (VRB), tequila (TRB) or Cockspur's rum (Cock 'n' Bull), it's powers of stimulation are regularly credited with keeping clubbers awake for longer, thereby increasing their capacity for alcohol and enhancing their proclivity for anti-social behaviour. The City of London, said one recent newspaper report, is fuelled on a high-octane blend of champagne and Red Bull, with dealers and brokers consuming prodigious quantities of \"Chambulls\" at the close of each day's business. No wonder the Police Federation talks of no-go areas. Alongside this self-perpetuating inferno of public awareness is an oral mythology that has grown up among Red Bull customers themselves. Take the ingredient taurine. \"Because of its name,\" says Broe, \"a lot of people think it's an extract of bull's testicles, or bile from bulls' stomachs. In fact, the glucuronolactone and the taurine we use are both pharmaceutically produced. But the minute the word of mouth dies - the minute it isn't liquid Viagra or legal cocaine - the minute it doesn't contain more caffeine than 12 espressos, then it's, like, would the last person out turn off the lights. The whole essence of Red Bull marketing isn't that we tell people what it is and why they should be drinking it. It's a word-of-mouth thing, and that's the kind of marketing you can't pay for.\" Broe talks a lot about \"senseful\" drinking, a word that I initially mistake for \"sensible\". But there's a subtle difference. \"It's when people play devil's advocate with themselves,\" she says. \"Okay, they're pumping alcohol into their body. But then maybe they want to mix it with natural fruit juices. Or they'll smoke 20 cigarettes a day, but it's okay because they go to the gym twice a week. You know that twisted mentality that says, 'I'm going to do it, but I might as well do it that little bit safer'? That will be the growth area. In future, people will want added value from everything they're drinking. There will be this whole pharmacy of drinks you drink because you want to wake up or you want to fall asleep or you want to be relaxed or whatever.\" Surprisingly, perhaps, she maintains that Red Bull never set out to be cool. \"But we had to choose fun ways to underline the brand functionality, and one of the ways that naturally happened, because of the popular culture of the time, was in terms of clubbing. These people were probably not drinking a lot of alcohol, they wanted to stay up all night, and the product just proved itself. And then they took it out of that environment and said, if it worked for me when I was clubbing it'll work for me when I'm studying, and if it worked for me when I'm studying, it'll work for me at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when I'm at work. And that's how it snowballs, slowly, slowly. But we're not out there saying, 'Come all ye nurses, you'll save more lives if you drink Red Bull.' \" However, lest you go charging off with the idea that all this word-of-mouth snowballing is an entirely spontaneous, uncontrolled process, listen to how Red Bull has been laying siege to one of its biggest unconquered markets - the US. \"Red Bull isn't legally available in New York,\" says Broe. \"It hasn't got a distributor. But there's some being shipped from Ireland because some of the New York club owners are from Dublin. They started giving the product just to waiters and waitresses, because they're the guys who are working all night. And one waitress had strapped the can to her tray and was walking around with it, and Demi Moore and Brad Pitt were asking, 'What's that?' The waitress told them, 'It's our drink because we're working so hard and it keeps us going. We're not selling it. It's just for us guys.' And the next thing you've got is magazines saying that Brad Pitt and Demi Moore are drinking the product, and you see it being thrown into the backs of cabs between clubs.\" Does she mean that the company has been deliberately restricting supplies of Red Bull to the US in order to make it seem more desirable? \"Oh yes. We really had to go for those opinion-formers to start with - the real cream of the star bars and clubs. It takes patience. If we were everywhere quickly, we would end up destroying the market. It would be a fad. But we can take our time, because we know the product works.\" Not everyone is convinced on that last point. I ask Ian Tokelove of the Food Commission, a body that represents consumer interests, what he thinks about the explosion of sports and energy drinks. \"You're buying into the image,\" he says. \"You're paying a lot of money for something you could make at home incredibly cheaply - for pence. But then you wouldn't get that lovely can and you wouldn't get the sexy marketing.\" It is certainly true that \"smart drinks\" sell at what the soft-drinks industry coyly calls \"a premium price\". The off-licence that sold me my \u00a31.20 can of Red Bull, for example, would have made around 40p on the sale, three times more than on a single can of cola. But isn't it worth paying more for a drink that improves my performance? Tokelove concedes that, to a professional athlete, a small physical effect might make the world of difference. \"But to any average member of the public, these drinks are going to have no effect on so-called performance.\" The main problem, he says, is that consumers don't really understand what, if anything, the various ingredients do. \"These drinks are crammed-packed full of sugar. People don't realise that when these drinks make the energy claim, what they are in fact saying is that this product is full of sugar and is therefore not necessarily good for the health. It can affect the way you behave. You will get a sugar rush - get jittery, and so on. It's basically the body trying to cope with the extra sugar.\" He is sceptical about the more exotic ingredients - taurine, for instance, which Red Bull's Kate Broe states is present in human breast milk, and is currently undergoing trials for its possible beneficial effects on racehorses. \"I'm quite sure that somebody somewhere will have done a small survey that has found that it does have a very small effect, which they can then blow out of all proportion,\" says Tokelove. \"But as regards rigorous scientific testing, I'm completely unaware of any. One person will say one thing and another will say another, and if you're promoting a product you will naturally pick the favourable research.\" An astonishing conversation that I subsequently have with a leading researcher in the field brings home to me just how hard it is to form any meaningful opinion on the question of whether this or that ingredient \"works\". Professor Jack James, head of the department of psychology at the National University of Ireland, Galway, has for some years been studying the effects of caffeine. Everybody I have spoken to so far, from sports scientist to consumer guardian, has taken for granted that, like it or not, caffeine functions as a stimulant. Does the professor accept that caffeinated drinks can therefore improve physical and mental performance? I expect him to prevaricate, but he is quite definite. \"Absolutely not,\" he says. \"If you like, I can take you through the argument.\" For a long time, says James, it has been generally believed that caffeine improves the ability to think quickly and clearly. \"This is a belief that has been in the scientific literature since the beginning of the 20th century. And it's a belief that is held, not unreasonably, by caffeine consumers themselves. As they will tell you, when they get up in the morning, they feel a bit sleepy and groggy, but when they have their first cup of coffee they feel ready to face the day. \"The scientific literature is based on many many studies which, on first impressions, would tend to support this interpretation. The classic sort of study is a double-blind challenge-type study where you have, for example, a group of subjects who will come into a laboratory to do a number of tests of their performance. They are assigned into two groups at random. One group receives caffeine and the other group receives a placebo.\" The subjects are all tested before taking a drink or capsule, and then some time later, and it has often been observed that the subjects who have received the caffeine perform better than the ones who did not. The obvious interpretation, and seemingly the only interpretation, says James, is that it's the caffeine that's making the difference. \"But there's one problem, and the problem is this. Caffeine is very widely consumed. Indeed, it's consumed by more than 80% of the population of the world on a daily basis. Hence, when the subjects are recruited, generally the majority of them will be caffeine consumers. Typically, the subjects are required to abstain from consuming any caffeine before they come into the laboratory. So they are in a period of abstinence. And we know from the pharmacological evidence that when they present in the laboratory they are in the early stages of caffeine withdrawal. So, the question then becomes: does the caffeine actually elevate performance above levels that are normal for that person, or is it just reversing the effects of withdrawal, which are, in fact, degrading their performance?\" When James conducted tests with subjects who were no longer suffering withdrawal symptoms, the results supported his suspicions. Caffeine does not elevate performance, he says. \"It just reverses the effects of caffeine withdrawal. If you are repeatedly exposed to caffeine, you become physically dependent on it, which means if you stop taking it abruptly, you suffer from discomfort, which encourages you to use it again.\" James, who abstains from both tea and coffee in the interests of his long-term health, believes that caffeine manufacturers are deliberately using energy drinks to create a new market, targeting young people. \"In previous decades, the inclusion of caffeine in drinks such as Coca-Cola was always justified by the manufacturers on the grounds that it enhanced taste. What's happening with these new drinks is a sea change. They are marketing drinks containing caffeine for its asserted pharmacological properties. The advertisements frequently use a style and language that comes from the drug culture, and I'm amazed that parents aren't up in arms about this.\" Something else the professor says sticks in my mind. Humans don't naturally like the bitterness of coffee, he says. But we learn to associate it with the drug on which we have become dependent. I make a mental note to remind myself, next time I slit open a fresh block of vacuum-packed coffee, that I don't really like the aroma, I only think I do. And I find myself wondering whether, if I had been introduced to caffeine through Red Bull or one of its sickly stable-mates, I wouldn't come to love the taste of energy drinks also. Oh, didn't I mention? I finally plucked up the courage to drink my can of Red Bull. In the interests of research, I approached it with an open mind. But somehow I couldn't entirely wipe from my brain a line I had read in a newspaper article. \"Taurine?\" said one anonymous taster on being told what he had just sampled. \"Are you sure there aren't a couple of letters too many at the start of that word?\"",

Another small-flowered perennial that was widely recurring was Knautia macedonica, which is a small-headed scabious with deep, maroon flowers. But there was structure from plants such as the purple spikes of Salvia nemorosa 'East Friesland' and the table-top corymbs of bright yellow Achillea 'Coronation Gold'. This pairing is in danger of becoming a clich\u00e9. Then, as strong punctuation marks, there would be solo plants (though others within hailing distance) of bold clary, Salvia sclarea turkestanica.</p> <p>Then there were grasses. Of course there were; they are so trendy. For instance, flowering at that time was the 1m-high Festuca mairei, never in blocks where the stems of one plant would interfere with the stems of the next, but in uneven drifts. Verbascums can usually be relied upon to stand up and be counted, and there are different species for different seasons. Likewise alliums, which were widely scattered so that their spherical or hemispherical flower heads made a generalised impression. To maintain a complex scenario such as this - not just weed-free, but so that the original intention does not become blurred - requires a good deal of intelligent care. (There are not really enough intelligent hands-on gardeners to go round. They all want to branch out into landscape design, where there is more money and greater physical comfort. But I believe the Waiser style could well be adapted in British private gardens where the owners are dedicated slaves to their mania.)</p> <p>Our itinerary then took us to the garden of perennials at Weinstephan, near Munich, in part of the grounds of a horticultural college. It is a broadly rectangular area, designed to be seen from one end against a backcloth of blue spruces. Their colouring suggested a primarily orange and mauve (from catmint, which was doubtless thought of as blue) colour theme, these being complementary colours, but white was allowed. L. coronaria was in its albino strain. Wickedly, it occurred to me that a well-distributed rash of magenta L. coronaria would make an exciting addition, but that, of course, would break the rules that we have imposed upon ourselves.</p> <p>It was interesting here that, apart from spires of buff-orange eremurus, there was little grouping but a pretty even scatter of ingredients. Although pointillist, like an impressionist painting, in the aggregate, it was a pretty uniform tapestry and effective as such. Straight paths were simply for easy access and of no visual importance - you placed yourself in the correct position and looked.</p> <p>I have never seen anything like this before, and it is good to know that there are experimenters around. Upkeep was meticulous - it needed to be. And there were plenty of later-flowering ingredients for following on, though none with the panache of lilies, eremurus and kniphofias that dominated in early summer</p>",

Then there were grasses. Of course there were; they are so trendy. For instance, flowering at that time was the 1m-high Festuca mairei, never in blocks where the stems of one plant would interfere with the stems of the next, but in uneven drifts. Verbascums can usually be relied upon to stand up and be counted, and there are different species for different seasons. Likewise alliums, which were widely scattered so that their spherical or hemispherical flower heads made a generalised impression. To maintain a complex scenario such as this - not just weed-free, but so that the original intention does not become blurred - requires a good deal of intelligent care. (There are not really enough intelligent hands-on gardeners to go round. They all want to branch out into landscape design, where there is more money and greater physical comfort. But I believe the Waiser style could well be adapted in British private gardens where the owners are dedicated slaves to their mania.) Our itinerary then took us to the garden of perennials at Weinstephan, near Munich, in part of the grounds of a horticultural college. It is a broadly rectangular area, designed to be seen from one end against a backcloth of blue spruces. Their colouring suggested a primarily orange and mauve (from catmint, which was doubtless thought of as blue) colour theme, these being complementary colours, but white was allowed. L. coronaria was in its albino strain. Wickedly, it occurred to me that a well-distributed rash of magenta L. coronaria would make an exciting addition, but that, of course, would break the rules that we have imposed upon ourselves. It was interesting here that, apart from spires of buff-orange eremurus, there was little grouping but a pretty even scatter of ingredients. Although pointillist, like an impressionist painting, in the aggregate, it was a pretty uniform tapestry and effective as such. Straight paths were simply for easy access and of no visual importance - you placed yourself in the correct position and looked. I have never seen anything like this before, and it is good to know that there are experimenters around. Upkeep was meticulous - it needed to be. And there were plenty of later-flowering ingredients for following on, though none with the panache of lilies, eremurus and kniphofias that dominated in early summer",

Spain's economic need to export much of its wine on an exchange-rate basis so favourable to Britain will ensure that it will continue to increase its share of the market; Chile's exports could expand to three times their present size; and Argentina has the opportunity to become a significant force with the possibility, one day, of being only spitting distance behind Italy as an exporter to the UK. </p> <p>It is to Tesco that we repair for the first of these wines.

I will not have this soup today.\" Anyone familiar with Struwwelpeter, or Straw-Headed Peter, that classic Victorian manual on how to bring up your child, will recognise the ditty. Honestly, those Victorians have a lot to answer for.</p> <p>There is no other dish in the cook's repertoire that follows the seasons as well as soup. In spring and summer, it is light and delicate, made pale and dreamy by the early-season vegetables; as the days shorten and autumn approaches, it becomes increasingly robust and strengthening; then, in winter, it takes on another guise again, when great meaty pots of broth and hefty lentil soups are the order of the day, the one-pot dish par excellence.</p> <p>But it's summer soups that appeal to me most, for they are the simplest, most elegant, daintiest - and, best of all, easiest to prepare, requiring but the smallest effort (and even that can be completed without fuss during the cool morning hours). After that, it's just a case of setting the soup in the fridge, be that for chilling it in preparation for eating it cold or for leaving the flavours to mingle before being reheated. Eat them cold, eat them warm: they taste equally splendid. All food is a matter of taste, but soups depend more than most other dishes purely on what takes your fancy.</p> <p>So easy is it to make a good one that I would like to say there is no such thing as a bad soup, but that's not true. Bad soups can only be the product of pure laziness, nothing less, so a sound keelhauling would not be too harsh a punishment for the purveyor of such culinary abuse. Flour and powder - be they flavoured or coloured - are simply not welcome in any soup, and should herewith be banished. A good soup has no need of such embellishments.</p> <p>In terms of shopping, there is possibly no easier dish to provide for, as just about every vegetable at the supermarket or greengrocer's can be put into the pot and come up trumps. As always, buy the best you can afford. Taking care to get the finest ingredients is vital to your chances of ending up with a truly great dish. Then you must pay close attention to the seasoning. And, finally, be clear on whether to use stock or water. (Generally speaking, the lower the quality of the ingredients, the more likely you will need to call on the help of stock, as its stronger flavour will help disguise any failings in your raw materials. However, stock is not vital to every soup - being stockless need not be a deterrent to the cook who is short of time.)</p> <p>As summer progresses and the quality, variety and availability of ingredients improves so, too, I hope, our soups will benefit accordingly. Peas, broad beans, spinach, sorrel, fennel, watercress, leeks, potatoes, tomatoes, courgettes and so on and so forth can be podded, peeled, sliced or chopped, then simmered, before being rendered to a smooth pur\u00e9e (the ideal consistency of such soups is that of pouring cream), ideally by passing them through a very fine sieve (chefs use a chinois or, if serious perfectionists, muslin, to refine their soups).</p> <p>Even the youngest tiny vegetables, simmered in their own cooking liquor and then enlivened with fresh herbs, and possibly a little olive oil, make a pleasing soup that is at once light and filling and has the added bonus of being perfect for hot weather, which ruins the appetite and puts to rest all thoughts of spending hours at the stove.</p> <p>That brings us back to the question of the temperature at which to serve the soup, in which decision you must always observe two rules. First, chilled soup must be just that - thoroughly chilled, with not a hint of warmth about it. And second, hot soup must be thoroughly heated. Apart from that, a hunk or two of good bread, some butter, possibly a bowl of salad to follow, and then a nice piece of cheese, all accompanied by a bottle of the good stuff, goes down a treat - as would a nod to the Big Yin, asking for a hot sun in blue skies.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Crab soup with chilli and parsley</b></p> <p><b>1 large crab</b></p> <p><b>1 onion</b></p> <p><b>1 carrot</b></p> <p><b>1 leek</b></p> <p><b>3 tomatoes</b></p> <p><b>1 stick celery</b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic</b></p> <p><b>1 bayleaf</b></p> <p><b>A small sprig thyme</b></p> <p><b>1-2 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>1.4 litres water</b></p> <p><b>600ml white wine</b></p> <p><b>400ml whipping cream</b></p> <p><b>Lemon juice (optional)</b></p> <p><b>1 small handful picked flat-leaf parsley</b></p> <p><b>1 red chilli</b></p> <p><b>4 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p>Peel and finely chop the vegetables, garlic and tomato. In a large pot that is big enough later to accommodate the crab and liquid, fry the chopped vegetables in a little olive oil, along with the thyme and bayleaf. Add the crab to the pot, pour over the water and cover the pan with a lid. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes or so. Carefully remove the crab from the stock, and set aside to cool. Leave the stock in the pot.</p> <p>Once the crab has cooled, crack it apart and remove the flesh, both brown meat and white, taking care to leave all trace of shell behind. Pop the shell back into the pot and add the wine. Simmer for 10 minutes, then pour the stock through a sieve. Return the soup to the stove, add the cream and bring to the boil again. Simmer for a further five minutes, adjust the seasoning and pass through a fine sieve again. Leave to cool, then chill the soup in the fridge and stir in the crab meats, adding a squeeze of lemon juice if required.</p> <p>Finely chop the parsley and chilli, and mix with the olive oil. Add a spoonful of this mixture to each bowl when serving.</p> <p><b> Chickpea and saffron broth</b></p> <p><b>250g dried chickpeas (canned chickpeas do not work very well in this recipe)</b></p> <p><b>4 courgettes</b></p> <p><b>4 plump, ripe tomatoes</b></p> <p><b>2 medium-sized onions, peeled</b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic</b></p> <p><b>1 red chilli</b></p> <p><b>1 bayleaf</b></p> <p><b>1 generous pinch best-quality saffron</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp chopped parsley</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp chopped coriander</b></p> <p>Soak the chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water. Fully drain and rinse the chickpeas, and place in a roomy pot on the stove. Bring to a boil, and skim off any foam and particles that rise to the surface. Drop in the chilli and bayleaf. Leave the pan to simmer for two hours - the peas may take longer, depending on their age, so make sure they are fully cooked.</p> <p>Cut the courgette, onions and tomatoes into small pieces. Drop into the pot and return to the boil. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface, and lower to a simmer for half-an-hour or so. Finely chop the garlic and add it to the pot, along with the saffron and seasoning to taste. Cook the soup for a further five minutes, add the chopped herbs and serve forthwith.</p> <p>Needless to say, this soup sits very well for several days - the flavours mellow beautifully, although a little more saffron may be required.</p> <p><b> Potage cr\u00e8me germiny</b></p> <p>A truly great soup.</p> <p><b> 3 large handfuls sorrel</b></p> <p><b>5 large handfuls spinach</b></p> <p><b>12 spring onions</b></p> <p><b>850ml pale chicken stock</b></p> <p><b>4 fresh egg yolks</b></p> <p><b>340ml whipping cream</b></p> <p><b>Sea salt and black pepper</b></p> <p>Prepare the leaves, removing any excess stalk, and yellowing or impaired leaves. Wash thoroughly. Tip the stock into a big pot and bring to the boil. Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add them to the pot. Once the pot is boiling, add the leaves and simmer for two minutes or so, then liquidise at once. Pass the soup through a fine sieve, return it to the pot, and season.</p> <p>If you are making the soup in advance, cool it at once and reheat only at the last minute. To serve, gently warm the soup, and in the meantime mix the yolks and cream in a bowl, adding them to the pot once the soup is good and hot. Remove the soup from the heat immediately - do not be tempted to let it linger over the flame for even a moment - then, stirring all the while, return to the stove above a low flame for the briefest time until it thickens, just. Serve at once.</p> <p><b> Fennel and almond soup</b></p> <p>Almonds and fennel have a curious affinity. Though this soup may be served warm, it is very good chilled.</p> <p><b> 2 litres chicken stock</b></p> <p><b>525g fennel bulbs</b></p> <p><b>1 small onion</b></p> <p><b>1 small stick celery</b></p> <p><b>80g almonds</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp good-quality olive oil</b></p> <p><b>150ml whipping cream</b></p> <p><b>lemon, juiced</b></p> <p><b>1 spoonful flaked almonds</b></p> <p><b>Fronds from the fennel bulbs</b></p> <p>Trim any blemishes from the fennel bulbs, and cut them into small pieces. Do the same with the onion and celery. Put the stock into a large pot and bring to a boil, then skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Tip the vegetables into the pot, and lower the heat to a simmer. Leave the soup to cook for half-an-hour or so. Lightly colour the almonds in a hot oven, then grind them until broken up, though not fine. Mix with the oil and tip into the soup, along with the cream and lemon juice. Bring to the boil, and season.</p> <p>Eat at once or, best of all, leave to cool, then chill, and serve in chilled bowls.

In spring and summer, it is light and delicate, made pale and dreamy by the early-season vegetables; as the days shorten and autumn approaches, it becomes increasingly robust and strengthening; then, in winter, it takes on another guise again, when great meaty pots of broth and hefty lentil soups are the order of the day, the one-pot dish par excellence. But it's summer soups that appeal to me most, for they are the simplest, most elegant, daintiest - and, best of all, easiest to prepare, requiring but the smallest effort (and even that can be completed without fuss during the cool morning hours). After that, it's just a case of setting the soup in the fridge, be that for chilling it in preparation for eating it cold or for leaving the flavours to mingle before being reheated. Eat them cold, eat them warm: they taste equally splendid. All food is a matter of taste, but soups depend more than most other dishes purely on what takes your fancy. So easy is it to make a good one that I would like to say there is no such thing as a bad soup, but that's not true. Bad soups can only be the product of pure laziness, nothing less, so a sound keelhauling would not be too harsh a punishment for the purveyor of such culinary abuse. Flour and powder - be they flavoured or coloured - are simply not welcome in any soup, and should herewith be banished. A good soup has no need of such embellishments. In terms of shopping, there is possibly no easier dish to provide for, as just about every vegetable at the supermarket or greengrocer's can be put into the pot and come up trumps. As always, buy the best you can afford. Taking care to get the finest ingredients is vital to your chances of ending up with a truly great dish. Then you must pay close attention to the seasoning. And, finally, be clear on whether to use stock or water. (Generally speaking, the lower the quality of the ingredients, the more likely you will need to call on the help of stock, as its stronger flavour will help disguise any failings in your raw materials. However, stock is not vital to every soup - being stockless need not be a deterrent to the cook who is short of time.) As summer progresses and the quality, variety and availability of ingredients improves so, too, I hope, our soups will benefit accordingly. Peas, broad beans, spinach, sorrel, fennel, watercress, leeks, potatoes, tomatoes, courgettes and so on and so forth can be podded, peeled, sliced or chopped, then simmered, before being rendered to a smooth pur\u00e9e (the ideal consistency of such soups is that of pouring cream), ideally by passing them through a very fine sieve (chefs use a chinois or, if serious perfectionists, muslin, to refine their soups). Even the youngest tiny vegetables, simmered in their own cooking liquor and then enlivened with fresh herbs, and possibly a little olive oil, make a pleasing soup that is at once light and filling and has the added bonus of being perfect for hot weather, which ruins the appetite and puts to rest all thoughts of spending hours at the stove. That brings us back to the question of the temperature at which to serve the soup, in which decision you must always observe two rules. First, chilled soup must be just that - thoroughly chilled, with not a hint of warmth about it. And second, hot soup must be thoroughly heated. Apart from that, a hunk or two of good bread, some butter, possibly a bowl of salad to follow, and then a nice piece of cheese, all accompanied by a bottle of the good stuff, goes down a treat - as would a nod to the Big Yin, asking for a hot sun in blue skies. All recipes serve six. Crab soup with chilli and parsley 1 large crab 1 onion 1 carrot 1 leek 3 tomatoes 1 stick celery 2 cloves garlic 1 bayleaf A small sprig thyme 1-2 tbsp olive oil 1.4 litres water 600ml white wine 400ml whipping cream Lemon juice (optional) 1 small handful picked flat-leaf parsley 1 red chilli 4 tbsp olive oil Peel and finely chop the vegetables, garlic and tomato. In a large pot that is big enough later to accommodate the crab and liquid, fry the chopped vegetables in a little olive oil, along with the thyme and bayleaf. Add the crab to the pot, pour over the water and cover the pan with a lid. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes or so. Carefully remove the crab from the stock, and set aside to cool. Leave the stock in the pot. Once the crab has cooled, crack it apart and remove the flesh, both brown meat and white, taking care to leave all trace of shell behind. Pop the shell back into the pot and add the wine. Simmer for 10 minutes, then pour the stock through a sieve. Return the soup to the stove, add the cream and bring to the boil again. Simmer for a further five minutes, adjust the seasoning and pass through a fine sieve again. Leave to cool, then chill the soup in the fridge and stir in the crab meats, adding a squeeze of lemon juice if required. Finely chop the parsley and chilli, and mix with the olive oil. Add a spoonful of this mixture to each bowl when serving. Chickpea and saffron broth 250g dried chickpeas (canned chickpeas do not work very well in this recipe) 4 courgettes 4 plump, ripe tomatoes 2 medium-sized onions, peeled 2 cloves garlic 1 red chilli 1 bayleaf 1 generous pinch best-quality saffron 1 tbsp chopped parsley 1 tbsp chopped coriander Soak the chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water. Fully drain and rinse the chickpeas, and place in a roomy pot on the stove. Bring to a boil, and skim off any foam and particles that rise to the surface. Drop in the chilli and bayleaf. Leave the pan to simmer for two hours - the peas may take longer, depending on their age, so make sure they are fully cooked. Cut the courgette, onions and tomatoes into small pieces. Drop into the pot and return to the boil. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface, and lower to a simmer for half-an-hour or so. Finely chop the garlic and add it to the pot, along with the saffron and seasoning to taste. Cook the soup for a further five minutes, add the chopped herbs and serve forthwith. Needless to say, this soup sits very well for several days - the flavours mellow beautifully, although a little more saffron may be required. Potage cr\u00e8me germiny A truly great soup. 3 large handfuls sorrel 5 large handfuls spinach 12 spring onions 850ml pale chicken stock 4 fresh egg yolks 340ml whipping cream Sea salt and black pepper Prepare the leaves, removing any excess stalk, and yellowing or impaired leaves. Wash thoroughly. Tip the stock into a big pot and bring to the boil. Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add them to the pot. Once the pot is boiling, add the leaves and simmer for two minutes or so, then liquidise at once. Pass the soup through a fine sieve, return it to the pot, and season. If you are making the soup in advance, cool it at once and reheat only at the last minute. To serve, gently warm the soup, and in the meantime mix the yolks and cream in a bowl, adding them to the pot once the soup is good and hot. Remove the soup from the heat immediately - do not be tempted to let it linger over the flame for even a moment - then, stirring all the while, return to the stove above a low flame for the briefest time until it thickens, just. Serve at once. Fennel and almond soup Almonds and fennel have a curious affinity. Though this soup may be served warm, it is very good chilled. 2 litres chicken stock 525g fennel bulbs 1 small onion 1 small stick celery 80g almonds 1 tbsp good-quality olive oil 150ml whipping cream lemon, juiced 1 spoonful flaked almonds Fronds from the fennel bulbs Trim any blemishes from the fennel bulbs, and cut them into small pieces. Do the same with the onion and celery. Put the stock into a large pot and bring to a boil, then skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Tip the vegetables into the pot, and lower the heat to a simmer. Leave the soup to cook for half-an-hour or so. Lightly colour the almonds in a hot oven, then grind them until broken up, though not fine. Mix with the oil and tip into the soup, along with the cream and lemon juice. Bring to the boil, and season. Eat at once or, best of all, leave to cool, then chill, and serve in chilled bowls. Either way, decorate with some slivered almonds and fennel fronds \u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, London SE1.",

But once you have borrowed something, you don't have a leg to stand on, and all that is left to you is a slug-like cringe.</p> <p>\"It's lost its suck,\" complains Maureen. \"And it's been bwilliant up till now.\" Heart sinks. Remember horrid episode from childhood involving neighbour's white mouse, which, while in my care, mysteriously expired. I offer to have vacuum cleaner mended, nay, if necessary to provide her with a new one.</p> <p>\"You idiot!\" hisses Ex-Spouse, once Maureen has minced off, mollified. \"The bloody thing's not our responsibility! It was probably on its last legs, anyway! We can't even afford a new vacuum cleaner for ourselves, never mind one for that silly old tart.\" Bad start to day. Twice humiliated before elevenses.</p> <p>Letter arrives from Harriet's school lamenting her performance in the recent exams. She is under-achieving in all the sciences. Feel a pang of double-edged guilt. Harriet is crap at science, and so was I. Except in O-level biology (genetics), when I calculated the chances of having blue-eyed children should I marry Keith Pike, a boy on the bus. I never managed to speak to Keith, but I certainly admired the back of his neck - a modest prerequisite for courtship.</p> <p>Perhaps if my breeding programme had been a little more energetically pursued, I might be congratulating Harriet on winning prizes instead of drafting apologetic letters to her long-suffering teachers. Wonder if physics labs still smell of rubber and gas. Preferred chemistry because it seemed at least to be in colour. Biology was best: it had tendrils and mandibles and seemed almost, round the back-of-beyond somewhere, to grasp the hand of poetry. Mackerel skies and flying fish. Now we can see how penguins surge and soar when they dive off the waddling obstacle course of land and into the glorious blue.</p> <p>Scarcely have I finished my crawling letter of apology to the school than there is another knock at the door. Am confronted by cross-looking woman encumbered with a baby on her back, a toddler at her side and a brace of dogs on leads. \"Is that your Volvo?\" she demands aggressively. \"It's blocking my drive!\" Feel gilt-edged guilt this time - at having inconvenienced somebody obviously already at the end of her tether.</p> <p>Race out and remove offending vehicle. Drive twice around the block without finding on-street parking place. A builder's truck is parked outside our house. It never occurs to me to complain, however. Everything must be my fault. It's July, and the only bedding plants in our garden were inserted by an arthritic octogenarian. Once you've started to feel guilty about things like that, it's but a short mental leap to the situation in Africa and the hole in the ozone layer.</p> <p>Eventually find a place in public car park at 30p per hour, several minutes' brisk walk from home. Arrive to find aged aunt wringing her hands. \" Och, Dulcie, dearrr! I didn't know wherrre you'd got to! My rrroom is full of dead flies!\"</p> <p>Something snaps. \"I'm sorry, Elspeth!\" I roar. \"I'm sorry I dared to leave the house without obtaining permission! I'm sorry I let those innocent flies die - in fact, it would have been better if they'd never been hatched! I expect that's my fault, too!\" Aunt looks horrified. Run upstairs and dive on to my blue futon, with rather less grace than a penguin. Two minutes later, Ex-Spouse appears: \"What the hell's the matter with you?\" he demands. Pull duvet over my head. Hard to believe that quite recently I lived by myself in a country cottage and was accountable to nobody. \"Tell Elspeth I'm sorry. Got a bad headache.\" Somehow, I have become the penguin who cannot escape from the land. Will I ever dive into the blue again? Make urgent plans to apply for job, preferably overseas.</p> <p>Half an hour later, Alice rings to invite me to spend a few days in London as Saskia has an exhibition on - \"Digital-is.\" Ah! Prepare to dive, porpoise-like, into the metropolis. Once permission has been obtained, of course. In triplicate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'Dulcie? Did you do anything unusual to my vacuum cleaner when you borrowed it?\" Maureen-next-door stands on the threshold, looking aggrieved. \"Anything unusual?\" I falter. Maureen does, after all, run a brothel - allegedly. Surely it is I, not Maureen, who should be hinting at appliance abuse. But once you have borrowed something, you don't have a leg to stand on, and all that is left to you is a slug-like cringe. \"It's lost its suck,\" complains Maureen. \"And it's been bwilliant up till now.\" Heart sinks. Remember horrid episode from childhood involving neighbour's white mouse, which, while in my care, mysteriously expired. I offer to have vacuum cleaner mended, nay, if necessary to provide her with a new one. \"You idiot!\" hisses Ex-Spouse, once Maureen has minced off, mollified. \"The bloody thing's not our responsibility! It was probably on its last legs, anyway! We can't even afford a new vacuum cleaner for ourselves, never mind one for that silly old tart.\" Bad start to day. Twice humiliated before elevenses. Letter arrives from Harriet's school lamenting her performance in the recent exams. She is under-achieving in all the sciences. Feel a pang of double-edged guilt. Harriet is crap at science, and so was I. Except in O-level biology (genetics), when I calculated the chances of having blue-eyed children should I marry Keith Pike, a boy on the bus. I never managed to speak to Keith, but I certainly admired the back of his neck - a modest prerequisite for courtship. Perhaps if my breeding programme had been a little more energetically pursued, I might be congratulating Harriet on winning prizes instead of drafting apologetic letters to her long-suffering teachers. Wonder if physics labs still smell of rubber and gas. Preferred chemistry because it seemed at least to be in colour. Biology was best: it had tendrils and mandibles and seemed almost, round the back-of-beyond somewhere, to grasp the hand of poetry. Mackerel skies and flying fish. Now we can see how penguins surge and soar when they dive off the waddling obstacle course of land and into the glorious blue. Scarcely have I finished my crawling letter of apology to the school than there is another knock at the door. Am confronted by cross-looking woman encumbered with a baby on her back, a toddler at her side and a brace of dogs on leads. \"Is that your Volvo?\" she demands aggressively. \"It's blocking my drive!\" Feel gilt-edged guilt this time - at having inconvenienced somebody obviously already at the end of her tether. Race out and remove offending vehicle. Drive twice around the block without finding on-street parking place. A builder's truck is parked outside our house. It never occurs to me to complain, however. Everything must be my fault. It's July, and the only bedding plants in our garden were inserted by an arthritic octogenarian. Once you've started to feel guilty about things like that, it's but a short mental leap to the situation in Africa and the hole in the ozone layer. Eventually find a place in public car park at 30p per hour, several minutes' brisk walk from home. Arrive to find aged aunt wringing her hands. \" Och, Dulcie, dearrr! I didn't know wherrre you'd got to! My rrroom is full of dead flies!\" Something snaps. \"I'm sorry, Elspeth!\" I roar. \"I'm sorry I dared to leave the house without obtaining permission! I'm sorry I let those innocent flies die - in fact, it would have been better if they'd never been hatched! I expect that's my fault, too!\" Aunt looks horrified. Run upstairs and dive on to my blue futon, with rather less grace than a penguin. Two minutes later, Ex-Spouse appears: \"What the hell's the matter with you?\" he demands. Pull duvet over my head. Hard to believe that quite recently I lived by myself in a country cottage and was accountable to nobody. \"Tell Elspeth I'm sorry. Got a bad headache.\" Somehow, I have become the penguin who cannot escape from the land. Will I ever dive into the blue again? Make urgent plans to apply for job, preferably overseas. Half an hour later, Alice rings to invite me to spend a few days in London as Saskia has an exhibition on - \"Digital-is.\" Ah! Prepare to dive, porpoise-like, into the metropolis. Once permission has been obtained, of course. In triplicate.",

      "body": "<p>When Mel Kenyon stood up to give a little speech at Sarah Kane's memorial, the words wouldn't come. She tried two or three times, before being defeated by her tears. In the end, she asked the crowd of friends and relatives at London's Royal Court to listen to a song for Sarah. Kane had killed herself just a couple of months before, and the raw sore of grief wept through the whole theatre. In a way, You Get What You Give, by the New Radicals, was crazily inappropriate. The song is an impassioned attempt to shake someone out of despair, to prove there is a reason to live. Sarah had done exactly the opposite - she had let go, she had given up. Yet the ecstatic tune - a rebuttal of all that was bleak and cruel and shitty in life, an affirmation of love and purpose against the odds - was somehow perfect.</p> <p>Kane's death at 28 was big news. Just like her first play, Blasted, had been. The obituaries talked about the controversial nature of her work, stretched for their Roget's, and lasciviously listed, as journalists always had done, the shock elements - the fellatio and frottage, the micturition and defecation, the rapes and hangings, the eye-gouging and cannibalism. They also quoted the infamous headline, \"The Disgusting Feast Of Filth\", that accompanied Jack Tinker's review in the Daily Mail. </p> <p>But this time the tone was different. The reports acknowledged the poetry, the tenderness, the classical traditions at play in her work. Many said that the world had lost the great dramatist of the 90s. In death, Kane's work (five plays in all, four of them staged during her lifetime) was finally being contextualised. There was a sudden posthumous consensus - the work wasn't hateful, nor was it about hate; it was about love. The impossibility of pure love. The newspapers even quoted Roland Barthes to help us understand the plays: \"When one is in love one is in Dachau.\"</p> <p>Blasted was first performed in January 1995, at the tiny Royal Court Upstairs theatre. It is set in a fancy hotel bedroom in Leeds. Ian, a middle-aged tabloid hack, seems to be dying and invites a trusting, retarded child-girl to make his last hours happier. She agrees to visit out of love, her desire to comfort him. He rapes her, taunts her, humiliates her. Halfway through the play, an armed soldier breaks into the room, wreaks his sickening destruction and turns the scene into a Bosnian battlefield. </p> <p>Kane was subject to the most bilious of attacks. She was accused of \"abject puerility\", of subjecting an audience to the theatrical equivalent of \"having your whole head held down in a bucket of offal\". Charles Spencer, in the Telegraph, called Blasted a work \"devoid of intellectual and artistic merit\", and later suggested that Kane was mad. Michael Billington, in the Guardian, wrote, \"I was simply left wondering how such naive tosh managed to scrape past the Court's normally judicious play-selection committee.\" Overnight, Blasted had become the Royal Court's biggest controversy since Edward Bond's Saved 30 years earlier, in which a baby was stoned to death. Even more astonishing was the reaction of established dramatists such as Harold Pinter and Bond himself, who rounded on the critics and told them they were out of their depth; Blasted was too new, too complex, too good for them.</p> <p>Kane was notorious, a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. In all, the play was performed in front of barely more than 1,000 people, and there has never been another production in Britain. But, like the first Sex Pistols concert, it has caused a strange form of false-memory syndrome. Many people believe they were there, and confidently tell the stories to prove it. </p> <p>The playwright David Greig shared a flat with Kane at university in Bristol. He had already enjoyed some success in his early 20s, but he certainly hadn't made the news pages. \"I saw her when the reviews were coming out, and said, 'You must be really pleased everyone's talking about you', but she really didn't feel that. Perhaps if it had been me, I would have revelled in it - maybe I'm a shallower person - but she felt devastated by the reviews. She found it really difficult that they were not taking her artistically seriously. In some way, Sarah was very arrogant. She knew Blasted was a very great work, and she found it devastating that that was not recognised.\"</p> <p>Devastated. So many people use that word when talking about Kane. They talk about her love of Manchester United and of clubbing and chatting and laughing, but invariably they return to the word devastated. Some friends and family still don't want to talk about her in public. Eventually, more than a year after her death, some would - including her brother Simon and her agent Mel Kenyon, both of whom feel they owe a very special duty to Kane. Nothing was to be published until the first production of her final play, 4.48 Psychosis, had opened and the reviews had appeared. The danger, Kenyon and Simon Kane stress, is that we use the work to explain the life, regard it as a serialised suicide note. Or, even worse, we use the life to explain the work. Sarah Kane (and Kenyon and Simon, who finally decided to stage the play) could not be more exposed. 4.48 Psychosis was finished just before she died, and is about suicidal depression. If you know anything about her life, it is impossible to de-personalise the play. </p> <p>I meet Simon Kane at the Royal Court, where 4.48 Psychosis is being rehearsed. He blanches at the suggestion that I might watch rehearsals, or read the play. He refuses to explain what the title means, and says he's going to leave it to the director, James Macdonald, who also directed the premieres of Blasted and Cleansed, to tell me about it.</p> <p>Simon is 30, Sarah's older brother and the executor of her estate. Before I have a chance to sit, he lays down the law. \"One of the things Sarah said in her last instructions was 'no biographies'.\" He also makes clear his own distrust of journalists, and explains it away as a family thing. Their parents were both journalists. While their mother gave up work to look after the children, Peter Kane went on to be area manager of the Daily Mirror for East Anglia. He had known how to invade privacy with a smile. \"What she wanted to leave behind was her work. That's all Sarah was interested in people seeing, rather than a fairly uninteresting story of her life. Growing up with a journalist, you pretty soon realise you have to be careful what you say to people . . . Sarah was a very private person.\" </p> <p>Simon Kane looks like his sister. But whereas she was handsome, boyish, he is pretty, girlish. He often blushes. He talks about how they grew up in Essex, how both of them were good pupils, keen learners. There was only a year between them, and in the early days they were competitive in a friendly way. After A-levels, Simon went off to study maths; a year later, Sarah began her drama degree. He says it would be easy to polarise the two, the artist and the scientist, but it would be wrong. </p> <p>As children, they used to talk a lot, about love, about their hopes, about God. Especially about God. Throughout their early teens, God dominated the household. The four of them went along to an evangelical church every Sunday. In the few interviews Sarah gave, she described it as \"the full spirit-filled, born-again lunacy\", and railed against the naivety of her religious years.</p> <p>Simon winces, and says the news reports gave the wrong impression. \"At the time of her death, it came across in the papers as if Mum and Dad had forced this mad, cultish religion on us. It really wasn't like that. Of all of us, I'd say Sarah was the most fervent.\" He says their Christianity was one of compassion, love thy neighbour as thyself, rather than vengeance is mine. \"If people had problems, Sarah would always listen and do whatever she could to help them out. I was aware of it as a child because I wasn't so much like that. I got to a point where I'd say, 'I'm sorry, I just can't deal with this,' and I don't remember Sarah ever doing that.\"</p> <p>He says the religion was normal, just part of growing up, then seems to change his mind mid-sentence. \"We went along to this church, and there were some peculiar people there. They did become quite extreme. They started reading the Bible very literally, and when you do that you're going to end up with some bizarre opinions. There are bits in the Bible that are atrocious - you know, like the treatment of female prisoners of war in Deuteronomy . . . 'If you want to take the woman rip her fingernails out and shave all her hair off'.\" He looks appalled. </p> <p>Sarah became an atheist, her writing fired by the cruelties carried out in the name of God. \"God, the bastard,\" was one of her favourite Beckett quotes. \"I think she looked at the world around her, and thought it was unsustainable to think there is an all-powerful, all-caring God who made the world as it is,\" says Simon. By the time she was studying for A-levels, she was also busy directing Chekhov and Shakespeare at school. </p> <p>Vince O'Connell, who went on to direct Kane's short film Skin, met her when she was 17 and acting in his play at a local drama group in Basildon. \"She was very obviously exceptional,\" he says. A few months later, she was bunking off school, working as an assistant director in a production at Soho Poly. \"She knew theatre, understood how it worked. It was instinctive. She had the ability to create a crackle in a room. She had that same ability as a person. Funny, empathetic, huge-hearted. She was gifted at living, more than anyone I've known. She had a massive appetite for life . . .\" He lurches to a stop. \"I know it's a paradox.\"</p> <p>O'Connell tells me a story about Skin that somehow sums up Kane. The film is about a black woman who kidnaps a leery racist abuser and beats him into an adoring, submissive love. Ewan Bremner played the man, Marcia Rose the woman. The two had never met each other before Skin. They fell in love while making the film, and now have a child together. </p> <p>Sarah Kane went to university wanting to be an actress. She then realised that actors were powerless, so she decided to direct. She then realised that there was hardly anything she wanted to direct, so she began to write. It's funny, says Simon, in some ways she was so unambitious, in others she knew exactly what she wanted and how to get it. \"She was very determined and uncompromising. </p> <p>She only ever produced work she was completely happy with.\"</p> <p>Everyone who knew Sarah Kane has an anecdote. The world is full of Sarah Kane anecdotes. She was such a wild child, she savaged the drink, said what she wanted to, did what she wanted to. The strange thing is that all the stories ultimately boil down to one incident, when she was accused of writing pornography and threw a pile of porn mags at the feet of her tutor and told him that if he wanted to wank he should do it to these instead. Everyone tells the story a little differently. In some versions, she accuses the tutor of writing porn, in others he accuses her, and in some they both accuse each other. \"It makes her sound very aggressive,\" says David Greig. \"But it was done very sardonically, actually. Sarah was really very gentle. Really, really gentle. Very kind. You hear a story and conjure up a picture, but the reality of the way she'd be when you met her was so huge. The aggression wasn't an act, but there was a degree of playfulness about it.\"</p> <p>Both Sarah and Greig were influenced by Howard Barker's modern Jacobean dramas - the extreme violence, the muscular language, the poetry, and dark black humour. At Bristol, they acted in the same production of Barker's Victory. Like Kane, Barker celebrated the perversity of love, embraced the terrible entwining of violence and tenderness. Greig says there is a quote in Barker's play, a definition of love, that best explains the ambiguities of Sarah's work. \"I would crawl across four miles of broken glass just to take a piss in her bathwater.\" Obsession, sacrifice, love, pain, humiliation, loathing, all in the one act. Greig says they used to joke about how the names of their favourite writers all began with B - Bond, Beckett, Brecht, Berkoff, Barker. \"All of them people who don't set their plays in the front room, who don't like kitchen sinks. And if they do have a kitchen sink, it will be filled with blood.\"</p> <p>At Bristol, Kane stood out as an actor and director. Not yet as a writer. Her first substantial written work, a series of three monologues under the umbrella title Sick, was performed in Edinburgh. One was about rape, one about a woman questioning her sexual identity, and another about eating disorders. They were all performed in the first person, confrontational, and felt as if you were listening to first-hand experience. Greig, who performed his own monologue in the same pub that year, says, \"It was very, very raw. It unsettled the audience. It didn't come across as particularly crafted.\" Greig thinks that this blurring of boundaries was intentional, a means of unsettling audiences, and that we should be wary of reading too much into the tantalising clues in her work. Kane later withdrew the monologues - disowned them, in effect - because she thought audiences regarded them as confessional.</p> <p>Greig and Kane were part of an intimate circle of gothic miserablists. Student clich\u00e9s, really, says Greig, laughing. They listened to Joy Division, dressed in black, raged against the slaughter in the Balkans. \"We both shared a slightly depressive outlook, a whole group of us, who shared an enjoyment of the darker things - a post-adolescent dwelling on the question of life, if you like.\" Kane never lost her love for Joy Division, nor her fiery despair about the civil war in former Yugoslavia, but Greig believes the depression of later years was very different from the earlier angst. </p> <p>There were many Sarahs, he says, with many different types of friends. She hated labels, especially those that defined her by gender or sexuality. Greig reminds me of an article she wrote for this paper, in which she discussed the 10 best shows she'd seen. Number two was a visit to a live sex show featuring a witch sucking the Grim Reaper's cock in Amsterdam: \"Perhaps the power of that sex show in Amsterdam was more to do with the grass I was smoking than the stark images thrown together as an excuse to watch people fuck,\" she wrote. Old Trafford was her favourite theatre.</p> <p>The director James Macdonald, who is now putting the finishing touches to 4.48 Psychosis, finally returns my call. He's apologetic, embarrassed. \"I just feel talked out about Sarah. I feel rather boring on the subject.\" He's not very good at dissembling, and within seconds the truth is out: \"I suppose I'm wary of her death creating the possibility of people looking at her work in the wrong way.\" He compares her to Sylvia Plath, and says just look at the way that her life is always refracted through the prism of her suicide. Not surprisingly, Macdonald feels vulnerable. If people use the play publicly to dissect her death, he may feel he has left her as exposed in death as in life. \"I wasn't sure I wanted to direct the play - she'd died so recently - but I thought it was an extraordinary piece of work.\" He says there is no truth to the stories circulating that he had received the play as an unfinished draft. </p> <p>\"I want people to see the play without thinking of her life.\" Is that possible? \"I want to allow for that possibility.\"</p> <p>Kane graduated with a first from Bristol and went straight on to David Edgar's playwriting MA at Birmingham University. Vince O'Connell says she hated the course, felt stymied by it. Her ideas were being squashed. She considered giving up, and completed the course only to please her mother - the enfant terrible of British theatre didn't like upsetting her family. She started Blasted, but kept it hidden from her tutors until it was well under way.</p> <p>Mel Kenyon went up to Birmingham to see the students' end-of-year show. She sat through seven hours of mediocrity before the embryo of Blasted was performed. \"It was quite brilliant,\" she says. \"I was awe-struck.\" She says only a woman could have written a play that understood violence so profoundly, from the perspectives of both victim and perpetrator, without glamorising it. Kenyon couldn't get the play out of her head, and she wrote to Kane asking if she could read the whole thing when it was completed. </p> <p>Sarah eventually went to see Kenyon in London. The two of them spent the meeting staring into the carpet. Kenyon told her that getting an agent is like getting married: you have to be sure. Sarah chose her anyway, though she had offers from other agents. Blasted almost missed its slot in the Royal Court season. Other plays had mounted up, were given priority, and it was put back to January 1995. \"In hindsight, that may or may not have been very clever,\" says Kenyon. \"January is a dull news period usually, and I always had a feeling . . . I'd said to Sarah that it may open and the shit could really hit the fan. I knew it would, but not in the way it happened. I thought some people would think it was fabulous, some would think it was awful, but I didn't think there'd be personal attacks. I thought everybody would recognise the quality of the writing. I didn't realise the level of stupidity and vindictiveness that would accompany the critique. In the end, they criticised nothing but the event.\"</p> <p>Kane's friends believe the outrage was feigned. \"There had been a show called Penetrator the previous year by Anthony Neilson, and that contained just as much sex and violence as Blasted,\" says David Greig. \"But the point is that Blasted was written by a woman, a young woman at that, and its central portrayal was of a middle-aged male journalist in all his weaknesses. People didn't review it seriously. They treated it like a game, as if they were doing her a favour by treating it this way.\"</p> <p>The Guardian's Michael Billington knows that he is one of the critics that most upset Kane. She wrote to him and told him so. Well before she died, Billington had recanted; what he once called puerile tosh, he had come to realise was a work of \"moral seriousness\". Today, Billington speaks with regret of his ebullient hatchet job: \"There was a man in front of me who stomped out, shouting that we've got to bring back the censor. There was a hysteria about the first night, and it was difficult to judge the play coolly and calmly. So I got it wrong, as I keep saying. She was a major talent. Apparently, Harold Pinter said at her memorial service that she was a poet, and I think that's dead right.\" </p> <p>Billington shows me the letter Kane sent him. It's classic Kane - eloquent, aggressive and touching, never more so than when she asks him not to repeat the idea that she is a creation of David Edgar's. \"I was not 'taught' by him, nor 'discovered' by him. I'm not sure where you got this idea - perhaps from David himself - but by repeating it you are making it more and more likely that David and I are going to get into a public row about his course. While I don't expect you to consider how this would make me feel, perhaps it might matter to you that it would upset David. Not nearly as much as it upset my mother when you said her daughter was depraved on national television, but it would upset him. And I'd rather that was avoided.\" </p> <p>He wrote back to her, saying he had misjudged Blasted. Billington wishes now that they had met. \"I just regret we never had a chance for a rapprochement, or for me to say to her face what I'd said in the letter. 'I got your play wrong.' \" </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/01/stage1\">Read the second part of 'A sad hurrah' here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Mel Kenyon stood up to give a little speech at Sarah Kane's memorial, the words wouldn't come. She tried two or three times, before being defeated by her tears. In the end, she asked the crowd of friends and relatives at London's Royal Court to listen to a song for Sarah. Kane had killed herself just a couple of months before, and the raw sore of grief wept through the whole theatre. In a way, You Get What You Give, by the New Radicals, was crazily inappropriate. The song is an impassioned attempt to shake someone out of despair, to prove there is a reason to live. Sarah had done exactly the opposite - she had let go, she had given up. Yet the ecstatic tune - a rebuttal of all that was bleak and cruel and shitty in life, an affirmation of love and purpose against the odds - was somehow perfect. Kane's death at 28 was big news. Just like her first play, Blasted, had been. The obituaries talked about the controversial nature of her work, stretched for their Roget's, and lasciviously listed, as journalists always had done, the shock elements - the fellatio and frottage, the micturition and defecation, the rapes and hangings, the eye-gouging and cannibalism. They also quoted the infamous headline, \"The Disgusting Feast Of Filth\", that accompanied Jack Tinker's review in the Daily Mail. But this time the tone was different. The reports acknowledged the poetry, the tenderness, the classical traditions at play in her work. Many said that the world had lost the great dramatist of the 90s. In death, Kane's work (five plays in all, four of them staged during her lifetime) was finally being contextualised. There was a sudden posthumous consensus - the work wasn't hateful, nor was it about hate; it was about love. The impossibility of pure love. The newspapers even quoted Roland Barthes to help us understand the plays: \"When one is in love one is in Dachau.\" Blasted was first performed in January 1995, at the tiny Royal Court Upstairs theatre. It is set in a fancy hotel bedroom in Leeds. Ian, a middle-aged tabloid hack, seems to be dying and invites a trusting, retarded child-girl to make his last hours happier. She agrees to visit out of love, her desire to comfort him. He rapes her, taunts her, humiliates her. Halfway through the play, an armed soldier breaks into the room, wreaks his sickening destruction and turns the scene into a Bosnian battlefield. Kane was subject to the most bilious of attacks. She was accused of \"abject puerility\", of subjecting an audience to the theatrical equivalent of \"having your whole head held down in a bucket of offal\". Charles Spencer, in the Telegraph, called Blasted a work \"devoid of intellectual and artistic merit\", and later suggested that Kane was mad. Michael Billington, in the Guardian, wrote, \"I was simply left wondering how such naive tosh managed to scrape past the Court's normally judicious play-selection committee.\" Overnight, Blasted had become the Royal Court's biggest controversy since Edward Bond's Saved 30 years earlier, in which a baby was stoned to death. Even more astonishing was the reaction of established dramatists such as Harold Pinter and Bond himself, who rounded on the critics and told them they were out of their depth; Blasted was too new, too complex, too good for them. Kane was notorious, a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. In all, the play was performed in front of barely more than 1,000 people, and there has never been another production in Britain. But, like the first Sex Pistols concert, it has caused a strange form of false-memory syndrome. Many people believe they were there, and confidently tell the stories to prove it. The playwright David Greig shared a flat with Kane at university in Bristol. He had already enjoyed some success in his early 20s, but he certainly hadn't made the news pages. \"I saw her when the reviews were coming out, and said, 'You must be really pleased everyone's talking about you', but she really didn't feel that. Perhaps if it had been me, I would have revelled in it - maybe I'm a shallower person - but she felt devastated by the reviews. She found it really difficult that they were not taking her artistically seriously. In some way, Sarah was very arrogant. She knew Blasted was a very great work, and she found it devastating that that was not recognised.\" Devastated. So many people use that word when talking about Kane. They talk about her love of Manchester United and of clubbing and chatting and laughing, but invariably they return to the word devastated. Some friends and family still don't want to talk about her in public. Eventually, more than a year after her death, some would - including her brother Simon and her agent Mel Kenyon, both of whom feel they owe a very special duty to Kane. Nothing was to be published until the first production of her final play, 4.48 Psychosis, had opened and the reviews had appeared. The danger, Kenyon and Simon Kane stress, is that we use the work to explain the life, regard it as a serialised suicide note. Or, even worse, we use the life to explain the work. Sarah Kane (and Kenyon and Simon, who finally decided to stage the play) could not be more exposed. 4.48 Psychosis was finished just before she died, and is about suicidal depression. If you know anything about her life, it is impossible to de-personalise the play. I meet Simon Kane at the Royal Court, where 4.48 Psychosis is being rehearsed. He blanches at the suggestion that I might watch rehearsals, or read the play. He refuses to explain what the title means, and says he's going to leave it to the director, James Macdonald, who also directed the premieres of Blasted and Cleansed, to tell me about it. Simon is 30, Sarah's older brother and the executor of her estate. Before I have a chance to sit, he lays down the law. \"One of the things Sarah said in her last instructions was 'no biographies'.\" He also makes clear his own distrust of journalists, and explains it away as a family thing. Their parents were both journalists. While their mother gave up work to look after the children, Peter Kane went on to be area manager of the Daily Mirror for East Anglia. He had known how to invade privacy with a smile. \"What she wanted to leave behind was her work. That's all Sarah was interested in people seeing, rather than a fairly uninteresting story of her life. Growing up with a journalist, you pretty soon realise you have to be careful what you say to people . . . Sarah was a very private person.\" Simon Kane looks like his sister. But whereas she was handsome, boyish, he is pretty, girlish. He often blushes. He talks about how they grew up in Essex, how both of them were good pupils, keen learners. There was only a year between them, and in the early days they were competitive in a friendly way. After A-levels, Simon went off to study maths; a year later, Sarah began her drama degree. He says it would be easy to polarise the two, the artist and the scientist, but it would be wrong. As children, they used to talk a lot, about love, about their hopes, about God. Especially about God. Throughout their early teens, God dominated the household. The four of them went along to an evangelical church every Sunday. In the few interviews Sarah gave, she described it as \"the full spirit-filled, born-again lunacy\", and railed against the naivety of her religious years. Simon winces, and says the news reports gave the wrong impression. \"At the time of her death, it came across in the papers as if Mum and Dad had forced this mad, cultish religion on us. It really wasn't like that. Of all of us, I'd say Sarah was the most fervent.\" He says their Christianity was one of compassion, love thy neighbour as thyself, rather than vengeance is mine. \"If people had problems, Sarah would always listen and do whatever she could to help them out. I was aware of it as a child because I wasn't so much like that. I got to a point where I'd say, 'I'm sorry, I just can't deal with this,' and I don't remember Sarah ever doing that.\" He says the religion was normal, just part of growing up, then seems to change his mind mid-sentence. \"We went along to this church, and there were some peculiar people there. They did become quite extreme. They started reading the Bible very literally, and when you do that you're going to end up with some bizarre opinions. There are bits in the Bible that are atrocious - you know, like the treatment of female prisoners of war in Deuteronomy . . . 'If you want to take the woman rip her fingernails out and shave all her hair off'.\" He looks appalled. Sarah became an atheist, her writing fired by the cruelties carried out in the name of God. \"God, the bastard,\" was one of her favourite Beckett quotes. \"I think she looked at the world around her, and thought it was unsustainable to think there is an all-powerful, all-caring God who made the world as it is,\" says Simon. By the time she was studying for A-levels, she was also busy directing Chekhov and Shakespeare at school. Vince O'Connell, who went on to direct Kane's short film Skin, met her when she was 17 and acting in his play at a local drama group in Basildon. \"She was very obviously exceptional,\" he says. A few months later, she was bunking off school, working as an assistant director in a production at Soho Poly. \"She knew theatre, understood how it worked. It was instinctive. She had the ability to create a crackle in a room. She had that same ability as a person. Funny, empathetic, huge-hearted. She was gifted at living, more than anyone I've known. She had a massive appetite for life . . .\" He lurches to a stop. \"I know it's a paradox.\" O'Connell tells me a story about Skin that somehow sums up Kane. The film is about a black woman who kidnaps a leery racist abuser and beats him into an adoring, submissive love. Ewan Bremner played the man, Marcia Rose the woman. The two had never met each other before Skin. They fell in love while making the film, and now have a child together. Sarah Kane went to university wanting to be an actress. She then realised that actors were powerless, so she decided to direct. She then realised that there was hardly anything she wanted to direct, so she began to write. It's funny, says Simon, in some ways she was so unambitious, in others she knew exactly what she wanted and how to get it. \"She was very determined and uncompromising. She only ever produced work she was completely happy with.\" Everyone who knew Sarah Kane has an anecdote. The world is full of Sarah Kane anecdotes. She was such a wild child, she savaged the drink, said what she wanted to, did what she wanted to. The strange thing is that all the stories ultimately boil down to one incident, when she was accused of writing pornography and threw a pile of porn mags at the feet of her tutor and told him that if he wanted to wank he should do it to these instead. Everyone tells the story a little differently. In some versions, she accuses the tutor of writing porn, in others he accuses her, and in some they both accuse each other. \"It makes her sound very aggressive,\" says David Greig. \"But it was done very sardonically, actually. Sarah was really very gentle. Really, really gentle. Very kind. You hear a story and conjure up a picture, but the reality of the way she'd be when you met her was so huge. The aggression wasn't an act, but there was a degree of playfulness about it.\" Both Sarah and Greig were influenced by Howard Barker's modern Jacobean dramas - the extreme violence, the muscular language, the poetry, and dark black humour. At Bristol, they acted in the same production of Barker's Victory. Like Kane, Barker celebrated the perversity of love, embraced the terrible entwining of violence and tenderness. Greig says there is a quote in Barker's play, a definition of love, that best explains the ambiguities of Sarah's work. \"I would crawl across four miles of broken glass just to take a piss in her bathwater.\" Obsession, sacrifice, love, pain, humiliation, loathing, all in the one act. Greig says they used to joke about how the names of their favourite writers all began with B - Bond, Beckett, Brecht, Berkoff, Barker. \"All of them people who don't set their plays in the front room, who don't like kitchen sinks. And if they do have a kitchen sink, it will be filled with blood.\" At Bristol, Kane stood out as an actor and director. Not yet as a writer. Her first substantial written work, a series of three monologues under the umbrella title Sick, was performed in Edinburgh. One was about rape, one about a woman questioning her sexual identity, and another about eating disorders. They were all performed in the first person, confrontational, and felt as if you were listening to first-hand experience. Greig, who performed his own monologue in the same pub that year, says, \"It was very, very raw. It unsettled the audience.

Kane later withdrew the monologues - disowned them, in effect - because she thought audiences regarded them as confessional. Greig and Kane were part of an intimate circle of gothic miserablists. Student clich\u00e9s, really, says Greig, laughing. They listened to Joy Division, dressed in black, raged against the slaughter in the Balkans. \"We both shared a slightly depressive outlook, a whole group of us, who shared an enjoyment of the darker things - a post-adolescent dwelling on the question of life, if you like.\" Kane never lost her love for Joy Division, nor her fiery despair about the civil war in former Yugoslavia, but Greig believes the depression of later years was very different from the earlier angst. There were many Sarahs, he says, with many different types of friends. She hated labels, especially those that defined her by gender or sexuality. Greig reminds me of an article she wrote for this paper, in which she discussed the 10 best shows she'd seen. Number two was a visit to a live sex show featuring a witch sucking the Grim Reaper's cock in Amsterdam: \"Perhaps the power of that sex show in Amsterdam was more to do with the grass I was smoking than the stark images thrown together as an excuse to watch people fuck,\" she wrote. Old Trafford was her favourite theatre. The director James Macdonald, who is now putting the finishing touches to 4.48 Psychosis, finally returns my call. He's apologetic, embarrassed. \"I just feel talked out about Sarah. I feel rather boring on the subject.\" He's not very good at dissembling, and within seconds the truth is out: \"I suppose I'm wary of her death creating the possibility of people looking at her work in the wrong way.\" He compares her to Sylvia Plath, and says just look at the way that her life is always refracted through the prism of her suicide.

Richard is a management consultant, \"by no means extravagantly rich\" and, Iyer insists fondly, \"one of the least ambitious and acquisitive people I know\". He is generous and contentedly married; self-aware and considerate. And, within a few paragraphs, he is almost impossible to bear. </p> <p>Richard's whole being has been colonised by work and travel. His flat is a suitcase depot. There are computer disks in the guest room, incoming faxes all night, conversations about nothing but air miles. His apartment block is really a kind of hotel: serviced by maids, silent with jet lag, \"do not disturb\" warnings sulking red-eyed in doorways. Most of the time Richard is not there at all, but somewhere in the air or in Asia or Europe or America, juggling his projects and plane tickets and fistfuls of telephone calling cards. </p> <p>Yet this strange, accelerated existence prompts few reflections on his part. Instead he talks like a robot: \"I really don't need to exist in real time or real place at all,\" he tells Iyer. \"When I'm sitting right here, and [my wife] Sharon's over there... I leave a message for her by calling her voicemail in Boston.\" The author asks him why. \"She can listen to the message repeatedly, and take down a lot of concrete information.\"</p> <p>Richard is what Iyer calls \"a global soul\": a modern-day nomad in the service of the international economy, no longer loyal to any place or culture. And all of us, Iyer claims, are living a little like that these days. Travel and technology have burst our horizons. We eat Thai and email America and feel less and less attached to a single identity. This can be stimulating, liberating - the first few chapters dazzle with anecdotes from abroad and lists of foreign delicacies - but what is it doing to our psyches? Does near-infinite choice lead to enrichment or exhaustion?

      "bodyText": "The Global Soul: Jet Lag, Shopping Malls and the Search for Home Pico Iyer Bloomsbury, \u00a315.99, 303pp Buy it at BOL Early in this appropriately restless book, before it finally settles into an argument of some originality about the way many people live today, the author visits an old schoolfriend in Hong Kong. Richard is a management consultant, \"by no means extravagantly rich\" and, Iyer insists fondly, \"one of the least ambitious and acquisitive people I know\". He is generous and contentedly married; self-aware and considerate. And, within a few paragraphs, he is almost impossible to bear. Richard's whole being has been colonised by work and travel. His flat is a suitcase depot. There are computer disks in the guest room, incoming faxes all night, conversations about nothing but air miles. His apartment block is really a kind of hotel: serviced by maids, silent with jet lag, \"do not disturb\" warnings sulking red-eyed in doorways. Most of the time Richard is not there at all, but somewhere in the air or in Asia or Europe or America, juggling his projects and plane tickets and fistfuls of telephone calling cards. Yet this strange, accelerated existence prompts few reflections on his part. Instead he talks like a robot: \"I really don't need to exist in real time or real place at all,\" he tells Iyer. \"When I'm sitting right here, and [my wife] Sharon's over there... I leave a message for her by calling her voicemail in Boston.\" The author asks him why. \"She can listen to the message repeatedly, and take down a lot of concrete information.\" Richard is what Iyer calls \"a global soul\": a modern-day nomad in the service of the international economy, no longer loyal to any place or culture. And all of us, Iyer claims, are living a little like that these days. Travel and technology have burst our horizons. We eat Thai and email America and feel less and less attached to a single identity. This can be stimulating, liberating - the first few chapters dazzle with anecdotes from abroad and lists of foreign delicacies - but what is it doing to our psyches? Does near-infinite choice lead to enrichment or exhaustion? And is the global soul, attractive or otherwise, an entirely new sort of person? Before we meet Richard, Iyer has already presented himself as an example. He is a journalist for middle-brow magazines, but also a serious writer. He is Indian, but was born in Britain. He moved to urban America as an adult, but now lives in rural Japan.

      "standfirst": "Sarah Kane's first play, Blasted, provoked outrage, but in the years before her suicide in  1999 she came to be recognised as an agonised, brilliantly poetic voice. All who knew  her are adamant that her work and life should not be confused, yet the parallels are hard to avoid",
      "trailText": "<p>Harold Pinter was at the Royal Court the night after the first reviews came out. He says that he had never heard a voice like Kane's, that she hardly knew where it was coming from herself. \"It was a very startling and tender voice, but she was appalled by the world in which she lived and the world within herself.\" Many of the critics \"were way out of their league\", says Pinter. \"Oddly enough, the night I went she happened to be there. She was extremely upset. I was able to tell her, for what it was worth, that it was terrific. She then dropped me a line, and we met up. It just seemed, when I met her that night, that she needed a friend. I'm sure she had plenty of friends, young friends, but I thought she might need an older friend. And I benefited from our friendship very much.\" A Pinteresque pause follows. \"I just found her very, very . . . I liked her very much.\" Whereas closer friends are reluctant to talk about her life and simply direct me towards the text, Pinter says the two are inseparable. \"Some playwrights take on a different personality, and you say, 'How can that fellow have written that?' But she was her work. It was one thing. And, as such, it could be extremely uncomfortable. One play of hers, Phaedra's Love, just frightened the shit out of me. I told her, and we used to laugh about it. She said, 'There's some things you just can't take, Harold,' and I'd say you're dead right.\" Why did it terrify him? \"Well, the violence was, what's the word? It jumped right out of the page. The page itself was violent. The act of turning the page was violent. She was so naked, and her work was evidently so naked. She had no protective skins at all. </p>",

The page itself was violent. The act of turning the page was violent. She was so naked, and her work was evidently so naked. She had no protective skins at all. </p> <p>\"What frightened me was the depth of her horror and anguish. Everyone's aware, to varying degrees, of the cruelty of mankind, but we manage to compromise with it, put it on the shelf and not think about it for a good part of the day. But I don't think she could do that. I think she had a vision of the world that was extremely accurate, and therefore horrific. Because the world is a fucking awful place. It's a very beautiful place, but this species mankind is an absolute bloody disaster. The elements of sadism are astonishing. She wasn't simply observing mankind; she was part of it. It seems to me she was talking about the violence within herself, the hatred within herself, and the depths of misery that she also suffered.\"</p> <p>Like Greig, Pinter jollies himself out of his misery. \"Anyway, I would like to tell you she was a girl of tremendous spirit. Despite everything I've said, she was a lot of fun.\" What made her happy? \"I think she seemed to be in love most of the time. When her love life was going well, she was happy.\" But it rarely did go well. \"As far as I could glean, she had a very unhappy love life. About a year before her death, she came here and a relationship with a woman had just finished. She was very distressed about it - who wouldn't be? - but again the depth of her suffering was her own, very singular. Her antennae were very sharp for every bloody thing, including love.\" </p> <p>It's tempting to apply a conventional narrative to Kane's life. The playwright Edward Bond already has done, arguing that the theatre and its critics killed her: a depressed girl wrote a wonderful play that was slated and everything went downhill from there. But it didn't. Kane wrote four more plays in a four-year period.</p> <p>Cleansed was about love, death and drug addiction in a concentration camp. Again, it was fuelled by her revulsion of Serb atrocities. Again, it was minimalist and elliptical. Kane was a political writer, but she never thought plays should tell you how to vote. During the run of Cleansed, the actress Suzan Sylvester pulled her back. Kane had always said she would never ask an actress to do something that she wouldn't do herself, so she learned a dance routine within an hour, and then prepared to whip off her clothes and teeter on to the stage in stilettos. She was terrified - she'd never worn stilettos before. As with Blasted, the critics suggested the violence in Cleansed was gratuitous and exaggerated. In fact, every violent incident in her plays was closely fashioned on real incidents. (The sucking out of an eye in Blasted, for example, comes from Bill Buford's account of football thugs' retribution against a policeman who had infiltrated their gang; the pole inserted up the arse and released through the shoulder was a Serb method of crucifixion; while the prisoner in Cleansed who learns how to count, discovers how much time he has left to serve and then hangs himself, is based on a man who was jailed on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela.) </p> <p>Crave was widely reviewed as Kane's best, most mature piece of writing. In this play, she dispensed with plot - four nameless voices, different characters or warring factions of one person's consciousness, sit around and discuss love, desire, abuse and the ultimate desire: death. Kane wrote Crave under a pseudonym for the theatre company Paines Plough, where she was working as writer-in-residence. The director, Vicky Featherstone, says it all started as bit of a joke: \"We used to do a workshop, in which new plays would be read. And one of the writers dropped out with three days to go. I said to Sarah, 'Why don't you write one?' I knew it takes her years to write anything. The thing about Sarah is that she hated letting people down, so she'd agree to things and regret it later.\"</p> <p>Kane disappeared. Every time Featherstone rang her house, the answerphone was on. \"I thought, Christ what have I done. Then, three days later, she turned up and said, 'I hate you for having made me do this.' She stood in the corridor, jiggling her leg, having a fag, and made me read it while she waited. It was just the most simple, perfect piece of writing.\" Kane then spent another year-and-a-half completing Crave.</p> <p>Why did she write it under the pseudonym, Marie Kelvedon? \"In one way, she thought it was funny. Marie was her middle name, Kelvedon was a town near where she was born. But, in another way, it was deadly serious. She had spent a lot of time shaking off the negative effects of Blasted. She really wanted to write something that could be judged for what it was, rather than for the fact that it had been written by Sarah Kane.\" The beginnings of Crave were read out, in front of Sarah, to the workshop, and the writers decided Marie Kelvedon was a great talent. </p> <p>Featherstone tells me how much she misses her friend - the pub talk, the pontificating, the raging sense of injustice. \"She was like a child with a massive brain, the biggest theatre brain I've ever known. I've never seen someone with their eyes so open to the world, as if seeing it for the first time. And yet she was very cynical in some ways.\" Like so many people who were close to Kane, Featherstone uses the word \"paradox\". The paradoxes of Crave - the barren mother, the caring abuser - and the paradoxes within Kane herself. Kane's work may have seemed anarchic, she herself may have seemed anarchic, but she had an amazing grasp of the mechanics and the history of theatre. </p> <p>Kane spent much of the last four years of her life travelling through Europe, doing workshops with students by day and writing by night. While Britain remained at best ambivalent to her, she became a huge star in France and especially in Germany. \"They saw her as something new and uncompromising,\" says her German translator, Nils Tabert. He says the students always had an image in their head of how Sarah would look and act. \"But she didn't turn up tattooed and pierced like people expected. Instead, here was a very young, very frail, very charming woman.\"</p> <p>Tabert says Kane was one of the best-read people he's met. \"She knew everything.\" They would spend hours searching out, and deleting, a single word. \"Forever, she was cutting away the superfluous words. The plays are so precise and, as a translator, that's a huge challenge.\" They also represent a huge challenge in that (as with Artaud's theatre of cruelty) the odd stage instruction is unperformable. \"When someone falls from the roof to the floor, you can't do it. Artaud once said this nice thing, that his plays require acting without a safety net, and Sarah's plays require that, too. Emotionally.\" But the difference is, says Tabert, Kane didn't want her instructions taken literally. She was surprisingly prudish about her work. She didn't want the audience to see blow jobs and mutilation; she regarded them as images. \"She thought the production of Blasted in Berlin was cynical. She found it offensive, cool and stylised, like Tarantino, whom she detested. They took the play very literally, there was a lot of nudity. It was true to the text, but it lacked the metaphorical quality, the poetry, and that's what she hated.\" </p> <p>Depression tends to be cyclical. For Kane, it was always there, sometimes simmering, sometimes raging. After writing Crave, she went into a vicious depression and admitted herself to the Maudsley Hospital in south London. She took anti-depressants, reluctantly. \"She hated them,\" says her agent, Mel Kenyon. \"She just told me she didn't like taking pills because they numbed her response to the world, which is, of course, what they're supposed to do. But as an artist, it's extraordinarily difficult if your responsive level is made less intense. What do you do? Take pills and take away the despair? But despair also engenders knowledge in some way, and that knowledge fuels your understanding of the world and therefore your writing, but at the same time you want to exorcise the despair. She tried to weigh it up all the time.\" </p> <p>Did Kenyon worry that Kane's writing might harm her? \"The only thing I ever wondered about was whether the connection made with the outer world was becoming less and less, and therefore she was having to dig deeper and deeper to create. There were times when I wanted her to embrace doing an adaptation or something, just so that she'd relieve herself of the need to go further inside.\"</p> <p>Did they talk about it? \"Yeah, we did, but I wasn't worried. I didn't think she was endangering her psyche, I just thought it may . . . I didn't want her world to shrink. Maybe I was dumb. I wanted to say you can use other things if you need a break from doing intense, personal statements.\" </p> <p>Kane came out of the Maudsley to triumph with Crave. Critics called it a dramatic poem, and compared it to TS Eliot's The Wasteland. Mel Kenyon says, \"It's not a mistake that the last play but one was called Crave - that's actually what it is. She had this incredible yearning, this desire.\" The language is so fragile, so spare, so beautiful, so romantic, that many reviewers suggested it showed a new optimism. This made Kane laugh. </p> <p>The only hope in this play, she said, lies in the possibility of death. She believed that Cleansed, possibly the most savage of her plays, was her most optimistic - every time the two boy lovers have another limb chopped off, they keep going, convinced that they can overcome if they love enough.</p> <p>Many friends say they remember her at her happiest when Crave was being premiered in Edinburgh. It was a huge success, she felt she was coming out of the depression, and she was surrounded by friends. \"It was just like the old Saz,\" says Vince O'Connell. \"She made such an effort to get back to herself, and for a time it worked.\" But she hadn't beaten the depression. </p> <p>The Actors Touring Company asked Kane to write a play based on Goethe's The Sorrows Of Young Werther. Werther was a fictional hero who killed himself for love. He became the ultimate romantic icon, and after Goethe published the story a spate of copycat suicides followed. Kane said that she was already working on 4.48 Psychosis, - and that there were parallels. The title refers to the time of morning when the urge to kill oneself is at its highest. In January 1999, a few months after the triumph of Crave and just after completing 4.48 Psychosis, she took 150 anti-depressants and 50 sleeping pills. Her flatmate discovered her unconscious at their Brixton flat, and drove her to King's College Hospital. The hospital received notes from the Maudsley, saying that she was \"preoccupied with morbid thoughts and suicide\".</p> <p>Mel Kenyon says that Sarah had never talked to her about killing herself. \"I knew she had this despair. We talked about that a great deal, and I knew taking her life was an option. However, she didn't threaten suicide ever. You know, you'll feel differently about me when I'm dead, we never had that conversation. Never. I felt, as other people did, strangely protective of her. You just want her to be as happy and as safe as possible.\" She visited her in hospital when she regained consciousness. Kenyon says she was calm and comfortable. But she still talked about wanting to die. Kenyon recalls Sarah saying she was annoyed she had eaten pizza - if she hadn't, she would not have survived. \"We both laughed about it. Not that we shrugged it off. We just spoke about it so openly that it seemed almost funny. I think people think it's a frenzied act, and I don't think it is.\"</p> <p>Two days later, in the middle of the night, Sarah was left alone for 90 minutes. She slipped out to the toilet, where she hanged herself by her shoelaces. Her family is still asking why she was not identified as an at-risk patient, and why she wasn't under 24-hour supervision. </p> <p>Many people have tried to explain Sarah's death, to tie the loose ends into a neat thesis. Some say that, when she lost her belief in God, she lost her reason for living. Others have begun to iconise her - the tortured artist. </p> <p>Mel Kenyon and Simon Kane don't mention the Werther connection to 4.48 Psychosis. The last thing they want is for audiences to see her as a contemporary Werther. \"There's a mythology being built up around everything,\" says Kenyon. \"The mythology that's often associated with suicide. Either that the work is more symptomatic of a psychological illness, and I don't believe that, or there's the romantic mythology that her work is more profound because she committed suicide. I don't believe that either.\"</p> <p>Harold Pinter wishes he had been surprised when he heard of her death, but he wasn't. \"She talked about it a great deal. She just said it was on the cards, you know, and I had to say, 'Come on! For God's sake!' </p> <p>I remember a line in Crave: 'Death is my lover, and he wants to move in.' That's quite a line, isn't it? She felt man's inhumanity to man so profoundly. I believe that's what finally killed her. She couldn't stand the bloody thing any more.''</p> <p>Simon Kane is convinced that his sister wasn't ill. \"I don't think just because you're depressed means you're necessarily ill. </p> <p>I think you can be depressed purely because you see the world around you and think what an awful place it is. She never struck me as insane in any way whatsoever.\"</p> <p>There does seem to be a danger in being over-protective towards Sarah; that, in cocooning her, Simon Kane is doing the very thing he is hoping to prevent: mythologising her, imputing something rather grander, more noble, to her despair than mere depression. </p> <p>Both David Greig and Vince O'Connell think that their friend Sarah Kane was a genius, both say they themselves have suffered milder forms of depression, and both could not be more sure that, in the end, Sarah was a sick woman. O'Connell says that people run away from the label of clinical depression because it frightens them. \"Sarah was one of the kindest people I have ever known, more fun to be with than anyone. You'd never be bored in her company. Clinical depression is a bloody frightening thing. I certainly saw Saz alter under the weight of that. She put up a fearsome fight against her depression, and to have the strength to live with it for as long as she did is awesome.\"</p> <p>Greig tells me that he has no time for the romantic notions associated with suicidal depressives. \"The fragile flowers, too delicate to survive in this harsh world, and they must like candles be blown out. I don't think that's true. I think the reality of extreme suicidal depression is that it's brutal and deadening and unpleasant.\" Kane never wrote because of her depression, he says. She wrote in spite of it.</p> <p>Simon Kane is looking out on to the Royal Court and talking about Sarah's influence on him. He says it's only in the past three years or so that he has really got to grips with theatre. When he first read Blasted, he was baffled, asked her what's that all about then. She told him to read it again. So he did. And again, until he began to realise how good it was. In the last year of Sarah's life, she began to take him to see plays, recommend texts for him to read, talk to him about new projects. As if she was preparing him for his new life. Really, he says, they always had a lot in common.</p> <p>He says the past year-and-a-half have been ghastly for his parents. \"You never can get over something like this. If nothing else, somebody you thought was going to be there isn't. My own experience of it is massively different from what it would have been . . . if I'd thought about it before.\" In what way? He opens his hands, bewildered. \"In a way I can't put into words. It's shocking to the core.\"</p> <p>\u0095 4.48 Psychosis will be playing at London's Royal Court Upstairs</p>",

Kane said that she was already working on 4.48 Psychosis, - and that there were parallels. The title refers to the time of morning when the urge to kill oneself is at its highest. In January 1999, a few months after the triumph of Crave and just after completing 4.48 Psychosis, she took 150 anti-depressants and 50 sleeping pills. Her flatmate discovered her unconscious at their Brixton flat, and drove her to King's College Hospital. The hospital received notes from the Maudsley, saying that she was \"preoccupied with morbid thoughts and suicide\". Mel Kenyon says that Sarah had never talked to her about killing herself. \"I knew she had this despair. We talked about that a great deal, and I knew taking her life was an option. However, she didn't threaten suicide ever. You know, you'll feel differently about me when I'm dead, we never had that conversation. Never. I felt, as other people did, strangely protective of her. You just want her to be as happy and as safe as possible.\" She visited her in hospital when she regained consciousness. Kenyon says she was calm and comfortable. But she still talked about wanting to die. Kenyon recalls Sarah saying she was annoyed she had eaten pizza - if she hadn't, she would not have survived. \"We both laughed about it. Not that we shrugged it off. We just spoke about it so openly that it seemed almost funny. I think people think it's a frenzied act, and I don't think it is.\" Two days later, in the middle of the night, Sarah was left alone for 90 minutes. She slipped out to the toilet, where she hanged herself by her shoelaces. Her family is still asking why she was not identified as an at-risk patient, and why she wasn't under 24-hour supervision. Many people have tried to explain Sarah's death, to tie the loose ends into a neat thesis. Some say that, when she lost her belief in God, she lost her reason for living. Others have begun to iconise her - the tortured artist. Mel Kenyon and Simon Kane don't mention the Werther connection to 4.48 Psychosis. The last thing they want is for audiences to see her as a contemporary Werther. \"There's a mythology being built up around everything,\" says Kenyon. \"The mythology that's often associated with suicide. Either that the work is more symptomatic of a psychological illness, and I don't believe that, or there's the romantic mythology that her work is more profound because she committed suicide. I don't believe that either.\" Harold Pinter wishes he had been surprised when he heard of her death, but he wasn't. \"She talked about it a great deal. She just said it was on the cards, you know, and I had to say, 'Come on! For God's sake!' I remember a line in Crave: 'Death is my lover, and he wants to move in.' That's quite a line, isn't it? She felt man's inhumanity to man so profoundly. I believe that's what finally killed her. She couldn't stand the bloody thing any more.'' Simon Kane is convinced that his sister wasn't ill. \"I don't think just because you're depressed means you're necessarily ill. I think you can be depressed purely because you see the world around you and think what an awful place it is. She never struck me as insane in any way whatsoever.\" There does seem to be a danger in being over-protective towards Sarah; that, in cocooning her, Simon Kane is doing the very thing he is hoping to prevent: mythologising her, imputing something rather grander, more noble, to her despair than mere depression. Both David Greig and Vince O'Connell think that their friend Sarah Kane was a genius, both say they themselves have suffered milder forms of depression, and both could not be more sure that, in the end, Sarah was a sick woman. O'Connell says that people run away from the label of clinical depression because it frightens them. \"Sarah was one of the kindest people I have ever known, more fun to be with than anyone. You'd never be bored in her company. Clinical depression is a bloody frightening thing. I certainly saw Saz alter under the weight of that. She put up a fearsome fight against her depression, and to have the strength to live with it for as long as she did is awesome.\" Greig tells me that he has no time for the romantic notions associated with suicidal depressives. \"The fragile flowers, too delicate to survive in this harsh world, and they must like candles be blown out. I don't think that's true. I think the reality of extreme suicidal depression is that it's brutal and deadening and unpleasant.\" Kane never wrote because of her depression, he says. She wrote in spite of it. Simon Kane is looking out on to the Royal Court and talking about Sarah's influence on him. He says it's only in the past three years or so that he has really got to grips with theatre. When he first read Blasted, he was baffled, asked her what's that all about then. She told him to read it again. So he did. And again, until he began to realise how good it was. In the last year of Sarah's life, she began to take him to see plays, recommend texts for him to read, talk to him about new projects. As if she was preparing him for his new life. Really, he says, they always had a lot in common. He says the past year-and-a-half have been ghastly for his parents. \"You never can get over something like this. If nothing else, somebody you thought was going to be there isn't. My own experience of it is massively different from what it would have been . . . if I'd thought about it before.\" In what way? He opens his hands, bewildered. \"In a way I can't put into words. It's shocking to the core.\" \u0095 4.48 Psychosis will be playing at London's Royal Court Upstairs",

And the wrench at the end of the book is surprisingly like not wanting to say goodbye.",

You placed your trust in an alchemist with silver nitrate-stained fingers, who promised that one's image had the power to outlast oneself. Photography brought with it the concept of the freeze frame. A photograph is an attempt to hold on to something long after it has already departed. Those early portraits have the air of an embalming procedure: subjects held as stiff against flock-wallpaper backgrounds as they would inevitably appear on a mortuary slab.</p> <p>Beryl Bainbridge's novel Master Georgie opens with a sequence in which such a grouping is arranged: \"Master Georgie ordered me to stand stock still and not to blink,\" relates Myrtle, the narrator. \"He had me rest my hand on Mr Hardy's shoulder. Mr Hardy didn't have to be told to keep still because he was dead.\" Bainbridge may have started a trend. Master Georgie is conceived in photographic frames, in which everyone - except the photographer - has a point of view. The photographer records what he sees, not what he thinks. For novelists this is fertile territory, given that their job is to think on everyone's behalf. </p> <p>Both Bellocq's Women by Peter Everett and Afterimage by Helen Humphreys began life as photographic sequences. Humphreys found her inspiration in a group of prints by an aristocratic female pioneer, while Everett took his from the dramatis personae of the brothels of New Orleans. Both take the collodion plate as evidence of a significant moment and sluice it in words to fill the imaginative gaps. </p> <p>The outcomes are as diverse as the techniques are similar. Humphreys's novel will appeal to Pre-Raphaelite sensibilities excited by the frisson of lesbian intrigue; Everett's to anyone with a stomach strong enough to cope with a description of a child prostitute fished from the Mississippi disfigured by catfish. </p> <p>But if a picture is worth a thousand words, are a couple of photographic collections worth two medium-length novels? Prudently, perhaps, both steer clear of illustrating their sources of inspiration. The late 19th-century studies which Julia Margaret Cameron took of her favourite housemaid in various allegorical disguises are not particularly well known, but have a generic pathos typical of Victorian \"art\" photography. </p> <p>Everett is on less stable ground, in that the images he has chosen to work with have become iconic. His saving grace is that no one knows anything concrete about the man who created them. EJ Bellocq died in 1949 leaving little of note, but a drawer full of secrets. He had worked as a commercial photographer for the Foundation Shipping Company, making documentary assessments of damaged steam paddlers. On his death, however, 80-odd glass plates were discovered among his papers, featuring the women who worked in the brothels of the Storyville district in New Orleans. The plates were eventually purchased by the distinguished photographer Lee Friedlander, who printed up the images and arranged for their display at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1970. </p> <p>Friedlander's prints confirmed what he had suspected - Bellocq had, without anybody realising, built up a body of some of the most psychologically perceptive portraits in American photographic history. The fact that the photographer had later scratched away some of the women's faces to preserve their anonymity merely added to their poignant, mysterious power.</p> <p>Although slightly prurient at first sight - the camera maintains the viewpoint of the prospective client - Bellocq's oeuvre is not pornographic, nor even particularly erotic. Often it veers closer to surrealism: a naked prostitute with her back towards us, unaccountably drawing a butterfly on the wall; dispassionate studies of the bizarre things women wear to please men; a Storyville whore splayed on a chair, covered in a bodystocking that reveals all her contours while erasing her nipples.</p> <p>These strange twilight goddesses could be floating in one of the feverish, sensual visions of Belgian surrealist Paul Delvaux. They were, however, real women whom Bellocq clearly knew and cared about. He seemed to have been adopted by the flophouses as a kind of mascot or benevolent father figure (the women used to refer to him as \"Papa\"). </p> <p>Peter Everett has made something of a speciality of imagining himself inside other artists' skins. His previous novel, The Voyages of Alfred Wallis, inhabited the salty hide of the celebrated Cornish fisherman-painter, while Matisse's War, the one before that, took the rather more sophisticated Frenchman as its subject.</p> <p>Everett chooses to explain Bellocq by casting him as a serial obsessive. First it's his mother, then his landlady's daughter; later a self-destructive 10-year-old nymphette. All of this sounds desperately unhealthy, but Everett suggests that Bellocq, who remained single all his life, gained in the blowsy, high-spirited enclaves of the brothels a sense of familial, domestic security that he failed to find elsewhere. </p> <p>Everett particularly relishes the over-scented atmosphere of these curiously homely vice dens. In fact, the whole novel reeks. No sooner does Everett conjure a comparison with Degas's ballet dancers than he draws attention to the sweat under their armpits, tenderly evoked elsewhere in the novel as a \"rank odour of wet rusty iron\": his pungent prose plays everywhere upon the senses. </p> <p>Afterimage, by comparison, is a breath of fresh air. This is the kind of novel in which the heroine enjoys the leisure to experience an erotic encounter with an apple tree and then floats indoors to enquire of her husband whether she will ever be taken seriously. Humphreys arranges a tidy story around three principal characters: Eldon, who wishes he were a great explorer; Isabelle, who wishes she were a great photographer; and Annie, her new maid, muse and model, who wishes being in service were more like Jane Eyre. Though Humphreys is certainly adept at teasing out a compelling tale, plot-wise this is fairly predictable, triangular stuff. The characters are far more preoccupied with exploring their individual fantasies than exploring each other. </p> <p>Ultimately, however, what goes on in the mind of the photographer is pure speculation. The image is the only statement that matters. It is a point which eludes both these novels, but which Bainbridge dealt with brilliantly in Master Georgie. In Bainbridge's novel, the man behind the camera doesn't have a voice; Georgie never speaks. All we hear are the accounts of his motley caravan of admirers as the whole crew becomes sucked into the maelstrom of the Crimean War. As the situations and scenery become ever more harrowing, the camera goes on impassively recording. Bainbridge demonstrates that the camera never lies, it simply remains impeccably silent.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"Why do saints come down to the world of the living, give us a couple of signs, and leave in a hurry?\" asks the heroine of Maria Escandon's delightful <strong> Esperanza's Box of Saints </strong> (Picador, \u00a39.99). While Esperanza prepares for her recently deceased daughter's funeral, San Judas Tadeo, saint of desperate causes, appears in the grease spots on her oven window.</p> <p>Esperanza takes this as a sign that Blanca is not dead, but has in fact been kidnapped and forced into prostitution. Determined to save her, she journeys from her Mexican village to the brothels of Tijuana. Aided by a confessor priest, a pot-smoking judge, a cross-dressing pimp and the clutch of saintly icons she carries everywhere, the unassailable Esperanza is transformed from spiritual naif into woman of the world. And, like the characters she drags along on her quest, the reader is richer for it. </p> <p>Rajeev Balasubramanyam's <strong> In Beautiful Disguises </strong> (Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99) deals with a similar metamorphosis. The lazy days of Arjuna's south Indian childhood are spent dreaming of becoming a film star. These end abruptly when she is told she must marry.</p> <p>Luckily, her brother-in law's father is on hand with a contact in the city, a few thousand rupees, and the sage advice to \"experience life\". Alas, Arjuna's world-view is mostly informed by the character of Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Surely, all a woman needs is \"an apartment, diamonds, a friend in Sing Sing, a cat\"? But what if she's picked the wrong movie? What if in fact, Sabrina is a more appropriate allegory? Colourful, spirited and crackling with charm: it's easy to see why Balasubramanyam has already won a Betty Trask prize. </p> <p>In the Alaskan wilderness of Kimberly Kafka's <strong> True North </strong> (Macmillan, \u00a39.99), the bears are so hungry they eat rubber seats off snowmobiles. This desolation suits bush pilot Bailey Lockhart, who prefers to minimise human contact. However, her log cabin sits in the middle of indigenous territory, and her attraction to Ingalik activist Kash draws her into an angry debate over land rights. Wise in her handling of delicate issues, Kafka expertly balances arresting physical description and suspenseful prose.</p> <p>Felix Campbell \"grew up in a glen with a glen-shaped soul, and baptism in his heart\". Still a virgin at 43 and oblivious to the designs of Ballymully's single women, he falls hook, line and sinker for a Catholic widow from the other side of the glen. In <strong> The Biggest Baby in Ireland after the Famine </strong> (Virago, \u00a39.99), Anne Barnett picks up the torch from her storytelling ancestors as once again Protestant meets Catholic and traditional values conflict with the proclivities of the human heart. However, Barnett's contribution to the genre lacks energy: thin on plot and stylistic dynamism, she still has a lot to learn from Edna O'Brien's wry and moving representations of rural Irish community. </p> <p>It's conventional to blame creative-writing programmes for slick prose and first-line shockers. Set in redneck rural Pennsylvania, the opening sequence of Maureen Gibbon's <strong> Swimming Green Arrow </strong> (Sceptre, \u00a310) certainly conforms to stereotype. \"When I was 18, I went parking with my boyfriend Del, my best friend June, and her boyfriend Ray. What I mean is that June fucked Ray and I fucked Del in the same car, at the same time.\" </p> <p>However, this tale of female friendship and first love is surprisingly compelling. The graphic sex scenes are not for the squeamish, but though brutal, they are never gratuitous. Rather, Gibbon's craft is to force the reader to acknowledge how easily addictive sex can be mistaken for love, with all the grisly consequences that ensue. This she does with almost effortless assurance. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502444359,00.html\">Buy Esperanza's Box of Saints at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502370320,00.html\">Buy In Beautiful Disguises at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502418903,00.html\">Buy True North at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502428796,00.html\">Buy The Biggest Baby in Ireland after the Famine at BOL</a></p>",

Aided by a confessor priest, a pot-smoking judge, a cross-dressing pimp and the clutch of saintly icons she carries everywhere, the unassailable Esperanza is transformed from spiritual naif into woman of the world. And, like the characters she drags along on her quest, the reader is richer for it. Rajeev Balasubramanyam's In Beautiful Disguises (Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99) deals with a similar metamorphosis. The lazy days of Arjuna's south Indian childhood are spent dreaming of becoming a film star. These end abruptly when she is told she must marry. Luckily, her brother-in law's father is on hand with a contact in the city, a few thousand rupees, and the sage advice to \"experience life\". Alas, Arjuna's world-view is mostly informed by the character of Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Surely, all a woman needs is \"an apartment, diamonds, a friend in Sing Sing, a cat\"? But what if she's picked the wrong movie? What if in fact, Sabrina is a more appropriate allegory? Colourful, spirited and crackling with charm: it's easy to see why Balasubramanyam has already won a Betty Trask prize. In the Alaskan wilderness of Kimberly Kafka's True North (Macmillan, \u00a39.99), the bears are so hungry they eat rubber seats off snowmobiles. This desolation suits bush pilot Bailey Lockhart, who prefers to minimise human contact. However, her log cabin sits in the middle of indigenous territory, and her attraction to Ingalik activist Kash draws her into an angry debate over land rights. Wise in her handling of delicate issues, Kafka expertly balances arresting physical description and suspenseful prose. Felix Campbell \"grew up in a glen with a glen-shaped soul, and baptism in his heart\". Still a virgin at 43 and oblivious to the designs of Ballymully's single women, he falls hook, line and sinker for a Catholic widow from the other side of the glen. In The Biggest Baby in Ireland after the Famine (Virago, \u00a39.99), Anne Barnett picks up the torch from her storytelling ancestors as once again Protestant meets Catholic and traditional values conflict with the proclivities of the human heart. However, Barnett's contribution to the genre lacks energy: thin on plot and stylistic dynamism, she still has a lot to learn from Edna O'Brien's wry and moving representations of rural Irish community. It's conventional to blame creative-writing programmes for slick prose and first-line shockers. Set in redneck rural Pennsylvania, the opening sequence of Maureen Gibbon's Swimming Green Arrow (Sceptre, \u00a310) certainly conforms to stereotype. \"When I was 18, I went parking with my boyfriend Del, my best friend June, and her boyfriend Ray. What I mean is that June fucked Ray and I fucked Del in the same car, at the same time.\" However, this tale of female friendship and first love is surprisingly compelling. The graphic sex scenes are not for the squeamish, but though brutal, they are never gratuitous. Rather, Gibbon's craft is to force the reader to acknowledge how easily addictive sex can be mistaken for love, with all the grisly consequences that ensue. This she does with almost effortless assurance. Buy Esperanza's Box of Saints at BOL Buy In Beautiful Disguises at BOL Buy True North at BOL Buy The Biggest Baby in Ireland after the Famine at BOL",

It is therefore a book both unreadable and unputdownable. </p> <p>Lost Years is Isherwood's reconstructed diary, composed between 1971 and 1977, about the period 1945-51, when he was in his early forties, living in Santa Monica with the photographer Bill Caksey. It fills in the gaping hole at the centre of the first volume of Isherwood's Diaries, published back in 1996, or at least it would if a hole can be said to be filled with a void. The title Lost Years is hardly subtle, but it is at least appropriate.</p> <p>Isherwood had to go back and reconstruct the material because during the late 1940s he abandoned his habit of keeping the detailed diaries that provided him with material for many of his novels and autobiographical works - he was too lazy, or too busy, depending on how you look at it. Even by Isherwood's own uneven standards, Lost Years is therefore something of an oddity: an unpolished and unfinished memoir based on virtually non-existent diaries and edited by someone else, the dutiful Katherine Bucknell, who also edited the Diaries. </p> <p>The reconstruction is at times a little wobbly, to say the least. The entries eventually peter out as Isherwood's attention begins to focus on various other writing projects, such as Christopher and His Kind, but even when he's concentrating on the job in hand his memory is unreliable and his efforts at recall half-hearted. Thinking back to his relationship with the artist Bill Harris, he wonders, \"Why did he suddenly decide on this boyish elopement? Was he trying to prove to Bill how young he still was?... I simply cannot remember.\" If he can't remember, why should we care? </p> <p>Isherwood's was always a style built around limitations, but in Lost Years the limitations become an irritation. History completely passes him by, as he reports himself in the third person: \"The next month passed without any remarkable incidents, as far as I can judge from the day-to-day diary. It sounds crazy to say this, when, in fact, Mussolini and his mistress were killed on April 28, Hitler's death was announced on May 1, Berlin fell on May 2 and the Nazis surrendered on the 7th! The day-to-day diary merely records that, on the 28th, he took a taxi to the beach and spent the night at Denny's,\" etcetera. </p> <p>Everything passes him by, then, except sex, of which he can't get enough: \"Christopher was ready to have sex with most males within reasonable age limits.\" His sexual liaisons are about the only thing Isherwood seems to remember with any real clarity, purpose or pleasure. A large part of the book is therefore taken up with a lusty retelling of his adventures, or what he refers to as \"stickings-in and pullings-out\". There is sex in courtyards, in cars, with friends and casual pick-ups, plus an attempt at an underwater Pacific blowjob, which might provide a useful metaphor for the book as a whole: an attempt to bring froth out of foam. </p> <p>At one point Isherwood announces, casually but authoritatively, like a cigar snob or a connoisseur of fine wines, that he prefers rimming to other sexual practices \"because of its grossness\". Grossness of various kinds is on display throughout the book. Isherwood recalls, for example, that the first time he slept with Stephen Spender's ex Tony Hyndman (\"Jimmy Younger\" in Spender's World Within World ), \"he found the act so delicious that he was unwilling to wash Tony's shit off his cock\".</p> <p>This is frank, but not nearly so shocking as a throwaway phrase such as \"When Christopher got cured of his guilt, several years later\", which makes guilt sound like a cast-off sweatshirt. There are depths, however, to which Isherwood does not sink. He does not, for example, and thank God - would we ever have heard the last of it, from either of them? - have sex with Gore Vidal. </p> <p>Even for Isherwood enthusiasts - for those of us who admire and marvel at his persistent attempts at honesty - there are passages in Lost Years that will unsettle and shock. Describing his relationship with the composer Barry Taxman, for example, Isherwood writes that \"he had that Jewish tactlessness, argumentativeness and aggressiveness which always aroused Christopher's anti-semitic feelings. Only, in Barry's case, Christopher's anti-semitism quickly became erotic. It made him hot to mate Barry's aggressiveness with his own, in wrestling duels which were both sexual and racial, Briton against Jew. Barry's aggressiveness became beautiful and lovable when it was expressed physically by his strong lithe body grappling naked with Christopher's. As they struggled, Christopher loved him because he was a pushy arrogant Jewboy.\" Not despite, note, but because. So that's all right then. </p> <p>The book ends abruptly in 1951 with the Broadway success of I Am A Camera - which saved Isherwood's career, and pulled him out of his downward spiral into sloth and self-pity - just out of sight and around the corner. I Am a Camera, adapted from Isherwood's novel Goodbye to Berlin, was later made into the film Cabaret by Bob Fosse, and although Isherwood undoubtedly deserves to be remembered as more than the man responsible for Liza Minnelli perched on a chair in black boots and stockings with her legs apart, it will not be for his Lost Years.</p>",

I simply cannot remember.\" If he can't remember, why should we care? Isherwood's was always a style built around limitations, but in Lost Years the limitations become an irritation. History completely passes him by, as he reports himself in the third person: \"The next month passed without any remarkable incidents, as far as I can judge from the day-to-day diary. It sounds crazy to say this, when, in fact, Mussolini and his mistress were killed on April 28, Hitler's death was announced on May 1, Berlin fell on May 2 and the Nazis surrendered on the 7th! The day-to-day diary merely records that, on the 28th, he took a taxi to the beach and spent the night at Denny's,\" etcetera. Everything passes him by, then, except sex, of which he can't get enough: \"Christopher was ready to have sex with most males within reasonable age limits.\" His sexual liaisons are about the only thing Isherwood seems to remember with any real clarity, purpose or pleasure. A large part of the book is therefore taken up with a lusty retelling of his adventures, or what he refers to as \"stickings-in and pullings-out\". There is sex in courtyards, in cars, with friends and casual pick-ups, plus an attempt at an underwater Pacific blowjob, which might provide a useful metaphor for the book as a whole: an attempt to bring froth out of foam. At one point Isherwood announces, casually but authoritatively, like a cigar snob or a connoisseur of fine wines, that he prefers rimming to other sexual practices \"because of its grossness\". Grossness of various kinds is on display throughout the book. Isherwood recalls, for example, that the first time he slept with Stephen Spender's ex Tony Hyndman (\"Jimmy Younger\" in Spender's World Within World ), \"he found the act so delicious that he was unwilling to wash Tony's shit off his cock\". This is frank, but not nearly so shocking as a throwaway phrase such as \"When Christopher got cured of his guilt, several years later\", which makes guilt sound like a cast-off sweatshirt. There are depths, however, to which Isherwood does not sink. He does not, for example, and thank God - would we ever have heard the last of it, from either of them? - have sex with Gore Vidal. Even for Isherwood enthusiasts - for those of us who admire and marvel at his persistent attempts at honesty - there are passages in Lost Years that will unsettle and shock. Describing his relationship with the composer Barry Taxman, for example, Isherwood writes that \"he had that Jewish tactlessness, argumentativeness and aggressiveness which always aroused Christopher's anti-semitic feelings. Only, in Barry's case, Christopher's anti-semitism quickly became erotic. It made him hot to mate Barry's aggressiveness with his own, in wrestling duels which were both sexual and racial, Briton against Jew. Barry's aggressiveness became beautiful and lovable when it was expressed physically by his strong lithe body grappling naked with Christopher's. As they struggled, Christopher loved him because he was a pushy arrogant Jewboy.\" Not despite, note, but because. So that's all right then. The book ends abruptly in 1951 with the Broadway success of I Am A Camera - which saved Isherwood's career, and pulled him out of his downward spiral into sloth and self-pity - just out of sight and around the corner. I Am a Camera, adapted from Isherwood's novel Goodbye to Berlin, was later made into the film Cabaret by Bob Fosse, and although Isherwood undoubtedly deserves to be remembered as more than the man responsible for Liza Minnelli perched on a chair in black boots and stockings with her legs apart, it will not be for his Lost Years.",

      "body": "<p>\"He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, 'Rictusempra!' \" </p> <p>Yes, everything does still seem to be working. As you may know by now, the latest book in the Harry Potter series is published next week. Part of the mystique is that the title, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was until recently kept secret. Nearly 2m in advance sales adds something else to the aura. And then there is the author, no less mysterious than some of her own creations.</p> <p>Lately she has been the subject of a piece of smear journalism in the Sunday Mirror, which tracked down her estranged husband Jorge in Portugal, alleging him to be a drug addict. Still, there must be compensations. Already among Britain's richest women, with her new book JK Rowling is likely to net a fortune in worldwide merchandising - \u00a3600m, according to one estimate. </p> <p>But there is much more to her tales of the young wizard than money, hype and gossip. There is a back story to all this: wizards have long been part of literary culture, both as subjects and as personae adopted by writers. Rowling is not the only bestselling children's author to put the occult at the centre of her writing. Philip Pullman, whose Northern Lights has won him great acclaim and large sales, is another writer alert to the expansive power of magic in children's literature. Both are drawing on a tradition that stretches back to Tolkien and further, into the mist-shrouded origins of northern European literature. </p> <p>In a schema that now has more general currency among Hollywood scriptwriters through the influence of mythographer Joseph Campbell, the hero or apprentice of a magical narrative will leave his or her \"ordinary world\" - the world of the Muggles, in Potter-speak - and face a journey, literal or metaphorical. On one level the attraction is clear: pure escapism and the fantasy of power denied in the ordinary world. On another it is more mysterious, posing the question of why magical narratives have proved so popular with children and young adults. Is there something freakish in the appeal of stories such as Rowling's, or should she be commended for a valuable contribution not just to children's books, but to literature in general? </p> <p>Witches probably make more regular appearances in such stories (no doubt a function of a sexism that runs deep in the veins of the culture), but boy, are the wizards more interesting. They are more finely grained, with a moral hinterland that leaves witches gasping. In Lord of the Rings - a book which constantly tops best-ever lists - Gandalf, the longbeard wizard who guides the hobbits in their search for the Ring, is just such a cross-hatched figure.</p> <p>He is knowing, but not all-knowing; powerful but, at the same time, fatally flawed. His transformative abilities are predicated on their not being over-used or abused; as if magical ability were a car that stopped working altogether if you drove it to the wrong places or at excessive speed. This is a common feature of the cultural presentation of \"white\" magic and also, one supposes, a submerged version of the parable of the talents: don't waste your wizardry. Hogwarts in the Potter stories flags up this aspect of sorcery simply by being a school. </p> <p>Writers of the past have not been slow to show what happens when supernatural powers are squandered, and not just in children's books. Building on Malory's Morte d'Arthur and its precursors, Tennyson created what is perhaps the greatest wizard in literature in his long sequence of Arthurian poems, Idylls of the King. The genius of Malory's and Tennyson's Merlin is that as well as being an iconic figure - the guardian of national purity - he is also a three-dimensional character with ordinary hopes and desires and fears. Rowling has developed a similar approach in the Potter books, as have the writers of the cult television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. </p> <p>In Buffy, sex and magic are inextricably entangled, with the confusing world of adolescence finding symbolic equivalents in the arcana of demonology. These work on numerous levels. Buffy kills vampires, but her boyfriend is a good vampire, though unreliable and difficult to integrate into ordinary society; all the while, she has an Oedipal relationship with her tutor in magic, the likeable but absent-minded Giles. </p> <p>Many of the Buffy characters are shape-shifters. The dry ice swirls, and friends show themselves to be monsters. This doesn't work only on a dramatic level; it also serves to exemplify how easily, in the confusion of teenage hormonal torment, an innocent or cosy sexual encounter can turn into something threatening. Shape-shifters are part of the Rowling universe too: in The Prisoner of Azkhaban, affable Professor Lupin turns out to be Master of the Dark Arts, and then a werewolf; finally we learn that he is a good werewolf. </p> <p>The Goblet of Fire is rumoured to be the first of the Potter books in which sex makes an appearance. As Harry, Hermione and friends enter adolescence, it will be interesting to see how Rowling stacks up the multivalent layers of sexual and magical identity. Perhaps Harry will go to the bad. It can happen to the best of them. Look what happened to Anakin Skywalker. Or Edmund in CS Lewis's Narnia stories, who succumbed to the lures of the White Witch, with Turkish delight standing in for forbidden sexual territory. It's more likely Harry will flirt with danger, seem to fall, and come out all the stronger. </p> <p>The test has long been a feature of magical narratives. In the Arthurian corpus of tales, both Sir Galahad and Sir Percival abdicate sexual power for military invulnerability, and variously fail or succeed the tests that are set them, according to which version you read. Lancelot becomes the Hugh Grant of Camelot, a figure in sexual disgrace; correspondingly, the magic stops working for him. It doesn't always work for the wizards, either. The key moment in Tennyson's Idylls comes when Merlin falls victim to sexual predations and is frozen in a tree, thereby losing his powers.</p> <p>This is a reversal of the usual pattern. The figure of the male bad enchanter (as in Spenser's Faerie Queene) is a common one. He usually ends up cornering a virgin: Milton's Comus, using semen-like glues, sticks his to a chair. Sometimes, however, the wizard gives up his powers willingly, breaking his rod like Prospero or Millroy, the faith healer in Paul Theroux's Millroy the Magician. This generally happens when some kind of cycle is thought to be complete (although in Theroux's case it is to enable the magician to fulfill an ordinary sexual relationship). </p> <p>If, as has been intimated, the Potter books continue into young adulthood - with three more said to be on their way, Harry looks as though he will get to his 18th birthday - can we expect our hero to retire in such a manner? Or, as with that wizard of the rational, Sherlock Holmes, will the public demand a comeback? </p> <p>It has often been argued that for Shakespeare, Prospero's role in The Tempest offered a way of encoding the climax of his own career; it's certainly true that for centuries writers have drawn parallels between the magical and literary arts. And there is without doubt something nocturnal and glamorously spectral about many writers in person. In the past, the wizard look ran to their property too. Some, holed up in their grand, gothic houses, have seemed the very image of the necromancer: Walter Scott, for instance, the \"White Wizard\" of Abbotsford, consciously drew on a tradition of Scottish magick that included recorded figures such as Pale Kenneth and Major Weir. </p> <p>Other authors, such as Yeats, have sought a necromantic agency in language, as though putting the right words in the right order might provide a channel to the nether world. In his memoirs, former Daily Chronicle and Guardian journalist HW Nevinson remembers visiting Yeats in his chambers at Woburn Place and listening to him harking on Leo Africanus, his 16th-century attendant spirit. Today, a quasi-magical correspondence with the past is at the heart of the work of authors such as Peter Ackroyd and Iain Sinclair. This correspondence is rooted in the London landscape, particularly the reaches of the Thames, the City and Clerkenwell. </p> <p>The latter affords the setting of The House of Doctor Dee, Ackroyd's novel about the Elizabethan alchemist - another area in which literature and the spirit world have touched each other. Even a poet as sober as Geoffrey Hill has not been averse to the notion that writing is, to borrow a phrase of Freddie Mercury's, \"a kind of magic\": Hill's poems are full of images of gold, and constantly press the idea that words, properly used, have an alchemical, transformative power. </p> <p>Writers such as these affect the image of the magus (think of John Fowles's novel), the wizard of an eastern, hermetic tradition in European literature that, through various byways, eventually winds itself back to the scholars of the Jewish Kabbalah; for these and their antecedents, secret knowledge is like a kind of drug. </p> <p>If all this makes you think of Getafix, the wizard in the Asterix stories, and then of Will Self (this kind of free-associating rough magic is central to some theories of literary mysticism), the return takes you round to the spell itself - to the very words. It was through the words themselves that Baudelaire and Rimbaud, through other systems of mystic correspondences and vocalisations, sought to break and remake their worlds. </p> <p>In this the dissolute French poets made common cause with authors of one of the most ancient forms of writing, runes. These archaic symbols appeared in Nordic and Germanic inscriptions from the second century AD until the Viking era, and latterly in Anglo-Saxon derivations. Used in systems of divination, they suggest that magic was central to the earliest forms of written communication.</p> <p>Northern European writers today constantly hark back to this tradition, raiding the \"word-hoard\", as Seamus Heaney called it, in attempts to bring magic to their work. While some of the appeal of the Potter stories lies in the way they offer, like Middle Earth, Narnia and Gormenghast before them, a parallel world in which young people can test the boundaries of their nascent identities, they are also firmly in this mainstream of northern European literature. And perhaps not just northern European; if the writers whose forebears came out of the forested, frozen north can be called wizards, can the storytellers and wisdom-keepers of other cultures not be wizards too - the shaman of the Native Americans, the trickster of the Caribbean? </p> <p>One thing is certain. When The Goblet of Fire comes out next week, JK Rowling will once again cast her spell over the minds of young children, the cash registers of bookshops - and, indeed, the keyboards of journalists driven to write that she is \"casting her spell\" over this and that. Afterwards, who knows? Maybe the craze will tail off, or maybe she will go from strength to strength. The wizards are out of the bag, in any case. Seamus Deane, Heaney's old schoolfriend, is rumoured to be writing a novel about one. Expect many more. But don't worry about wizards planning to take over the world. We have no plans of that nature.</p> <p>\u0095 Giles Foden is the author of two novels, Ladysmith and The Last King of Scotland.</p>",

Moreover, Harding's desire to dissolve boundaries, not only between countries and continents but between different kinds of human suffering, so that anyone who has suffered anything in his or her life can plausibly claim to be a refugee, hardly helps: for if everyone is a refugee, no one is.

This latter is a disgusting slur, the only possible function of which is to stimulate admiration in the reader for the intensity of the author's compassion. </p> <p>The refusal to face in any concrete way the real moral and practical dilemmas posed by mass migration is this book's greatest weakness.

Yet he remains important because he's a master craftsman, his characteristically ribald tales of familial tensions and small-town infidelities conveyed, almost too elegantly, within carefully modulated sentences.</p> <p>Perhaps it's this acute feeling for the lush possibilities of language, combined with an equally sensitive perception of the seedy duplicity and detritus of everyday life, that allows him to approach the Bard, however reverentially. </p> <p>What Updike offers us in Gertrude and Claudius is a roiling three-part prequel to Shakespeare's Hamlet. The action spans three decades, and in each section Updike signals the various sources of the play by invoking the appropriate spellings.</p> <p>In part one the names are taken from a 12th-century account of the Hamlet legend. We see Gerutha betrothed to the king, Howendil; she bears a son, Amleth, and is drawn to the king's brother, Feng. In part two, the names come from a 16th-century source: Geruthe commits adultery with Fengon, Horvendile's brother, thus arousing the suspicions of her son, Hamblet. In part three the drama tiptoes into the first two scenes of Shakespeare's version, and the names revert to those he favoured. </p> <p>By tracing the story's provenance, Updike cleverly undermines the perception of Shakespeare's text as the definitive version of the tale, while also paying homage to his creative appropriation of the original sources.</p> <p>Updike's endeavour is similarly fluent. He dreams between the lines, making full use of the additional subtleties and depths offered by novelistic discourse. What would be theatrical asides become lengthy interior monologues; motives only suggested or summarised previously are investigated and dramatised. The fraternal rivalries and resentments are well measured and deftly nuanced throughout, so that when Feng finally poisons the king as he sleeps in the orchard, it is less an act of malice than a despairing bid to overcome the loveless dictates of the court. </p> <p>Our knowledge of the play and its resonances are everywhere brought to bear by Updike's twists and turns. He smuggles in lines and phrases and teases with presentiments, some more subtle than others. Hamlet himself is banished to brood in the wings; he has only one line in the book. His moody presence is communicated by the worried words of others, and he looms all the larger because of it. Just as we are inhabiting the lacunae of Shakespeare's text - spaces now lavishly upholstered by Updike's prose - so, too, do we sense the dark prince stalking the blind spots of our own newly granted perspective. And the terrible foreboding is all ours. </p> <p>As the novel progresses, the queen's ignorance of her husband's murder piques the reader's conscience, and we flinch at the studied accretion of her niggling doubts and unhappinesses. We are guilty by proxy, the murderer's accomplice, and Updike presses the point with glorious understatement: \"She was puzzled. There seemed to be a secret.\" </p> <p>In prose bulging with earthy metaphors and canny dialogue, Updike proffers descriptions to prick the senses: a garment has \"the secret little greasy stink of sheep in the rain\". He excels at the seemingly incidental objects of domestic life, here transposing this skill to the timber-floored chambers and wainscoted rooms of \"vast, formal, echoing Elsinore\". The brushes, powders and toothpicks on Gertrude's dressing table comprise a sad inventory of a queen never quite at ease with her roles as mother and wife. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Corambis (Polonius) retains the clumsy punning and pontification that Shakespeare bestowed upon him. And Updike drops in a few anachronisms to give an ahistorical, ironic feel, just in case we are beginning to take it all too seriously. Understandably for such an ambitious project, there are moments in the narrative that don't quite ring true, as well as bucolic passages during which Updike's sentences become fat with self-indulgence: a \"gloomy winter morning emanated a coruscating halo of static phosphorence\". Occasionally, pronouncements lack humour or insight. </p> <p>No doubt Updike would defend his stylistic extravagance under the licence of a bawdy Elizabethan excess, and nowhere more so than when writing about sex. As you'd expect from a writer who has fun finding new ways to describe the \"brainless rhythm of thrust and counterthrust\", here he runs amok. Women are to be \"pressed into the mattress and basted like a spitted chicken\", while Howendil boasts \"enough explosive thrusting to fill a bucket\". The queen is supremely submissive: \"had he bid her lie down in pigshit she would have squeezed her buttocks together in the clench and rejoiced to be thus befouled\". </p> <p>Clearly, Updike is enjoying himself. Perhaps he believes he can preclude charges of misogyny or chauvinism by entering into the spirit of the times. Others might claim that, as in The Witches of Eastwick, he is at his best when giving his prejudices free rein. Despite its injudicious outbursts, and there are quite a few of them, Gertrude and Claudius is a marvellously enterprising and linguistically joyful footnote to one of the most famous plays in our language.

They will be available from July 4 onwards at www.eloan.com/uk. Bid for a home over the internet through www.PropWatch.com. The website allows consumers to buy and sell property online using a bidding process where the market rather than an estate agent sets the price of the property. Buyers submit offers online using software that allows sellers to set a defined bidding period, after which they can choose whether to accept the highest bid or not. Internet home buying can also be done through the television. In a deal with cable company Telewest, digital television viewers will be able to access on-screen Property Internet's residential property website www.08004homes.com. The site has more than 70,000 UK properties and also features property news, house buying advice, area guides, financial services advice and DIY information. Find a property (www.findaproperty.com) is hoping to lure potential buyers with more detailed information. The website has introduced five new categories: prestige homes, waterside homes, new homes, short let and commercial. It hopes the move will help customers locate their desired property more effectively and with more precision. Share website MoneyGuru (www.moneyguru.co.uk) is offering refunds to customers who follow its advice but don't see the returns. The site says that if recommendations from its in-house ana lysts don't outperform the FTSE All-Share index average over the year, customers will get a no-quibble refund of their \u00a311.95 subscription. Fund information site TrustNet (www.trustnet.co.uk) has had a redesign. New features include live news feeds, comparative performance tables and charts and a personal portfolio facility.",
