      "bodyText": "A row is brewing between Vodafone Airtouch and Orange management over the interpretation of yesterday's ruling by the European Commission that Orange be demerged from its parent. The EC gave the green light to Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann but required as part of that deal that Orange be demerged. Mannesmann bought Orange in 1999. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone operator, has maintained that the EC's ruling will still allow it to consider a trade sale of Orange. However, Hans Snook, chief executive of Orange, is adamant that Britain's third biggest mobile phone company will be relisted as an indepdent FTSE-100 company by the autumn. The group may also look at listing on the Nasdaq and Frankfurt markets. Orange is expected to return to the EC and seek a clarification on its ruling that Vodafone may only sell Orange via a demerger. A demerger would see the sale of shares in Orange to the existing shareholders of Vodafone. Orange management had lobbied the EC strongly on a demerger from Vodafone. They have argued that a trade sale by Vodafone could see it sold to a weaker opponent making it less competitive unit. European Commissioner Mario Monti said: \"We are confident that Orange, once divested by Vodafone, will be able to constitute a viable competitor.\" Vodafone has agreed a confidential deadline with the EC by which time it must demerge Orange.

An Orange demerger is a cheaper option for Vodafone as it reduces the capital gains tax which would occur under a trade sale. Nevertheless, France Telecom has expressed interest in making a bid for Orange as has Holland's KPN Telecom. Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent welcomed the decision on the four month investigation and said the company's priority was now to forge ahead with integrating Mannesmann. It was the EC's first ruling on a merger between two large mobile phone operators. One of the EC's concerns was that the merger would result in favourable treatment in roaming tariffs to business customers which use Vodafone and Mannesmann's networks that cover at least nine European countries. Vodafone is likely to introduce a pan-European tariff and this could undercut the charges of national operators in various European countries. Mr Monti extracted a concession from both Vodafone and Mannesmann on roaming agreements. He said rivals would be able to access Vodafone and Mannesmann's networks for a period of three years \"at a non-discriminatory price\". This would, in effect, allow rivals to charge a similar price for overseas calls within Europe \"and prevent the emergence of a dominant position\". But after three years, competitors will have to fend for themselves. Vodafone shares yesterday fell 1/2p to 312p.",

He sticks his tongue out at the corrective John of Gaunt, seizes his lands with arbitrary zeal and skips off to the Irish wars as if going to a fashion parade. </p> <p>Within the parameters of Jonathan Kent's production, it is a fine performance. Fiennes has a stained glass profile, a resonant voice and a mordant irony. If the lyricism of Richard's downfall is underplayed, Fiennes compensates with a mocking humour. He is at his best in the deposition scene where he exaggeratedly cocks an ear as he cries: \"God Save The King\" and hugs the crown to his chest as if it were a favourite toy. Stripped of monarchy's protective divinity, this Richard becomes poignantly aware of his own wastefulness and other people's cunning. </p> <p>What I miss in Kent's production is much sense of the play's politics. We are magnetised by Richard. But Linus Roache's stolidly impassive Bolingbroke gives us no hint of a man who turns injustice into opportunity. And amongst the anonymous Shakespearean nobles only two performances stand out. One is David Burke's ferocious, death-haunted John of Gaunt and the other is Oliver Ford Davies's wonderfully dithering Duke of York who reacts to the dilemmas of power with the uncertainty of the liberal intellectual. </p> <p>Barbara Jefford also makes an impressive late appearance as a dominatingly maternal Duchess of York. But one looks in vain for an any insight into the way Boling broke's coup d'etat breeds another kind of tyranny. </p> <p>The production feels like an old-fashioned framework for Fiennes's performance and for his agonised discovery that even kings are subject to the imperatives of transience, time and death.</p>",

The Second Division strugglers have drawn up a shortlist headed by Clough and Danny Wilson after ending John Duncan's seven-year tenure yesterday with the club staring relegation in the face. Wilson lives in Chesterfield and is keen for a quick return to the game after being sacked by Sheffield Wednesday last month. But Clough, the former England forward and son of a famously successful manager, would be cheaper and is therefore the likelier option. The Burton Albion player-manager has made it known he wants to test himself at a higher level after a successful first year with the Dr Marten's Premier League side, who are still challenging for promotion to the Nationwide Conference. Duncan guided Chesterfield to an FA Cup semi-final against Middlesbrough three years ago but his team have won only five of 40 league games this season and fans have demanded his removal. The Aberdeen chief executive Gordon Bennett has urged the Scottish Football Association to play fair with its ticket allocation for the Scottish Cup final on May 27. The Dons will face Rangers at Hampden Park and have asked for a 50-50 split in tickets. Rangers have requested a greater share to reflect their size of support, but Bennett insists the SFA should follow the example of its English counterpart. \"In England, if Manchester United were playing Bradford in the cup final the ticket allocation would be 50-50,\" he said. \"If Rangers were playing Celtic on May 27 it would be 50-50.

      "bodyText": "On IRA \"freedom fighters\" \"That is how the IRA saw themselves. They were prepared to die - 10 starved themselves to death. That's not what a criminal or godfather of crime does; it's someone who believes they're fighting for the freedom of their country and you've got to deal with them on that basis.\" Livingstone on ITV, April 2000, defending his 1980s comment that the IRA were \"freedom fighters\" On sex and drugs \"I don't take drugs, and I don't think anyone should take drugs, but I'm also saying I think the drugs tsar is a waste of money.\" Clarifying comments after his NME interview, April 2000 \"I do think we could consider decriminalising things like ecstasy and cannabis, but I would never do anything to encourage people to take drugs any more than I would encourage people to drink.\" Ken Livingstone in the NME, April 2000 \"We are all bisexual.\" Livingstone in the 1980s \"When I was leader of the GLC, for three years running I was voted by a City Limits readers' poll as the man they would most like to spend a day with on Clapham Common!\" Livingstone, November 1998 \"Being a man is pretty abhorrent. Back-slapping, beer-swilling, beer-gutted men sitting around boasting. Urgh. As a man, you can never remove the conditioning that's made you what you are. The idea that women are just there to be notched up like scores on a gun is so deep you have to struggle against it all the time. It's a question of overcoming your evil.\" Livingstone in the 1990s On capitalism and direct action \"Every year the international financial system kills more people than world war two. But at least Hitler was mad.\" Livingstone in the NME, April 2000 \"I have always been in favour of direct action \u0085 One of my fondest memories was chasing the inspector of the Archway Road inquiry out on to the roof at Central Hall. The barrister representing the government was one Michael Howard, who interposed with his body, saying: 'Don't throw him over!' As if I was going to.\" Livingstone in Face magazine, January 2000 \"I've been on the record in so many interviews and articles over the last 30 years - you won't find a single time when I've ever supported violence, whether it was Irish terrorism or whether it's a thug that whacks an old lady over the head.\" Livingstone, attempting to clarify his comments, January 2000 On depression \"I've had very few depressions in my life, but they follow a pattern, and I look and feel awful for a few months. One such depression was in 1979, when I didn't get elected to the Commons. Another was in 1983 when the national executive committee barred me from standing in Brent East. The other was when we lost the election in 1992 \u0085 [If Tony Blair doesn't let me stand for mayor I'll] get depression with associated psoriasis, a classic stress pattern.\" Livingstone in the New Statesman, 1999 Frank Dobson is \"clinically depressed\". What Livingstone is alleged to have said to reporters, November 1999",

      "bodyText": "Leaders of the country's largest Chinese community yesterday complained of a rising tide of racial attacks and harassment that go unpunished by the police. A delegation organised by National Civil Rights Movement, met representatives of the Metropolitan police's race and violent crime task force at Scotland Yard to express fears from London's 60,000-strong Chinese that racially motivated crimes against the community were on the increase. They also said confidence in the police had been eroded. The NCRM handed over details of 15 cases of alleged racial violence and abuse against Chinese restauraters and other individuals in London. In one case, the mother of the owner of a Chinese take-away was attacked. In another, police are accused of failing to take any action after a man who was left permanently disabled following an attack on his shop. In other incidents, customers refused to pay their bills, and subjected restaurant staff to racist abuse and physical violence. The NCRM is also involved in a further eight incidents outside London. The delegation told the meeting that members of the Chinese community were victims of racial stereotyping by the police, and that in many cases the victims of racist crime had found themselves being arrested instead of the offenders. The NCRM told of cases where Chinese waiters who fought off racially motivated attacks had found themselves arrested and charged. It alleged that the Met's Chinese unit, which operates from Charing Cross police station, central London, often assumed that any crime involving a person of Chinese descent was related to Triad gangs. \"This is such a crude stereotyping of a racial group. We have asked the police to delink the so-called Triad wars from racial attacks, and they said they would do that,\" said Suresh Grover, chairman of the NCRM. Jeff Brathwaite, deputy director of the violent crime task force told the delegation that the Met would respond to the allegations within a week and that an audit of attacks against people of Chinese descent across London would be completed within a fortnight. Mr Grover said the promise to review cases from across the capital was effectively an admission that the Met had no idea of the scale of racist crime against the Chinese community. \"The Macpherson report is relevant to all communities and police procedure should be to protect the victims of crime and punish the perpetrators - but it has not been the case in the Chinese community,\" he said. Jabez Lam, a project worker at the NCRM and a community leader in Chinatown, who attended the meeting, said: \"This is the beginning of a long journey. \"The response from the police was positive. The proof of their resolve will come when we see how they react in the future.\" A Met spokesman said the force was grateful for the opportunity to address the concerns of the capital's Chinese community. Clash with racist gang Fu Yon Lam and his fellow waiters at the New Diamond restaurant in central London are used to dealing with drunks who refuse to pay, verbal abuse, and occasional acts of vandalism. Shortly before last Christmas, however, a violent clash with a white racist gang left Mr Lam, 46, in hospital, and four other waiters in police custody. Mr Lam says the attackers, eight men who smashed crockery and screamed racist abuse, were ignored by the police and were not charged. \"I was smashed on the head. Then someone came at me while I was dizzy and I put my hand out to protect myself - the tendon in my hand was severed.\" The waiters were held for 21 hours before being released. The gang visited the police by appointment to give statements.",

Leeds are still pressing for the game to be played at Elland Road, and earlier today chairman Peter Ridsdale warned they might pull out of the competition if Uefa move the match to a neutral ground.</p> <p>Ridsdale also said that several of his players received death threats in their hotel rooms after Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight were murdered. \"The team were in no fit mental state to play the first tie,\" said Ridsdale. \"They were understandably shaken up by, among other things, receiving death threat phone-calls to their rooms in the early hours of the morning even though we had asked for no calls to be put through.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Turkish MP Rasim Zaimoglu said he wants go to Leeds for the game and urged the entire Turkish parliament to do the same.

Meanwhile Chris Sutto'n remains in situ. Is there no justice?!?</p> <p>According to This Is London, V-necked Vialli wants to improve the shape of his team by drafting in two wingers - Stephane Dalmat of Marseille and Internazionale's \u00a38m-rated Javier Zanetti.

Because after yesterday's sacking of Hansie Cronje only two of the nine captains of the Test-playing nations from the 1999 World Cup - Steve Waugh of Australia and Stephen Fleming of New Zealand - are still in charge. </p> <p>The first captain to lose his job was <strong>Alec Stewart</strong>, who paid the price for England's failure to qualify for the World Cup Super Sixes, and was replaced for the Test series against New Zealand by Nasser Hussain. Stewart was quickly followed by <strong> Arjuna Ranatunga</strong>, skipper of the other notable World Cup flops, holders Sri Lanka. Ranatunga was axed in favour of Sanath Jayasuriya, who took control last August.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's <strong> Alistair Campbell </strong> was next to go. He fell on his stump in early November, three days before Zimbabwe's return Test against South Africa in Harare; they had lost the first game, in Bloemfontein, by an innings. Andy Flower stepped in.</p> <p>In the New Year, three high-profile names departed in quick succession. <strong> Brian Lara </strong> handed in his notice following West Indies' 2-0 defeat in New Zealand, and later announced he would be taking a break from cricket (presumably to recharge his batteries for a run-fest in England this summer); Jimmy Adams took over for the successful series against Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Then, in February, <strong> Wasim Akram</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,134914,00.html\">under pressure </a>from wisden.com columnist Kamran Abbasi, stood down after Pakistan's dismal tour of Australia, and gave way to Saeed Anwar, who promptly injured himself and then told the selectors he didn't want the job back anyway; Moin Khan was ushered in. Just over a week later India's golden boy <strong> Sachin Tendulkar</strong>, similarly badgered by Abbasi, followed suit, but bizarrely delayed his moment of departure until after the impending series against South Africa. Not surprisingly, India lost. After much dithering, the chalice was passed to Sourav Ganguly.</p> <p>Which brings us to <strong> Hansie Cronje</strong>, dumped yesterday by the South African Cricket Board after he admitted accepting money for \"information and forecasting\". Shaun Pollock became the seventh - or eighth if you include Moin - new Test captain since last August.</p> <p>Steve Waugh and Stephen Fleming are believed to be safe in their jobs.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "If your name is Steve or Stephen and you come from the Antipodes, chances are you won't lose your job as Test captain. If it isn't and you don't, well, bad luck. Because after yesterday's sacking of Hansie Cronje only two of the nine captains of the Test-playing nations from the 1999 World Cup - Steve Waugh of Australia and Stephen Fleming of New Zealand - are still in charge. The first captain to lose his job was Alec Stewart, who paid the price for England's failure to qualify for the World Cup Super Sixes, and was replaced for the Test series against New Zealand by Nasser Hussain. Stewart was quickly followed by Arjuna Ranatunga, skipper of the other notable World Cup flops, holders Sri Lanka. Ranatunga was axed in favour of Sanath Jayasuriya, who took control last August. Zimbabwe's Alistair Campbell was next to go. He fell on his stump in early November, three days before Zimbabwe's return Test against South Africa in Harare; they had lost the first game, in Bloemfontein, by an innings. Andy Flower stepped in. In the New Year, three high-profile names departed in quick succession. Brian Lara handed in his notice following West Indies' 2-0 defeat in New Zealand, and later announced he would be taking a break from cricket (presumably to recharge his batteries for a run-fest in England this summer); Jimmy Adams took over for the successful series against Zimbabwe. Then, in February, Wasim Akram, under pressure from wisden.com columnist Kamran Abbasi, stood down after Pakistan's dismal tour of Australia, and gave way to Saeed Anwar, who promptly injured himself and then told the selectors he didn't want the job back anyway; Moin Khan was ushered in. Just over a week later India's golden boy Sachin Tendulkar, similarly badgered by Abbasi, followed suit, but bizarrely delayed his moment of departure until after the impending series against South Africa. Not surprisingly, India lost. After much dithering, the chalice was passed to Sourav Ganguly. Which brings us to Hansie Cronje, dumped yesterday by the South African Cricket Board after he admitted accepting money for \"information and forecasting\". Shaun Pollock became the seventh - or eighth if you include Moin - new Test captain since last August. Steve Waugh and Stephen Fleming are believed to be safe in their jobs.

Pok\u00e9mon is not just a card game, but a set of computer games, soft toys and plastic figures and a soon-to-be-released feature film, which special people will be pawing at the ground to be taken to this Easter. What differentiates Pok\u00e9mon from previous crazes, is not only the breadth of its product range, but the way in which children remain gripped by it for up to four years - a lifetime in terms of kids' fashion. Yet the reason for its success is relatively simple. Pok\u00e9mon, like trump cards, is built around the basic premise that children love sorting things. </p> <p>\"It is a passport to group activity, at an age where children are starting to get into bigger groups,\" says Dr John Richer, consultant clinical psychologist in paediatrics at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. \"There is an element of combat that appeals particularly to boys in middle childhood.

Instead of cartoon cats or Brazilian footballers, the Pok\u00e9mon are a set of 150 critters with Dungeons-and-Dragons-type names such as Kangaskhan and Magikarp. But the real difference is that they are designed for children to progress through stages of gamesmanship and ever-advancing technology. </p> <p>Leo Shirley, 8, has 50 Pok\u00e9mon cards, including his most prized asset, Ninetales, a sort of flying ferret printed on shiny paper. Shirley is not interested in Pok\u00e9mon trump tactics. He does not use the battle counters, small plastic discs with numbers on them, which accompany the packs and are placed on an opponent's cards to \"destroy\" them. Neither does he have any Pok\u00e9mon GameBoy games. What Shirley is interested in, is the act of sorting. </p> <p>\"I've got some rare ones and my friend has\" - he pauses for effect - \"Aerodactyl.\" Pok\u00e9mon was banned from Shirley's school, when a boy had his arm broken in a fight over them. \"I don't use battle counters,\" he says. \"I only have them to swap.

He is where Shirley would like to be in two years time, a big boy playing big matches in the Pok\u00e9mon league. \"We play twice a week, for about an hour each time,\" he says. Pok\u00e9mon has been banned from his school, also. \"I win a lot.\" </p> <p>\"It is a very ready means of sorting out status and power in the playground,\" says Dr Duncan McLean, a consultant psychologist at the Anna Freud Centre. \"Collecting cards gives children who might not excel by other means - football, say - a chance to advance in the hierarchy.\" </p> <p> T he cards may have an educational value, too. Children hooked on Pok\u00e9mon retain large volumes of information, much of it numerical. \"You keep score in your head,\" says James Swan. \"Sometimes you forget and have to do it on paper.\" </p> <p>Pok\u00e9mon is unlikely to make it to literacy hour, though.

I am her father.\" </p> <p>Since then life has taken an ironic twist. Dad has taken a partner of the age that I was then and the incident no longer makes me laugh. In fact, if I'm honest, I too find myself thinking, \"God, how nauseating\" whenever he speaks of the woman he says he loves, 27 years his - and 10 years my own - junior. I want him to be happy, so I find myself wondering how I - of all people - became so bloody virtuous. </p> <p>\"The adult child feeling deeply disturbed by the parent having a younger partner than them is extremely common, and can cause huge rifts in the parent-child relationship,\" says Julia Cole, a relationship therapist who sees an increasing number of such clients. </p> <p>Not that there are more fathers at it now than in the past, she says. \"Indeed, during the Victorian era, it was quite ordinary for fathers to marry a very young women if their wife died. The recent growth in clients is caused by the fact that parents and their children now tend to be far more open with each other. The fact that mothers, too, have younger lovers now is also significant.\" </p> <p>Jill Taylor, a 26-year-old whose mother has, for three years, been dating a man who was in Taylor's school class, claims the hardest part was coming to terms with \"Mum suddenly displaying characteristics that were as far removed from parenthood as could possibly be. She'd been my role model, my rock and my moral touchstone throughout my childhood, and here she was being frivolous, unpredictable and, most importantly, immature. I felt as though our roles had been reversed. I'd grown out of the kind of relationships she was indulging in and was ready to settle down. I found it unsettling, even frightening. I almost hated her.\" </p> <p>Whatever their age, children want parents to behave like parents, according to Dr Julia Berryman, senior lecturer in psychology at Leicester University. \"You often hear mothers proudly claiming they are like a sister to their child, but in my experience that child - even when adult - doesn't like it. For the same reason that we don't want our par ents dancing at the school disco when we're teenagers, we don't want them to be involved with men of our age when we're older.\" </p> <p>Then there's the inevitable embarrassment. My dad spent the millennium holiday snowboarding with the new girlfriend. I mean, pleeeease . </p> <p>Kathleen Cox, a clinical psychologist and specialist in parenting issues, explains: \"If a relationship is formed with a massive age gap, there is bound to be some kind of transformation in the endeavour to find common ground - from a change of clothes to a new taste in music. But for the child, this can feel like an invasion, a sense of 'this is what my age group is supposed to be doing'.\" </p> <p>Frequently, an attempt to recapture lost youth is exactly what these \"American Beauty syndrome\" relationships are about. But the odds are stacked against success. It may be endearing at first that your partner has never heard of the Stone Roses, or, conversely, was not even born when you were at Woodstock, but this can soon turn to exasperation. </p> <p>\"I think knowing that they'll never last is the reason that I get so upset about my father's young things,\" says Lorna Mitchell, a 40-year-old whose father's latest is 29. For others, the \"trophy\" girlfriends are acceptable. It's the \"serious\" ones that are dangerous. Sonya Adwell, a 27-year-old whose father has always had young lovers, says: \"I didn't grow up with Dad. He and Mum got divorced when I was a baby. He then married another woman who I don't like and has had a string of young girlfriends. In a funny sort of way, it makes me feel important, because it proves what he has always said to me - that I'm the only woman in his life who really matters.\" </p> <p>Adwell's take on the subject may be different because of the very fact that she didn't grow up with her father. Cole says: \"It's normal for those of us who were brought up by our parents to feel quite sick at the thought of them having sex. If one of them shacks up with someone youthful, it somehow accentuates that, yes, they do have sex.\" </p> <p>For some, the situation can even feel incestuous. \"My clients don't tend to use that word,\" says Cole. \"But they'll say things such as, 'It could have been one of my best friends. It could have been me.' It is very disturbing. The adult part of you wants to be happy for your parent but the child part of you thinks 'Ugh'.\" </p> <p>Timing is also important. Imagine you are 23 and your 50-year-old father runs off with a 17-year-old girl just after he has divorced. It's what happened to Richard Hogan, now 32. \"Seventeen is so young,\" he says. \"It seemed ridiculous for my dad to have someone living with him who had Wham! posters on the wall, such a short time after he'd been with my mum. I couldn't imagine what she saw in him. I could only assume she was a gold-digger. Even now I have my suspicions.\" </p> <p>One of Hogan's biggest problems has been how to relate to his new \"mother\". \"It wasn't appropriate to communicate with her as a stepparent but nor did it seem right to talk to her like a friend or a little sister. I felt great pressure about that. Would it show that I couldn't bear what she stood for?\" </p> <p>And that is the heart of the matter. For most grown-up children whose parents have had a cross-generational relationship, what really matters is what the new partner symbolises, rather than whether he or she is a nice person or good for your parent. At worst, this is selfish and judgmental. At best, it is simply human nature. </p> <p> Some of the names have been changed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>One meal rarely changes your life - unless it's the one where you realise that your child is starving herself. When Martha Furniss sat down to a dinner of salad and brown bread with her 19-year-old daughter Amy, she asked her why she would only eat salad. Amy replied \"I can't eat\", over and over again. </p> <p>\"I realised only then,\" Furniss says. \"Her trousers looked very baggy. And then she stopped washing and the light went out of her eyes.\" That meal was eight years ago. Since then, Amy, now 26, has spent time in psychiatric units and private clinics, seen a clinical psychologist and almost lost her life - twice. She is 6ft tall, but at one time she weighed only 6st. She lives at home and still has anorexia. </p> <p>Her father Edward says he feels her upbringing was happy, but can't help dwelling on the month Amy refused to eat when she was 11. \"Looking back,\" he says, \"it was a herald of what was to come.\" He is angry, too. \"Body image, body image,\" he says. \"We can't get away from it.\" </p> <p>Such sentiments have this week been echoed by Tessa Jowell, the minister for women, who has invited representatives of a modelling agency, an editor of a teenage girls' magazine and the writer Susie Orbach to a Downing Street summit in June with the aim of tackling the pressure young women feel to conform to images of the thin ideal. The initiative, while bringing the government accusations of running a nanny state, does make very public an illness that for parents of sufferers has for so long been a very private problem. </p> <p>Support for parents of people with eating disorder is just beginning to be recognised as crucial to their child's recovery - unless, that is, family abuse is one of the causes of the illness. Alcoholism, gambling and drugs are widely recognised as having a direct effect on parents or carers, and a network of support is available. But there is no formal equivalent of Alcoholics or Gamblers Anonymous for parents of anorexia and bulimia suffers, just a few self-help groups scattered around the country. The Centre For Eating Disorders in London, in response to the increasing number of calls it has received from grandparents and parents of young sufferers, has set up an advice programme geared to children and is in the process of setting up a support group for parents. </p> <p>Including parents in the process of counselling is not in order to blame them, but to make them aware that building self-esteem is central to their child's recovery, says Gilly Green, a psychotherapist at the centre. \"The wider social context, where thinness is best, is extremely influential,\" she says. \"But what goes on at home is also very important, particularly the feedback that parents give their children about how they look.\" </p> <p>As celebrity weight-watching becomes a spectator sport, the pressure to conform to a physical ideal can crush even the most confident adult. For children, the pressure is compounded by peers and their developing, fragile sense of self that is often dependent on family example. </p> <p>Green argues that children take mental photographs of their parents. \"Little girls watch what mummy does with her hair, her clothes and her attitude to food,\" she says. \"Watching parents skip meals, eating only certain foods and eating alone establishes a role model.\" </p> <p>Ninety per cent of those suffering from eating disorders are women, and the relationship between a mother's eating patterns and her daughter's is well researched. Three children out of every five whose mothers are bulimic show evidence of an eating disorder. Research also shows that mothers of bulimics tend to weigh less than those of girls without eating disorders and, typically, are much more critical of their daughters. </p> <p>Fathers, by comparison, have little effect on their daughters. Males make up 10% of those with eating disorders, but generally the cause is less connected to a son's emulation of his father's eating habits than feeling that he has failed in the public arena. \"In a boy it seems to be rooted more in peer-group pressure,\" says Keith Chopping, a practitioner in eating disorders. \"He wants to have the body of a favourite athlete or may be responding to peers who say he's too fat to play games. </p> <p>\"If you ask a mixed classroom of young adolescents to name what's wrong with them, boys say they're not good at maths, football or games, while girls say, 'My neck, my arms, my thighs, my breasts.'\" </p> <p>This emphasis on a girl's appearance begins, says Chopping, from the year dot. Children most susceptible to developing an eating disorder are obedient and compliant, eager to please both parents and peers. Although the most vulnerable age is between 15 and 25 - peaking from 14 to 18 - building a child's sense of physical self-esteem needs to start from birth. But what can parents do to let their children know that they are valued for more than the sum of their body parts, when there is a barrage of messages saying little else? </p> <p>\"Encourage your child to think about their character rather than what they look like,\" Chopping says. \"Tell your daughter that we're in a blip and the ideal woman hasn't always looked like this. Encourage expression of feelings about the body.\" </p> <p>Chopping also advises parents not to encourage a child who is unhappy with their body to go on a diet. Equally, forcing a child - even a toddler - to eat everything on their plate should be avoided. There is no point in making threats about the consequences of not eating. \"If food becomes about power it's no longer a friend but an invasion,\" he says. </p> <p>If you do think there is a problem, trust your instincts and be insistent when asking for help. Warning signs for parents worried about their child's relationship to food are a lack of concentration, fainting, collapsing, wearing baggy clothes and over-exercising. Yet many parents who realise that their child is ill have trouble convincing their GP of the seriousness of the problem. </p> <p>Elsie Watchman's 15-year-old daughter Kate began to show signs of an eating disorder two years ago. She ate less and less and exercised furiously until, Watchman says, \"she wouldn't keep still and jigged about on the spot\". The family did not manage to get help until Kate hit 7st and \"looked horrendous\". </p> <p>Now, Kate's weight is stable and Watchman feels positive about her recovery. Every week Kate talks to a counsellor in London on the phone and every few months travels the 100 miles to the capital for counselling. Watchman decided the trip was worthwhile after the psychiatrist Kate was referred to locally \"implied my daughter was naughty and stupid and that I was letting her rule my life\". She was told Kate would \"pull herself together\" but, she says, \"I know my own, and I knew that it had gone beyond that\".</p>",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday probation services got some good news. At the annual meeting of the chief officers' association (Acop), the management of the 54 services in England and Wales were able to hear how they had turned around a crucial area of probation work with an 18% jump in performance in six months. The improvement relates not just to the service's sternest key performance indicator (KPI), but is also one that carries political significance. </p> <p>The subject is enforcement. This is the unsentimental edge to community supervision that brings down a sanction on an offender who can't or won't adhere to the terms of their court order or the conditions of their release from prison. </p> <p>Enforcement is for probation what waiting lists are for hospitals, detection rates are for the police and exam results are for schools. And like police, doctors and teachers, probation staff have had their fair share of public berating from the secretary of state and wagging ministerial fingers. No one expects offenders to be given too many chances, nor likes the idea that a court order could be flouted. The same sentiments are heard from parliament, only much louder. </p> <p>For probation, the need to enforce has grown as the service has changed. With a caseload of more serious and persistent offenders, protecting the public is now a primary focus.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday probation services got some good news. At the annual meeting of the chief officers' association (Acop), the management of the 54 services in England and Wales were able to hear how they had turned around a crucial area of probation work with an 18% jump in performance in six months. The improvement relates not just to the service's sternest key performance indicator (KPI), but is also one that carries political significance. The subject is enforcement. This is the unsentimental edge to community supervision that brings down a sanction on an offender who can't or won't adhere to the terms of their court order or the conditions of their release from prison. Enforcement is for probation what waiting lists are for hospitals, detection rates are for the police and exam results are for schools. And like police, doctors and teachers, probation staff have had their fair share of public berating from the secretary of state and wagging ministerial fingers. No one expects offenders to be given too many chances, nor likes the idea that a court order could be flouted. The same sentiments are heard from parliament, only much louder. For probation, the need to enforce has grown as the service has changed. With a caseload of more serious and persistent offenders, protecting the public is now a primary focus. This guides practice, like swift recall to prison. Then there has been the drive to make sure all probation work is based on evidence of success - the initiative known as \"What Works\". This quiet revolution has also meant that evidence of effectiveness in reducing reoffending is the yardstick for designing programmes and supervision arrangements. In this, compliance, the flipside of breach, applies. Court orders will not have any effect on offending if offenders do not turn up to programmes. Then there is need to capture public and sentencer confidence by shedding the hackneyed \"soft option\" tag, demonstrating that there is a line that offenders cannot cross without consequences. In May last year a plan was conceived and adopted by Acop to address probation's achilles heel of enforcement performance.

One of the women standing next to her in the queue nudged her friend and pointed at the brand new block of council flats across the road. \"Only posh people are allowed to live there,\" she proclaimed. Olga held her tongue. </p> <p>She had just moved into a flat on the seventh floor of Coronation Court, the first high-rise block in the city and one of the first in the country. And she loved it. She loved having electricity, running water and a bathroom with flush toilet - very different from the gas-lit terraced house in inner-city Walton where she'd been living since 1949 with her husband, his father and grandmother. </p> <p>The two women in the bus queue raised their eyes towards the top floor and one inquired of the other: \"How do they get the coal up there?\" Olga could take no more. \"Excuse me,\" she butted in. \"We have central heating.\" </p> <p>The stunned silence that greeted this statement couldn't have been more pronounced had she claimed to have a wall-mounted jukebox or a teak-veneered cocktail cabinet. Central heating!

One of the women standing next to her in the queue nudged her friend and pointed at the brand new block of council flats across the road. \"Only posh people are allowed to live there,\" she proclaimed. Olga held her tongue. She had just moved into a flat on the seventh floor of Coronation Court, the first high-rise block in the city and one of the first in the country. And she loved it. She loved having electricity, running water and a bathroom with flush toilet - very different from the gas-lit terraced house in inner-city Walton where she'd been living since 1949 with her husband, his father and grandmother. The two women in the bus queue raised their eyes towards the top floor and one inquired of the other: \"How do they get the coal up there?\" Olga could take no more. \"Excuse me,\" she butted in. \"We have central heating.\" The stunned silence that greeted this statement couldn't have been more pronounced had she claimed to have a wall-mounted jukebox or a teak-veneered cocktail cabinet. Central heating! Whatever next? Fast-forward 44 years and Olga, now 74, is reminiscing in the hairdressing salon on the eighth floor of Coronation Court, which houses one of the block's three computer terminals.

Blocked by police from reaching the presidential palace, and blanketed by an evil fog of traffic fumes, a few hundred Filipinos from peasant farms and NGO movements lie in the middle of the road - a \"die-in\", they say, to symbolise their struggle for land reform and food. </p> <p>Inside the palace, as guests of President Estrada, the International Rice Research Institute is holding its 40th anniversary of \"scientific effort combating poverty and hunger around the world\". It is the object of the protesters' scorn. </p> <p>The IRRI has some of the world's leading rice scientists, and was the organisation that developed high-yielding crops for the \"green revolution\" of the 1960s and 1970s. But it is deeply unpopular these days at the grassroots. Rafael Mariano, leader of the powerful KMP peasant movement, charges the IRRI with locking rice farmers into dependency on the market. \"Rice is a political crop,\" he says. \"He who controls the production and distribution of rice has an invaluable weapon to control the whole of Asia.\" </p> <p>The local NGO, Masipag Farmer-Scientist Alliance, takes the charge further, saying that the expensive chemical inputs required by the IRRI's rice varieties have forced farmers into a cycle of debt, and over the years depleted the soil, poisoned workers and caused massive loss of on-farm diversity. They argue that the costs of these inputs actually outweigh the outputs of increased yields. </p> <p>Gurdev Khush, head of IRRI's plant breeding, genetics and biochemistry division, predicts that the current world rice output of 590m tonnes will have to increase by 50%, using less land and less water, to feed Asia's growing population over the coming decades. He is working on developing a high-yielding \"super rice\" that could improve yields by 50% to meet that need through conventional breeding. </p> <p>But the great debate in the Philippines these past two weeks has been over GM rice. The IRRI's director general, Ronald Cantrell, believes that GM is the way forward, and stated that \"for the [developed] countries to say 'no' to biotechnology is criminal\". The institute begins its first GM rice field trials in the next few months. </p> <p>The previous week, the world's leading rice biotechnologists had gathered at the IRRI Filipino HQ for a conference. It was here that Maurice Ku, of Washington State University, announced that he had developed a GM rice that could boost yields by 35% by inserting maize genes. Ku said the yields of the new GM rice approach targets the IRRI says are needed to feed the rising population in Asia over the next 20 years. </p> <p>But the news had not filtered out into the paddy fields. Leopoldo Guilaran has been farming three acres of rice and corn on the Philippine island of Negros for over 20 years. When told about the new rice, he said: \"We don't need this unproven genetic engineering technology or these seeds. The average production of a rice field here is 2.2 tonnes per hectare. Increasing that up to only 3.5 tonnes per hectare would make the Philippines self-sufficient in rice. </p> <p>\"But what keeps the farmers poor is that they don't have land or access to capital. A farmer's monthly wages barely cover half a month's living expenses.\" </p> <p>The IRRI agrees that land reform is vital, but says it is unlikely and, therefore, GM is the best option. But where the scientists see GM as a technological issue, the Filipino farmers see it as life or death. Millions of farmers in the Philippines are tenant farmers and, on average, they hand over 60-70% of their harvest to their landlord as rent. The landlord offers credit to the tenant to buy the required seed and chemical inputs from him and he buys the rice from the tenant. </p> <p>Guilaran, speaking for other farmers at Masipag, says: \"Even if the scientists invented a rice that could yield 20 tonnes per hectare, it wouldn't make a difference to the farmer who grows it. If he doesn't own the land it grows on, he still won't be able to afford to feed his family.\" </p> <p>The Ibon Foundation, a Filipino indigenous rights group, says that, as a result of the landlords and contract growing system, many of the peasant farmers face cycles of crippling debt and poverty. Often the destitute farmers turn to armed struggles for land. There are currently 80 pockets around the country. </p> <p>Emmanual Yap, leader of Masipag, fears that GM rice will create the same cycle of dependency, control and environmental depletion. He says: \"A rice seed engineered to increase yields, even using increased photosynthesis efficiency, will still require more from the soil and thus require bought inputs. It's a simple input-output equation.\" </p> <p>The GM companies prefer to talk about developing \"high value\" crops, which usually refers to rice seed that only reproduces if the farmer applies a chemical bought from the company. For rice farmers, who currently save and replant their seed, this is their worst fear about GM. </p> <p>Yap says: \"They [the companies] will face a big challenge by the Filipino farmers. Rice is basic food- it is their life. This will really trigger off a protest from people, because it will marginalise the small farmers even more.\"</p>",

Candidates cannot be regarded as serious if they promise more buses, better trains, less pollution and less congestion but don't at the same time support the key policy needed to achieve those aims. There needs to be a strong block of Greens on the 25-member London assembly, to ensure that these and other policies for the greening of London can go ahead. Greens will be working for: \u0095 A spatial development strategy which restores the historic pattern of London as a network of 300 urban villages, strengthening local communities and reducing people's overall need to travel; \u0095 The scrapping of environmentally destructive and traffic generating schemes, such as Heathrow's Terminal 5 and the proposed developments on Crystal Palace Park and Rainham Marshes; \u0095 The appointment of a London animal rights officer; \u0095 A \"zero waste agency\" to promote waste reduction, re-use and recycling; \u0095 A ban on the growing of GM crops in the Greater London area; \u0095 An end to the transport of nuclear waste through London; \u0095 An economic development strategy which supports strong local economies and makes London less reliant on the global marketplace which is causing so much damage to the global environment and failing to provide Londoners with the broad range of opportunities they need.",

What a pity the reality is such a cock-up. </p> <p>People and honeybees have a long history together. Palaeolithic wall paintings in Spain bear witness to the human lust for sweetness consummated only by robbing bees of the fruits of their magical industry. Bees may be some of the first creatures to have been domesticated and yet there is still something mysteriously wild about them. We treated them with respect not just because of their stings but because they would up sticks and leave us if we didn't. But there is another, more essential kind of respect for nature itself, which we dishonour at our peril. </p> <p>Bees pollinate our crops, their ecology is essential to the whole flowering world, they provide us with honey and wax, they fascinate us. But what do they get out of it? They get a life-sucking parasitic mite, Varroa jacobsonii. The spread of Varroa in honeybee hives around the world is a consequence of globalisation, free trade, the commodification of nature and a reneging on our ancient pact with the bees. </p> <p>There are around 35,000 beekeepers in Britain, most of them hobbiests, but between them they keep up to 200,000 colonies, each containing between 5,000 and 80,000 bees. Each colony can produce 100 lbs of honey which sells, at farm-gate prices, at \u00a32.50 per lb. This does not include the 400 wholly professional bee farmers in Britain. Those beekeepers who have not got Varroa in their colonies soon will have. Its spread, like that of Dutch elm disease in the 70s, is inexorable. </p> <p>Varroa came from the far east, where it was a parasite on the Asiatic race of honeybee. This bee had co-evolved with Varroa and developed ways of coping with it. Asian countries switched their honey industry from their native, mite-resistant Apis cerana to the more productive European honeybee Apis mellifera; by the 1950s Varroa had switched too. </p> <p>The European bee was defenceless against Varroa and colonies were decimated. Thanks to the international trade in bees, Varroa spread through Apis mellifera-dominated beekeeping around the world and arrived in Britain in 1992. Since then it has spread through apiaries and feral colonies throughout England and Wales and is currently heading north into Scotland. </p> <p>Steve Balogh, a beekeeper and interpreter, recently returned from China, where he met leading Chinese bee scientists who have been tackling their own Varroa problem. \"Since the 1960s the Chinese had been working on a control for Varroa which did not hurt the bees as well,\" Balogh says. \"In the 1970s they came up with a successful treatment, but the mites began to show signs of resistance and fallback measures were needed.\" </p> <p> In the 1980s, Wei Hua Zhen came up with a new preparation and did field trials. Since 1996, she has saved 10,000 hives using this. \"There are problems with intellectual property rights and the Chinese won't say what the preparation is made of, but it's a fraction of the price we have to pay for Varroa control in Britain. What will happen when Varroa becomes resistant to chemicals in the west, as is happening in Germany and France?\" </p> <p>Medwin Bew, director of the National Bee Unit at Maff's Central Science Laboratories in York, is sceptical about the Chinese solutions and happy with the regulations and treatments currently in use; even though only two of the dozen control methods used in Europe are permitted in the UK. </p> <p>\"I'm optimistic about the future,\" says Bew. \"Beekeepers are resiliant and won't give up - the bees mean too much to us. Varroa may be a pain in the neck but it can be managed with enough resources and hard work.\" </p> <p>This is a view shared by Michael Badger, president of the British Beekeepers Association who is also optimistic and thinks the existing controls are sufficient. Badger says: \"I've kept bees for 50 years and won't let Varroa bother me: new people coming in to beekeeping just accept Varroa as part of the business.\" </p> <p>This attitude angers beekeepers like Steve Balogh. \"The authorities have been no kind of help whatever,\" says Balogh. </p> <p>Either their regulations get amended or they'll have ruled bees out of existence altogether.\" </p> <p> The lessons learned from the ancient relationship between people and bees have not entirely been lost and have even found a new lease of life in some of the poorest countries. </p> <p>The charity Bees for Development has been supporting sustainable beekeeping projects around the world since 1993, encouraging the use of local strains of honeybee, local materials for hives and the protection of the local environment where bees forage. </p> <p>They even have beekeeping projects where the bees forage on land riddled with landmines; people make a sustainable living from land they cannot even tread on. </p> <p>\"When Varroa becomes a problem for people in very poor communities it's a disaster, because they can't afford the chemicals used tocontrol it,\" says Helen Jackson, of Bees for Development. \"It's so sad the bees have been dealt an awful blow by spreading the mite.\" </p> <p>So, the Varroa mites plague the bees because people have cocked up natural processes to get more honey from the bees and the pharmaceutical companies exploit the beekeepers who depend on them to control the mites.

So why do only 11% of the electorate turn out to vote for local government in the wards dominated by council housing? And why do 60% of tenants pay little or no rent, giving them no leverage on their landlord? No other European country runs housing for low income people this way. So why do we? </p> <p>Two devastating world wars and the oldest industrial slums in the world led to the vast clearances of inner Victorian terraces and the construction of 10,000 large, difficult to manage council estates. No private body could take on a building programme on this scale, so we created a top-heavy, state-run, bureaucratic housing machine. </p> <p>As a result, councils are supposed to offer a \"decent home\" at an affordable price to anyone in proven need. But do they? Why is one in 10 council homes hard to let even in inner London? Why are councils knocking down estates that they can no longer let or manage, while similar housing provided by other landlords lasts many generations? </p> <p>Two problems beset council housing - the stock itself, and the way it is run. The stock is in large clumps of uniform housing with many unguarded, unsupervised and unused areas. It has a strong public stamp and too often a run down air that signifies lack of control or care. The basics - rubbish, graffiti, litter, security, repairs - have lower priority than the politics. Because residents do not generally vote for their council landlords, their voice is usually unheard. </p> <p>The second problem is more difficult still. To become a council tenant, you queue, not knowing what home you will get or when or where. You can only choose to live near family or friends, to move when your home becomes too small or when you can afford an extra room, if you will accept the least popular estates. Thus we build social ghettos. Up to 19 out of 20 council offers are refused because housing is \"allocated according to need\", but not your needs. Hard pressed officials obey the strict rules that their local political bosses make in order to be \"fair\". They have turned a variable and personalised need into a rule-bound system to cope with the sheer volume of people and property - 300,000 new council lettings a year in England. People are voting with their feet. </p> <p>Thus property and people problems are breaking up many estate communities. The ties, loyalties and links that help us to fit in and co-operate are disintegrating. Council housing, worth around \u00a3200bn, has become a political liability. At the very first opportunity, starting in 1986, local councils firmly took the initiative, and began to transfer their stock to newly created landlords with residents on the boards. Transfers attract large capital receipts, private loans to improve the homes and an overwhelming vote from tenants for more \"street level\" services. </p> <p>For the first time tenants have a chance to vote directly for their future. About 70% of tenants turn out to vote - in sharp contrast with council elections. Nine out of 10 ballots have gone in favour of transfer. Of the 128 successful transfers, around 70% voted yes. It is the customer-orientated service and the prospect of solid repair that win support. </p> <p>So far 102 local authorities have transferred nearly half a million homes. Most transfers involve around 5,000 homes. But the game is changing. In the last three years, around 50 large, run-down estates in cities, where social conditions are more extreme, have transferred to local housing companies. The new companies are local, small-scale, hands-on and strongly community focused. They offer a unique chance to change conditions on the ground. </p> <p>At least 300,000 homes are in the pipeline this year, representing a landslide change in the attitude of \"municipal fiefdoms\". The government may see the total transfer of all council homes by 2010, planned or not. </p> <p>But big is not beautiful. Birmingham and Glasgow are both planning to transfer all their stock, nearly 100,000 homes each, in one big lump. Large-scale demolitions are built in. Both cities and the government will have a fight on their hands under the present proposals.

City leaders have so far rejected this successful model in favour of a city-wide trust, with the same stamp of gigantism and control as its council predecessor. </p> <p>Birmingham also plans \"a municipal housing trust\" looking remarkably like the city council, bypassing the active housing associations engaged at community level. Funders may prefer less clumsy, more manageable, bite-sized bodies where innovation can drive a fresh start. </p> <p>Councils have a vital political job, brokering the interests of complex and changing communities, ensuring basic order and good public services so that we can get on with our lives.

He now faces financial ruin after seeing his credibility ripped to shreds.</p> <p>Playing down Mr Irving's claims of support, Professor Lipstadt said: \"You have to treat whatever he says with a tremendous grain of salt and a tremendous question mark. So I am not so worried about how many 'hits' he says he has got.\"</p> <p>Despite his devastating courtroom defeat, Mr Irving insisted he did not regret his libel action. \"I have no regrets. It's been the most exhausting phase of my life but I put up a good fight,\" he told the Times. \"They wanted a scrap, so I gave them one.\"</p> <p>Judge Charles Gray ruled that Prof Lipstadt was justified in branding Mr Irving a \"Holocaust denier\" and an associate of right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism.

      "bodyText": "An unrepentant David Irving today said he had received hundreds of supportive emails after suffering a humiliating high court libel defeat in which he was branded a racist. \"Over the last 24 hours or so since the judgment came out, I have had 322 emails from all over the world - I was up to 4am reading through them - from people who have read my books and saying: 'What on earth is going on here, Mr Irving?\"' Mr Irving spoke one day after his libel action against Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books ended ignominiously with the judge calling him an anti-Semite. He now faces financial ruin after seeing his credibility ripped to shreds. Playing down Mr Irving's claims of support, Professor Lipstadt said: \"You have to treat whatever he says with a tremendous grain of salt and a tremendous question mark. So I am not so worried about how many 'hits' he says he has got.\" Despite his devastating courtroom defeat, Mr Irving insisted he did not regret his libel action. \"I have no regrets. It's been the most exhausting phase of my life but I put up a good fight,\" he told the Times. \"They wanted a scrap, so I gave them one.\" Judge Charles Gray ruled that Prof Lipstadt was justified in branding Mr Irving a \"Holocaust denier\" and an associate of right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism. Mr Irving now faces a ruinous \u00a32m legal bill. Penguin, owned by the Pearson media group, said it would \"resolutely pursue the costs\" incurred in their defence. But Mr Irving has said he simply did not have the money. \"I have no doubt [the defendants] would drive me to bankruptcy,\" he said.

The statistics are a relief to David Blunkett, the education secretary, who said that since the election, 300,000 children had benefited from smaller infant classes. He also announced a further \u00a3175m for cutting classes during the next year. The government has set a target of removing oversize classes for five, six and seven-year-olds completely by 2002. For the first time since the government announced it intended to remove oversized classes in primary schools, the average class size for older primary children has fallen marginally too, from 28.4 in January 1999 to 28.3. This January, there were 22,000 fewer eight to 11-year-old children in classes of over 30 than a year ago. Mr Blunkett said today that the drop \"gives the lie to the claim that lower infant class sizes are at the expense of older primary pupils\". Today's statistics show the number of infants in classes of over 30 halved from 356,586 in January 1999 to 177,020 this January. Announcing the details today, Mr Blunkett also allocated a further \u00a3175 million for the year 2000/01 to continue the class size campaign. By this September, Mr Blunkett said he expected there would be only around 50,000 infants in classes of more than 30, and none by September 2001. In addition to smaller classes, an extra 20,000 teaching assistants were being employed, bringing the overall adult-child ratio in primary schools down from 19.5 last January to 19.0 this year, and down from 22.5 to 21.7 for eight to 11-year-olds.

It quoted the words of a young boy to his hero, Joe Jackson, one of the eight players involved in throwing the game. \"Say it ain't so, Joe\" remains a powerful expression of Innocence Lost, akin, said the Guardian, to the exposure of Cronje \"as a liar\". </p> <p>Mike Walters of the <strong> Mirror </strong> painted the bigger picture, lamenting, \"It will be remembered as the day cricket lost its soul.\" <strong> The Sun's </strong> John Etheridge was equally apocalyptic. \"Hansie Cronje's reputation as a human being of honesty and integrity has fallen apart, in just 100 hours,\" he wailed. \"It is one of the most anguished and damaging centuries in the game's history.\"</p> <p>Mike Selvey, the <strong> Guardian's </strong> cricket correspondent, also began by implying that the game could never be the same again. \"With the sacking of Hansie Cronje in South Africa yesterday, not just his reputation but that of cricket as a metaphor for all that is fair and true lies in tatters.\" Selvey went on, \"Cricket has had its controversies...But nothing if all the allegations are proved, to rank with this.\"</p> <p>In the <strong> Independent</strong>, Derek Pringle was one of many to ask the questions, \"if a God-fearing man like Cronje can be tempted, who else is in the bookies' thrall?\", and \"why did a seemingly intelligent man, who apparently wanted for little financially or spiritually, risk all for such a modest sum?\" Looking at the wider implications, Pringle noted that \"people are reexamining England's victory in the Centurion Test, where Cronje set England a generous run-chase, after rain had appeared to have produced a certain draw.\" </p> <p>Writing in the Comment &amp; Analysis pages of the <strong> Guardian</strong>, Matthew Engel expressed surprise that Cronje was involved, but was completely underwhelmed by the news that cricket is more tainted than most people thought: \"only a cricket administrator could have doubted that someone was going to be exposed sooner or later.\" The tone of Engel's piece was reminiscent of the broadsides against the game's authorities that made his editor's notes in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack such compulsive reading. \"It's a morass\", he wrote today, \"and cricket is in up to its neck while pretending that its big toe is just getting a little mucky.\"</p> <p>Peter Johnson of the <strong> Mail </strong> took a similar line. \"Now the pretence is over,\" he thundered. \"The downfall of Hansie Cronje leaves nowhere for the authorities to hide.\" His attack on the inactivity of the ICC was backed up by claims in the <strong> Independent</strong> by the former South African Test cricketer and current coach of Nottinghamshire Clive Rice that bribery and blackmail are rife in the world of cricket. Rice described the betting situation as \"a festering sore.\" </p> <p>But in the <strong> Telegraph</strong>, ex-Australian captain Ian Chappell pointed out that instances of foul play on the field were often hard to detect. \"You could employ a panel of Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers and Clyde Walcott at a game and I would defy them to detect a guy losing his wicket on purpose. There is simply no way you can prove it.\" Chappell added, \"I commentated throughout the series in question [India v South Africa], and did not notice anything suspicious.\"</p> <p>In the <strong> Times</strong>, Christopher Martin-Jenkins was one of the few not to express unreserved horror that a man of Cronje's religious background could have stooped so low. \"It is not being wise after the event to say that there was always room for doubt about Cronje's stature as an exemplary and God-fearing leader of men,\" explained CMJ, \"not least because of the sledging of South Africa's opponents on the field, which he did rather more than merely condone.\" But CMJ is nothing if not fair: \"In his immediate defence it may be said that the phone call that Cronje made to Dr Ali Bacher in the darkest hour of the night, admitting his guilt up to a point, was the sign of a tormented soul wishing to make a clean breast of things rather than the reaction of one to whom wrongdoing was a habit.\"</p> <p>In the <strong> Mail</strong>, Mike Dickson provided a fascinating insight into the changing attitude of Cronje over the last two years. \"A man whose faith eschews the pursuit of material wealth has been found to be among the most vulnerable and, according to some who know him best, that can be traced back two years.\" The writing, it seems, may have been on the wall a while ago, in what Dickson called the \"apparent elevation of Mammon over God.\" But Jim Holden of the <strong> Express </strong> maintained that Cronje's religious convictions never left him, saying that he \"confessed his sporting sins to a church minister\" before revealing all to Dr Ali Bacher.</p> <p>Simon Hughes writing in the <strong> Telegraph </strong> did his best to follow what passed as Cronje's reasoning. \"The top nations play a one-day match on average every 10 days (Mark Waugh, for example, played 36 last year) so it is hardly surprising if occasionally their desire and commitment appear to slip.

If forensic scientists can prove that the knife and the bar, which were found by the new owners of the house when they were digging up the patio, were the murder weapons, detectives at Scotland Yard may yet bring the killers to book. They will also receive a great deal of carping over why the garden was not searched thoroughly before - a sweep by a metal detector would have pinpointed the location. The Met might be on the verge of prosecutions - we all hope so, anyway - but there are reasons why the latest developments should be treated with a little caution. The announcement of the discovery by Scotland Yard yesterday afternoon was the latest in a series of disclosures by officers from the racial and violent crimes task force, the unit investigating the murder. They are gradually cranking up the pressure on the people they believe were behind Stephen's stabbing. Not just the suspects, but their friends and their ex-girlfriends. The yard knows the revelations will always make headline news. These are legitimate tactics. In January, there was a fresh appeal for information on the BBC Crimewatch programme. A week later, assistant commissioner John Grieve hinted he was mining a significant seam of new information. Last month, there was another Crimewatch appeal. Mr Grieve spoke of the inquiry being at a \"very, very delicate stage\". The sense of anticipation rose to new heights when three men were arrested and questioned. But within 48-hours they were released without charge on police bail. Now they have found a knife and a bar. Could either have incriminating fingerprints or DNA? Would the person who hid them not have had the sense to wipe them clean? The tests will tell us soon enough. Until then, it is too early to hope that Doreen and Neville Lawrence are about to get justice for their son.",

The Queen and Prince Philip arrived at Hillsborough Castle accompanied by the RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, and his deputy, Colin Cramphorn, amid tight security. The award of the George Cross, in recognition of the bravery of the force during 30 years of the Troubles, is only the second time it has been made for collective gallantry. The people of Malta received the honour for their courage in withstanding German bombing during the second world war. The Queen paid tribute to the \"terrible price\" paid by the RUC in its stand against terrorism. She said the award also recognised the courage of civilian officers and the armed forces. \"I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the RUC, the regular officers of all ranks, the members of the full time and the part time reserve and former members who have served so loyally over the years,\" the Queen said. \"I salute your courage and sense of duty, I admire your determination to maintain the rule of law and provide a police service during some of the most difficult times in the history of this province. \"A terrible price has ben paid for this brave and resolute stand.\" The fact that Northern Ireland was now a more peaceful and stable place to live was a tribute to the RUC, said the Queen, who said she looked forward to enmity being put aside while recognising the sacrifices of the past. Accompanying Pc Paul Slaine to receive the award were the assistant chief constable, Bill Stewart, the longest serving chief officer in the force, and Constable Susan Wright, who joined RUC on 2 April. Pc Slain's receipt of the George Cross on behalf of the RUC was intended to symbolise the sacrifices made by the force, which has lost 302 members to terrorist action. He was injured in 1992 when a remote-controlled mortar was fired at an RUC patrol in Newry. A colleague, Colleen McMurray, 34, died in hospital after the attack.

The decision to award the RUC the George Cross - at the same time as the government was preparing to implement policing reform proposals which will change the name, symbols and structure of the force - was controversial. Unionist politicians, members of the RUC and the relatives of officers killed during the Troubles are angry at the proposal to change the force's name to the Police Service for Northern Ireland in an attempt to encourage more Roman Catholics and nationalists to join. Republicans condemned the award as \"offensive\" to members of their community, who they say are not adequately represented in the force.",

The NAO report found that between 1995 and 1999 Railtrack, received \u00a3139 million in performance bonuses, despite the condition of tracks declining since April 1994, when it took over the management of track, signalling and stations on the rail network from British Rail. \"The bonus system was set in place in 1995 and it cannot be changed until April 2001,\" said Mr Winsor, who took up his post in July last year. \"But as soon as I got in I started reviewing the whole bonus system, the entire financial structure of the railway industry, and I am going to put this right,\" he told the Today programme. \"The constraints on me are such that I cannot implement these decisions until April 2001, but you can be sure that from April 2001 these nonsenses are going to be swept away.\" In a critical report, the NAO found that the number of broken rails had increased, and that Railtrack was responsible for nearly half of all delays to passenger trains. Most of these delays were the result of maintenance and renewal problems. Railtrack faces fines both this year (1999-2000) and next (2000-01) unless it meets tough new train delay reduction targets set by Mr Winsor. David Davis, chairman of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: \"Today's report shows how weak regulation has enabled Railtrack to earn substantial bonuses despite being responsible for half of delays to passenger trains and while at the same time the condition of the track is not up to 1994 levels.\" It was \"wholly unsatisfactory\" that 3% of the track was now rated as \"very poor\". Mr Davis added: \"The whole system for awarding bonuses to Railtrack for these [train-delay] reductions is flawed.\" The NAO said Mr Winsor's office of the rail regulator had had \"difficulty in establishing how far Railtrack had discharged its obligation to maintain and renew the railway network properly\". The NAO report went on: \"The information available to the ORR on the condition of Railtrack's assets remains incomplete. \"The ORR did not agree with Railtrack from the outset what work Railtrack would do in the period 1995-2001, or what would be achieved as a result of it, in terms, for example, of improved performance or asset condition.\" NAO chief Sir John Bourn said: \"The rail regulator needs to overcome the difficulties experienced up to now in monitoring Railtrack's performance and setting effective incentives. \"I therefore welcome the action he is taking to secure that Railtrack maintain, renew and improve the national railway network on which the public and industry depend.\" The NAO recommended that the ORR should: \u0095 Set out more clearly what it expected Railtrack to deliver from maintenance and renewal \u0095 Set and keep to a timetable for removing deficiencies in its information on the condition of Railtrack's assets \u0095 Ensure that key elements of the monitoring information that the ORR receives from Railtrack were independently verified \u0095 Continue to develop appropriate targets and clearly predictable incentives for Railtrack to improve its performance on punctuality, cancellations and track condition.",

In a statement released earlier today, Uefa said the delay was \"to allow Uefa to receive and fully evaluate written submissions from both sides before making a decision\". Leeds asked Uefa to ban the Turkish club's fans from the second leg at Elland Road after two Leeds fans were killed in Istanbul before last week's first leg.

But don't think April 2000 is too late to see a millennium movie - this one's for posterity. The film begins with the news announcement that, with seven days to go until the new year, a mystery virus is sweeping Taiwan: Taipei is being evacuated, the water is contaminated and will soon be cut off entirely. Plus there's trouble with the plumbing. </p> <p>While torrential rain pelts down outside, a young man (Tsai's regular star Lee Kang-Sheng) gets a visit from the plumber. The flat downstairs has water leaking through, but it won't take a second to fix. Next thing you know, the woman downstairs (Yang Kuei-Mei) not only has water gushing down her walls, but also a hole in her ceiling. She goes about her daily life, mainly occupied with stockpiling toilet paper, suffering occasional interruptions from the man upstairs: cascades of plaster and the occasional stream of vomit. She retaliates by blasting him in the eye with her aerosol. </p> <p>The situation is ripe with resonances: images of voyeurism, Freudian echoes of penetration by broom handles and umbrellas. But strange manifestations are also occurring on the corridors and stairways of the crumbling apartment block. The woman reappears in the lift as a chanteuse in red feathers, singing a swishy calypso number; she later returns with three backing singers to warn the man in her life (and here the subtitles come into their own): \"Stop calling me a tiger lady/You're not a perfect hubby/You're penniless and you're a jealous sod/What a useless fool you are.\" </p> <p>On one hand, The Hole gives us a grim depiction of social breakdown; on the other, a joyously lurid tribute to the popular 50s/60s Hong Kong chanteuse Grace Chang, whose original hits these all are. The contrast is unnerving between the light, peppy staging of the dances, and the slow, sombre treatment of the rest: long takes, hardly any dialogue, a constant sound of falling rain. But this kitchen-sink apocalypse is portrayed with poker-faced humour. In one scene, the man slips his bare leg through the hole and wobbles about uncomfortably for a bit, as if he's had it amputated. Downstairs, we see his leg dangling from the ceiling; the woman walks past, but doesn't see it. Then, just as she's about to spot it, the leg slowly, delicately extricates itself and vanishes. </p> <p>Plumbing problems have been a constant in Tsai's work since Rebels of the Neon God (1992). Leaky ceilings also featured in The River (1997), in which a young man developed a mystery illness after working as a film extra, playing a corpse floating in a river. In The Hole, body and apartment are both fatally porous, open to every ill that can seep in from the outside world - an anxiety that, Tsai has explained, has much to do with the everyday experiences of pollution and political instability in Taiwan. </p> <p>But the film also has theatrical echoes - the two flats could be settings from an absurdist playwright such as Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco or the British writer NF Simpson, whose own 1957 play The Hole had a group of characters peering into just such a mysterious cavity. As a former dramatist and stage director, this was very much the world that Tsai inhabited: the best-known of his own claustrophobic plays featured a dialogue between a man and a wardrobe. </p> <p>The Hole is rivetingly mysterious, right up to its ambivalent closing shots. Tsai Ming-Liang signs off with a note: \"In the year 2000, we are grateful that we still have Grace Chang's songs to comfort us.\" But then this is the same man who declared: \"I am a pessimist and have no optimistic thoughts about the future.\" People can always take refuge in the deathless, cheery old songs; but those songs can never do justice to, or dispel, life's horrific realities. Tsai Ming-Liang, in fact, has come remarkably close to Dennis Potter here. The Hole's message may be that every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven - well, perhaps - but it still buckets it down. </p> <p>\u0095 The Hole is at the ICA, London SW1 (0171-930 3647) from Friday till April 27.</p>",

Fred Barras, 16, a market trader from Newark, Nottinghamshire - who was on bail at the time of his death - was accompanied on the burgling trip by two men with even more convictions. Norwich crown court heard that between them they had committed 115 offences. Barras was shot in the back last August in Bleak House in the Norfolk village of Emneth Hungate. Farmer Tony Martin, 55, is accused of killing Barras at his home. He is also accused of attempting to murder and unlawfully wounding Brendan Fearon, 30, another burglar, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Martin has denied these charges and another charge of possessing a firearm and ammunition with intent to injure life. He has pleaded guilty to possession of a Winchester pump action shotgun without holding a firearm certificate. Fearon, who was severely injured after being shot twice, told the court that he allowed Barras to go on the burgling trip to \"keep him out of trouble\". He had found the 16-year-old drinking with a group of his friends and allowed him to come along for the ride. Fearon told the jury that he and Barras and another man, Darren Bark, travelled to Bleak House after being told it was filled with antiques. He claimed that they went there to look at it. He and Barras got out of the car and began to look around some of the farm buildings when they were confronted by a rottweiler dog \"shaking its mouth\". He added that the pair stumbled across Bleak House, smashed a window and went inside in an attempt to get away from the dog. \"I was feeling about for a window or a door. I saw what I thought was a torch flashing and heard Fred shout: 'He's got me',\" said Fearon. He told the court that he saw the face of an old man in the flashing light. \"Then I saw a flash, heard a noise and my left leg went numb.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>David Irving was the Holocaust deniers' best shot. However discredited he has long been among professional historians, he puts on a good show of his Nazi learning. </p> <p>He may even have deserved the praise as a military specialist bestowed on him by Mr Justice Gray yesterday as the sucker punch before his devastating depiction of Irving as a racist, anti-semite and - this was the nub of the case - a deliberate falsifier of the evidence. </p> <p>The Holocaust has been paraded through the law courts before, as if the destruction of European Jewry by the Nazis were like some recidivist, forever to be called back before the bench. </p> <p>Long court cases, involving much of the Irving \"evidence\" have unfolded in Canada, in France and here too. </p> <p>Irving's suit echoed the libel action brought by Wladislav Dering in the early 60s, later written up by Leon Uris in his novel QBVII. But Irving is the best of this bunch, the \"face\" for those purulent haters behind the websites and the seamy pamphlets. The deniers will not give up. </p> <p>Irving demonstrated his intellectual disreputability by claiming to have learnt nothing, despite that stupendous parade of evidence. Neither accumulating scholarship nor judicial decisions will weaken an idea as fixed as this one. </p> <p>But never again will the deniers' claims to standing have even the sliver of credibility that attached to Irving before he took action against Professor Lipstadt. </p> <p>Yet there is no point pretending this verdict is some vindication of English court procedure let alone libel law. A few well-chosen hard words from a judge guarantees little by way of wisdom from his colleagues on the bench in future. </p> <p>The high court has established no claim to epistemological superiority: it was the convincing evidence presented in Mr Justice Gray's court that made his conclusion right. Besides, the English law of defamation remains an ass.</p> <p>The defendants in Irving's action had to scramble to prove the truth of large historical contentions. As for \"reputation\", Professor Lipstadt's imputations against Irving, true or false, would have lowered the recognition he enjoyed before the trial as a Nazi sympathiser and Jew-hater not a jot. </p> <p>The judge in this case won admirers but the absence of a jury still raises hard questions about our alleged incapacity to assess evidence and ascertain truth. \"Our\" as in us: would ordinary people empanelled in a jury really have found it impossible to see through David Irving? </p> <p>For is not the most compelling lesson of this marathon legal affair that truth is no shining city on a hill.

      "bodyText": "David Irving was the Holocaust deniers' best shot. However discredited he has long been among professional historians, he puts on a good show of his Nazi learning. He may even have deserved the praise as a military specialist bestowed on him by Mr Justice Gray yesterday as the sucker punch before his devastating depiction of Irving as a racist, anti-semite and - this was the nub of the case - a deliberate falsifier of the evidence. The Holocaust has been paraded through the law courts before, as if the destruction of European Jewry by the Nazis were like some recidivist, forever to be called back before the bench. Long court cases, involving much of the Irving \"evidence\" have unfolded in Canada, in France and here too. Irving's suit echoed the libel action brought by Wladislav Dering in the early 60s, later written up by Leon Uris in his novel QBVII. But Irving is the best of this bunch, the \"face\" for those purulent haters behind the websites and the seamy pamphlets. The deniers will not give up. Irving demonstrated his intellectual disreputability by claiming to have learnt nothing, despite that stupendous parade of evidence. Neither accumulating scholarship nor judicial decisions will weaken an idea as fixed as this one. But never again will the deniers' claims to standing have even the sliver of credibility that attached to Irving before he took action against Professor Lipstadt. Yet there is no point pretending this verdict is some vindication of English court procedure let alone libel law. A few well-chosen hard words from a judge guarantees little by way of wisdom from his colleagues on the bench in future. The high court has established no claim to epistemological superiority: it was the convincing evidence presented in Mr Justice Gray's court that made his conclusion right. Besides, the English law of defamation remains an ass. The defendants in Irving's action had to scramble to prove the truth of large historical contentions. As for \"reputation\", Professor Lipstadt's imputations against Irving, true or false, would have lowered the recognition he enjoyed before the trial as a Nazi sympathiser and Jew-hater not a jot. The judge in this case won admirers but the absence of a jury still raises hard questions about our alleged incapacity to assess evidence and ascertain truth. \"Our\" as in us: would ordinary people empanelled in a jury really have found it impossible to see through David Irving? For is not the most compelling lesson of this marathon legal affair that truth is no shining city on a hill. It has to be worked at; the credibility of those who claim to express it is critical. Even a casual reader of the case reports could quickly see how painstaking genuine historical scholarship is; it builds detail upon detail, avoiding casual inference and thin deduction. Eventually, a plausible narrative is pieced together but even then it has to withstand the slings and arrows of competitive scholars. And the Holocaust is now hot history. Due, in part, to the persistence of the deniers, academic effort has been redoubled. Among the many Irving assertions to be comprehensively demolished was the suggestion that thought police prevent open challenge to received historical wisdom. It is precisely because of the historians' efforts from the early 50s on that there is now no room for doubt, despite the false trails and the lacunae left by a Nazi bureaucracy as assiduous about destroying the signs of its crimes as realising the final solution. Other jurisdictions make denying the Holocaust a crime. After this case, we can rely on empiricism and the sheer weight of evidence.",

And, lest we be fooled by Irving's insistence that he was the penniless David battling the mighty Goliath of world Jewry, let's remember who brought this case. It was Irving who sued the American academic Deborah Lipstadt and her publishers, Penguin Books - not the other way around. Short of apologising on bended knee to a Nazi sympathiser, Lipstadt had no choice but to defend herself in court. She was not, as Irving argued, the enemy of free speech: on the contrary, it was he who tried to use Britain's absurd libel laws to suppress his critics. He wanted Lipstadt gagged; instead he has brought ruin upon himself. </p> <p>But much more than the fate of David Irving was decided yesterday. The high court also drove a stake through the heart of \"revisionism\" - the right-wing credo which says the Jews have mounted a con-trick on the rest of humanity by inventing a tragedy. Gray has nailed that lie. When he read his judgment to a packed and hushed Court 36 yesterday, he began by explaining that he could not rule on \"what actually happened during the Nazi regime\". He would leave that to the historians. But, within minutes, Gray was issuing declaration after declaration, demolishing Irving and his Holocaust-denying chums. In a typical, devastating sentence, the judge ruled \"that no objective, fair-minded historian would... doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to kill hundreds of thousands of Jews\". His theories in shreds, Irving himself shrank before our eyes: a windbag whose air was slowly seeping away. </p> <p>Gray's verdict matters not just to the victims of the Shoah and their families. It matters to all of us. For what became clear as this case unfolded was that Holocaust revisionism is an assault not only on Jews but on history itself - the very business of understanding the past. Irving argued that we could not trust eye-witness testimony (both survivors and Nazis had made it all up) and that any document that pointed at the systematic destruction of European Jewry was bound to be a forgery. With that as his method, Irving sought to sweep away the foundations of history and even of justice: for if we cannot believe the evidence of tens of thousands of witnesses, how can we believe anything? If Irving had won yesterday, the ground beneath our feet would have begun to feel shaky. The court would have declared that we, like David Irving, live in a topsy-turvy world where nothing can ever be known. That's why this verdict is not a victory for the defence; it is a victory for memory. </p> <p>Now what? There will be a temptation to shout this ruling from the rooftops. For the last two decades, particularly in the US, Jews have been oddly defensive about the Shoah: they have constructed memorials and museums, even made films like Schindler's List, in part to see off the deniers. They have wanted to gather the evidence that might silence the Irvings. Yesterday's verdict may bring release from that defensive crouch: now we can tell our story our way, happy that our accusers have been defeated in a venue respected around the world. </p> <p>I can see that happening, and yet I hope it does not. I would like the Jewish world to have a different, less expected response to this result. I would like to see a pause and even, frankly, a rest: for it's time we gave the victims and survivors of the Holocaust some peace. </p> <p>Thanks to jet travel I began yesterday morning, four hours before the verdict, in Prague. (Along with several Guardian colleagues, I was in the city for a weekend literary festival sponsored by the paper.) It made an eerily appropriate ante-room for Court 36. For what used to be Czechoslovakia once contained nearly 260,000 Jews; now only three or four thousand are left. Prague itself is filled with reminders of the Nazi effort. Take the Jewish Museum, a fine building brimming with holy books and religious artefacts. Visitors snake around the display cases, their cameras clicking - most of them unaware that the curators of this exhibition were the men of the Third Reich: Hitler had designated Prague as the site for a future Museum of the Extinct Jewish People. He wanted future tourists to see what strange creatures the Nazis had so bravely removed from the planet. The SS began bringing to Prague Judaica from destroyed synagogues and communities all over the region. </p> <p>Now, though, one has the queasy feeling that Hitler's macabre plan has come unexpectedly true. Tourists do indeed come to gaze at Jewish prayer books in glass cases, to marvel at the striking, lop-sided tombstones of Prague's Jewish cemetery, assembled like a mouthful of jagged teeth. In the Prague museum, Jews are like butterflies: rare and exotic - catalogued and pressed under glass. An entire cottage industry has built up, trading in a fascination not with Jewish life, but Jewish death. </p> <p>Jews cannot blame this process on others. American Jewry wanted a Holocaust museum in Washington DC, just as British Jews worked hard to get the Holocaust into the national curriculum. But several committed, thoughtful Jews are beginning to wonder if it isn't time to call a halt. In his landmark book, the Holocaust in American Life, Peter Novick calls on his community to find something else to place at the centre of their identity. He has pleaded for an end to the commercialisation and \"sacralization\" of the Shoah which has turned it into a kitschy, quasi-mystical event. At the Prague festival William Styron - whose novel, Sophie's Choice, came before the current Holocaust boom - suggested now might be the time for some \"quiet\". Not because the slaughter is a holy event which cannot be discussed by mere mortals, but because our collective interest in it is getting unhealthy. </p> <p>This would be a fine riposte to Irving, who likes to quip that the Holocaust is \"the only interesting thing that has ever happened to the Jews\".

      "body": "<p>By the 32nd and final day of his libel trial, David Irving was tired from the strain of representing himself in court. </p> <p>His exhaustion helped to undermine his claim that he was a seeker of historical truth rather than a Hitler worshipper when, at a weary moment, he mistakenly addressed the judge as Mein F\u00fchrer. </p> <p>Irving had gone to the high court in London claiming that he was suing Penguin books and Professor Deborah Lipstadt to defend free speech and the right of historians to dissent from the mainstream view about the Holocaust. </p> <p>In fact, money and rehabilitating his foundering career may have been Irving's real motive for suing. </p> <p>The Guardian has established that Irving was in huge financial difficulty before the trial. He had taken out five mortgages on his flat off Grosvenor Square in London worth \u00a3750,000. Records lodged with the land registry show that two of his creditors had filed bankruptcy petitions against him, which were not followed up. </p> <p>For Irving, 62, this also was a vanity libel trial, a chance to use the high court as a platform for his extreme views. Increasingly, he had been marginalised from the mainstream and confined to fringe neo-Nazi audiences. </p> <p>Before the verdict, Irving told the Guardian that whatever the outcome: \"My reputation as a historian has been greatly enhanced.\" He took pride from holding his own in court without the help of a defence barrister. </p> <p>But a once glittering writing career, from which he earned up to \u00a3100,000 a year, was in severe decline. The doors of reputable publishing houses were closed to him as concerns about his integrity grew more acute. </p> <p>In spring 1996, his American publisher, St Martin's Press, pulled out of a deal to publish his biography of Goebbels. That autumn, three years after the publication of Deborah Lipstadt's book Denying the Holocaust; the growing assault on truth and memory, he issued a writ for libel. </p> <p>Irving saw her book and its charge that he was a Holocaust denier as the climax of an international, Jewish-inspired and long-running conspiracy against him that threatened his livelihood. </p> <p>Lipstadt, 53, professor of Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, was determined to fight the case: \"It became a personal quest for the preservation of truth and memory.\" </p> <p>Irving's defeat was far from a foregone conclusion. The burden was on Penguin books and Lipstadt to prove their charges that Irving had wilfully distorted history to suit his fascist views. </p> <p>Their counsel, Richard Rampton QC, staked out the uncompromising ground on which they would stand or fall on the first day. </p> <p>\"Mr Irving calls himself a historian. The truth is, however, that he is not a historian at all, but a falsifier of history. To put it bluntly, he is a liar.\" </p> <p>The decision by Penguin and Lipstadt to plead justification, namely that the charges against Irving in her book were true, was not only a vastly expensive business but also a mammoth academic task. </p> <p>Four years of research unearthed 30 examples of falsifications of history by Irving. It was the sheer weight of these and the consistent pattern they formed that won the day for Penguin and Lipstadt. </p> <p>The method behind Irving's deceptions were complex, the effects significant. </p> <p>The defence spent \u00a380,000 on a 700-page report on Irving's historical methods from Richard Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge university and an expert on the writing of history. </p> <p>Prof Evans, who was paid \u00a3750 a day, and two PhD students spent two years combing through Irving's work. His report, which was submitted to the judge, shows his shock at the scale of deceptions he found: </p> <p>\"Penetrating beneath the confident surface of his prose quickly revealed a mass of distortion and manipulation ... so tangled that detailing it sometimes took up many more words than Irving's original account. </p> <p>\"A similar knotted web of distortions, suppressions and manipulations become evident in every single instance which we examined. </p> <p>\"I was not prepared for the sheer depths of duplicity which I encountered in Irving's treatment of the historical sources, nor for the way in which this dishonesty permeated his entire written and spoken output.\" </p> <p>Both sides agreed to dispense with a jury because of the complexity of the evidence, leaving the judge, Charles Gray, adjudicating over one of the most emotive trials in memory. </p> <p>The first sign of David Irving's Hitler worship came early, his twin brother Nicholas revealed. Recalling an incident in 1944 after a German bombing raid on Essex, he told an interviewer: \"We were only six years old, it was 1944. There were doodlebugs, windows were blown out and houses had been damaged. </p> <p>\"Suddenly, David said: 'We have to say something.' So he went up to them, did a Nazi salute and said 'Heil Hitler'.\" </p> <p>Irving dropped out of a science degree after his first book, The Destruction of Dresden, was published in 1963. His lack of formal training as a historian did not stop him writing 30 books. </p> <p>The first clear sign that his apparent quest for historical truth seemed to be hiding an attempt to rehabilitate Hitler came in his 1977 bestseller, Hitler's war. </p> <p>In the book Irving claimed Hitler had not ordered the extermination of the Jews and had even intervened to stop the murder of Jews. This, said Irving, was based on documents detailing communications between top German military leaders. </p> <p>The court heard that one document referred to an order not to liquidate one trainload of 1,000 Jews sent from Germany to Latvia in November 1941. </p> <p>Irving, through mistranslating the document, had falsely portrayed it as an order from Hitler to halt all such killings. </p> <p>Before the trial, Irving claimed that the shooting of up to 1,500,000 Jews on Germany's eastern border with Russia, was not systematic but a series of random acts of which Hitler was unaware. </p> <p>During the trial, evidence was produced which forced Irving to concede Hitler had indeed sanctioned them. </p> <p>One such piece of evidence was an order on August 1 1941 to a mobile killing unit, the Einsatzgruppen, which said Hitler would be getting continuous reports about their shootings. </p> <p>This evidence had been known to Irving since 1982. A copy of the order was contained in a book found in Irving's study, in which he had written notes in the margin, suggesting he had read it. </p> <p><strong> Gas chambers</strong><br> </p> <p>Irving later admitted that a report in December 1942 detailing the execution of 363,211 Jews in South Russia, Ukraine and Bialystok \"was in all probability shown to Hitler.\" </p> <p>For the second edition of Hitler's War in 1991, Irving had expunged all references to the Holocaust. </p> <p>Irving's position in court was that the Nazis may have killed between 1m-4m people, but that it was not systematic and did not involve gas chambers. </p> <p>\"He posed as a thoughtful intellectual, burrowing away with original source documents to try to seek the truth about the Holocaust. </p> <p>But a series of viciously anti-semitic speeches he had made to neo-Nazi audiences, which suggested he had denied the Holocaust, put paid to that image. </p> <p>The judge heard extracts from a 1991 speech given by Irving in Calgary, Canada, in which he rubbished the idea that the Auschwitz camp existed to murder Jews. \"It's baloney. It's a legend. </p> <p>\"Once we admit the fact that it was a brutal slave labour camp and large numbers of people did die, as large numbers of innocent people died elsewhere in the war, why believe the rest of the baloney? </p> <p>\"Tasteless. I say quite tastelessly, in fact, that more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz. </p> <p>\"Oh, you think that's tasteless, how about this? There are so many Auschwitz survivors going around, in fact the number increases as the years go past, which is biologically very odd to say the least. </p> <p>\"I'm going to form an association of Auschwitz survivors, survivors of the Holocaust and other liars, or the ASSHOLS.\" </p> <p>This trial turned on the death camp at Auschwitz. Despite evidence to the contrary, Irving clung to his view it was no more than a \"brutal slave labour camp\". </p> <p>The court heard how Irving misinterpreted documents involving the testimony of an Auschwitz survivor at the Nuremburg trials, a French woman called Marie-Claude Vaillant Couturier. </p> <p>Irving twisted the private diaries of Judge Francis Biddle, who presided over the trial where Vaillant Couturier testified, to try to rubbish her evidence. </p> <p>In a speech, Irving claimed that Biddle's notes of the trial, which he unearthed in an American university library, showed he disbelieved her evidence. </p> <p>Irving told an audience that Biddle wrote: \"I don't believe a word of what she's saying, I think she's a bloody liar.\" </p> <p>Vaillant Couturier's evidence had set out the horror of the death camp. She had been a member of the French national assembly and was sent to Auschwitz in 1943. There she testified to seeing beatings, forced sterilisations and castrations and gas chambers. </p> <p>In fact, Biddle doubted only one small section of her testimony.

      "bodyText": "By the 32nd and final day of his libel trial, David Irving was tired from the strain of representing himself in court. His exhaustion helped to undermine his claim that he was a seeker of historical truth rather than a Hitler worshipper when, at a weary moment, he mistakenly addressed the judge as Mein F\u00fchrer. Irving had gone to the high court in London claiming that he was suing Penguin books and Professor Deborah Lipstadt to defend free speech and the right of historians to dissent from the mainstream view about the Holocaust. In fact, money and rehabilitating his foundering career may have been Irving's real motive for suing. The Guardian has established that Irving was in huge financial difficulty before the trial. He had taken out five mortgages on his flat off Grosvenor Square in London worth \u00a3750,000. Records lodged with the land registry show that two of his creditors had filed bankruptcy petitions against him, which were not followed up. For Irving, 62, this also was a vanity libel trial, a chance to use the high court as a platform for his extreme views. Increasingly, he had been marginalised from the mainstream and confined to fringe neo-Nazi audiences. Before the verdict, Irving told the Guardian that whatever the outcome: \"My reputation as a historian has been greatly enhanced.\" He took pride from holding his own in court without the help of a defence barrister. But a once glittering writing career, from which he earned up to \u00a3100,000 a year, was in severe decline. The doors of reputable publishing houses were closed to him as concerns about his integrity grew more acute. In spring 1996, his American publisher, St Martin's Press, pulled out of a deal to publish his biography of Goebbels. That autumn, three years after the publication of Deborah Lipstadt's book Denying the Holocaust; the growing assault on truth and memory, he issued a writ for libel. Irving saw her book and its charge that he was a Holocaust denier as the climax of an international, Jewish-inspired and long-running conspiracy against him that threatened his livelihood. Lipstadt, 53, professor of Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, was determined to fight the case: \"It became a personal quest for the preservation of truth and memory.\" Irving's defeat was far from a foregone conclusion. The burden was on Penguin books and Lipstadt to prove their charges that Irving had wilfully distorted history to suit his fascist views. Their counsel, Richard Rampton QC, staked out the uncompromising ground on which they would stand or fall on the first day. \"Mr Irving calls himself a historian. The truth is, however, that he is not a historian at all, but a falsifier of history. To put it bluntly, he is a liar.\" The decision by Penguin and Lipstadt to plead justification, namely that the charges against Irving in her book were true, was not only a vastly expensive business but also a mammoth academic task. Four years of research unearthed 30 examples of falsifications of history by Irving. It was the sheer weight of these and the consistent pattern they formed that won the day for Penguin and Lipstadt. The method behind Irving's deceptions were complex, the effects significant. The defence spent \u00a380,000 on a 700-page report on Irving's historical methods from Richard Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge university and an expert on the writing of history. Prof Evans, who was paid \u00a3750 a day, and two PhD students spent two years combing through Irving's work. His report, which was submitted to the judge, shows his shock at the scale of deceptions he found: \"Penetrating beneath the confident surface of his prose quickly revealed a mass of distortion and manipulation ... so tangled that detailing it sometimes took up many more words than Irving's original account. \"A similar knotted web of distortions, suppressions and manipulations become evident in every single instance which we examined. \"I was not prepared for the sheer depths of duplicity which I encountered in Irving's treatment of the historical sources, nor for the way in which this dishonesty permeated his entire written and spoken output.\" Both sides agreed to dispense with a jury because of the complexity of the evidence, leaving the judge, Charles Gray, adjudicating over one of the most emotive trials in memory. The first sign of David Irving's Hitler worship came early, his twin brother Nicholas revealed. Recalling an incident in 1944 after a German bombing raid on Essex, he told an interviewer: \"We were only six years old, it was 1944. There were doodlebugs, windows were blown out and houses had been damaged. \"Suddenly, David said: 'We have to say something.' So he went up to them, did a Nazi salute and said 'Heil Hitler'.\" Irving dropped out of a science degree after his first book, The Destruction of Dresden, was published in 1963. His lack of formal training as a historian did not stop him writing 30 books. The first clear sign that his apparent quest for historical truth seemed to be hiding an attempt to rehabilitate Hitler came in his 1977 bestseller, Hitler's war. In the book Irving claimed Hitler had not ordered the extermination of the Jews and had even intervened to stop the murder of Jews. This, said Irving, was based on documents detailing communications between top German military leaders. The court heard that one document referred to an order not to liquidate one trainload of 1,000 Jews sent from Germany to Latvia in November 1941. Irving, through mistranslating the document, had falsely portrayed it as an order from Hitler to halt all such killings. Before the trial, Irving claimed that the shooting of up to 1,500,000 Jews on Germany's eastern border with Russia, was not systematic but a series of random acts of which Hitler was unaware. During the trial, evidence was produced which forced Irving to concede Hitler had indeed sanctioned them. One such piece of evidence was an order on August 1 1941 to a mobile killing unit, the Einsatzgruppen, which said Hitler would be getting continuous reports about their shootings. This evidence had been known to Irving since 1982. A copy of the order was contained in a book found in Irving's study, in which he had written notes in the margin, suggesting he had read it. Gas chambers Irving later admitted that a report in December 1942 detailing the execution of 363,211 Jews in South Russia, Ukraine and Bialystok \"was in all probability shown to Hitler.\" For the second edition of Hitler's War in 1991, Irving had expunged all references to the Holocaust. Irving's position in court was that the Nazis may have killed between 1m-4m people, but that it was not systematic and did not involve gas chambers. \"He posed as a thoughtful intellectual, burrowing away with original source documents to try to seek the truth about the Holocaust. But a series of viciously anti-semitic speeches he had made to neo-Nazi audiences, which suggested he had denied the Holocaust, put paid to that image. The judge heard extracts from a 1991 speech given by Irving in Calgary, Canada, in which he rubbished the idea that the Auschwitz camp existed to murder Jews. \"It's baloney. It's a legend. \"Once we admit the fact that it was a brutal slave labour camp and large numbers of people did die, as large numbers of innocent people died elsewhere in the war, why believe the rest of the baloney? \"Tasteless. I say quite tastelessly, in fact, that more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz. \"Oh, you think that's tasteless, how about this? There are so many Auschwitz survivors going around, in fact the number increases as the years go past, which is biologically very odd to say the least. \"I'm going to form an association of Auschwitz survivors, survivors of the Holocaust and other liars, or the ASSHOLS.\" This trial turned on the death camp at Auschwitz. Despite evidence to the contrary, Irving clung to his view it was no more than a \"brutal slave labour camp\". The court heard how Irving misinterpreted documents involving the testimony of an Auschwitz survivor at the Nuremburg trials, a French woman called Marie-Claude Vaillant Couturier. Irving twisted the private diaries of Judge Francis Biddle, who presided over the trial where Vaillant Couturier testified, to try to rubbish her evidence. In a speech, Irving claimed that Biddle's notes of the trial, which he unearthed in an American university library, showed he disbelieved her evidence. Irving told an audience that Biddle wrote: \"I don't believe a word of what she's saying, I think she's a bloody liar.\" Vaillant Couturier's evidence had set out the horror of the death camp. She had been a member of the French national assembly and was sent to Auschwitz in 1943. There she testified to seeing beatings, forced sterilisations and castrations and gas chambers. In fact, Biddle doubted only one small section of her testimony. According to Irving's own notes of the judge's diary, Biddle records her as saying: \"House of prostitution for SS selected young women as they were washing for maids. All camps used the same system.\" After this remark, Biddle, in brackets writes, \"this I doubt\", namely that the same system was used at every SS camp. Irving dismissed the witnesses to systematic extermination at Auschwitz as wrong or lying. He claimed 100,000 people had died there, the same number as at Dresden, and that was through disease, overwork and some shootings. Irving's revisionist views on Auschwitz were prompted by a report written by American extremist Frederick Leuchter in 1989. In the report Leuchter claimed that samples of concrete taken from the surviving walls at Auschwitz's gas chambers contained quantities of hydrogen cyanide that were too low to kill human beings, and thus suggested the chambers were for delousing. But the truth was quite the reverse. The real amount of hydrogen cyanide needed to kill humans is 22 times lower than that needed to kill lice. Irving wrote the foreword to the Leuchter report. During the trial he was forced to admit it was riddled with errors. In court, Irving rejected the label of being a Holocaust denier, saying he did not question that it had happened, but merely queried the \"means, the scale, the dates and other minutiae.\" The court heard evidence that Irving was an anti-semite and racist. He displayed his prejudice in front of his young daughter, singing the ditty: \"I am a baby Aryan/Not Jewish or sectarian/ I have no plans to marry an/Ape or Rastafarian.\" Irving consorted with the far right, addressing meetings of the Hitler-worshipping British National Party, the German neo-Nazi DVU party and extreme right National Alliance in the US. Germany got so fed up with Irving that it eventually banned him from entering, as did Canada and Australia. Perhaps the biggest insight into his deeper motivation comes not from the libel case, but from the opening line of his introduction to the new edition of Hitler's War, posted on his website: \"To historians is granted a talent that even the gods are denied - to alter what has already happened.\"",

Although he is banned from the country, he holds a bank account there and has been championed by the hard right German People's Union (DVU). </p> <p>A party spokesman in Munich refused to say yesterday whether it had funded him but described Irving \"as a good man and a seeker of the truth\". </p> <p>Last night Irving said: \"When I have got money from Germany it comes in occasional 500 Deutschmark notes from a rather sweet old lady.\"</p>",

In fact, the brunt of the \u00a32.5m cost of assembling the Lipstadt team was met by the publishers, though the Bronfman family, leading figures in the World Jewish Congress and owners of the distillers Seagrams, are believed to have made sizeable contributions. Included in the \u00a32.5m that Irving will now have to pay comes the \u00a3343,000 costs of Richard Rampton QC, the barrister who gave him such a roasting in court. Irving, however, looks to be in no position to pay that sort of money. He may live in a large Mayfair apartment but as the Guardian today reveals he has mortgaged it to the hilt. Without a publisher for almost 10 years, he has had to rely on his own precarious imprint Focal Point. As well as writing and printing his own books, Irving drives the van to deliver them to those bookshops still prepared to sell them. He also has two young daughters and his Danish wife, Bente, to support. Set against this, Irving's only real earnings of late have been in the courts. He was paid an estimated \u00a375,000 by the Sunday Times in 1994 in an out-of-court settlement after they tried to disassociate themselves from him in the furore that followed his translation of the Goebbels diaries. Irving already has a bankruptcy writ against him in the US to recover unpaid costs from a libel case he brought against the Jewish Board of Deputies six years ago. The only real asset he appeared to have left is a holiday apartment in the fashionable Florida island of Key West, where he retreated to compose himself in the weeks before the verdict. But this, in fact, is held in the name of a Sam Dixon, an Atlanta lawyer who has acted for the Ku Klux Klan. Having at first refused to give details of the \"4,000 people around the world who have contributed to my cause\" for fear of leaving them liable for his costs, Irving has now revealed his big backers were American. One US donor, he said, handed him $50,000 in cash in a brown paper bag at Amsterdam airport two years ago, and within the past month a banker's draft for \u00a310,000 was sent to him from New York. (As if to prove how deep his well of support in the States is, even as he lost in the high court, Irving was still organising a two-day \"real history\" conference in Cincinnati in September.) Despite the fact that extremist websites carry links to his appeals for cash, Irving denies any of his funds come from neo-Nazis. The New York-based Anti-Defamation League said they would be \"shocked\" if he was not getting money from supporters of the far-right National Alliance, National Association For the Advancement Of White People and the denialist Committee For Open Debate On The Holocaust. Jewish organisations also suspect several of Irving's most consistent backers are German. Although he is banned from the country, he holds a bank account there and has been championed by the hard right German People's Union (DVU). A party spokesman in Munich refused to say yesterday whether it had funded him but described Irving \"as a good man and a seeker of the truth\". Last night Irving said: \"When I have got money from Germany it comes in occasional 500 Deutschmark notes from a rather sweet old lady.\"",

      "body": "<p>In an emphatic and damning 334-page judgment Mr Justice Gray branded David Irving a racist anti-semite who for \"his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence\". </p> <p>He said Irving was \"an active Holocaust denier\" who associated with neo-Nazi extremists. The 62-year-old historian's ideological views led him to portray Hitler \"in an unwarrantedly favourable light, principally in relation to his attitude towards and responsibility for the treatment of the Jews\". </p> <p>He ruled that the defence of justification by the American academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin over her 1994 book, Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, had succeeded. </p> <p>The judge said the central issue was Irving's treatment of the available evidence: \"It is no part of my function to attempt to make findings as to what actually happened during the Nazi regime. The distinction may be a fine one but it is important to bear it in mind.\" </p> <p>Offering a grain of comfort to Irving, he said: \"My assessment is that, as a military historian, Irving has much to commend him. For his works of military history Irving has undertaken thorough and painstaking research into the archives. </p> <p>\"He has discovered and disclosed to historians and others many documents which, but for his efforts, might have remained unnoticed for years. </p> <p>\"It was plain from the way in which he conducted his case and dealt with a sustained and penetrating crossexamination that his knowledge of world war two is unparalleled. His mastery of the detail of the historical documents is remarkable. He is beyond question able and intelligent. </p> <p>\"But the questions to which this action has given rise do not relate to the quality of Irving's military history but rather to the manner in which he has written about the attitude adopted by Hitler towards the Jews and in particular his responsibility for the fate which befell them under the Nazi regime.\" </p> <p>Overall, he said, Irving had \"treated the historical evidence in a manner which fell far short of the standard to be expected of a conscientious historian\". </p> <p>The judge said the respondents had selected 19 instances where they contended Irving had in one way or another distorted the evidence. </p> <p>He noted that many of the documents he had to analyse were chosen by Irving himself who claimed they demonstrated Hitler was a friend of the Jews. \"I have come to the conclusion that the criticisms advanced by the defendants are almost invariably well-founded.\" </p> <p>On the central question of Hitler's attitude to the Jews, the judge concluded that Irving's submissions had \"a distinct air of unreality about them\". </p> <p>\"In the result the picture which he provides to readers of Hitler and his attitude towards the Jews is at odds with the evidence. It is common ground between the parties that until the latter part of 1941, the solution to the Jewish question which Hitler preferred was their mass deportation.\" </p> <p>The respondents, however, claimed that from the end of 1941 onwards \"the policy of which Hitler knew and approved was the extermination of Jews in huge numbers. Irving on the other hand argued that Hitler continued to be the Jews' friend at least until October 1943\". </p> <p>\"The unreality of Irving's stance, as I see it, derives from his persistence in that claim, despite his acceptance in the course of this trial that the evidence shows that Hitler knew about and approved of the wholesale shooting of Jews in the east and, later, was complicit in the gassing of hundreds of thousands of Jews in the Reinhard and other death camps.\" </p> <p>He said Irving had accepted he was wrong in telling audiences in Australia, Canada and the US that the shooting of Jews by the Einsatzgruppen death squads was done without Hitler's approval. </p> <p>Hitler was incontrovertibly, rabidly anti-semitic, the judge said, and spoke in sinister and menacing tones about Jews. He rejected Irving's claim that Hitler had stopped being anti-semitic after 1933. </p> <p>On the issue of Auschwitz the judge said the central question of the case was whether the evidence supported the respondents' contention that the number of deaths ran into hundreds of thousands or whether Irving was right when he claimed the killing by gas was on a modest scale. </p> <p>He said the cumulative effect of the documentary evidence for the genocidal operation of gas chambers at Auschwitz was \"considerable\". </p> <p>\"No objective, fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to kill hundreds of thousands of Jews.\" </p> <p>Mr Justice Gray said it appeared to him to be \"incontrovertible\" that Irving was a Holocaust denier. </p> <p>\"Not only has he denied the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz and asserted that no Jew was gassed there, he has done so on frequent occasions and sometimes in the most offensive terms. </p> <p>\"By way of examples, I cite his story of the Jew climbing into a mobile telephone box-cum-gas chamber; his claim that more people died in the back of Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz; his dismissal of the eyewitnesses en masse as liars or as suffering from a mental problem; and his reference to an Association of Auschwitz Survivors and Other Liars or 'ASSHOLS'.\" </p> <p>He rejected as untrue the claim made by Irving in his evidence that in his denial of the existence of any gas chambers at Auschwitz, he was referring solely to the gas chamber constructed by the Poles after the war for the benefit of visitors to the site or, as Irving put it, as a \"tourist attraction\". </p> <p>Irving had also made broader claims which \"tend to minimise the Holocaust\", said the judge. He had minimised the number of those killed by means other than gas at Auschwitz and elsewhere. </p> <p>On anti-semitism, the judge said it appeared to him undeniable that most, if not all, of the statements made by Irving and cited by the respondents as demonstrating his anti-semitism, revealed \"clear evidence that, in the absence of any excuse or suitable explanation for what he said or wrote, Irving is anti-semitic\". </p> <p>He added: \"His words are directed against Jews, either individually or collectively, in the sense that they are by turns hostile, critical, offensive and derisory in their references to semitic people, their characteristics and appearances.\" </p> <p>Examples included Irving's claims that Jews deserved to be disliked; that they had brought the Holocaust on themselves; that Jews generated anti-semitism by their greed and mendacity; that Jews were among the scum of humanity and that they scurried and hid furtively, unable to stand the light of day. </p> <p>Irving's principal explanation or justification for his comments about Jews was that he was seeking to explain to Jews why anti-semitism existed, said the judge. </p> <p>\"But I do not think that this was the message that Irving was seeking to convey to his audiences and it was certainly not the sense in which his remarks were understood. It appears to me that Irving has repeatedly crossed the divide between legitimate criticism and prejudiced vilification of the Jewish race and people.\" </p> <p>There was also ample evidence of Irving's racism. Mr Justice Gray cited the ditty composed by Irving for his daughter: </p> <p>\"I am a Baby Aryan Not Jewish or Sectarian I have no plans to marry an Ape or Rastafarian.\" </p> <p>As a historian, the judge said: \"Irving appears to take every opportunity to exculpate Hitler.\" Yet on numerous occasions, \"Irving has misstated historical evidence; adopted positions which run counter to the weight of the evidence; given credence to unreliable evidence and disregarded or dismissed credible evidence.\" The question is, whether his misrepresentations were deliberate. </p> <p>\"Over the past 15 years or so, Irving appears to have become more politically active than was previously the case. He speaks regularly at political or quasi-political meetings in Germany, the United States, Canada and the new world. The content of his speeches and interviews often displays a distinctly pro-Nazi and anti-Jewish bias. </p> <p>\"He makes surprising and often unfounded assertions about the Nazi regime which tend to exonerate the Nazis for the appalling atrocities which they inflicted on the Jews. He is content to mix with neo-fascists and appears to share many of their racist and anti-semitic prejudices.\" </p> <p>Mr Justice Gray roundly concluded: \"The picture of Irving which emerges from the evidence of his extracurricular activities reveals him to be a rightwing pro-Nazi polemicist. In my view the defendants have established that Irving has a political agenda. </p> <p>\"It is one which, it is legitimate to infer, disposes him, where he deems it necessary, to manipulate the historical record in order to make it conform with his political beliefs. </p> <p>\"It appears to me that the correct and inevitable inference must be that for the most part the falsification of the historical record was deliberate and that Irving was motivated by a desire to present events in a manner consistent with his own ideological beliefs even if that involved distortion and manipulation of historical evidence.\"</p>",

At stake is how far scurrilous websites should be protected from the libel laws. The precedent-setting test case involves an English professor, Daniel Curzon Brown, who teaches at the City College in San Francisco. Since 1997, a website has operated which allowed students at the college to post anonymous reviews of their teachers. The reviews include a \"bottom 10\" of the teachers who have received the most negative reviews. Prof Brown ranks fifth on that list. Most of the 1,700 teaching staff at the college have learned to ignore the rude comments, or avoid the website itself. But Prof Brown, who is gay and a published author, has been the subject of some particularly vicious, anonymous attacks and has decided that he can no longer allow them to be posted with impunity. The professor is described on the site as \"homomanic, racist and mentally ill\", all of which he vehemently denies. He has described the attacks as \"evil\" and says he does not understand how anyone can justify them. As a result, he has brought a lawsuit against the operator of the website, Ryan Lathouwers, which is due to start today at the city's superior court. Prof Brown, who has been teaching at the college for 20 years, said that the attacks had made him \"depressed and afraid\" and says that it is time to challenge the idea that the internet is \"holy\" and somehow above the law. Mr Lathouwers, whose website contains a disclaimer about the views expressed, is fighting the case and has the support of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is anxious to uphold the first amendment's protection of free speech and fearful of what a libel victory might bring to the internet industry. A spokeswoman for the ACLU, which has had to defend the views of racist groups on similar first amendment grounds, says that free speech means \"that sometimes feelings get hurt\". Its position is that the value of preserving free speech outweighs hurt feelings. The college itself is unwilling to try to have the site closed, also on first amendment grounds. The case has many parallels with that of Demon Internet in the UK, which recently agreed to pay \u00a315,000 in damages to a physicist who claimed he had been defamed by two anonymous postings on the net. The case appeared to establish that internet providers in the UK are subject to the same libel laws as other media. In the US, where the libel laws are much less powerful than in the UK, the internet receives protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which essentially allows the internet service provider immunity from the libel laws. Victory for Prof Brown would send providers scurrying to their sites, some of which contain graphic and unsubstantiated libels. The action has provoked further action on the website (teacherreview.com) with former students of Prof Brown weighing in on both sides of the argument. One anonymous contributor attacks both Prof Brown and the attacker who called him \"homomanic\" saying: \"his [Brown's] being a horrible instructor has nothing to do with his personal life\".",

      "bodyText": "The people who have been holding their children over the fence of that house in Miami in the belief that the six-year-old shipwrecked boy, Elian Gonzales, has magical healing powers, are acting no more oddly than many others in the Elian affair. His Miami relatives, die-hard anti-Castro Cubans, seem to think that Elian has magic powers that will change the laws of the United States - and even the laws of decent behaviour - to permit them to stop the child's father from claiming him. George W Bush seems to think that Elian's magic powers will allow him to support the child's relatives in this absurd proposition and gain votes by it. Even less creditably, so does Al Gore, who broke with what has been the reasonable position of the Clinton administration - that US law and the rights of this little family should prevail over the opportunity to make political capital out of a six-year-old's tragedy. Meanwhile, back in Havana, Fidel Castro must be even more convinced of Elian's magic powers. After all, he has provided Castro with a cause that - even at this late stage in history - has enabled him to rally millions to his side in defiance, yet again, of their bullying neighbour. Never mind that a third of the island might prefer to be living in the US, and the equivalent of another third already is. The effective kidnapping of Elian has proved a magic reviving pill for the jaded indignation of Castro's suffering citizens. When the boy was exhibited on US television talking about his dead mother, Castro could rightly denounce it as an abuse. When a raft of congressmen, with an eye to Miami votes in this election year, declined to insist that the boy be returned to his father and instead lined up in his diminutive shadow and claimed they were protecting his \"freedom\", Castro could mock them without fear of contradiction. Elian's freedom, by this code, does not appear to include the freedom to be reunited with his surviving parent because, these congressmen say, Elian should not be returned to the \"jail\" that is Castro's Cuba. This is nonsense. Cuba may not be a model of freedom but nor is it a prison. Most of its children still get a better deal, impoverished though their country is since the collapse of the Soviet Union, than children in the US's client states elsewhere in Latin America. Children in Cuba have, on the whole, had the luxury of eating, sleeping, attending decent schools and living beyond their fifth birthday, which is more than many can do in Brazil or Peru. It's not six-year-olds who see Cuba as a prison, though it would not be hard to find an adolescent who did. Since Cuba's economic collapse, it's hard to make an honest living and the economy has steadily submitted to the power of the dollar. It makes a mockery of ambition and self-respect and heroic efforts are required to keep teenagers on the rails. It's not wise to complain, though. Cuba is still a place where you are wise to keep your political thoughts to yourself. But Castro is ageing and Cuba is changing. By the time Elian grows up, it will have changed beyond recognition. If the boy wants to leave then, it's more likely he will have more trouble getting a US entry visa than a legal Cuban exit permit. Every year, Cuba grows more open and accessible; every year, increased contact creates new possibilities for a peaceful transition to a post-Castro Cuba. That, of course, is not what Miami's revanchists want. They are after blood and revenge, not constructive engagement, and for more than 40 years they have made a nonsense out of US foreign policy. If the Helsinki process helped bring about the collapse of the Berlin wall, where is the Helsinki process for Cuba - a much smaller and easier target for a charm offensive? Any thought of such a process is strangled at birth by the Cuban American Foundation - an outcome that delights no one more than Castro. His brand of government always needs an enemy and thrives on confrontation. If the US were to lift the embargo against Cuba tomorrow, who would Castro be able to blame for the state of the Cuban economy, the lack of telephones, the pot-holed roads and the crumbling buildings? If there was no external threat, how many of the crowd demonstrating for Elian's return would be demonstrating instead for religious freedoms or political change. Each time the US allows Miami to dictate policy, it guarantees Castro another few years of security and his people another few years of painful uncertainty. Elian's relatives spent much of Sunday on television talk shows arguing, with no evidence, that Elian's father - who has now arrived in the US to try to bring this circus to an end - is not fit to bring up his own child. The courts have ruled he must go back and now it should only be a matter of how to arrange it with the least upset for the child. The game is up, but they won't face up to it.

With the Anschluss, and because he was Jewish, he left for Z\u00fcrich, where he had an uncle who eventually helped him get to England. </p> <p>At the outbreak of the second world war, he was interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien, and a meeting there with a European publisher persuaded him to enter the profession. </p> <p>When released in 1942, he went to work for Nicholson and Watson, transferred to the technical book and trade journal publisher Ernest Benn, where he became sales manager, and started his own company, Allan Wingate, in 1945. </p> <p>He was backed by private investors and, having underestimated his capital needs, kept bringing new members on to the board. These tended to be public school or bridge party types, contemptuous of Deutsch's accented English and East European background. Anthony Gibb, son of historian Sir Philip, became chairman and, having his own publishing ambitions, ousted him. </p> <p>In 1951, with help and advice from Stanley Rubinstein, the publishing solicitor, he started Andr\u00e9 Deutsch Ltd. At Wingate's, he had successfully published his compatriot George Mikes's light-hearted satire on the English, How To Be An Alien, with illustrations by Nicholas Bentley; the former remained with him as an author, the latter as a board member.

The prestige went to his head and he undertook to publish in English the official biography of the German President Theodor Heuss, who was unknown outside Germany.

At one point, again in financial difficulties, Deutsch sold himself out to Time-Life Books, with a contract to stay on as publisher, but the arrangement did not work and he bought himself out again. </p> <p>When he felt the time had come to retire (and the 1980s were not a happy time for independent publishers, with the banks increasingly unhelpful), he accepted an offer from Tom Rosenthal.

Think of a mid-European leprechaun and you've got the picture. He was already well into his 50s when he published my first two books. They were about cricket, of which he knew nothing, but he read the Guardian and had heard of Ian Botham. </p> <p>The paper would pay my hotel bills for daily reports on England's 1980 tour of the West Indies, and Andr\u00e9 would stump up all travel expenses for the main wheeze - a spoof, ghosted autobiography by an imagined 17th member of the England party called Desmond (ie me), who would spill the beans on the tour. </p> <p>The day before we left, Andr\u00e9 gave me my \"expenses\" - in the form of copies of personal letters he had already sent to, among others, Eric Williams, Forbes Burnham and Michael Manley, former black movement student authors of his, now prime ministers of respectively Trinidad, Guyana, and Jamaica. </p> <p>I feared the worst publisher's double-cross. Not a bit of it. From day one in Trinidad, chauffeured cars were at my disposal, and the odd private plane. In return, I was fast into my stride with Another Bloody Day In Paradise - till the tour began to fall apart with the team being thrown out of Guyana on the back of South African apartheid and the death of England's manager Ken Barrington. Back home, Andr\u00e9 panicked. \"Drop Desmond and play it straight,\" he wired. </p> <p>Twelve months later, with another England team, this time in India, a beaming Andr\u00e9 arrived with some 30-odd copies of ABD in P and arranged a \"launch\" party at the pricey Taj Mahal in Bombay. When the time came to leave, a week or so later, all party charges had been referred to my bill - and dear old Andr\u00e9 was back in London. </p> <p>But I loved him. I last saw him a couple of years ago, looking sad, hunched, lonely. \"We should really do that spoof tour book again,\" he said - and his leprechaun's eyes were glistening with pleasure and anticipation once again. </p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, publisher, born November 15 1917; died April 10 2000.</strong></p>",

They were about cricket, of which he knew nothing, but he read the Guardian and had heard of Ian Botham. The paper would pay my hotel bills for daily reports on England's 1980 tour of the West Indies, and Andr\u00e9 would stump up all travel expenses for the main wheeze - a spoof, ghosted autobiography by an imagined 17th member of the England party called Desmond (ie me), who would spill the beans on the tour. The day before we left, Andr\u00e9 gave me my \"expenses\" - in the form of copies of personal letters he had already sent to, among others, Eric Williams, Forbes Burnham and Michael Manley, former black movement student authors of his, now prime ministers of respectively Trinidad, Guyana, and Jamaica. I feared the worst publisher's double-cross. Not a bit of it. From day one in Trinidad, chauffeured cars were at my disposal, and the odd private plane. In return, I was fast into my stride with Another Bloody Day In Paradise - till the tour began to fall apart with the team being thrown out of Guyana on the back of South African apartheid and the death of England's manager Ken Barrington. Back home, Andr\u00e9 panicked. \"Drop Desmond and play it straight,\" he wired. Twelve months later, with another England team, this time in India, a beaming Andr\u00e9 arrived with some 30-odd copies of ABD in P and arranged a \"launch\" party at the pricey Taj Mahal in Bombay. When the time came to leave, a week or so later, all party charges had been referred to my bill - and dear old Andr\u00e9 was back in London. But I loved him. I last saw him a couple of years ago, looking sad, hunched, lonely. \"We should really do that spoof tour book again,\" he said - and his leprechaun's eyes were glistening with pleasure and anticipation once again. Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, publisher, born November 15 1917; died April 10 2000.",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations World Food Programme director Catherine Bertini arrived in Ethiopia yesterday to assess the food crisis there amid claims that even more food aid than previously requested will be needed to avert starvation. The Ethiopian government has already appealed for 800,000 tonnes of food aid to feed some 8m people threatened by starvation, but unless some rain falls soon more than a million tonnes will be needed, according to aid organisations. The Save the Children Fund said yesterday that a further 1.2m people would be at risk if, as is expected, the June harvest fails. The World Food Programme's (WFP) regional representative in Ethiopia, Judith Lewis, said the WFP had already revised its estimates of the number of people at risk five times in the past year. \"I've never seen a country plagued by so many problems,\" said Ms Lewis. \"At the end of 1998 the food situation in Ethiopia looked good, but since then we have seen one disaster after another.\" Ms Bertini will assess one of the worst hit areas of the country today when she visits the south-eastern town of Gode. Tens of thousands of people are said to be at risk there, but according to Ms Lewis there are signs of improvement. \"Food is getting to the right places and people suffering from malnutrition are responding well to our feeding programmes\" she said. The greatest problem facing the aid agencies is the logistics of getting food to the hungry. Infrastructure in many parts of the country is woefully inadequate, and acts of banditry in the worst affected region, near Ethiopia's border with Somalia, are common enough to prevent the WFP basing any of its international staff there. The drivers of the food convoys have to be carefully chosen to ensure that they belong to the same clan that dominates any region they have to pass through. Several drivers have been killed in the last few months because the clans controlling the areas they travel through did not accept them. However, the biggest obstacle to the relief effort is the border war that Ethiopia has been fighting for the last two years against its northern neighbour, Eritrea. Ethiopia is landlocked and until the war broke out relied on the Eritrean ports of Assab and Massawa for trade. Since then it has had to rely on the port of Djibouti, which UN logistics experts say cannot cope. Eritrea offered Ethiopia the use of its ports last week but Ethiopia rejected the offer, calling it a \"gimmick\".",

      "bodyText": "Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola yesterday joined forces to create a standard for delivering secure transactions on mobile handsets by 2001. The move is designed to fuel the rise of m-commerce, such as banking or buying train tickets with a mobile phone - a process the three companies say is being stifled by fragmented technologies. M-commerce in Europe is predicted by consultants McKinsey &amp; Company to be worth between $9bn and $16bn by 2002. The number of mobile phone users globally is expected to exceed one billion by 2004. Once m-commerce becomes popular, it is likely that financial institutions will begin loyalty programmes similar to those offered for credit cards. The standard being developed will be open and based on the Wireless Application Protocol. Wireless Identification Module and Mobile Public Key Infrastructure technologies will provide the security functions while connectivity will be based on Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth can be fired from a mobile phone, much like an infrared beam, to handle nearby transactions such as paying for a parking meter. Matti Alahuhta, the president of Nokia, said: \"Integrating security and transaction applications on a common core standard and platform will create a global mass market for mobile e-business.\" Jan Ahrenbring, Ericsson vice president for marketing, said: \"Ericsson estimates that by 2004 there will be around one billion users of mobile telephony and 60m mobile internet subscribers worldwide. \"The most important thing that is needed to get all these consumers to start using mobile e-commerce is a standard which makes it safe and easy to use.\" None of the companies would say what operating system would be used for mobile phones.

Mr Chen's efforts to avoid the question of \"one China\" have been undercut by his elected vice-president, Annette Lu, who infuriated Beijing last week by referring to Taiwan's independence. Yesterday he warned against unrealistic expectations of his inaugural speech on May 20 while promising to show \"sincerity and goodwill\" to China, but the question is whether goodwill will be enough. Another awkward issue surfaced yesterday when the Dalai Lama said he would accept an invitation to attend the inauguration. Mr Chen will either have to put him off or risk a visit which enrages Beijing by linking the two most sensitive issues on its agenda. Tempers have frayed across the Taiwan strait after several weeks of relative calm since Mr Chen's election last month. Beijing called Ms Lu a \"lunatic who could bring disaster to Taiwan\" after she said that Taiwan already has independent sovereignty. Ms Lu told a Hong Kong television network that China and Taiwan are only \"close neighbours\" in a geographical sense, while historically they are merely \"remote relatives\". The official People's Daily said Ms Lu \"intends to push Taiwan into the abyss of war\". It asked: \"Are the 23m Taiwanese people at ease that such a lunatic advocate of independence, who could bring disaster at any time, has taken office as a Taiwan leader?\" Spokesmen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive party (DPP), in whose cause Mr Chen and Ms Lu won the election, have declined to comment on the Chinese attacks. Chinese public opinion appears to be worried by any prospect of armed conflict across the Taiwan strait. Privately, some Chinese officials express confidence that there will not be any war. This is in spite of the popular newspapers which in Kunming and other provincial cities festoon newsstands with headlines about the military might of the People's Liberation Army. But there is still great uncertainty among Chinese and foreign experts alike as to how the conceptual gap between Beijing's insistence upon \"One China\" and Mr Chen's stress on Taiwan's right to self-determination can be bridged.",

      "body": "<p>A month after Labour won the election, Tony Blair stood in the grey concrete of a vast estate in South London - as miserable a place as any - and promised \"no forgotten people, no one left out\".</p> <p>Today the government starts to redeem that pledge. The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal plans social engineering on a giant scale, rolling out into the worst 3,000 districts.</p> <p>The scale and ambition of this is monumental - by far the most difficult task the government has attempted, or is ever likely to.</p> <p>The risk of failure is frightening because if it doesn't work it may be years - if ever - that any government dares embark again on an assault on the roots of poverty.</p> <p>This takes us back to the days when Labour believed it could change society fundamentally. With good policies and enough money, people's lives can be transformed.</p> <p>The forces of conservatism drove all these neighbourhoods to far worse despair and degradation through unemployment and neglect.</p> <p>Now the forces of progress will show how to free them: the very word \"renewal\" signifies the left's old faith in redemption.</p> <p>It's all been tried before, the right says, with that \"nothing works\" cynicism they so relish. The poor are always with us, it's the human condition. Remember the slum clearances, they chuckle?</p> <p>Only look at the rhetoric that surrounded the \"cities in the sky\", the hated tower blocks. There was the Urban Programme in 1968, whatever happened to that? Only look, says the right, at the squillions squandered in the poorest places over the years.</p> <p>Renovation schemes, enveloping, decanting, recanting, it's all been done and what happens? Things fall apart again. Why will anything be different now?</p> <p>This stands a better chance than any programme yet. Eighteen policy action teams have burrowed into every cause and every solution to socially excluded neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Not a stone is left unturned in their dissection of bad estates, half empty as everyone escapes who can, while shops, banks, GPs and services flee. Crime and drugs make life hell.</p> <p>Using all these reports, today's renewal strategy will draw them together in a template for breathing life into urban deserts.</p> <p>As ever, employment comes first. Every expert on deprivation says it is what counts. Can work be found?</p> <p>Many new jobs will be created in the process of regeneration, as businesses and shops are brought back, new squads of neighbourhood wardens created, redoubled services of every kind employing residents, plus transport bringing outside jobs within reach.</p> <p>More money will pour in than ever before, the sum not revealed until July's spending review.</p> <p>This mighty programme will stretch the power of government to its very limit. The social exclusion unit (SEU) has produced some of the best reports from any government, drawing up new policy on many causes of poverty: teenage pregnancy, rough sleepers, school exclusions, children in care.</p> <p>Each report has been sent out to a cross-departmental committee to take action, but their success can't be judged for a long time.</p> <p>Do the SEU's levers work when pulled? It's one thing to frame perfect policy, quite another to reach down into the messy confusion of life out there and make it happen.</p> <p>The brightest young brains in government delight in the intellectual clarity of research, number-crunching and problem solving.</p> <p>Policy designers are not the ones who dirty their own hands with the frustrating, messy business of implementation.</p> <p>That's left to the local infantry on the ground, where it's far harder to recruit the same calibre.</p> <p>However, the Whitehall designers have set themselves public targets with public monitoring to check the success of every plan. Eventually transparent facts will hang out there for all to see and they will take the blame for failure.</p> <p>They have devised a self-punishing system, trying to change the most intractable of human behaviour, reaching into the puzzling heart of teenage girls' sex lives, or care-home runaways. Of all the tasks they have set themselves, today's is the mega one incorporating all the others: it will be the making or breaking of all the government's social policy.</p> <p>It may test the power of government to destruction, but it has every chance of being the best social programme ever.</p> <p>How is the implementation to work? They started with the key question: who's in charge here? These sprawling estates have dozens of departments providing every sort of service but who coordinates it all?</p> <p>Seventeen pilot schemes already up and running have tried to create an answer, with various degrees of success.</p> <p>The government's instinct was to seek out local community movers and shakers - vicars, head teachers, community leaders - hoping to turn them into engines of renewal. The idea was to avoid local authorities: isn't it they who sucked up vast funds and failed time and again?</p> <p>They wanted local partnerships with communities, councils and businesses working under some charismatic leader. The trouble is local community leaders are thin on the ground in such places. The bureaucratic burden is enormous.</p> <p>It takes force to bang heads together in all the local departments to make them pool resources.

      "bodyText": "A month after Labour won the election, Tony Blair stood in the grey concrete of a vast estate in South London - as miserable a place as any - and promised \"no forgotten people, no one left out\". Today the government starts to redeem that pledge. The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal plans social engineering on a giant scale, rolling out into the worst 3,000 districts. The scale and ambition of this is monumental - by far the most difficult task the government has attempted, or is ever likely to. The risk of failure is frightening because if it doesn't work it may be years - if ever - that any government dares embark again on an assault on the roots of poverty. This takes us back to the days when Labour believed it could change society fundamentally. With good policies and enough money, people's lives can be transformed. The forces of conservatism drove all these neighbourhoods to far worse despair and degradation through unemployment and neglect. Now the forces of progress will show how to free them: the very word \"renewal\" signifies the left's old faith in redemption. It's all been tried before, the right says, with that \"nothing works\" cynicism they so relish. The poor are always with us, it's the human condition. Remember the slum clearances, they chuckle? Only look at the rhetoric that surrounded the \"cities in the sky\", the hated tower blocks. There was the Urban Programme in 1968, whatever happened to that? Only look, says the right, at the squillions squandered in the poorest places over the years. Renovation schemes, enveloping, decanting, recanting, it's all been done and what happens? Things fall apart again. Why will anything be different now? This stands a better chance than any programme yet. Eighteen policy action teams have burrowed into every cause and every solution to socially excluded neighbourhoods. Not a stone is left unturned in their dissection of bad estates, half empty as everyone escapes who can, while shops, banks, GPs and services flee. Crime and drugs make life hell. Using all these reports, today's renewal strategy will draw them together in a template for breathing life into urban deserts. As ever, employment comes first. Every expert on deprivation says it is what counts. Can work be found? Many new jobs will be created in the process of regeneration, as businesses and shops are brought back, new squads of neighbourhood wardens created, redoubled services of every kind employing residents, plus transport bringing outside jobs within reach. More money will pour in than ever before, the sum not revealed until July's spending review. This mighty programme will stretch the power of government to its very limit. The social exclusion unit (SEU) has produced some of the best reports from any government, drawing up new policy on many causes of poverty: teenage pregnancy, rough sleepers, school exclusions, children in care. Each report has been sent out to a cross-departmental committee to take action, but their success can't be judged for a long time. Do the SEU's levers work when pulled? It's one thing to frame perfect policy, quite another to reach down into the messy confusion of life out there and make it happen. The brightest young brains in government delight in the intellectual clarity of research, number-crunching and problem solving. Policy designers are not the ones who dirty their own hands with the frustrating, messy business of implementation. That's left to the local infantry on the ground, where it's far harder to recruit the same calibre. However, the Whitehall designers have set themselves public targets with public monitoring to check the success of every plan. Eventually transparent facts will hang out there for all to see and they will take the blame for failure. They have devised a self-punishing system, trying to change the most intractable of human behaviour, reaching into the puzzling heart of teenage girls' sex lives, or care-home runaways. Of all the tasks they have set themselves, today's is the mega one incorporating all the others: it will be the making or breaking of all the government's social policy. It may test the power of government to destruction, but it has every chance of being the best social programme ever. How is the implementation to work? They started with the key question: who's in charge here? These sprawling estates have dozens of departments providing every sort of service but who coordinates it all? Seventeen pilot schemes already up and running have tried to create an answer, with various degrees of success. The government's instinct was to seek out local community movers and shakers - vicars, head teachers, community leaders - hoping to turn them into engines of renewal. The idea was to avoid local authorities: isn't it they who sucked up vast funds and failed time and again? They wanted local partnerships with communities, councils and businesses working under some charismatic leader. The trouble is local community leaders are thin on the ground in such places. The bureaucratic burden is enormous. It takes force to bang heads together in all the local departments to make them pool resources. It often asks too much of local activists, so today's strategy will include a new institute to train up a new breed of energetic community workers. Meanwhile, for lack of anyone else, local authorities are often taking the lead. (In one pilot local residents chose to exclude the local authority but, rightly, Whitehall panicked and insisted they be a partner.) As for joined-up government, a Cabinet Office report is damning about results so far: it will be very difficult. Places like Middlesbrough and Manchester now have a lattice of new action zones and schemes, not co-terminous, criss-crossing their patch, all of them good but hard to synchronise. So today expect a surprising degree of Whitehall control over all this renewal: if their research shows \"what works\", they'll be loth to let local authorities or even local residents choose what they want. In one pilot, residents wanted to spend on housing improvements but this scheme is not mainly for bricks and mortar (which has failed too often before) but for people: arts, sports, skills-training, after-school clubs, extra police, refuse collectors or wardens and the like. Since it is the government which will be judged in the end, letting go is very hard to do - even when research shows community enthusiasm is the vital ingredient. This will be hard going: there'll be endless such disputes. But this is the best chance there has ever been. It will take years, billions of pounds and a government undeterred when some of it fails and fails again. It will often feel thankless, and rarely excite even the mildest interest from the press. But this is what must deliver the promise to abolish child poverty. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

He did this with energy and enthusiasm, and with a clarity of vision and unflinching leadership. The tributes from so many sources show what an important contribution to the development of a multicultural Britain he has made: always willing to listen, engage and challenge whatever situation and whoever he encountered I worked closely with him for nearly 20 years to bring black and ethnic minority politics into the mainstream. This involved a searching analysis of history and geography, the impact of migration and colonialism, and how power is gained and exercised in favour of oppressed people. This led Bernie to conclude that the unity and purpose of the black and ethnic minority communities had to be harnessed: only then could we be in a position to be taken seriously. He united workers in industries and the public services through the Black Trade Unionist Solidarity Movement in the early 80s; pulled together the Labour party black section in pursuing seats in councils and in parliament; improved the bargaining position of agriculture workers in the Carribbean. The list could go on - the project needs to go on. Cllr Narendra Makanji, London Borough of Haringey \u0095 Bernie Grant MP remained his own man. He was prepared to criticise education standards in his own borough and refused to be muzzled. He was unfailingly polite whenever we met and was an outspoken champion on behalf of his Tottenham constituents. Voters have lost one of the few MPs on the Labour benches to stick to their principles. Cllr Peter Forrest",

It means that the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon - which he has pledged to complete by July - will be conducted under fire from Hizbullah guerrillas.</p> <p>\"We checked and we tried, and the answer today from the Syrians is that they are not ready yet for peace,\" Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, told Israel army radio.</p> <p>The report of new settlement activity is bound to draw a hostile response from Mr Clinton in talks that were due to get under way yesterday evening.</p> <p>Although Mr Barak's sudden trip to Washington was undertaken ostensibly to unblock negotiations with the Palestinians and clear the way for the declaration of an independent state in September, the expansion of the settlement at Katzrin now takes centre stage.</p> <p>\"As long as the Syrians continue to express their positions the way they have been expressing in the past few days - then there is no point to negotiations,\" Haim Ramon, the minister for Jerusalem, told Israeli radio.</p> <p>\"We must allow the residents of the Golan Heights to work, to develop, to approve housing if necessary.\"</p> <p>The message from Katzrin is intended for multiple audiences. It could be last-minute brinkmanship intended to concentrate the mind of Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, on reopening negotiations, and spare Israel the prospect of embarking on a promised withdrawal from south Lebanon that will leave its northern villages vulnerable to attack.</p> <p>It is equally aimed at appeasing Mr Barak's domestic audience. In recent weeks, even liberal Israelis have despaired at Mr Assad's determination to hold out for nothing less than a complete withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights.</p> <p>So too has Mr Clinton, who failed in a meeting with President Assad in Geneva last month to persuade him to consider proposals that would have allowed Israel to retain a sliver of the coastline around the lake.</p> <p>But the scenario created by the absence of a Syrian peace deal is alarming. In recent days Israeli authorities have begun to seek international support for its withdrawal from southern Lebanon.</p> <p>The lobbying is aimed at securing international commitments to a monitoring body - possibly drawn from the United Nations already in Lebanon - to provide stability in south Lebanon after the Israeli departure.</p> <p>Israel is also worried about international condemnation should it launch reprisals for any attacks on its territory from south Lebanon after Israeli troops have left.</p> <p>\"Barak is going to try to mobilise American support for having the UN or some kind of multilateral force - maybe French or Canadian - in Lebanon to legitimise Israel's withdrawal,\" said Efraim Inbar, a political scientist at Bar Ilan university.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the bulldozers ploughed up the earth for yet more settlers' homes in the occupied Golan Heights yesterday, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, arrived in Washington for a one-day summit with President Bill Clinton intended to nudge forward twin peace processes that now seem hopelessly stalled. The decision to construct another 200 homes at Katzrin, the largest settlement on the strategic plateau that was captured from Syria in the 1967 war, was the most visible sign yet that Mr Barak has given up hope of reviving peace talks with Damascus. It means that the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon - which he has pledged to complete by July - will be conducted under fire from Hizbullah guerrillas. \"We checked and we tried, and the answer today from the Syrians is that they are not ready yet for peace,\" Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, told Israel army radio. The report of new settlement activity is bound to draw a hostile response from Mr Clinton in talks that were due to get under way yesterday evening. Although Mr Barak's sudden trip to Washington was undertaken ostensibly to unblock negotiations with the Palestinians and clear the way for the declaration of an independent state in September, the expansion of the settlement at Katzrin now takes centre stage. \"As long as the Syrians continue to express their positions the way they have been expressing in the past few days - then there is no point to negotiations,\" Haim Ramon, the minister for Jerusalem, told Israeli radio. \"We must allow the residents of the Golan Heights to work, to develop, to approve housing if necessary.\" The message from Katzrin is intended for multiple audiences. It could be last-minute brinkmanship intended to concentrate the mind of Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, on reopening negotiations, and spare Israel the prospect of embarking on a promised withdrawal from south Lebanon that will leave its northern villages vulnerable to attack. It is equally aimed at appeasing Mr Barak's domestic audience. In recent weeks, even liberal Israelis have despaired at Mr Assad's determination to hold out for nothing less than a complete withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. So too has Mr Clinton, who failed in a meeting with President Assad in Geneva last month to persuade him to consider proposals that would have allowed Israel to retain a sliver of the coastline around the lake. But the scenario created by the absence of a Syrian peace deal is alarming. In recent days Israeli authorities have begun to seek international support for its withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The lobbying is aimed at securing international commitments to a monitoring body - possibly drawn from the United Nations already in Lebanon - to provide stability in south Lebanon after the Israeli departure. Israel is also worried about international condemnation should it launch reprisals for any attacks on its territory from south Lebanon after Israeli troops have left. \"Barak is going to try to mobilise American support for having the UN or some kind of multilateral force - maybe French or Canadian - in Lebanon to legitimise Israel's withdrawal,\" said Efraim Inbar, a political scientist at Bar Ilan university.",

Chipperfield gets animal licence A licence to keep wild animals at the family farm of the circus trainer Mary Chipperfield was granted yesterday despite opposition from animal welfare campaigners. The move sparked anger from Animal Defenders, whose undercover investigation at the Hampshire farm triggered an animal cruelty prosecution last year. Test Valley borough council said permission had been given to keep four camels and two zebras at Croft Farm in Over Wallop, near Andover, Hampshire. A thorough investigation had been launched into the application and there was \"no supportable reason\" why the licence should not be granted. The application is understood to have been made by Mrs Chipperfield's daughter, Suzanne, but the council refused to confirm or deny the name of the individual. Mary Chipperfield, 62, was convicted of cruelty to a chimpanzee in January last year and was fined \u00a37,500 last April. Her husband, Roger Cawley, was fined \u00a31,000 for cruelty towards a sick elephant, but no orders were made to prevent them from keeping or working with animals. Animal Defenders said 4,000 of their supporters, including the actresses Jenny Seagrove and Annette Crosbie and the former Take That singer Mark Owen, had objected to the application. They claimed the licence should have been denied because Suzanne Chipperfield was a director of Mary Chipperfield Promotions Ltd at the time of the trial. Ms Chipperfield, a circus performer, was unavailable for comment because of work commitments.",

Tam White, an Edinburgh-born singer and actor whose gravelly tones took over Robbie Coltrane's singing duties in Tutti Frutti and landed him the role of the MacGregor clan chief in Braveheart, was deemed to have too strong an accent. In Black and Blue, an adaptation of Ian Rankin's crime thriller to be broadcast next month, London-based TV executives had the Scottish musician's lines redubbed, using the voice of an unnamed actor on the grounds that English viewers might not understand his Scots tones. White plays debt collector Rico Briggs alongside John Hanna as Rankin's hard drinking Detective Inspector John Rebus. A London-based spokeswoman for STV and Clerkenwell Productions confirmed that White's lines were dubbed by another actor with \"less of an accent\".

      "bodyText": "Two new life saving cancer drugs, which some health authorities have rejected on grounds of cost, are expected to be recommended by the national institute for clinical excellence as standard treatments for women with breast and ovarian cancer. Cancer patients and charities greeted with delight yesterday the news, leaked to the BBC, of Nice's intentions. The body, set up by the government \"to end the lottery of postcode prescribing\" by comparing drugs and other treatments and issuing guidelines on what works best and is most cost-effective, is due to report on the group of cancer drugs known as the taxanes at the end of the month. The two drugs that seem set to get the green light are Taxol for early and late-stage ovarian cancer and Taxotere for advanced breast cancer. But whatever the recommendation from Nice, there are still doubts over whether all health authorities will be prepared to pay for the drugs, which cost \u00a310,000 a year per patient - even though the health secretary, Alan Milburn, has said that some of the \u00a32bn rise on health spending should go to funding Nice guidance. Gordon McVie, director general of the Cancer Research Campaign, said the guidance on the taxanes would leave health authorities \"with nowhere to hide. Hopefully, it will end the discrimination that has existed against NHS patients in favour of the private sector.\" The drugs have long been available in the United States. \"We are expecting any day now some sort of papal announcement from Nice that what is happening in the rest of the world can be allowed to happen in Britain too,\" said Professor McVie. He believed the drugs could benefit 4,000 to 5,000 ovarian cancer patients and 15,000 to 20,000 women with breast cancer. Both drugs have been licensed for some time - Taxol is licensed for both ovarian and advanced breast cancer but Nice is said to want more evidence of its effect on breast cancer before it will recommend that use. Professor McVie suggested Nice was lagging behind the research, which showed both drugs could prolong life if they were used in early-stage cancers. Jackie O'Donnell, 55, from Middlesbrough, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in November 1998, said the news was wonderful. She did not know of Taxol until she read about it. When she asked her consultant, he said he was not supposed to mention it to her because Tees health authority would not pay. \"If I had lived just two miles away, I could have had Taxol because the health authority in North Yorkshire did pay for it.

      "bodyText": "Detectives hunting the racist killers of Stephen Lawrence revealed yesterday that they have recovered a knife and a metal bar in the garden of the former home of two of the five original suspects. The discovery was made in the grounds of the former Acourt family home in Bournbrook Road, Eltham, close to where the teenager was stabbed to death in south-east London seven years ago. The house where the items were found is listed in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report as the home of suspects Jamie and Neil Acourt in 1993. It now has new occupants. Scotland Yard refused to say when the weapons were discovered or give details of who tipped it off. But deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of the racial and violent crimes taskforce, confirmed the knife and the bar had been sent for forensic analysis. The tests could take weeks. Although the police examined many knives in the aftermath of Stephen's murder on May 7 1993, they were never confident that they had identified the murder weapon. A red-handled kitchen knife with a 10in (25cm) blade was handed to police by the mother of Gaynor Cullen, who was the girlfriend of Gary Dobson, one of the original suspects. The weapon was shown again recently on a Crimewatch programme and is also being re-examined by scientists. The knife found recently is a similar size. If this were the weapon used to kill Stephen Lawrence, it would be a significant breakthrough for the Metropolitan police, which has never given up hope of successfully prosecuting the men who stabbed the 18-year-old student. Gary Dobson, Neil Acourt and Luke Knight were acquitted in 1996 of Stephen's murder when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family collapsed. The case against Jamie Acourt and David Norris was dropped before it reached court. Mr Grieve said yesterday: \"Not only are people now willing to speak to us, but there could also be new evidence. \"We know there are people out there who know exactly what happened to Stephen Lawrence and can give important evidence. \"They know that we are going to get justice for Stephen. What happened has preyed on their consciences for seven years. Now is the time to come and speak to us. \"Tell us what you know. It could just prove to be the final piece of the puzzle.\" Scotland Yard has been hinting for weeks that detectives are closer than ever to discovering what happened to Lawrence and seem confident they know who was responsible for his murder.

His initiative will be combined with plans to monitor poverty at local level using government statisticians to develop on-the-ground indicators of need. This means agencies, or councils, would be held to account if targets for reducing deprivation are not met. A ministerial group could be established to co-ordinate policy. Mr Prescott will also announce an immediate extension of the \u00a3800m New Deal for Communities programme from 17 pilot projects on some of the country's poorest estates to seven new areas. He will visit a rebuilt estate in Leytonstone, north-east London, to stress that neighbourhoods can be brought back to life with a renewal programme involving tenants, local agencies, government departments and town halls. Mr Prescott will signal a radical programme aimed at bringing the poorest communities up the prosperity league over the next decade by launching a national strategy for neighbourhood renewal. It talks of \"bridging the gap between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest of England\" It is based on the most detailed analysis of poverty yet undertaken in England following recommendations from a string of \"cross-cutting\" policy action teams working under the government's social exclusion unit. They have examined ways of curbing anti-social behaviour, creating new jobs, improving schools and creating more demand for homes in unpopular areas. In a preliminary report from the unit 18 months ago, ministers were told that the gap between the poorest communities and the rest of the country had grown dramatically over the past two decades. It highlighted 44 local authority districts which had the highest concentrations of deprivation in England with two thirds more unemployment than average, mortality rates 30% above the norm and three times the level of poor housing. But ministers have been keen to encourage local partnerships and \"active citizens\" with new community enterprises. The SEU has talked of \"dynamic local leaders with the power and resources to turn their community around\". The local government and regeneration minister, Hilary Armstrong, will today endorse plans for neighbourhood managers to handle complaints.",

In a move which raised fresh questions about government \"spinning\", one of the project's backers released a letter which directly challenged Downing Street's claim that ministers had been forced to abandon the northern laboratory. Ministers faced a backbench rebellion from north-west Labour MPs last month when the government decided to site the \u00a3500m synchrotron project at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory at Didcot, instead of at the Daresbury laboratory in Cheshire. Downing Street attempted to quell the revolt by claiming that its hand had been forced by the Wellcome Trust and the French government - the project's two other backers - who had demanded that the project be based in Oxfordshire. The Wellcome Trust yesterday rejected Downing Street's account by pointing out that it had only thrown its weight behind the Oxfordshire laboratory under pressure from the government. Michael Dexter, the trust's director, said that the government's Office for Science and Technology (OST) had \"persuaded\" him to support the Oxfordshire site at a meeting in April last year. \"Prior to the OST's recommendation we had not seriously considered any locations,\" Mr Dexter said in a letter to the leaders of Warrington and Halton borough councils. \"Government persuaded us that locating the synchrotron [in Oxfordshire] was the best way forward and we agreed to this in June 1999.\" Mr Dexter admitted, however, that the Wellcome Trust was reluctant to change its mind once it had opted for the Oxfordshire site.

      "byline": "Matthew Baylis",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> 'She wanted me not in the house... She had a new boyfriend.\" So spoke Mary, on the subject of her mother. Her relatives, visiting for Mary's birthday, glossed over this painful revelation, but as Cutting Edge: The Five Of Us (C4) demonstrated, being mentally handicapped doesn't stop people having strong feelings. </p> <p>Mary and four other adults with similar disabilities share a flat. If the standard flatmate wrangles - Who Ate My Cheese? and Who's Nicked The Hairdryer? - were absent, this didn't mean perpetual harmony prevailed. Between Mary and the turbulent Kwok, for instance, there existed a fraught relationship. \"Put her out of the room\", Kwok kept insisting, without much provocation. \"Plonker!\" was one of Mary's memorable retorts. The high emotion was not confined to rows, nor eased by the presence of cameras. </p> <p>The amiable lynchpin of the group, Luke, had to cope with his father's death - and a microphone in his face. \"What do you feel, Luke?\" the interviewer asked. \"My heart is closed\", he replied, with a dignity that hopefully shamed the prat interrogating him. As Luke swallowed tears, and his flatmates rallied round, it felt wrong to watch. The scrutiny defeated the point of the programme. One only needed minutes watching the flatmates to understand that they were just like us, with lives full of intrigue, jealousy and loss. Few of us needed a documentary team to point that out. And pointing a camera at people as they go about their most trivial business implies the opposite - that they are different to us, curious exhibits. This was docu-soap at its worst: intrusive and unkind. </p> <p>Unkind sums up the treatment dished out to 23-year-old Helen Smith by her local health authority (Home Ground: The Kindness Of A Stranger, BBC 2). Struck by meningitis, the gifted pianist underwent a quadruple amputation to save her life. Left with hooks instead of hands, and painful plastic legs, Helen petitioned her NHS doctors to refer her to a specialist prosthetic clinic. They refused. Her consultant sounded unrepentant - though his eyes avoided the camera. He expressed regret at her \"negative\" attitude. Cheerful optimism, we assume, would have made his job easier - though it would still have not resulted in a referral. \"It's equally unfair to everybody,\" he noted, \"but at least it's consistent.\" Well, thank God for that. </p> <p>Fortunately, the story took a fairytale twist when an Essex businessman came up with the cash. Helen was fitted with new limbs, and progressed from being suicidal to displaying stoical courage. \"Maybe that's why it happened to me and no one else,\" she said, applying mascara with a hi-tech hand, \"because I am able to cope.\" Her transformation was inspiring. Less satisfying, particularly in light of the title, was the sketchy appearance of her benefactor, Danny Watts, at the very end. Clearly, anyone who gives \u00a325,000 to a complete stranger has their own story, but Danny wasn't telling. </p> <p>Shouting is a tactic cherished by South Africa's Task Force (Channel 5). \"It allows them to dominate a room with their voices, rather than guns.\" Teachers have been doing this for centuries, of course, but few of the STF look like they spent long in the classroom. Using a combination of bellowing and bullets, this crack squad is taking on South Africa's increasingly violent criminals, as corruption rots the traditional police force. </p> <p>The average bobby makes \u00a350 a month, before bribes. The STF, who train with live ammo, make much more. This is only fair.

      "bodyText": "'She wanted me not in the house... She had a new boyfriend.\" So spoke Mary, on the subject of her mother. Her relatives, visiting for Mary's birthday, glossed over this painful revelation, but as Cutting Edge: The Five Of Us (C4) demonstrated, being mentally handicapped doesn't stop people having strong feelings. Mary and four other adults with similar disabilities share a flat. If the standard flatmate wrangles - Who Ate My Cheese? and Who's Nicked The Hairdryer? - were absent, this didn't mean perpetual harmony prevailed. Between Mary and the turbulent Kwok, for instance, there existed a fraught relationship. \"Put her out of the room\", Kwok kept insisting, without much provocation. \"Plonker!\" was one of Mary's memorable retorts. The high emotion was not confined to rows, nor eased by the presence of cameras. The amiable lynchpin of the group, Luke, had to cope with his father's death - and a microphone in his face. \"What do you feel, Luke?\" the interviewer asked. \"My heart is closed\", he replied, with a dignity that hopefully shamed the prat interrogating him. As Luke swallowed tears, and his flatmates rallied round, it felt wrong to watch. The scrutiny defeated the point of the programme. One only needed minutes watching the flatmates to understand that they were just like us, with lives full of intrigue, jealousy and loss. Few of us needed a documentary team to point that out. And pointing a camera at people as they go about their most trivial business implies the opposite - that they are different to us, curious exhibits. This was docu-soap at its worst: intrusive and unkind. Unkind sums up the treatment dished out to 23-year-old Helen Smith by her local health authority (Home Ground: The Kindness Of A Stranger, BBC 2). Struck by meningitis, the gifted pianist underwent a quadruple amputation to save her life. Left with hooks instead of hands, and painful plastic legs, Helen petitioned her NHS doctors to refer her to a specialist prosthetic clinic. They refused. Her consultant sounded unrepentant - though his eyes avoided the camera. He expressed regret at her \"negative\" attitude. Cheerful optimism, we assume, would have made his job easier - though it would still have not resulted in a referral. \"It's equally unfair to everybody,\" he noted, \"but at least it's consistent.\" Well, thank God for that. Fortunately, the story took a fairytale twist when an Essex businessman came up with the cash. Helen was fitted with new limbs, and progressed from being suicidal to displaying stoical courage. \"Maybe that's why it happened to me and no one else,\" she said, applying mascara with a hi-tech hand, \"because I am able to cope.\" Her transformation was inspiring. Less satisfying, particularly in light of the title, was the sketchy appearance of her benefactor, Danny Watts, at the very end. Clearly, anyone who gives \u00a325,000 to a complete stranger has their own story, but Danny wasn't telling. Shouting is a tactic cherished by South Africa's Task Force (Channel 5). \"It allows them to dominate a room with their voices, rather than guns.\" Teachers have been doing this for centuries, of course, but few of the STF look like they spent long in the classroom. Using a combination of bellowing and bullets, this crack squad is taking on South Africa's increasingly violent criminals, as corruption rots the traditional police force. The average bobby makes \u00a350 a month, before bribes. The STF, who train with live ammo, make much more. This is only fair. Many, like Inspector Ashley Crooks, have spiritual dilemmas to contend with. \"Thou shalt not kill is written in the Bible\", he mused, after slaying several hijackers. Then a new call came in on the radio, and Ashley abandoned his theological deliberations to fetch some armour-piercing bullets. But later, after more crims were pushing up daisies, Ashley confided his greatest fear. This is neither divine wrath, nor dying in a hail of bullets - which the STF regard as a form of promotion.

      "body": "<p>The voice at the end of the phone was faint. \"Hello, hi Hansie,\" said the voice. \"Hello, hi Sanjay,\" came the reply. The accent was curious - South African perhaps? Detectives from Delhi police, who had been monitoring the cellphones of several businessmen as part of a low-key extortion investigation, were baffled. Why was an Indian bookmaker called Sanjay Chawla talking to a South African man on his mobile phone? And who was he? </p> <p>Over the next three weeks the answer became clear. Officers from the Indian police crime branch had sought authorisation last month for phone taps as part of the extortion inquiry. Listening in, they swiftly realised they had stumbled upon something much bigger. Both \"Hansie\" and \"Sanjay\" kept referring to the \"pitch\" and \"players\". Other names were mentioned too - Herschelle Gibbs, Nicky Boje, Pieter Strydom, and Henry Williams. This was not about extortion but cricket, the officers concluded, dazed. </p> <p>Almost immediately after transcribing the first telephone call on March 13, crime branch officers identified Chawla's interlocutor. He was none other than South Africa's cricket captain, Hansie Cronje. </p> <p>Cronje's side had arrived in India on March 9 for a series of one-day matches. The man with the curious accent had identified himself as being in room 346 of the Taj Palace hotel in Delhi. \"You can come in,\" he had told Chawla, who was in the lobby. \"See you in two minutes.\" </p> <p>Detectives checked the hotel's records. There could be no mistake. Cronje, regarded as one of the game's most honest players, with a spiritual side unusual in a modern cricketer, was staying in room 346. </p> <p><strong> Betrayal</strong><br> As the series went on, the crime branch pieced together an astonishing picture of what appeared to be match-fixing, bribery, corruption and betrayal at the highest levels of cricket. The web stretched across continents - from India, where the games were being played, to London, where Chawla had lived for the past eight years, and to South Africa. </p> <p>Millions of pounds are routinely bet across Asia on the outcome of one-day matches. But the big money, for those in the know, was to be made on forecasting - accurately predicting, for example, how many runs a player would score. </p> <p>\"And how many runs for Gibbs?\" Chawla asked Cronje in one of at least 10 conversations taped during the series. \"Less than 20,\" he replied. \"Less than 20?\" Sanjay queried. \"Yeah,\" Cronje said. </p> <p>Detectives put together more pieces of the jigsaw. The transcripts of what would become the Cronje tapes yielded other names. They included Rajesh Kalra, an Indian contact of Chawla's who helped arrange the bookmaker's frequent trips to the sub-continent from his home in London. Another name was that of Krishan Kumar, a failed Bollywood actor. Kumar raised funds to pay bribes for match-fixing, police believed. The funds came from a series of shadowy moneybrokers, or hawalas, who operate across Asia and the Gulf. Money is lent on the basis of trust; there is no documentation. As many as 200 hawalas could be involved in a single transaction. </p> <p>By March 19, when the series ended with South Africa's 3-2 defeat, the head of Delhi police's crime branch, KK Paul, felt he was on solid ground. He had obtained \"compelling evidence\" of Cronje's involvement in match-fixing. Nearly 40 pages of transcripts had been recorded. In the most damning section, Cronje refers to the guys \"wanting\" 25 each. \"So that's 75 for those three ... and what can you pay me? I do not know how much you pay me.\" \"You say,\" is Sanjay's reply. The two men agree on \"140 for everybody\". The \"140\" amounted to \u00a3320,000, police allege. </p> <p>Officers had also discovered that Chawla had trailed the South Africans around the country during the series. He had booked into the same hotels as the team: at Cochin, the venue for the first one-day international, now under suspicion; Faridabad, the third match, also suspect; at Bombay, the centre of India's illegal betting industry; and Bangalore. </p> <p>Chawla and Kalra had fallen out, officers discovered, after the match at Cochin did not go to plan, with the South Africans scoring more than 300 runs. \"It's a complete script written before the match and each part of the script has money on it. It appears part of this script went wrong,\" one officer said. Chawla had also travelled to South Africa in December, it emerged. The jigsaw was almost complete. </p> <p>On April 7, Dr Paul let off his bombshell. The crime branch of Delhi police formally registered a case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against Cronje and Chawla, on the basis of their taped telephone calls. It was the first time an international cricketer had ever been charged with match-fixing. \"We have unearthed an international racket in match-fixing and betting,\" Dr Paul said. </p> <p>\"The conversation reveals that money was paid. Indications are that the money was paid in London.\" The tapes, he insisted, were \"quite explicit\". Four other South African players - Gibbs, Boje, Stry dom, and Williams - were also named as being part of the conspiracy. Rajesh Kalra was arrested at his plush home in an upmarket Delhi colony. Chawla had skipped back to Britain, where he vanished. </p> <p>The reaction from South Africa was pained and incredulous. \"I have spoken to Cronje and he says it is absolute rubbish,\" Ali Bacher, the managing director of South Africa's cricket board declared. \"There is nothing in it at all.\" </p> <p>On Sunday, as Kalra was hauled before Delhi magistrates, hiding his face with a yellow towel, Cronje gave surfaced for the first time to give his denial. \"I want to make it 100% clear that I deny ever receiving any sum of money during the one-day international series in India. The only way to clear my name is to speak to the players and to check my bank account.\" </p> <p><strong> Turmoil</strong><br> Relations between South African and India were plunged into turmoil by the affair, with South Africa's high commissioner to Delhi, Maite Nkoane-Mashabane, paying a sceptical visit to India's foreign ministry, demanding that the tapes be handed over. South Africa's press, meanwhile, pronounced Cronje innocent. It's NOT our Hansie, the Sunday Tribune declared. The headline would soon look foolish. Indian officials privately complained of double standards from the South African media, verging on racism. </p> <p>A giant storm was breaking on Cronje's head. Delhi police requested help from Interpol to examine his bank accounts in London. Kalra, meanwhile, was proving a useful detainee; fresh details of meetings between Cronje and Chawla spilled out. </p> <p>Officers searched Chawla's three-storey family home in the Delhi suburb of Noida for details of his travel movements in recent months.

The pharmaceutical industry claims that its \u00a340m annual profit from vaccines in the UK does not leave sufficient margins to allow it to pay a levy into a fund for the families of damaged children. Under the 1979 vaccine damage payments act, some families of children suffering 80% or more brain damage following immunisation received a one-off payment of \u00a310,000, a sum which has now risen to a maximum of \u00a340,000.

      "bodyText": "A parliamentary committee is to investigate the phenomenon of air rage following allegations that passengers are not being warned of the health risks involved in long-haul travel. The Lords science committee is to call executives from British airlines and ask them to answer accusations that they have been reducing leg room and lowering the quality of air in cabins to boost profits. Increasing scientific evidence suggests lower cabin air quality, the ever closer cramming of passengers, and excessive supply of alcohol are adding to air travel stress and illnesses. The inquiry follows growing complaints that airlines and doctors are doing next to nothing to explain the dangers of lengthy air travel, especially to passengers prone to hardening of the blood or respiratory diseases. The inquiry has in part been prompted by the 75-year-old Lord Graham of Edmonton, who spent a week in hospital and six weeks on medication following a flight from New Zealand. Lord Graham, who is to give evidence to the six-month inquiry, contracted deep vein thrombosis, a potentially fatal illness. He said yesterday: \"Blood thickens at 30,000 feet, especially if the space between seats is tight, no one is encouraged to walk around, and passengers are offered more and more alcohol the whole time rather than water.\" He claimed leg room in British-owned airlines, especially on charter flights, was lower than elsewhere. He said economists had provided evidence showing the overall cost to the health service from air travel-induced sickness was well in excess of that of providing basic advice on how to avoid illnesses, including taking aspirin as a blood thinner. The chairwoman of the inquiry, Lady Wilcox, said yesterday: \"There is more and more anecdotal evidence that people get off planes thinking there are things wrong with them. \"Our job will be to separate the science from the fiction. It comes at a time when the airlines are planning to build these new super jumbos big enough to take 1,000 people non-stop to Australia. There is clearly more stress because people are less willing to be to be herded about and messed around.\" Her view has been echoed by Helen Muir at Cranfield University's college of aeronautics. She claims that the stress of longer and more frequent flights leads to disruptive passengers. Consumer campaigners point out that fresh air in the cabin requires more fuel and airlines are free to save on fuel costs by setting their own rates of circulation in the passenger cabin as long as they conform with the requirement on air quality. On Airbus aircraft, a high air flow setting increases fuel costs by 1%. Airbus and Boeing claim they change air quality once every two minutes, far more than occurs in offices. However, the space in aircraft cabins is much more confined and the flow can reduce when the plane is on the ground. Air pressure is normally equivalent to the atmospheric pressure at 8,000 feet. The effect has been reported as equivalent to breathing air containing around 15% oxygen compared with 21% at sea level.",

Diane's rummaging through her letters, a notette from the bank, something formal from Labour Women. Then she gets to the Filofax. \"I want to move now to ter rorism,\" says Sir David Madel. Giggles all round. Terrorists love these weapons, nasty and cheap. Or as Colonel Terry Taylor, the assistant director of the Institute for Strategic studies and weapons inspector, says, they give a good return on the pound. If anyone fancies remaking Dr Strangelove, Col Terry's your man. The red purse is out again. Saks, Fifth Avenue. Sir John Stanley gets moist around the collar. He takes out his papers, almost waves them in the air. We need to be told about these weapons. \"Do the public have knowledge of the sheer horror of these weapons?\" He quotes Robin Cook from February 4 1998: \"If 100kg of anthrax were released from the top of a tall building in a densely populated area it could kill three million people.\" Oh come off it, say Col Terry and his sidekick Dr Trevor. This is just scaremongering, an unfortunate statement from the foreign secretary. Why is it unfortunate, ask the committee. \"You're stretching the limits of credibility technically and scientifically.\" He says this is nothing more than a guesstimate dependent on any number of variables - like the weather and our lungs' ability to absorb the poison. Diane looks up from her nails. What's all this about collusion between the weapons inspectors and the CIA? Haven't got a clue, answers Col Terry. Back to the Filofax.",

Estrada has taken only a few months.\"</p> <p>A recent survey shows growing public opprobrium against the 62-year-old \"people's champion\", who made his name playing Robin Hood roles in more than 70 films before moving into politics. When Mr Estrada, known as Erap to his devotees, took office in May 1998 his approval rating was 60%. This month it was 5%.</p> <p>Nepotism and cronyism are proving his downfall. His seven wives (according to most estimates), 10 children (at the latest count) and numerous movie star pals have won dubious contracts - one actor recently won the right to provide Manila's fire engines.</p> <p>\"It's so blatant and lacks so much finesse it disgusts me,\" said Narzalina Lim, a cabinet minister under the previous two presidents.</p> <p>Enter Sister Christine, a veteran campaigner against injustice and corruption. Last month she was fired as a director of the Philippine charity sweepstake office. She immediately went public, claiming she was sacked because she refused to approve the disbursement of millions of pounds to foundations controlled by Mr Estrada, his first lady, his eldest son and other cronies. \"They thought the people believed in them so much they could do what they want,\" Sister Christine said.</p> <p>This furore came hard on the heels of a stock market scandal in which Mr Estrada was accused of ordering the authorities to back off an insider dealing investigation involving a company owned by one of Mr Estrada's friends and in which his relations, and he himself according to many rumours, had invested vast sums.</p> <p>\"Filipinos understand nepotism and corruption but their tolerance for perfidy only goes so far,\" said the respected newspaper columnist Conrad Dequiros. \"Coming from such a widely respected person, the sweepstake scandal tipped the scales from tamana, or enough, to sobrana, or too much. After she spoke out [Estrada's position] suddenly went boom.\"</p> <p>Calls for Mr Estrada to resign are now daily fare in the media, as are reports of heightened separatist violence in the southern island of Mindanao. \"Erap's opponents, from the secessionists, to the revolutionaries and coup plotters, are using his unpopularity to make further demands, which in turn is undermining his position,\" Mr Dequiros said.</p> <p>Last Monday a number of groups launched the Exclamation Mark Movement, with a logo of an angled exclamation mark to \"demonstrate to Mr Estrada that he has to either shape up or ship out\", Maria Olaguer, one of the convenors, said.</p> <p>Mr Estrada has not taken the storm lying down. At a meeting of American businesspeople last week, he came out with all guns blazing: \"Overall, our economic performance is superior to that of the past two administrations. And yet, in the face of this record, some of my headline-grabbing opponents are asking me to resign! Hello!</p> <p>\"No wonder their exclamation point is reclining diagonally. It is too embarrassed to stand up for a cause that substitutes fantasies for facts and lunacy for logic. It is part of the hollow acoustics of a bankrupt and leaderless opposition. It has no political, legal or moral basis behind it.\"</p> <p>He argued that the Philippines had recovered from the 1997 Asian economic crisis faster than its neighbours.</p> <p>That, however, is only half the truth, according to Mr Dequiros. \"The reality is that the Philippines was in such trouble before the crisis, it had practically no collapsing to do.\"</p> <p>Mr Estrada still controls congress and the loyalty of his vice president, the opposition leader, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. And despite rumours of a coup last weekend, most people believe the military has been sufficiently depoliticised to make a takeover unlikely.</p> <p>But the situation is changing. \"Six months ago I thought there was no possibility of violent transition,\" Mr Dequiros said. \"Now I just don't know. I can't rule it out any longer.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christine Tan, who lives surrounded by young children in an unpainted house in the middle of a Manila slum, is hardly the archetypal whistle-blower on presidential corruption and cronyism. But this diminutive 69-year-old Catholic nun who rarely raises her voice above a lilting whisper, has generated such public outrage against the Philippines' film star-turned-president, Joseph Estrada, that many Filipinos are arguing over when, not if, a change of power will come. \"In a sense it's worse than [Ferdinand] Marcos now,\" she said, referring to the dictator who ruled the country for 21 years before being ousted in 1986. \"It took Marcos a few years to become really corrupt. Estrada has taken only a few months.\" A recent survey shows growing public opprobrium against the 62-year-old \"people's champion\", who made his name playing Robin Hood roles in more than 70 films before moving into politics. When Mr Estrada, known as Erap to his devotees, took office in May 1998 his approval rating was 60%. This month it was 5%. Nepotism and cronyism are proving his downfall. His seven wives (according to most estimates), 10 children (at the latest count) and numerous movie star pals have won dubious contracts - one actor recently won the right to provide Manila's fire engines. \"It's so blatant and lacks so much finesse it disgusts me,\" said Narzalina Lim, a cabinet minister under the previous two presidents. Enter Sister Christine, a veteran campaigner against injustice and corruption. Last month she was fired as a director of the Philippine charity sweepstake office. She immediately went public, claiming she was sacked because she refused to approve the disbursement of millions of pounds to foundations controlled by Mr Estrada, his first lady, his eldest son and other cronies. \"They thought the people believed in them so much they could do what they want,\" Sister Christine said. This furore came hard on the heels of a stock market scandal in which Mr Estrada was accused of ordering the authorities to back off an insider dealing investigation involving a company owned by one of Mr Estrada's friends and in which his relations, and he himself according to many rumours, had invested vast sums. \"Filipinos understand nepotism and corruption but their tolerance for perfidy only goes so far,\" said the respected newspaper columnist Conrad Dequiros. \"Coming from such a widely respected person, the sweepstake scandal tipped the scales from tamana, or enough, to sobrana, or too much. After she spoke out [Estrada's position] suddenly went boom.\" Calls for Mr Estrada to resign are now daily fare in the media, as are reports of heightened separatist violence in the southern island of Mindanao. \"Erap's opponents, from the secessionists, to the revolutionaries and coup plotters, are using his unpopularity to make further demands, which in turn is undermining his position,\" Mr Dequiros said. Last Monday a number of groups launched the Exclamation Mark Movement, with a logo of an angled exclamation mark to \"demonstrate to Mr Estrada that he has to either shape up or ship out\", Maria Olaguer, one of the convenors, said. Mr Estrada has not taken the storm lying down. At a meeting of American businesspeople last week, he came out with all guns blazing: \"Overall, our economic performance is superior to that of the past two administrations. And yet, in the face of this record, some of my headline-grabbing opponents are asking me to resign! Hello! \"No wonder their exclamation point is reclining diagonally. It is too embarrassed to stand up for a cause that substitutes fantasies for facts and lunacy for logic. It is part of the hollow acoustics of a bankrupt and leaderless opposition. It has no political, legal or moral basis behind it.\" He argued that the Philippines had recovered from the 1997 Asian economic crisis faster than its neighbours. That, however, is only half the truth, according to Mr Dequiros. \"The reality is that the Philippines was in such trouble before the crisis, it had practically no collapsing to do.\" Mr Estrada still controls congress and the loyalty of his vice president, the opposition leader, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. And despite rumours of a coup last weekend, most people believe the military has been sufficiently depoliticised to make a takeover unlikely. But the situation is changing. \"Six months ago I thought there was no possibility of violent transition,\" Mr Dequiros said. \"Now I just don't know. I can't rule it out any longer.\"",

Judges in the east German city of Stralsund followed the advice of federal state prosecutors and imprisoned the five, aged between 17 and 20, to near maximum terms for young offenders after concluding that they had been motivated by sheer \"hatred of foreigners\". It was the first time that federal prosecutors had taken over the prosecution from the local judiciary. Both the government and the federal prosecutor's office have been alarmed by an increase in attacks on foreigners in the east and the comparatively lenient sentences passed down by local courts. Germany's image abroad is considered to have suffered as a result. The federal prosecutor Kay Nehm declared last January that he would take over the case because the accused and their like \"threatened the internal security of Germany\". The court heard how the five youths got drunk at a fair in the east German town of Eggesin last year and chased two Vietnamese men aged 28 and 29 through the streets. Two of the five then attacked their victims, kicking them with their boots and punching them to the ground before \"jumping repeatedly on their heads\". Experts doubted whether yesterday's verdicts would have any long term deterrent effect. \"The consensus in Germany is still that foreigners are undesirable,\" said the journalist and neo-Nazi expert Burkardt Schr\u00f6der. \"These youths see themselves simply as the executors of the public's will.

While the three-day event is likely to be dominated by questions of trade, security and Asian economic instability, local people are determined to highlight matters closer to home.</p> <p>Since 1945, when Okinawa became the only Japanese land territory to be invaded by the allies, the island has been turned into a massive military fortress. It was a crucial staging post in the Vietnam war, and is now home to 75% of US personnel in Japan, including 17,000 marines - the most intense concentration of US firepower outside America. The writer and Japan expert Murray Sayle calls Okinawa America's 51st state - its aircraft carier.</p> <p>For Washington and Tokyo, the relationship has been largely of mutual benefit. On its side, the US has been able to preserve its dominance in the Asia-Pacific region against the perceived threats of China and North Korea, at relatively little expense. The Japanese government's subsidy to the US military reached $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) last year and pays for virtually all non-military costs for the Okinawan bases, from cutting the lawn and running bowling alleys to providing water and electricity, and educating the marines' children.</p> <p>As John Metterle, commanding officer of Futenma, one of the largest marine bases in Okinawa, put it: \"Were the community to decide we weren't a friendly neighbour, I suppose they could cut us off and then we'd be in a hum.\"</p> <p><b> Subsidy</b><br></p> <p>For its part, Japan has had its security needs catered for by an outside power. Though there is increasing grumbling in Tokyo about the size of the subsidy (Japan pays about three times as much as Germany to host the American bases), there is an acceptance that the economic success story of post-war Japan has in part been thanks to the relative peacefulness of the region that the Americans have helped to sustain.</p> <p>But for the Okinawans themselves the story is not that simple. With about a fifth of the island swallowed up by 37 American military installations, local people are constantly reminded that the first US troops landed in Okinawa 55 years ago and have never left.</p> <p>\"It is often said that the bases are not located in Okinawa, but Okinawa [is] located among the bases,\" said Tateo Kishimoto, the mayor of Nago where the G8 summit will be held. Some 8,000 Okinawans work in the bases and that figure rises to 36,000 if service providers dependent to varying degrees on the Americans, such as shopkeepers and bar owners, are included.</p> <p>But against that is the disadvantage of having a fifth of Okinawa's most fertile land taken up by the bases, hindering the growth in local businesses. The value of the bases to the local economy has also declined over time, from about 35% of GDP in the 1950s to barely 5% today, calculates Professor Moritake Tomikawa, an economist at Okinawa International University.</p> <p>Socially, too, there are subterranean tensions. They exploded in 1995 when three US marines raped a 12-year-old local girl on her way home from school. Huge protests followed. Since then the marine command has imposed tough restrictions on off-base drinking, and a curfew on personnel entering the red-light districts of central Okinawa, where fighting had become a fixture of GI life. \"We've also introduced a new dress code, as a marine who dresses well is more likely to behave well,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Owermohle. \"Now an off-duty marine has to wear clothing suitable for a young professional, rather than a high-school student.\"</p> <p>In an effort to assuage local feeling, the Americans are making further concessions by proposing to relocate the Futenma airbase to a new site offshore. Recent polls suggest that about 60% of Okinawans are opposed to the plans unless a time limit of 15 years is placed on the new heliport. Otherwise, they fear the relocation will merely be used to extend the US presence indefinitely.</p> <p>When Mr Clinton visits he will find it difficult to avoid these underlying resentments. \"It is true that Japan has enjoyed its post-war prosperity because of the US-Japanese peace treaty, but we would like President Clinton to see that we shoulder an excessive burden,\" said Keiichi Inamine, governor of Okinawa.</p> <p>Kiyomi Shimamoto made the same point from a more personal perspective. \"I don't know if the bases have been good or bad; I just felt over the years that my individuality had been denied,\" she said.</p> <p>A few weeks ago she finally tracked down her father in Illinois, where he is a fire brigade captain. When she asked him whether he would accept her as his daughter, he broke down and cried. He had waited a long time for her call, he said, and yes of course she was his child.</p> <p>\"He says he wants me to visit him in America. But he warned me that if I do he may never let me come back to Okinawa. This time he says he won't let me go.\"</p>",

The writer and Japan expert Murray Sayle calls Okinawa America's 51st state - its aircraft carier. For Washington and Tokyo, the relationship has been largely of mutual benefit. On its side, the US has been able to preserve its dominance in the Asia-Pacific region against the perceived threats of China and North Korea, at relatively little expense. The Japanese government's subsidy to the US military reached $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) last year and pays for virtually all non-military costs for the Okinawan bases, from cutting the lawn and running bowling alleys to providing water and electricity, and educating the marines' children. As John Metterle, commanding officer of Futenma, one of the largest marine bases in Okinawa, put it: \"Were the community to decide we weren't a friendly neighbour, I suppose they could cut us off and then we'd be in a hum.\" Subsidy For its part, Japan has had its security needs catered for by an outside power. Though there is increasing grumbling in Tokyo about the size of the subsidy (Japan pays about three times as much as Germany to host the American bases), there is an acceptance that the economic success story of post-war Japan has in part been thanks to the relative peacefulness of the region that the Americans have helped to sustain. But for the Okinawans themselves the story is not that simple. With about a fifth of the island swallowed up by 37 American military installations, local people are constantly reminded that the first US troops landed in Okinawa 55 years ago and have never left. \"It is often said that the bases are not located in Okinawa, but Okinawa [is] located among the bases,\" said Tateo Kishimoto, the mayor of Nago where the G8 summit will be held. Some 8,000 Okinawans work in the bases and that figure rises to 36,000 if service providers dependent to varying degrees on the Americans, such as shopkeepers and bar owners, are included. But against that is the disadvantage of having a fifth of Okinawa's most fertile land taken up by the bases, hindering the growth in local businesses. The value of the bases to the local economy has also declined over time, from about 35% of GDP in the 1950s to barely 5% today, calculates Professor Moritake Tomikawa, an economist at Okinawa International University. Socially, too, there are subterranean tensions. They exploded in 1995 when three US marines raped a 12-year-old local girl on her way home from school. Huge protests followed. Since then the marine command has imposed tough restrictions on off-base drinking, and a curfew on personnel entering the red-light districts of central Okinawa, where fighting had become a fixture of GI life. \"We've also introduced a new dress code, as a marine who dresses well is more likely to behave well,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Owermohle. \"Now an off-duty marine has to wear clothing suitable for a young professional, rather than a high-school student.\" In an effort to assuage local feeling, the Americans are making further concessions by proposing to relocate the Futenma airbase to a new site offshore. Recent polls suggest that about 60% of Okinawans are opposed to the plans unless a time limit of 15 years is placed on the new heliport. Otherwise, they fear the relocation will merely be used to extend the US presence indefinitely. When Mr Clinton visits he will find it difficult to avoid these underlying resentments. \"It is true that Japan has enjoyed its post-war prosperity because of the US-Japanese peace treaty, but we would like President Clinton to see that we shoulder an excessive burden,\" said Keiichi Inamine, governor of Okinawa. Kiyomi Shimamoto made the same point from a more personal perspective. \"I don't know if the bases have been good or bad; I just felt over the years that my individuality had been denied,\" she said. A few weeks ago she finally tracked down her father in Illinois, where he is a fire brigade captain. When she asked him whether he would accept her as his daughter, he broke down and cried. He had waited a long time for her call, he said, and yes of course she was his child. \"He says he wants me to visit him in America. But he warned me that if I do he may never let me come back to Okinawa. This time he says he won't let me go.\"",

Robert Ray, who took over the investigations into Mr Clinton when Mr Starr stepped down last October, said yesterday that the investigation into the Lewinsky affair remained open and that he was \"actively\" considering bringing criminal charges against Mr Clinton when he became an ordinary citizen again on January 20 2001. The news that the Lewinsky affair may end up blighting not just Mr Clinton's presidency but also his ex-presidency, too, brought a mixture of resignation and condemnation from the White House. \"Nearly $100m [\u00a360m] has been spent on investigations into this administration and not one member of it has faced a felony charge as a result,\" an official said. Among the criminal charges that Mr Ray is still considering are obstruction of justice and perjury, exactly the same charges on which Mr Clinton was unsuccessfully impeached last year after the Starr report on the Lewinsky affair in 1998. Other possible charges include making false statements and conspiracy to commit the other crimes. As a sign that he means business and is not winding down his activities, Mr Ray has recruited six new lawyers on to his payroll, as well as a new investigator, to replace others who have left. Another FBI agent has been seconded to the continuing investigation. Mr Ray said yesterday that he intended to spend a further $3.5m on the investigation over the next six months, on top of the more than $52m spent by Mr Starr, who spent four years on the case. A White House source said these sums meant that Mr Clinton's opponents had now spent almost as much money trying to get him out of office since 1996 as they did in attempting to defeat him in the 1996 presidential election. \"It is an open investigation,\" Mr Ray said in yesterday's Washington Post. \"There is a principle to be vindicated, and that principle is that no person is above the law, even the president of the United States. That is what we have been charged with doing.\" In the past, Mr Ray has only said that he would not make any final decisions about whether to bring further charges against Mr Clinton until after November.

      "body": "<p>Pity anyone still involved however remotely with Huntingdon Life Sciences. The company, which tests animals for the pharmaceutical industry, has been under extreme physical and financial siege for several years. Exposed on TV and in this newspaper for its treatment of puppies, it has been taken to court and heavily fined, told to clean up its act by the government, seen its share price drop to an all-time low and its scientists vilified and threatened. Its major shareholder, the financial house Phillips and Drew, has received bomb threats and now the remaining investors are not just being targeted by individual letter, but by personal protest outside their houses.</p> <p>This week, the attention turned to the formerly anonymous David Braybrook, a pensioner aged 70. Like 1,700 other investors - whose names and addresses are easily found in Company House in London - he had been sent a letter some months ago by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection Reform Group (AVRG). Unless he sold his shares within a week, he was told, he was liable to have his home picketed. Although several hundred investors sold up on receipt of the letter, Braybrook did nothing and on Monday, after receiving a telephone call warning him that the protest would take place, he opened his door to be met by a crowd of protesters including a man dressed as a beagle.</p> <p>The protest was short, sharp, peaceful and made its point. Braybrook, clearly shocked, had a series of 5ft-tall photographs, showing animal cruelty at Huntingdon Life Sciences some years ago, plastered across his walls and underwent a separate ordeal by press. By yesterday, the protesters had moved on.</p> <p>But if Braybrook was shocked, so too, says Niel Hansen, one of the protesters outside his house, were many of the Huntingdon investors who received the AVRG's letter. \"Many had no idea that they had money invested in a vivisection company and were only too happy to sell. Many had no idea what Huntingdon Life Sciences did; in fact, one old lady phoned me up in tears because she was unaware she had invested in such a company. We had lots of replies to our letter with the vast majority in support of what we were doing. Only a few people were angry.\"</p> <p>Hansen now promises to expand the campaign to other Huntingdon investors. \"This was the first in a series of demonstrations with eight more planned. We will be circulating the names and addresses of shareholders to other independent groups and we hope they will start their own protests.\"</p> <p>Taking protest to individuals is not new, but taking it to anonymous members of the public rather than corporate chiefs or government ministers is. In the very old days - in the 80s - concerned investors or campaigners would most likely have written to the managing director and, reasonably politely, pointed out the error of his company's ways. A request would be made that something be done and mostly the company would duck and do nothing.</p> <p>By the late 80s, environment, consumer, human rights and animal campaigners were increasingly frustrated. They changed tack and began to get more actively involved. One of the tactics was to buy shares in companies, attend annual meetings in force and cause mayhem or deep embarrassment by asking awkward questions of the board of directors. It worked up to a point. Companies loathed the attention, but environmental and other issues were accepted marginally on to the corporate agenda.</p> <p>But in the 90s, direct action by individuals came of age, first at Twyford Down and then at Newbury. Environmentalists and other groups had no hesitation in naming names and exposing directors and government officials responsible for what they saw as destructive road-building policies. Activists in turn began taking their protests directly to the homes of chief executives and corporate chiefs. Arms dealers were outed, road-builders had their houses draped with banners, people sat on the roofs of the then transport minister Ian McGregor, and the head of Tarmac was \"visited\" by several hundred protesters.</p> <p>The personal approach became more common. In the US, the head of a large Japanese corporation which was responsible for much deforestation in the far east was reportedly so shocked about the scale of what his company was doing that he immediately changed the policy. Similarly, a direct approach to Malcolm Walker, the head of Iceland Foods, started the corporate flight from GM foods.</p> <p>Walker received six individually addressed letters from a group in Blackburn asking him what he was going to do about the novel foods and was intrigued because he had not even heard of genetic modification. Almost as soon as he found out, he asked his technical director to steer clear of them. The other supermarkets followed suit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ethical investments were becoming increasingly important, largely because of personal lobbying of groups and individuals. A campaign by People and the Planet, an umbrella group of students which is present now in every university, has managed to get the universities' pension funds to turn to ethical investments. Now, the pressure on other companies and local authorities which profess public accountability and social responsibility is extreme.</p> <p>But in the past few years the pressure to act in a socially and ethically responsible way has been turning to anyone who deals in money. With stockmarkets booming in an increasingly globalised world, and trillions of dollars now being moved every day between financial centres, the link between finance and environmental destruction and human rights abuses has been made with a vengeance. Protest has moved to those who have it, those who control it and those who influence where and how it is invested. The City, traditionally aloof or unaware of its power, has became a prime target.</p> <p>No one in the world of money, it seems, is now immune from protest. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the World Trade organisation, the giant regional development banks, stockbrokers, fund managers and now individuals are all being called to account. Protesters, in the US and the UK, are even turning to throwing pastries at anyone with unaccountable financial power.</p> <p>Jonathan Porritt, having run Friends of the Earth in the 80s, has seen the money protests develop over 20 years and has long campaigned to make the City more ethical. He sees a ratcheting up of the pressure being brought to bear. \"The City has argued for years that all that they are doing is investing other people's money, that they are just middlemen. That whole illusion is eroding fast.\" Part of the reason, he says, is that ethical or green funds are now doing as well as most conventional portfolios, and that new government regulations will force all companies to declare their policies on the environment and social issues, but some has been because of the campaigners.</p> <p>\"People don't like their names in lights. They're more sensitive now, more open to the impact on their reputations. I suspect that the sort of protests against Huntingdon, the personalising of the protest, will become much more common. The animal rights campaigners are drawing on a huge hinterland of support.</p> <p>\"This is the logical extension of direct action protest,\" says Tony Juniper, policy director of Friends of the Earth, which has recently targeted Norwich Union and helped organise the Newbury protests against individuals.</p> <p>\"The City is an important bastion, a source of enormous power that campaigners and activists have not been able to influence very much. But it's just sitting there. Most people have a stake in the City through their pension or insurance funds. But it's not the City's money, it's ours. This sort of protest turns faceless people into individuals.\"</p> <p>The City does not like the attention. In the past few years it has tried, unsuccessfully so far, to snuff out protest at shareholder meetings by preventing investors with only a few shares from attending. But after the June 18 riots last year and then the Huntingdon bomb threats, it has responded vitriolically.</p> <p>But the investors are beginning to pay attention to the criticisms levelled at it. The Prudential, with hundreds of billions of pounds worth of pension funds, has recently undertaken to pay more attention to ethics, and yesterday the Association of British Insurers, whose 450 members control \u00a3940bn of investments, said that companies are becoming more aware of their public images.</p> <p>\"They are now taking ethical considerations into account [when they invest in companies],\" said a spokeswoman. \"The protests seem eccentric rather than threatening. Protest is a factor now in investment, but not necessarily the most important.\"</p> <p>But the companies and industries that have been targeted are also appealing to higher authority. In the past few months, the pharmaceutical industry has called on the government to have legislation to clamp down on what it calls \"economic terrorism\". Huntingdon itself has written to Tony Blair urging him to bring \"extremist animal rights groups\" within the remit of terrorist legislation. The City, too, has also welcomed the massive police attention being paid to groups such as Reclaim the Streets which is planning to hold a weekend of protest over May day which may include action against City institutions.</p> <p>Yesterday, Braybrook was unrepentant, and becoming something of a hero for the City, which likes people not to bow to pressure. \"I won't have a man dressed as a beagle making up my mind for me,\" he told reporters. \"I am at liberty to buy what I like and it is my intention to leave the money where it is.\"</p> <p>This is not altogether surprising. Huntingdon shares have plummeted so deeply in the past year or two that investors can barely give them away.</p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Graham Diggines.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dresdner Bank is this week expected to unveil changes designed to give its merchant banking arm Dresdner Kleinwort Benson more autonomy. They will include a restructuring of top management to streamline links between the investment bank and Dresdner's managing board. The changes are expected to be approved at a board meeting this week, which will be overshadowed by the fall-out from the cancelled merger of Dresdner and Deutsche Bank. The merger failed after the two banks could not agree on the future of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. There is speculation in Frankfurt that a number of directors will lose their jobs in a radical shake-up of Dresdner's board. The German daily Handelsblatt reported yesterday that the supervisory board was poised to oust as many as six of the top 10 executives. The bank declined to comment. Dresdner's chief executive Bernhard Walter has already said he will step down at the end of this month because of the merger's collapse. His opposite number at Deutsche Bank, Rolf Breuer, yesterday received a vote of confidence from his boardroom colleagues. In a letter to staff signed by all managing board members - including Mr Breuer - the board said Mr Breuer would remain its spokesman and that he had the \"unrestricted support\" of the chairman of the supervisory board. Changes at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson have been under consideration for some time but are thought to have been put on hold by the merger talks with Deutsche. \"Dresdner Kleinwort Benson is such an important and profitable part of the bank the feeling is that the investment banking business should be recognised as such,\" according to one source. The collapse of the deal with Deutsche is believed to have left Germany's third largest bank vulnerable to a takeover bid, with America's Citigroup and France's BNP as the most likely suitors. Speculation about a link-up with Commerzbank is also gaining ground, and banking sources say there were contacts between the banks earlier this year. However, Dresdner is unlikely to begin merger moves until the dust has settled on its last attempt.",

      "body": "<p>Of the generation of incendiary Royal Court playwrights who rejuvenated British theatre in the mid-90s - Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Anthony Neilson, Jez Butterworth - Joe Penhall hardly seemed the talent most likely to succeed. A stranger to front pages - at least since he quit as crime correspondent for the Hammersmith Guardian - 32-year-old Penhall has made quiet progress since his electrifying 1994 debut Some Voices, which cast Ray Winstone as the mild-mannered elder brother of a young schizophrenic. Yet this week, the affable west Londoner becomes, officially, the first of that Bratpack to grow up, premiering his latest play, Blue/Orange, at the National Theatre. </p> <p>It's a turnaround. In the introduction to Methuen's edition of his Plays One - \"an optimistic title\", Penhall laughingly admits - he describes snubbing an invite from the National in 1997, because \"I couldn't think of a subject with Land Rovers and boulders in it.\" So what's changed? \"I thought, perhaps naively, that that was what was expected when one did a play at the National.\" Not so. When the theatre persevered, Penhall offered it one of two plays. \"One had lots of scenes, lots of characters, lots of story - it was very big and had a bit of everything. The other had three blokes and an orange.\" The latter got the nod. </p> <p>Penhall is a reluctant interviewee, not least because, last time we spoke his tongue wagged regrettably free. That was spring 1998, the time of his Donmar Warehouse drama of job insecurity, The Bullet. Elaborating on an observation, by Guardian critic Michael Billington that he was the most \"warm-hearted\" writer of his generation, Penhall slammed \"the notion that desperation is some sort of spiritual release which strikes a chord in all of us. What I'm saying is: no it fucking doesn't.\" His plays - which include 1995's Pale Horse and 1997's Love and Understanding - tend to explore what it means to be \"good, well-adjusted and unassuming\" in an age when, \"if you've got one shred of idealism... the shorthand for it is pedantic, anally retentive.\" </p> <p>There's a raging idealism at play in Blue/Orange, which should satisfy those who lament the absence of political theatre from the British stage. And that's political with a small \"p\": for Penhall, the political is always best dramatised by the personal. Blue/Orange returns to territory staked out by Some Voices, only this time, it assails care in the community - \"an exercise in cruelty and greed unparalleled in post-war England\", Penhall has written - not from the patient's perspective, but from the doctors'. \"The thing about the medical profession that fascinates me,\" says Penhall, \"is that, while I grew up with this idea that doctors were somehow unimpeachable, in fact there's as much salaciousness and dishonesty there as anywhere else.\" </p> <p>Blue/Orange demonstrates real anger at how that frailty is brought to the surface by NHS bureaucracy and low morale. \"I wanted to explore,\" says Penhall, \"the absurdity of legislating the criteria for providing care,\" which he describes as \"like holding a river in a sieve\". To do so, he propels the play's three characters into a whirlwind of bureaucracy, perverted political correctness and \"ugly, surreal, ungovernable, horrifying mental illness\" that recalls, and may surpass, Mamet's Oleanna. </p> <p> We have the statistics, and Joe Penhall's real-life experience of them, to thank for the addition of race into that potent brew. Black people are 12 times more likely to be diagnosed schizophrenic than whites. When Penhall worked with psychiatric patients in the US, \"one of the fellas I was looking after was this black guy who would wake up convinced he was white. I couldn't resist writing about that.\" In Blue/Orange, Chris thinks his dad is Idi Amin - and that oranges are blue. The racial theme was refined by an article Penhall read, \"saying 'Thank God for Prince Philip', because right-thinking white liberals secretly breathe a sigh of relief every time he unleashes one of his absurd racial gaffes. I was outraged,\" says the writer, although the duke's brand of bumbling chauvinism has been incorporated into Blue/Orange in an intriguingly ambiguous way. </p> <p>The main characters in the drama are a careerist senior doctor and the idealist underling with whom he's at war. Theirs has the making of a devastating on-stage confrontation - the more so because Penhall has wooed his favourite actor to star in it. \"I wrote Bill Nighy a letter. 'I hope I'm not being over-familiar, but, Bill, this is your play. I don't want anyone else to do it. There are notes you can only hear on a Steinway. There are songs that only Elvis can sing.' \" Clearly flattered, Nighy - erstwhile star of Stoppard's Arcadia - accepted, taking his place in a production overseen by Notting Hill director Roger Michell. </p> <p>There's fate at work here, because Penhall is involved in a film that's been dubbed - much to his disgust - \"the anti-Notting Hill\". His own adaptation of Some Voices, set in Shepherds Bush - a mile from the scene of Hugh and Julia's love-in - is due to debut at Cannes in May. \"One article said we were going to drive the house prices down,\" remarks Penhall of a movie - starring Daniel Craig, Kelly McDonald and David Morrissey - that realises the writer's ambition to bring schizophrenia, in all its grim complexity, to the screen. \"I spent a fair few years trying to get that film made,\" says Penhall, who based the original play's protagonist, Ray, on a friend with the illness. \"It was quite clear why it took so long: you can make a film about junkies, or a man beating his wife until there are bubbles coming out of her nose, but schizophrenia scares people or baffles them.\" </p> <p>Having waited half a decade, of course, two films come along at once: the producers of Wonderland and This Year's Love are set to bring Love and Understanding to the screen. Their writer is pleased, in his breezy, blokey way, about this; but thanks to Blue/Orange, which he's greatly enjoyed working on, Penhall is committed to writing for the stage. \"If you've got a big mouth,\" he says, with the widest smile, \"theatre, not the cinema, is the place to be.\" </p> <p>So can he handle the burden of expectation imposed by the National Theatre's recent run of ropey new plays? \"I do think about it,\" he admits, \"because it's quite clear that certain theatres are better than others at doing new work: some are the A-team, others can't even get off the bench.\" </p> <p>\"The thought of anyone depending on me is kind of horrific,\" he shudders. \"But I think they're big boys. They can look after themselves.\" It's that \"Land Rovers and boulders\" attitude again, the ambivalence of an instinctive subversive towards a pillar of the establishment. \"What I'm writing about in this play,\" says Penhall, \"is the arrogance and self-assurance of bourgeois liberalism. I think you can take it as read that those in positions of authority are almost invariably inadequate.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Blue/Orange opens on Thursday. Box office: 0171-452 3000.</p>",

His own adaptation of Some Voices, set in Shepherds Bush - a mile from the scene of Hugh and Julia's love-in - is due to debut at Cannes in May. \"One article said we were going to drive the house prices down,\" remarks Penhall of a movie - starring Daniel Craig, Kelly McDonald and David Morrissey - that realises the writer's ambition to bring schizophrenia, in all its grim complexity, to the screen. \"I spent a fair few years trying to get that film made,\" says Penhall, who based the original play's protagonist, Ray, on a friend with the illness. \"It was quite clear why it took so long: you can make a film about junkies, or a man beating his wife until there are bubbles coming out of her nose, but schizophrenia scares people or baffles them.\" Having waited half a decade, of course, two films come along at once: the producers of Wonderland and This Year's Love are set to bring Love and Understanding to the screen. Their writer is pleased, in his breezy, blokey way, about this; but thanks to Blue/Orange, which he's greatly enjoyed working on, Penhall is committed to writing for the stage. \"If you've got a big mouth,\" he says, with the widest smile, \"theatre, not the cinema, is the place to be.\" So can he handle the burden of expectation imposed by the National Theatre's recent run of ropey new plays? \"I do think about it,\" he admits, \"because it's quite clear that certain theatres are better than others at doing new work: some are the A-team, others can't even get off the bench.\" \"The thought of anyone depending on me is kind of horrific,\" he shudders. \"But I think they're big boys. They can look after themselves.\" It's that \"Land Rovers and boulders\" attitude again, the ambivalence of an instinctive subversive towards a pillar of the establishment. \"What I'm writing about in this play,\" says Penhall, \"is the arrogance and self-assurance of bourgeois liberalism. I think you can take it as read that those in positions of authority are almost invariably inadequate.\" \u0095 Blue/Orange opens on Thursday. Box office: 0171-452 3000.",

They were spoken by Lev Dodin, director of the Maly Theatre of St Petersburg, in Taormina, Sicily last weekend where he won the eighth annual European Theatre Prize. </p> <p>No award could be more richly deserved. At the moment, however, it is uncertain whether anyone here will get to see Dodin's new production of Brian Friel's Molly Sweeney, given its world premiere in Taormina. Partly it's a matter of cost: the Arts Council's National Touring panel initially jibbed at the application from a British producer for a \u00a3140,000 grant though they are now re-examining a lower figure. What is staggering is that they expressed doubts about the \"artistic qualities\" of Dodin's recent work. This seems mind-boggling. Alas, poor Lev: good enough for Europe and the world but not, it seems, for the Arts Council of England. </p> <p>Certainly Dodin is more famous for big ensemble productions such as Brothers and Sisters, an enveloping saga of Russian peasant life. Friel's play, in contrast, is an intimate three-hander about a blind woman who regains her sight after an operation and finds her world falling apart. Using intercut monologues delivered by Molly, her bumptious husband, and a whiskey-driven opthalmologist, it bears a strong resemblance to Friel's Faith Healer. But that, I suspect, explains Dodin's fascination with the play: its themes of spirituality, vision, the distinction between real and imaginary worlds are exactly those that animate his own work. </p> <p>Admittedly it wasn't easy to judge Dodin's production in Taormina. For a start there were no English surtitles. The production, played without interval, was also presented after a lengthy prize-giving ceremony and didn't finish till 1am. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Dodin's production struck me as intensely theatrical without betraying the text. Where Friel's original production was staged with austere simplicity, Dodin puts the three characters into huge, swivelling wicker chairs, and there is even a downstage swimming-pool into which Molly finally stumbles as she teeters between blindness and sight. Dodin's version also brings out the heroine's raw pain: at one point Tatiana Chestakova's diminutive Molly lets out a cry of soul-stirring anguish. The contained hysteria of her well-meaning husband and doctor, both of whom suffer a metaphorical blindness, added to the power of an impressive production: one which underlined Friel's crucial distinction between healing and curing. </p> <p>Dodin's own lifelong concern with spiritual values, theatrical vividness and ensemble acting were also on display in a rare revival of The House: the final part of a vast tetralogy about Russian village life, Brothers and Sisters, which is based on a novel by Fyodor Abramov. Set 20 years after the second world war, one theme stands out: the difficulty of being good in an imperfect world. </p> <p>The hero struggles to work the land even though failure has been programmed in by the Soviet collective. He, in turn, ostracises his sister trying to bring up illegitimate twins after being deserted by her husband. In the most touching scene of all an old woman berates her former communist husband for the rigours of their life together while fussing over his hair and collar. You realise that Dodin's project is the exploration of the Russian soul; and he does this with a team of actors who live as intensely in the moment as any I have ever seen. \"Theatre is acting,\" was the motto of one of Dodin's first teachers; and in the Maly he has created a company that reminds a promiscuously freelance culture such as ours what can be achieved by fellowship and permanence. One just hopes that a relationship with British audiences dating back to 1988 is not about to be brutally severed by the Arts Council.</p>",

The leaflets weren't advertising the return of Frank Sinatra or Freddie Mercury; instead they pointed audiences to Sadler's Wells and a ballet called The King. The idea of a 23-years-dead Elvis touring Britain was weird enough, but Elvis in blue suede point shoes? </p> <p>Peter Schaufuss, the Danish choreographer behind this odd event, talks in the matter-of-fact tones of one who feels his idea is so obvious that it doesn't merit an explanation. He was attracted to Elvis because \"he's a very well-known person - probably the best known human being\". There must be more to it than that, but the more Schaufuss speaks, the less enlightening he is. \"Elvis gives you a good story,\" he offers, \"a sad story of a multi-talented person who unfortunately became a drug addict.\" </p> <p>So Schaufuss didn't spend his childhood hunting out gold lam\u00e9 suits and bopping to Jailhouse Rock? Well, no: he was too busy dancing with the Royal Danish Ballet, where he began his career at the age of seven. </p> <p>Schaufuss's work on The King hasn't turned him into a fan, but he does admire some sides of Elvis's persona. \"Not only did he have a phenomenal music talent, he was also not afraid of a day's work. He would record an album in a week. Fantastic!\" </p> <p>It's easy to see why that attracts Schaufuss: he set up his own ballet company less than three years ago (having, in the previous decade, departed from the English National Ballet, the Berlin Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet), and since then has created eight full-length ballets. These include a version of Hamlet choreographed to recordings of John Gielgud reading the monologues, and a staging of the film Midnight Express. He's now planning a piece based on the life and works of Hans Christian Andersen. </p> <p>Point out the unusual nature of these works and Schaufuss bristles. \"I make pieces for a large, general audience and I can't see why anyone would have a problem with that. They're not going to see men in white tights with big sleeves, no. You can walk in straight from the street without having seen a play before, sit down and understand what you are seeing on stage and be entertained. </p> <p>\"You should always challenge your audiences,\" he continues, \"but not in such a way that they don't know what they've seen.\" Certainly, large, general audiences seem to have no problem with this: The King has been selling out venues wherever it tours. </p> <p>Schaufuss calls the piece a \"dansical\", explaining that it's a work where movement replaces singing, then quickly adds, \"We have got the best singer in the world singing his original songs.\" Like Elvis's later concerts, the show opens with Richard Strauss's Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 theme). It then follows Elvis's life chronologically through his music. </p> <p>\"I've listened to the 460 songs Elvis recorded,\" Schaufuss states blankly, \"and I've picked music mirroring what took place in Elvis's life at a particular time.\" </p> <p>We do get to see Elvis in gold lam\u00e9 rocking and rolling to That's Alright, Mama, but also more tender scenes to gospel numbers and Are You Lonesome Tonight?, a song that, for Schaufuss, summarises the whole Elvis story. \"I did consider calling the ballet Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" he says. \"That is a very appropriate title for something inspired by the legend of Elvis Presley. I've seen a clip from one of his last shows where he sings that song and actually cries: it shows a side of him that is very sad. I think it's a great tragedy that someone who had talent, good looks, a fortune, everything he wanted, ended up so lonely.\" Unsurprisingly, the hilarious recording of Elvis changing the lyrics to the song to mention baldness, as shown at Elvis - The Concert, doesn't come up. </p> <p>Off-putting sternness aside, it's good to see someone treating Elvis's later years with respect, when the tendency is to view him as a monstrous aberration gobbling fried peanut butter sandwiches. The King doesn't stint on white jumpsuited excess, but it does place Elvis in the context of serious art. The only music not directly related to Elvis in the piece is by Wagner - the Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde. \"That sounds outrageous,\" Schaufuss concedes, \"but Wagner's music is about gods and icons, and Elvis is a modern icon. It works very well.\" And if you thought you had no interest in the singer, Schaufuss is convinced that you'll walk out of his ballet with \"a very different opinion about Elvis\". </p> <p>\u0095 The King is at the Festival Theatre, Edinburgh (0131-529 6000), from April 17 to 22 and Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (0171-863 8000), from April 27 to May 6.</p>",

Peter Schaufuss, the Danish choreographer behind this odd event, talks in the matter-of-fact tones of one who feels his idea is so obvious that it doesn't merit an explanation. He was attracted to Elvis because \"he's a very well-known person - probably the best known human being\". There must be more to it than that, but the more Schaufuss speaks, the less enlightening he is. \"Elvis gives you a good story,\" he offers, \"a sad story of a multi-talented person who unfortunately became a drug addict.\" So Schaufuss didn't spend his childhood hunting out gold lam\u00e9 suits and bopping to Jailhouse Rock? Well, no: he was too busy dancing with the Royal Danish Ballet, where he began his career at the age of seven. Schaufuss's work on The King hasn't turned him into a fan, but he does admire some sides of Elvis's persona. \"Not only did he have a phenomenal music talent, he was also not afraid of a day's work. He would record an album in a week. Fantastic!\" It's easy to see why that attracts Schaufuss: he set up his own ballet company less than three years ago (having, in the previous decade, departed from the English National Ballet, the Berlin Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet), and since then has created eight full-length ballets. These include a version of Hamlet choreographed to recordings of John Gielgud reading the monologues, and a staging of the film Midnight Express. He's now planning a piece based on the life and works of Hans Christian Andersen. Point out the unusual nature of these works and Schaufuss bristles. \"I make pieces for a large, general audience and I can't see why anyone would have a problem with that. They're not going to see men in white tights with big sleeves, no. You can walk in straight from the street without having seen a play before, sit down and understand what you are seeing on stage and be entertained. \"You should always challenge your audiences,\" he continues, \"but not in such a way that they don't know what they've seen.\" Certainly, large, general audiences seem to have no problem with this: The King has been selling out venues wherever it tours. Schaufuss calls the piece a \"dansical\", explaining that it's a work where movement replaces singing, then quickly adds, \"We have got the best singer in the world singing his original songs.\" Like Elvis's later concerts, the show opens with Richard Strauss's Thus Spake Zarathustra (the 2001 theme). It then follows Elvis's life chronologically through his music. \"I've listened to the 460 songs Elvis recorded,\" Schaufuss states blankly, \"and I've picked music mirroring what took place in Elvis's life at a particular time.\" We do get to see Elvis in gold lam\u00e9 rocking and rolling to That's Alright, Mama, but also more tender scenes to gospel numbers and Are You Lonesome Tonight?, a song that, for Schaufuss, summarises the whole Elvis story. \"I did consider calling the ballet Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" he says. \"That is a very appropriate title for something inspired by the legend of Elvis Presley. I've seen a clip from one of his last shows where he sings that song and actually cries: it shows a side of him that is very sad. I think it's a great tragedy that someone who had talent, good looks, a fortune, everything he wanted, ended up so lonely.\" Unsurprisingly, the hilarious recording of Elvis changing the lyrics to the song to mention baldness, as shown at Elvis - The Concert, doesn't come up. Off-putting sternness aside, it's good to see someone treating Elvis's later years with respect, when the tendency is to view him as a monstrous aberration gobbling fried peanut butter sandwiches. The King doesn't stint on white jumpsuited excess, but it does place Elvis in the context of serious art. The only music not directly related to Elvis in the piece is by Wagner - the Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde. \"That sounds outrageous,\" Schaufuss concedes, \"but Wagner's music is about gods and icons, and Elvis is a modern icon. It works very well.\" And if you thought you had no interest in the singer, Schaufuss is convinced that you'll walk out of his ballet with \"a very different opinion about Elvis\". \u0095 The King is at the Festival Theatre, Edinburgh (0131-529 6000), from April 17 to 22 and Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (0171-863 8000), from April 27 to May 6.",

      "body": "<p>With the sacking of Hansie Cronje in South Africa yesterday, not just his reputation but that of cricket as a metaphor for all that is fair and true lies in tatters. </p> <p>Dark, brooding, beetle-browed Hansie, seen by colleagues and opponents alike as a man of absolute integrity and honesty, stands accused, along with three members of his team that toured India recently, of rigging matches, a scandal so deep that it would have been unimaginable a decade ago before the first rumbles began to emerge from the subcontinent. </p> <p>If he were to be found guilty, nailed by the evidence compiled painstakingly by the New Delhi police, he would be a ruined man, perhaps doubly so in a country that places its sports stars on the highest of pedestals. </p> <p>Already he has coughed to accepting between $10,000 and $15,000 (\u00a36,300-\u00a39,500) for providing \"information and forecasting\" to a bookmaker and, though he continues to maintain his innocence of match-fixing, his credibility is shot to pieces. He has lied until he could do so no longer, and doubtless the whole truth will out in dribs and drabs. </p> <p>\"Unequivocally, we are shattered,\" Ali Bacher, chief executive of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, said yesterday. \"The UCB and the government have been deceived.\" </p> <p>He might have added that a sports-obsessed nation has been betrayed. One feels for Bacher and South African cricket, for they have striven so hard for recognition and success and believed that they were almost there. The forthcoming one-day series against Australia has little meaning for them now. </p> <p>In uncovering this the Indian police have succeeded in exposing what may prove to be the biggest scandal in cricket history and one of the biggest in sport anywhere. </p> <p>Cricket has had its controversies - bodyline, throwing, the D'Oliveira affair and Packer - even down to the allegations of corruption levelled at Pakistani cricketers and the money accepted by the Australians Mark Waugh and Shane Warne for supplying insipid information about weather and ground conditions to a bookmaker. But nothing, if all the allegations are proved, to rank with this. </p> <p>Few people can believe, or want to believe, that it is true. To some extent, before yesterday's press conference cricket had begun to close ranks - as the Australian Cricket Board to its detriment did when dealing with Warne and Waugh - which in the circumstances is shameful. </p> <p>The charges were fabricated, lies, figments of the imagination. And they would go away. No one, in fact, apart from those in India, actually turned round when the allegations first surfaced late last week and asked themselves, \"What if?\" </p> <p>The trouble is that if someone as respected as Cronje has been within the cricket community can do even what he has confessed thus far to doing and, for a period of time at least, get away with it, then what does it say about the rest of the game? Who else is involved, for others there surely must be? </p> <p>Pakistanis, we know already, have dipped their hands in the till, and one, Salim Malik, has paid a price of sorts (although some suspect he is carrying the can for others still playing). Indians are under investigation and the Australians, unwittingly they say, have dabbled on the fringes of legality. And now South Africans. </p> <p>Where does this leave England? Well, we all joke about England and the notion that anyone would be daft enough to consider paying them to lose when they do it so well without incentive. But approaches have been made: to Adam Hollioake when he was leading the side in Sharjah and to Chris Lewis. On each occasion the incidents were reported forthwith. Have there been others who have kept things to themselves? </p> <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board will issue statements saying that it is confident such things do not go on in its own domain, but it will do so in the knowledge that until Cronje got his cards that is precisely the stance that the South Africans took. </p> <p>Cricket lends itself readily to bookmaking scams. Altering the outcome of a match is hard, although Cronje as captain had greater scope than others. But it is in spread-betting and the possibility of manipulating events during a game that real scope for skulduggery lies. </p> <p>An example: before a one-day game in England last year, one firm was offering a spread on the number of balls into the match that the first wide would be signalled. It does not take much imagination to see the potential in that situation. </p> <p>It is alleged in the Delhi police tape transcripts that Herschelle Gibbs, one of the three implicated along with Cronje, had been expected, in a match in Faridabad, to score fewer than 20 runs and to do so slowly. He made 19 from 36 balls. Coincidence? </p> <p>Perhaps good will come from this case, for in pinning down such a high-profile figure as Cronje a warning will be sent out worldwide that there is a price to be paid.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With the sacking of Hansie Cronje in South Africa yesterday, not just his reputation but that of cricket as a metaphor for all that is fair and true lies in tatters. Dark, brooding, beetle-browed Hansie, seen by colleagues and opponents alike as a man of absolute integrity and honesty, stands accused, along with three members of his team that toured India recently, of rigging matches, a scandal so deep that it would have been unimaginable a decade ago before the first rumbles began to emerge from the subcontinent. If he were to be found guilty, nailed by the evidence compiled painstakingly by the New Delhi police, he would be a ruined man, perhaps doubly so in a country that places its sports stars on the highest of pedestals. Already he has coughed to accepting between $10,000 and $15,000 (\u00a36,300-\u00a39,500) for providing \"information and forecasting\" to a bookmaker and, though he continues to maintain his innocence of match-fixing, his credibility is shot to pieces. He has lied until he could do so no longer, and doubtless the whole truth will out in dribs and drabs. \"Unequivocally, we are shattered,\" Ali Bacher, chief executive of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, said yesterday. \"The UCB and the government have been deceived.\" He might have added that a sports-obsessed nation has been betrayed. One feels for Bacher and South African cricket, for they have striven so hard for recognition and success and believed that they were almost there. The forthcoming one-day series against Australia has little meaning for them now. In uncovering this the Indian police have succeeded in exposing what may prove to be the biggest scandal in cricket history and one of the biggest in sport anywhere. Cricket has had its controversies - bodyline, throwing, the D'Oliveira affair and Packer - even down to the allegations of corruption levelled at Pakistani cricketers and the money accepted by the Australians Mark Waugh and Shane Warne for supplying insipid information about weather and ground conditions to a bookmaker. But nothing, if all the allegations are proved, to rank with this. Few people can believe, or want to believe, that it is true. To some extent, before yesterday's press conference cricket had begun to close ranks - as the Australian Cricket Board to its detriment did when dealing with Warne and Waugh - which in the circumstances is shameful. The charges were fabricated, lies, figments of the imagination. And they would go away. No one, in fact, apart from those in India, actually turned round when the allegations first surfaced late last week and asked themselves, \"What if?\" The trouble is that if someone as respected as Cronje has been within the cricket community can do even what he has confessed thus far to doing and, for a period of time at least, get away with it, then what does it say about the rest of the game? Who else is involved, for others there surely must be? Pakistanis, we know already, have dipped their hands in the till, and one, Salim Malik, has paid a price of sorts (although some suspect he is carrying the can for others still playing). Indians are under investigation and the Australians, unwittingly they say, have dabbled on the fringes of legality. And now South Africans. Where does this leave England? Well, we all joke about England and the notion that anyone would be daft enough to consider paying them to lose when they do it so well without incentive. But approaches have been made: to Adam Hollioake when he was leading the side in Sharjah and to Chris Lewis. On each occasion the incidents were reported forthwith. Have there been others who have kept things to themselves? The England and Wales Cricket Board will issue statements saying that it is confident such things do not go on in its own domain, but it will do so in the knowledge that until Cronje got his cards that is precisely the stance that the South Africans took. Cricket lends itself readily to bookmaking scams. Altering the outcome of a match is hard, although Cronje as captain had greater scope than others. But it is in spread-betting and the possibility of manipulating events during a game that real scope for skulduggery lies. An example: before a one-day game in England last year, one firm was offering a spread on the number of balls into the match that the first wide would be signalled. It does not take much imagination to see the potential in that situation. It is alleged in the Delhi police tape transcripts that Herschelle Gibbs, one of the three implicated along with Cronje, had been expected, in a match in Faridabad, to score fewer than 20 runs and to do so slowly. He made 19 from 36 balls. Coincidence? Perhaps good will come from this case, for in pinning down such a high-profile figure as Cronje a warning will be sent out worldwide that there is a price to be paid.",

      "body": "<p>History is likely to record it as the most momentous encounter between an artist and a dealer since that long-ago day in the mid-50s when Leo Castelli, on the verge of becoming the most influential dealer of new art in New York, paid a visit to Robert Rauschenberg's cockroach-infested loft in the armpit of Manhattan in order to \"discover\" him, and ended up discovering Rauschenberg's lover and downstairs neighbour, Jasper Johns, instead. </p> <p>\"I saw evidence of the most incredible genius,\" Castelli would later recall, \"entirely fresh and new and not related to anything else.\" He had stumbled, in other words, into the situation that every dealer (and collector) dreams of - a brilliant young artist whom nobody else is on to, who can still be bought cheap. </p> <p>Damien Hirst and Jay Jopling met each other for the first time on the night of May 23 1991. The following exchange cemented what has to be the most singular - and rewarding, in all senses of the word - relationship between an artist and a dealer in this country. Hirst: \"Do you know what I like about life?\" Jopling: \"No. What?\" Hirst: \"Everything!\" </p> <p>The reason it can be dated so precisely is that it was the night of an opening at the Karsten Schubert Gallery in London's Charlotte Street. Schubert at that point had cornered the market in what the world did not yet know as Young British Art. (A book paid for and published by him in 1990, called Technique Anglaise, would help define the movement that has been instrumental in shaping the profile and debate not only on contemporary British art, but art internationally, for the past decade.) </p> <p>Schubert had been fast off the mark. It was always said about him that he had a good ear. He had got to the degree shows at the then just emerging Goldsmith's College well ahead of anybody else. Freeze, the now near-mythical Docklands show of work by Hirst and his contemporaries, had happened in 1988. By 1991, the Karsten Schubert Gallery already had Angus Fairhurst, Mat Collishaw, Michael Landy, Gary Hume, Anya Gallaccio and Rachel Whiteread (who didn't go to Goldsmith's but is always lumped in with the YBAs because she is represented by Schubert and collected by Charles Saatchi). </p> <p>It was a killer hand. Only the trump card was missing. </p> <p>By the early 90s, there were very few people in the London art world who didn't know Hirst. \"He was trying to take over the world even in 1985,\" Whiteread has said, \"and he hadn't made anything!\" Schubert had known Hirst - small, furious, bluntly made - for three years. But it was another dealer, a new face, whom the artist went with in 1991. </p> <p>\"Jay [Jopling] was very into making it very sexy in that tabloid way,\" Schubert says. \"There is a history in England of people being negative about contemporary art. As a result, the press was not interested in it, or only in the most negative, carping manner. And then over the past 12 years, it has become this amazing mainstream thing, with artists making the front page. I remember Jay saying that it might be a good thing to encourage this, with very judicious leaks to the tabloid press. </p> <p>\"There was a lot of spin there. All that, of course, was new. And if you talked to oldies in this business, they kind of shuddered a little bit. It just was not done before. You wouldn't leak things to the gutter press. And you would not employ PR people. When it started happening, I felt in two minds about it. But once a new standard was set, you couldn't not do it. It's like, I don't think politicians should spin-doctor. But then that's a very naive, old-fashioned notion of what should and shouldn't happen. They do. Jay is amazing at it, he is brilliant, his energy level is extraordinary.\" </p> <p>Schubert says this in the spare, wood-panelled flat in Soho where he now lives and works. Norman Rosenthal, who staged Sensation at the Royal Academy in 1997 and who's curating a second bad-mannered exhibition at the Academy this autumn, is his immediate neighbour. Schubert, who moved to England from Germany in 1984, is resolutely unraucous. \"The wrong man at the right time,\" as one of his former artists, Angus Fairhurst, calls him, now lives quietly, dealing privately, representing only two artists: the painter Bridget Riley and the sculptor Alison Wilding. (He says he also \"helps Michael Landy a bit\".) </p> <p>He seems thoughtful and bookish. In the three years since his gallery folded, he has written a book on museums. So, yes, he had them all. Eldorado was his for the taking. But he found himself temperamentally unsuited to dealing with the drinking and drugging habits, the mental-as-anything, round-the-clock caning it, no-limits way of living of the brashest and best of the farkin young farkin British farkin artists. He was around it for a while and then decided he didn't want to live the life. </p> <p>The dean of art writers, David Sylvester, recently had this to say about dealers: \"They buy and sell portable objects that can easily cost more than a castle or two. They survive by outwitting some of the world's most cunning and ruthless manipulators of wealth, and they also know how to charm the old rich, key sources of supply. When they deal in the work of living artists, they shape the careers of some of the most charismatic and paranoid individuals of their time.\" </p> <p>They have also, Sylvester might have added, got to be prepared to party hard. To get off their faces and stay off their faces \"from late\", as the sign in one of the London artists' favourite after hours drinking holes has it, \"til unconscious time\". </p> <p>In the early \"bonding\" period of their association, Jopling has said that he was out of it for a year, going to parties, going to bars, staying wrecked with Hirst. It has come to seem like a precondition for anybody with serious ambitions to be a player in the London art game. Even the now unlikely Anthony d'Offay could occasionally be put in touch with his inner delinquent by Gilbert and George, the British stars of his very starry international stable, who have just jumped ship to Jopling's new White Cube-2. </p> <p>Eventually, Schubert's non-participation in the high-jinkery disqualified him in the eyes of some of his artists from being the kind of dealer they wanted to represent them. \"He wanted to engage with an older age group,\" Fairhurst says. \"He didn't want to engage with what was happening now. He had it all in the palm of his hand and he didn't know what to do with it.\" Fairhurst is now with Sadie Coles HQ, whose flagship artist is his girlfriend, Sarah Lucas. </p> <p>The three of them can often be seen hard at it in the Groucho Club and the Colony Room, hitting the old falling-down lotion. Fairhurst is selling better than he ever has, and Lucas has lately hit a purple patch in her career, a fact that Sadie Coles believes is directly connected to what appears to be the seamless marriage of their working and social lives. \"How can you sell art if you don't know what the story is? The closer you get to somebody, the better the job you're going to do for them. When they're pissed, that's when they're often talking about ideas.\" </p> <p>Coles is regularly out until four or five. But she's always at her desk in the gallery by 10. \"She looks pretty ropey at her desk,\" Schubert says. It's a joke. They're friends. But it's a joke he's pleased to be able to make from the outside, looking in. \"It became intensely social,\" he says, \"and it still is. The Americans, for example, are always gobsmacked when this group arrives. They hadn't seen anything like this. I think there is something wonderful about it. They are working all the time. They are always in the studio. Looking, looking, looking. But there is also a drawback there, which is that one can become very claustrophobic. And it also becomes incredibly tiring. I just couldn't do it.\" </p> <p>The residual mainstream, establishment aspect of the Karsten Schubert Gallery for the span of its life between 1987 and 1997 was embodied in the person of a minor royal, Lady Helen Windsor, the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Kent, who worked at the gallery for five years from 1988. Schubert was young and cutting-edge. But it is clear to him now that he clung for too long to conventional notions of what a gallery was. \"Having a big space was what a gallery was about. And then suddenly there Jay was in this little thing [White Cube]. It gave him great flexibility. It was a completely new way of dealing with contemporary artists, not having a big space. Nobody understood that then. I remember thinking at the time that what he proposed was a radical departure. Jay turned it upside-down. It was very, very clever.\" </p> <p>Jopling opened for business in 1993, just after the recession had receded. Other west end dealers including Schubert were reeling. It now seems that White Cube was tailor-made for that moment, although it wasn't so obvious then. \"Boys don't like other boys seeing them when they've got small things,\" I remember Hirst saying just after Jopling opened modestly in St James's. He was only half-joking. It was a while before White Cube came to seem pacey, cool and agenda- setting, not least to the artists. </p> <p>Around 1989, there had been some talk of Schubert joining forces with Anthony d'Offay to put on a big show of Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume and other artists of the emerging Freeze generation. \"I remember there was a meeting with all the artists and d'Offay,\" Schubert says, \"and he turned to me afterwards and said could I tell him which would be the greatest, most important of these people. It ended up in the usual d'Offay mind-fuck way where he said, 'If it works, I want to represent them; if it doesn't, you can have them back.' So I said, 'No, thank you.'\" </p> <p>It was another two years before Hirst's and Jopling's paths crossed after an opening at the Schubert Gallery. Hirst and Schubert could have done business with each other during that time, but they didn't. \"I just couldn't see it. He was making very, very big demands. There was already talk about the shark in formaldehyde at that point. There was a recession, and there were already eight artists. And in a way, the beauty of the Damien-Jay situation was that Jay arrived with a clean slate. There was just no more room for anyone else with Damien. This needed full attention. And Jay was in a position to do that, and he did it very, very well. It's very well matched. There's a sense of showmanship and a sense of theatre.\" </p> <p>By the beginning of 1991, Schubert already had his own leading young British artist, Rachel Whiteread. They stayed together for six years and in that time Whiteread won the Turner Prize and established a huge international reputation as an artist. One of the peculiarities of the art business is that artists and dealers hardly ever have contracts binding them together. Whichever party wants to walk can walk. And, for reasons that have never been made public, Whiteread left the Schubert Gallery in 1997 to go to Anthony d'Offay. For Schubert, it was the final straw. To the amazement of many people, he closed down the business. </p> <p>He says: \"I think it's become more difficult for artists, because as a result of becoming faster, it's also more volatile. Unfortunately, this audience, which is so big now, is so fickle. Many people treat it like the fashion world and change the art on their walls the way they change their wardrobe. They're just looking for the latest thing; they all zoom in. </p> <p>\"An English collector said to me something really funny the other day. We were talking about the whole situation and he said, 'Look at it this way: there were four cubists, five abstract expressionists, four pop people, three minimalists, there were probably four people from the 80s, and then you've got 50 young British geniuses.' </p> <p>\"I think part of the anxiety starting to become apparent is that it is dawning on people that it is beginning to shake down. You know, history, it's a fantastic process. It's also one of the cruellest processes going. Which is: you just edit it down to the bones. That what history does. There isn't room.\"</p>",
