After Celtic had donned their working clothes to batter their way through the atrocious underfoot conditions, they managed to lose their way. </p> <p>In the 81st minute Giovanni Van Bronckhorst's clever pass to Neil McCann gave him the yard he needed to get away from Johan Mjallby, who pulled him down. Jorg Albertz, usually so reliable, drove the penalty against Jonathan Gould, who kept it out with his legs. </p> <p>But there was worse to come for Celtic. Three minutes later Van Bronckhorst placed his pass into that same channel, where spaces had started to appear as Celtic tired. This time Rod Wallace made the run and squeezed his shot inside the post. The Englishman may have had a fitful season but the Ibrox manager Dick Advocaat has been loyal, and his patience was spectacularly rewarded. </p> <p>Celtic's approach, on the face of it, was exceedingly cautious. They played four defenders and two wing-backs, hardly encouraging the other midfielders to get forward. The home side were just intent on placing as many shields as they could between themselves and the free-running Rangers midfield. </p> <p>In fairness it worked through the first half, as Rangers could not find any rhythm on a pitch unsuited to their purposes. Indeed Celtic created a number of chances to take the lead. The best of them all came in the seventh minute, when St\u00e9phane Mahe wandered down the left and crossed so well that Craig Moore was taken out of the game. </p> <p>The ball fell to Mark Viduka eight yards out. He controlled it well and seemed bound to score when he side-footed the ball towards the corner of the net. However the Rangers goalkeeper Stefan Klos made a truly remarkable save, almost doing the splits and stopping the effort with his outstretched left foot. </p> <p>With Viduka and Jackie McNamara finding more space than should have been available on the right flank, Celtic's decision to leave the finer arts in the dressing-room seemed justified as they lumped the ball out of the mud towards the green bits. But as time went on, they began to rue that lost early chance. </p> <p>There was no shortage of spirit either. When the defender Tom Boyd was caught by the boot of Rod Wallace , his eye started to swell alarmingly. But his visit to the touchline was short-lived and he came back to provide a through ball which gave Viduka another chance to score the elusive goal. </p> <p>But that was missed as well and at half-time Rangers had good reason to be happy about the scoreline, if nothing else.

Scientists at the 15 national health service laboratories which carry out genetic tests for susceptibility to breast cancer have expressed concern that Myriad's plans to move into Britain would herald legal action to stop their work, even though their tests are cheaper. But the agreement announced yesterday between Utah-based Myriad and the British firm Rosgen so far only covers patients able to pay for the tests privately. David Ashworth, Rosgen's business development manager, said last night: \"Neither we, nor Myriad, have any plans to stop NHS labs doing any testing whatsoever. \"The agreement we have signed with Myriad specifically states that neither company intends or expects to have any such dealings with the NHS.\" In the US, pressure from Myriad has led to all other labs ceasing to test for the breast cancer susceptibility genes. Myriad claims to have patented the two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, although Britain's Institute of Cancer Research claims it discovered BRCA2 first. The Dutch and Norwegian governments have expressed alarm over Myriad's gene patent claims. But in Britain, the prime minister, Tony Blair, said in parliament last month that the government had \"no interest\" in the issue of gene patenting \"other than to ensure people get the best treatment possible.\" Rosgen, based on the Roslin campus near Edinburgh where Dolly the sheep was cloned, said yesterday that it had licensed Myriad's technology for five years. It would take referrals from the NHS, but only from patients able to pay privately, and only if the NHS agrees to provide counselling services for the patients involved. Gene mutations are though to be linked to 7-10% of all breast and ovarian cancers. Women with mutations have a 56-87% chance of developing breast cancer by age 70, compared to 12% in the population as a whole. Women may be referred for genetic tests if they have a family history of breast cancer or if relatives have the mutations. The results of a positive test can be traumatic - including a decision on whether to have a preventative mastectomy - so counselling is essential. Myriad has criticised the existing British labs as \"homebrew\" operations.

      "bodyText": "A doctor told the high court in London yesterday how he risked his life to photograph badly beaten inmates at a Serb-run camp during the Bosnian conflict and handed the camera to an ITN crew. Idriz Merdzanic, a Bosnian Muslim, said that he was taken against his will, with two other doctors and medical staff, to Trnopolje camp in north-west Bosnia in May 1992. The doctor was giving evidence in a libel case brought by ITN and reporters Penny Marshall and Ian Williams, who are suing Living Marxism (now LM) magazine over claims that they misrepresented the camp by using the emotive image of an emaciated Bosnian Muslim standing behind barbed-wire, in their award-winning report in August 1992. Speaking through an interpreter, Dr Merdzanic told Mr Justice Morland and a jury that he had treated men who had been severely beaten and women who had been raped by the Serb guards. About 10 metres away from the surgery was a laboratory room used to interrogate prisoners, he said. \"They were taking wooden legs from the tables and they would beat people with those, whatever they would find there. We heard the screams and the beatings. Some of the people that they beat up, they would bring them to us to help them, to dress their wounds.\" Dr Merdzanic, 41, said he used another inmate's camera to photograph injured men in the interrogation room. One of the men later died. He said he took the pictures \"hoping then that one day we would be able to show them to show everybody what happened\". The camera was hidden in a water tank in the surgery. \"If it had been discovered, I would probably have been killed.\" He passed the camera to Ms Marshall when the ITN crew visited the camp and the pictures were later shown around the world in the news report about the camps at Trnopolje and Omarksa. Dr Merdzanic, who lost more than a 20lbs while in the camp, said the Serbian Red Cross doctors gave inmates no medicines except DDT powder for bugs and head lice. But after the ITN visit, he said, the International Red Cross came to the camp, the wire was taken down and convoys of inmates were allowed to leave, although some young men were taken off the convoys and killed. ITN and the two reporters are claiming damages over an LM press release, editorial and article headed The picture that fooled the world, published in 1997. LM, which denies libel and pleads justification and fair comment, asserts that there was no barbed wire surrounding Trnopolje, which was a collection centre for refugees and not a prison, and that the barbed wire in fact surrounded the news team who were filming from a small enclosure next to the camp. The case continues today.",

According to Jeffrey Robinson, author of The Manipulators, shoppers are at the mercy of retailers who are using increasingly sophisticated ways of persuading us to shop. \"Making money is the nature of the exercise and as little as possible is left to chance. Study after study constantly refines the deliberate application of manipulative techniques to trigger emotional responses to products and services,\" he says. </p> <p>Traffic generation is the buzzword among retailers. It involves getting consumers to move around the entire store so they see all the products on offer. Vast amounts of money are invested by companies into research and development of traffic generation. It's a highly competitive area and besides, retailers are not keen for consumers to know the extent to which they are manipulated as they push the trolley up the aisle. As a result, many of the designers and psychologists involved in new ideas are bound by confidentiality and only talked to us if we agreed to anonymity. One retail designer says: \"There are lots of tricks used in retailing. You put the cash desks, changing rooms or lavatories at the back of the store, not to save space but to make sure customers have to walk past other merchandise to get to them.\" </p> <p>Some retailers use escalators to carry people up to other floors but stairs for descent, positioned at opposite ends of the store to increase traffic generation. </p> <p>Rune Gustafson, managing director of 20/20, a retail design company, explains that supermarkets, in particular, try to pace the flow of shoppers. \"The speed at which you travel round the supermarket isn't uniform. There is a slower-paced layout to make you linger over buying a nice bottle of wine and a faster-paced layout for commodities such as soap powder.\" </p> <p>Most stores are \"zoned\" which means that products are grouped together by theme. \"A fashion retailer will put suits and shirts and ties together to tell a story because people will buy the complete look,\" says Gustafson. And Marks &amp; Spencer now groups together all the components for lunch - sandwiches, crisps, fruit and soft drinks. \"In the past you used to have to wander round to get all these items and some people couldn't be bothered.\" </p> <p>\"Zoning has boosted sales by 30%,\" says another designer, who has worked for the company. If a retailer wants to sell lots of a product then it is positioned on shelves at about 4ft 6in high - or average eye level - because consumers don't generally look at bottom shelves. Hot spots - large displays at the end of aisles offering bargains, special offers or the latest \"must have\" product are also intended to get customers moving through the store. Retailers try to imitate natural light because it makes us buy more says Robinson. \"It makes products look better and, because it is more akin to sunlight, our bodies respond better to it.\" </p> <p>Fast food restaurants rely heavily on orange, red and pink tones. \"These colours excite, make us eat more quickly and therefore vacate the table sooner for the next customer.\" Softer blue tones are used in areas where retailers want customers to relax and browse but are never used in food halls, says Robinson, \"because foods don't look good surrounded by blue\". </p> <p>Oddly, few retailers put much thought into the lighting in changing rooms - although the mirrors are often deceptively flattering, the lighting generally isn't. Paco Underhill, a \"retail anthropologist\" who analyses stores on behalf of retailers says, \"The lighting should make everybody look like a million bucks.\" He says that in the future changing rooms will have different light settings so shoppers can see what an outfit looks like in daylight, under fluorescent light or by candlelight. </p> <p>Then there's the music. Finding yourself jigging along to your favourite track when out shopping for clothes is not unusual. Fashion retailers play music associated with clubbing or a night out to put customers in a good mood. Psychologists at the University of Leicester are researching the effect of music on shopping habits and how it influences what people choose. Over a period of two weeks they played French and German music at a local branch of Asda. \"The results were clear. When French music was played, sales of French wine outnumbered sales of German by a third. Sales of German wine rose when German music was played,\" says Dr Adrian North. </p> <p>A similar experiment carried out in the US, found that if classical music was played in off-licences, shoppers would gravitate towards more expensive wines. </p> <p>Silent stores can make consumers self-conscious, so some stores use \"white noise\", a dull hum like the sound a fridge makes. It is barely discernible but puts people at ease. The potential uses of sound are fascinating. One psychologist is experimenting with it to reduce shoplifting. \"We introduced a simulated radio station at a shopping centre with music and announcements. For example, if you lose your child, contact a security guard and if you want to enter our competition, contact our security guard. The endless references to security cut theft by 34%,\" he says. </p> <p>Scents also influence behaviour. \"In future, multi-sensory experiences such as sounds, texture and scents will be increasingly important,\" says Jasmine Montgomery of Fitch, a design group. Whether it is the smell of cakes baking, or of a particular type of disinfectant that reminds you of infant school, aromas produce an emotional rather than a rational response and are a very powerful marketing tool.\" </p> <p>A research psychologist agrees that used properly, scent is influential: \"Pumping lavender around a store will not make customers buy more shirts but aromas can be used in an associative way and put customers in the mood. The smell of coconut oil or rum punch could be used in a travel agency to evoke the idea of booking a holiday.\" </p> <p>Travellers using BA lounges at Heathrow are assailed with the smell of new-mown grass, courtesy of the Aroma Company. Its director, Sarah Harrop, explains: \"We have worked with BA to produce a fragrance to bring the outside inside to jaded passengers who move from office to plane to office.\" She says scents can help reflect a brand's values and make an environment more pleasant. \"A lot of companies go for natural fragrances such as 'mountain air' but if you walk into a store and can smell something really distinct then we have got it wrong.\" Harrop says that a smell of peppermint can be used to keep people alert and citrus to uplift. </p> <p>Internet shopping is already changing how people shop. Groceries apart, it will become even more of a leisure activity than it already is. That's the view of Marian Salzman, who is a futurologist at Brand Futures Group, a New-York based consultancy. \"Stores will have to work harder and offer more to entertain consumers to encourage them to shop. The National Basketball Association Store in New York not only sells merchandise but has basketball courts where shoppers are encouraged to play,\" she says. </p> <p>And it may not be long before the hidden persuaders reach right out through the store door to grab you in the street. Saltzman predicts: \"Mobile phones will become more sophisticated and will be able to detect where you are on the high street. If you are outside a branch of Gap, for example, they will be able to send you a message saying that if you go inside now you will get 20% discount.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here's the scoop: crime writing is sexy. Crime writing is currently in - which is where it should always have been. Forget Miss Marple and arsenic in the crusted port. Today's crime writers are dealing with the real world, real problems, real dramas. Like surgeons, they wield a scalpel, slicing open society and probing the wound, finding the cancers of corruption, deceit, unemployment, dope. And the surgery? The surgery is in the writing: clean, sharp, incisive, with dialogue Hollywood would kill for. </p> <p>Pick up any Elmore Leonard, any Lawrence Block, and you'll get a masterclass in dialogue. For action and perversion, turn to James Ellroy, crime fiction's self-proclaimed \"Demon Dog\". He doesn't just snap and howl: given half a chance, he'll rip your head off with images and scenes that seem to have been transcribed in some antechamber of hell. This is visceral, immediate writing. It has urgent things to say. It demands the attention. It doesn't let go. </p> <p>Young readers and young writers are being drawn by this. They may not have read their Agatha Christie, but you can be sure they know their Tarantino by heart. They watch The Sopranos; they wish they could have been Al Pacino in the first Godfather movie; they know that crime fiction is no longer the domain of the \"dime a word\" pulp writer. Crime fiction can do anything, explore any avenue, use myriad voices and locations. There are wonderful crime novels set in Franco's Spain, Nazi-occupied France, cyberspace, futuristic Edinburgh. Even in ancient Rome. There are funny crime novels and sad ones, brutal ones and elegant ones. Romantics and cynics are drawn to the form. There are even \"accidental\" crime writers - like me, for instance. </p> <p>Where did it all come from? Did Edgar Allan Poe pen the first whodunnit stories? Should the English writer (and friend of Dickens) Wilkie Collins be credited with the first full-length crime novel? Do we start further back, with murder and mystery in Shakespeare? Or how about Sophocles, whose Oedipus has a good claim to be an early detective story? Stories down the ages have depended upon tension and deferred answers to keep their readers and listeners guessing. It's like with jokes: if the punchline was told straight away, you'd lose interest. So it is with all narratives. Crime fiction merely codifies this principle. </p> <p>The \"golden age\" of crime fiction is supposed to be the 20s and 30s, when the traditional English whodunnit was at its height, practitioners such as Christie, Marjorie Allingham, Dorothy L Sayers and Ngaio Marsh giving it style and substance.

      "bodyText": "Here's the scoop: crime writing is sexy. Crime writing is currently in - which is where it should always have been. Forget Miss Marple and arsenic in the crusted port. Today's crime writers are dealing with the real world, real problems, real dramas. Like surgeons, they wield a scalpel, slicing open society and probing the wound, finding the cancers of corruption, deceit, unemployment, dope. And the surgery? The surgery is in the writing: clean, sharp, incisive, with dialogue Hollywood would kill for. Pick up any Elmore Leonard, any Lawrence Block, and you'll get a masterclass in dialogue. For action and perversion, turn to James Ellroy, crime fiction's self-proclaimed \"Demon Dog\". He doesn't just snap and howl: given half a chance, he'll rip your head off with images and scenes that seem to have been transcribed in some antechamber of hell. This is visceral, immediate writing. It has urgent things to say. It demands the attention. It doesn't let go. Young readers and young writers are being drawn by this. They may not have read their Agatha Christie, but you can be sure they know their Tarantino by heart. They watch The Sopranos; they wish they could have been Al Pacino in the first Godfather movie; they know that crime fiction is no longer the domain of the \"dime a word\" pulp writer. Crime fiction can do anything, explore any avenue, use myriad voices and locations. There are wonderful crime novels set in Franco's Spain, Nazi-occupied France, cyberspace, futuristic Edinburgh. Even in ancient Rome. There are funny crime novels and sad ones, brutal ones and elegant ones. Romantics and cynics are drawn to the form. There are even \"accidental\" crime writers - like me, for instance. Where did it all come from? Did Edgar Allan Poe pen the first whodunnit stories? Should the English writer (and friend of Dickens) Wilkie Collins be credited with the first full-length crime novel? Do we start further back, with murder and mystery in Shakespeare? Or how about Sophocles, whose Oedipus has a good claim to be an early detective story? Stories down the ages have depended upon tension and deferred answers to keep their readers and listeners guessing. It's like with jokes: if the punchline was told straight away, you'd lose interest. So it is with all narratives. Crime fiction merely codifies this principle. The \"golden age\" of crime fiction is supposed to be the 20s and 30s, when the traditional English whodunnit was at its height, practitioners such as Christie, Marjorie Allingham, Dorothy L Sayers and Ngaio Marsh giving it style and substance. On the other side of the Atlantic, Chandler and Hammett reacted against this \"cosy\" school. Chandler in particular felt it his duty to take crime back on to the \"mean streets\" (his phrase) by making it urban and relevant to its time and place. Interestingly, the private eye - hero of the American golden age - had as his predecessor the cowboy. Both were based on the \"knight errant\", bringing a certain chivalry to bear on morally barren landscapes.

Crime fiction has always depended on archetypes and has always dealt with the fears of its time and its readership.

Lord Grabiner defines the black - or informal - economy as any undeclared economic activity, covering casual moonlighting, work paid cash in hand and organised crime. The report cites several examples, including that of a couple where the wife worked full time in a nursing home, while the husband claimed a jobseeker's allowance without reporting her earnings. How big is the informal economy? By its nature, the size of the informal economy is hard to measure and estimates run anywhere from \u00a350bn to \u00a380bn a year, or 8% of gross domestic product. Lord Grabiner tends to think these estimates are exaggerated, but avoids giving a precise sum. Gauging the scale of benefits fraud is easier.

He rejects a general amnesty, which he says would not work, but recommends a confidential anonymous hotline offering advice to people in the black economy on how to put their affairs in order.

When it gets launched in 2003, it will be on the lookout for the mysterious bursts of gamma rays that have been astonishing astronomers for decades. </p> <p>A gamma ray burst lasts for about two minutes. But during that time, it is brighter than all the rest of the universe put together: a brief blaze from some unimaginably fierce cosmic traffic accident. </p> <p>Invisible light of this ferocity raises huge questions which nobody can yet answer. By the time scientists have detected a gamma ray burst and tried to turn other telescopes on it, the blaze has faded. The aim of Swift, now being prepared by David Palmer of the Goddard space flight centre run by Nasa in Maryland, and by a team which includes scientists at Leicester university and at the Mullard space sciences lab in Surrey, is to detect these explosions of radiation in the distant universe, and train other instruments on it within seconds. </p> <p>Gamma ray bursts are a kind of proof that JBS Haldane was right: the universe is not only queerer than we may suppose, it is queerer than we can suppose. They were first detected more than 30 years ago by Cold War satellites looking for violations of the nuclear test ban treaty. It took a while to persuade people that the telltale radiation was coming from outer space not Inner Mongolia or some other nuclear testing ground. And it took a while to come to terms with the other puzzle: how could these things be so violent? </p> <p>Swift will peer at a huge arc of the sky. It has a screen of randomly scattered lead blocks, sitting above 32,000 detectors, 4mm squares of cadmium zinc telluride each 2mm deep, and when a gamma ray hits one of these, it gives off an electrical signal. The shadow cast by the lead blocks will reveal the direction of the radiation. </p> <p>It will be the signal for Swift to change position in a big hurry, and get to work with x-ray and optical telescopes to pinpoint the source. It will also measure the redshift for the radiation burst, which will tell astronomers how fast the mysterious radiating object is receding, and therefore how far away. David Palmer expects the bursts to be very far away. </p> <p>\"If one occurred in our galaxy at 1,000 light years away, it would be for a few seconds 10 times as bright as the noonday sun, and the optical brightness is one part in one thousand of the gamma ray brightness,\" he says. \"The atmosphere absorbs gamma rays - but if it absorbed that much, it would produce chemicals in the upper atmosphere which would destroy the ozone layer, so the biosphere would be in pretty bad shape afterwards.\" </p> <p>A gamma ray burst in this galaxy 65 million years ago could, some argue, provide an alternative explanation for the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Fortunately, such explosions might happen in a galaxy like this one only at intervals of a million or 10 million years. But there could be 100 billion galaxies in the discernible universe. That means that there could be a gamma ray burst somewhere in the sky, every day. </p> <p>There will, says Palmer, be more than one explanation for gamma ray bursts. Some last only a few thousandths of a second; some last for whole minutes, and one seemed to explode in multiple bursts every few days. \"My guess is that some are probably something akin to a supernova, and others are neutron stars spiralling into each other. It's as if you took two neutron stars and converted them entirely into energy as gamma rays, with nothing left over. Maybe it's just poverty of imagination, but I don't know any reasonable way to do that.\" </p> <p>That might explain why some gamma ray bursts are so brief. Neutrons stars are one stop from oblivion: they pack the mass of something like the sun into a parcel a few miles across, so that a cubic inch of neutron starstuff would weigh millions of tons. </p> <p>\"If you have two neutron stars, then the timescale once they start tearing each other apart is milliseconds and that's because you have two things which are the size of a mountain and moving at the speed of light.\" </p> <p>So why do some gamma ray bursts last so long? \"If you have a supernova-type gamma ray burst, you have the centre of the star collapsing and the rest of the star has to fall down into it, and that takes a long time because you usually start with a star many times larger than the sun. You get a black hole at the centre, everything has to spiral down the drain, jets have to eat their way through the poles of the star and through the envelope of the star: that also takes time, possibly hours, possibly less.\" </p> <p>But earthbound clocks might not measure the time of a gamma burst truly. Something that actually involved an explosion of months could seem - by the time it crossed the vastness of space - to last only for seconds because of some teasing Einsteinian trickery with time and space. And anyway, Dr Palmer says, a satisfactory explanation of one burst will not be an explanation for all such events. </p> <p>\"There are hundreds of gamma ray bursts every year. Every one looks different. If we say at least 95% are either colliding neutron stars or supernovae that would still leave 5% that we don't know what they are, and there are quite a few weird science theories around.\" </p> <p>One of these (he doesn't like it much, but it's there) involves trying to imagine a region of the universe where neutrinos, the immeasurably small, barely detectable particles that pour from the sun in their squillions, and pass through the earth as if it wasn't there at all, rotate in the wrong direction. If so, that region would be separated from this part of the universe by a cosmic membrane through which neutrinos could not pass, because they'd have to turn around. This membrane would have surface tension, which would pull the neutrinos into a kind of high density bowl. Suppose a star fell into this neutrino porridge: it would burn up in a twinkling, go supernova, and discharge energy which would have to escape in some form, so why not gamma rays? </p> <p>Or try this: what if a piece of cosmic string (a bit of freak stuff left over from the first moment of creation, thinner than an atom but even an inch of it weighing millions of tons) sliced through a star? If you were to count the number of degrees in a circle around a piece of cosmic string, it would not be 360, it might be only 90. So suddenly you'd have the sphere of a star which was only 90 degrees and the extra mass would have to go somewhere. \"It is unlikely,\" says Palmer \"to be very calm about it.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>So now it is falling into place. Almost a year after the start of the Kosovo war we are starting to be able to answer a question that has baffled commentators and military analysts since the war began: why, despite the displays of overwhelming force and aviatic wizardry that nightly filled our television screens, was the world's most sophisticated fighting force so peculiarly ineffective?</p> <p>Throughout the war were we told by Nato's chirpy press spokesman Jamie Shea that the air bombardment was working, that it was systematically taking apart the Yugoslav army. And yet at the end, after 79 days and more than 3,000 bombing missions, thousands of Serb soldiers, with tanks and heavy guns still intact, emerged from their hideouts punching the air and smiling at the television cameras.</p> <p>A squirming Nato has already provided some clues to this riddle. Much of the US air force that made up the bulk of the Nato assault was debilitated by the inability of its radar system to penetrate cloud cover - though how a state-of-the-art war effort could be foiled by something as primordial as water vapour is another puzzle.</p> <p>And now we know that in the early weeks of the campaign a spy was operating at the heart of Nato and divulging its lists of bombing targets to the Serbs. No wonder the bombers failed to hit their targets - the targets had been moved in full knowledge that the raids were coming.</p> <p>The disclosure of the leaking of Nato's bombing list exposes a mind-boggling incompetence on the part of those entrusted with prosecuting Europe's first war since 1945. No amount of cheerful chat from Jamie Shea will legitimise the fact that for the first few weeks of the war top secret lists were circulated to no fewer than 600 people.</p> <p>This in itself was a product of Nato's loose construction. The alliance that embarked on the Kosovo war was composed of 19 member states - several of whom, notably France, Italy, Greece and latterly Germany, were ambivalent about the value of military action.</p> <p>But there is a danger of confusion here. It was not Nato's constitution that was at fault, but the bungling of its high command.</p> <p>The Pentagon will no doubt jump on the spy revelations to press its objections to Nato's structure. What America would like is an \"alliance\" run from Washington with a little marginal help from London. Paris, Rome, Athens and Berlin should stop acting like spoiled children and do what they are told.</p> <p>If that line were allowed to take hold it would be unfortunate. The lesson of the new disclosure is not that we need less democracy within Nato. The lesson is that we need people at the top of its military pyramid who know what they are doing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So now it is falling into place. Almost a year after the start of the Kosovo war we are starting to be able to answer a question that has baffled commentators and military analysts since the war began: why, despite the displays of overwhelming force and aviatic wizardry that nightly filled our television screens, was the world's most sophisticated fighting force so peculiarly ineffective? Throughout the war were we told by Nato's chirpy press spokesman Jamie Shea that the air bombardment was working, that it was systematically taking apart the Yugoslav army. And yet at the end, after 79 days and more than 3,000 bombing missions, thousands of Serb soldiers, with tanks and heavy guns still intact, emerged from their hideouts punching the air and smiling at the television cameras. A squirming Nato has already provided some clues to this riddle. Much of the US air force that made up the bulk of the Nato assault was debilitated by the inability of its radar system to penetrate cloud cover - though how a state-of-the-art war effort could be foiled by something as primordial as water vapour is another puzzle. And now we know that in the early weeks of the campaign a spy was operating at the heart of Nato and divulging its lists of bombing targets to the Serbs. No wonder the bombers failed to hit their targets - the targets had been moved in full knowledge that the raids were coming. The disclosure of the leaking of Nato's bombing list exposes a mind-boggling incompetence on the part of those entrusted with prosecuting Europe's first war since 1945. No amount of cheerful chat from Jamie Shea will legitimise the fact that for the first few weeks of the war top secret lists were circulated to no fewer than 600 people. This in itself was a product of Nato's loose construction. The alliance that embarked on the Kosovo war was composed of 19 member states - several of whom, notably France, Italy, Greece and latterly Germany, were ambivalent about the value of military action. But there is a danger of confusion here. It was not Nato's constitution that was at fault, but the bungling of its high command. The Pentagon will no doubt jump on the spy revelations to press its objections to Nato's structure. What America would like is an \"alliance\" run from Washington with a little marginal help from London. Paris, Rome, Athens and Berlin should stop acting like spoiled children and do what they are told. If that line were allowed to take hold it would be unfortunate. The lesson of the new disclosure is not that we need less democracy within Nato. The lesson is that we need people at the top of its military pyramid who know what they are doing.",

Sachin Tendulkar was 30 days older when he made his first one, for India v England at Old Trafford in 1990. The oldest is Jack Hobbs - 46 years 82 days old when he made 142 for England v Australia at Melbourne in 1928-29. The oldest in the last ten years was Graham Gooch - 40 years 315 days old when he made his last Test ton, 210 for England v New Zealand at Trent Bridge in 1994.</p> <p><strong>I am doing a family history and would like to know more about Tom Richardson, who played for Surrey and England around the turn of the last century? </strong> asks Ron C</p> <p>Tom Richardson was an immensely strong fast bowler who took 2104 wickets in a career which lasted only 13 seasons. He passed 100 wickets in ten of those seasons, and actually took 290 wickets in 1895. The previous year, for Surrey v Essex at The Oval in 1894 he took all ten wickets in an innings. He also took 88 wickets in his 14 Tests for England. He was born in Byfleet, Surrey, on August 11, 1870, and died of \"congestion of the brain\" in France on July 2, 1912, when he was only 41.</p> <p><strong>Which family event made Test history during the third match of the 1997 Ashes series?</strong> asks Colleen</p> <p>Doing a quiz, by any chance? That match was Dean Headley's debut, which meant that his family became the first to provide three generations of Test cricketers. Dean's grandfather George, the first great West Indian batsman, played 23 Tests and averaged a magnificent 60.83. His father Ron was a stylish left-hand opener who played for Worcestershire and Jamaica, and was called up to play two Tests for West Indies in England in 1973. Dean is the first of the three to bowl for a living, and the first to play for England (he was born in Stourbridge, in the West Midlands, while his father was playing here). </p> <p><strong>Given that a bowler is no-balled when any part of his foot is not on the line, is the batsman required to be across the line or merely on it to be safe from a run-out or stumping? </strong> asks Jamie Wilson</p> <p>The no-ball law says that a delivery is fair as long as \"Some part of the front foot whether grounded or raised was behind the popping crease\". And Law 29 says that \"A batsman shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his bat in his hand or his person is grounded behind the line of the popping crease\". So both batsman and bowler have to be behind the line rather than on it.</p> <p><strong>I am trying to trace whether someone called Edward Cook played any first-class cricket for Middlesex, probably in the 1960s? </strong> asks Allan Jamieson</p> <p>The only Cooks (or Cookes) who have played for Middlesex are Colin, who played a few matches as a batsman between 1981 and 1984, and Simon, the medium-pacer who is on their staff now. You might mean Edward \"Ted\" Clark, who played 196 matches for Middlesex between 1959 and 1976. He scored a century on his first-class debut, against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1959.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me the name of the trophy given to the county cricketer who scores the fastest century of the English season? </strong> asks Sal</p> <p>It is called the Lawrence Trophy, and is named after Sir Walter Lawrence, the industrialist who first presented it in 1934. Initially it was given for the fastest century in minutes, but is now given to the quickest one in terms of balls received. The winner in 1999 was England's Andrew Flintoff, who reached three figures in only 61 balls for Lancashire against Gloucestershire at Bristol. The first winner, in 1934, was Frank Woolley of Kent. There was no award between 1939 and 1965, but it was revived in 1966, when Ken Barrington won it, and it's been awarded annually since. </p> <p><strong>I was wondering if you had heard of a Sri Lankan player called Aruna Seneviratne, whose son Martin is in my cricket team (Lane Cove Under-12s)?</strong> asks Rob Loosli from Sydney, Australia</p> <p>No-one of that name has played an official Test or one-day international for Sri Lanka. And he also doesn't seem to be mentioned in a huge history of Sri Lankan cricket that recently landed in the Wisden office. That book does mention quite a few Seneviratnes, so possibly he is in there under his full name. </p> <p><strong>A friend of mine has been talking knowledgably of a player called Solkar, who he says was a specialist batsman who was only called into action as a bowler in times of dire need but had a good record against Geoff Boycott. Ring any bells? </strong> asks Morgan Kavanagh</p> <p>It's Eknath Solkar, the left-handed Bombay batsman who played 27 Tests for India between 1969-70 and 1976-77. He scored 1068 runs in Tests, at an average of 25.42, and also took 18 wickets (59.44) with his gentle, club-standard bowling. He did get Boycott out (for 6) in the first Test of 1974, at Old Trafford, whereupon Boycott made himself unavailable for Test cricket (he didn't re-appear until 1977). Solkar was also a magnificent close fielder, adding to the menace of India's great spinners of that time - Bedi, Chandrasekhar, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan, the current Test umpire.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p> <p>We regret that not all questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into</p>",

And Law 29 says that \"A batsman shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his bat in his hand or his person is grounded behind the line of the popping crease\". So both batsman and bowler have to be behind the line rather than on it. I am trying to trace whether someone called Edward Cook played any first-class cricket for Middlesex, probably in the 1960s? asks Allan Jamieson The only Cooks (or Cookes) who have played for Middlesex are Colin, who played a few matches as a batsman between 1981 and 1984, and Simon, the medium-pacer who is on their staff now. You might mean Edward \"Ted\" Clark, who played 196 matches for Middlesex between 1959 and 1976. He scored a century on his first-class debut, against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1959. Can you tell me the name of the trophy given to the county cricketer who scores the fastest century of the English season? asks Sal It is called the Lawrence Trophy, and is named after Sir Walter Lawrence, the industrialist who first presented it in 1934. Initially it was given for the fastest century in minutes, but is now given to the quickest one in terms of balls received. The winner in 1999 was England's Andrew Flintoff, who reached three figures in only 61 balls for Lancashire against Gloucestershire at Bristol. The first winner, in 1934, was Frank Woolley of Kent. There was no award between 1939 and 1965, but it was revived in 1966, when Ken Barrington won it, and it's been awarded annually since. I was wondering if you had heard of a Sri Lankan player called Aruna Seneviratne, whose son Martin is in my cricket team (Lane Cove Under-12s)? asks Rob Loosli from Sydney, Australia No-one of that name has played an official Test or one-day international for Sri Lanka. And he also doesn't seem to be mentioned in a huge history of Sri Lankan cricket that recently landed in the Wisden office. That book does mention quite a few Seneviratnes, so possibly he is in there under his full name. A friend of mine has been talking knowledgably of a player called Solkar, who he says was a specialist batsman who was only called into action as a bowler in times of dire need but had a good record against Geoff Boycott. Ring any bells? asks Morgan Kavanagh It's Eknath Solkar, the left-handed Bombay batsman who played 27 Tests for India between 1969-70 and 1976-77. He scored 1068 runs in Tests, at an average of 25.42, and also took 18 wickets (59.44) with his gentle, club-standard bowling. He did get Boycott out (for 6) in the first Test of 1974, at Old Trafford, whereupon Boycott made himself unavailable for Test cricket (he didn't re-appear until 1977). Solkar was also a magnificent close fielder, adding to the menace of India's great spinners of that time - Bedi, Chandrasekhar, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan, the current Test umpire.

In fact, Tarkovsky, the greatest and most imitated director Russia has produced in the last 50 years, made seven full-length films between 1962 - when Ivan's Childhood burst upon the world - and 1986, when The Sacrifice was completed. Two of these films were made outside Russia where the authorities deeply suspected his motives and were unwilling to accord him state funds. </p> <p>In defence of the authorities (who often were indeed idiots), Tarkovsky was difficult to please. As an artist he felt entitled to be. I remember visiting the location set of The Sacrifice on the Swedish island of Faroe. It was bitterly cold, and since a night scene was called for, the cast, including the British actress Susan Fleetwood, waited for Tarkovsky, shivering in night attire. He was half an hour late and, according to a production assistant, had spent much of that time staring at himself in the mirror, readjusting his scarf and hat. \"If he wasn't such a damned good director,\" Fleetwood said, \"I'd have left long ago.\" </p> <p>But, of course, he was a damned good director - a metaphorical looking glass, as one critic has said, providing man with a reflection of himself. Perhaps his most Russian film and, oddly enough, the film that has been most appreciated in the west, is Andrei Rublev, Tarkovsky's second. It is epic in scale and scope - a commentary on the physical and spiritual foundations of Russia itself. </p> <p>Rublev was not a fictional character but an icon painter and monk who lived and worked on the cusp of the 13th and 14th centuries, trained by the even more celebrated Theophanes the Greek. Tarkovsky attempted to paint a portrait of the time, as much through psychological truth as ethnographic accuracy. The landscape of Russia did the rest. \"Our Russia - it has to endure everything,\" says Rublev at one point to the spectre of Theophanes, who replies that it probably always will. </p> <p>The film begins with a peasant launching himself in a balloon from a cathedral across the landscape of medieval Russia and ends with a superb montage of Rublev's surviving icons. In between, Rublev witnesses the often horrific sufferings of a divided Russia, split between feuding princelings and Tartar invaders. </p> <p>There are eight episodes in all, the most notable being the story of a boy who, to save his life, pretends he can cast a giant bell and succeeds through blind faith - a feat that inspires Rublev to paint again. </p> <p>The film is as much about the role of the artist in society as it is about the emergence of the Russian nation. Rublev can only create art by sharing the sufferings of the age in which he lives. All Tarkovsky's films say this, and their spiritual preoccupations and the poetic formulation of these that sets them apart. You can object to his vision as messianic and sometimes fundamentalist. It is hard, however, to mock the impact of his films.</p>",

After the accident he said he found it extremely difficult to begin writing again, but Riding the Bullet was part of his recovery. He is now eagerly awaiting the reaction to this latest story. \"I'm curious to see what sort of response there is and whether or not this is the future,\" King said in a statement. Other - mostly science fiction - writers have experimented with similar distribution of their work, but King is the first of the world's top selling authors to try it. \"This is really the first effective market test,\" said Keith Loris, president of SoftLock.com of Maynard, Massachusetts, which provided some of the technology. \"Up to now, this has been technology in search of a market.\" King recently signed a three-book deal rumoured to be worth \u00a330m in what is said to be the most valuable literary contract in history. The sum shatters previous records and turns the author of more than 30 bestsellers, including Carrie, The Shining and Misery, into the colossus of commercial fiction.",

Columbia bosses are reported to have been relieved by the decision, who worried that in Lee's hands the Ali project would be more racially charged and therefore less marketable. \"They felt it would become a narrow, militant movie,\" admits an unnamed studio source. \"They thought Mann could deliver a more mainstream movie.\"</p> <p>For Lee, the current controversy boasts a distinct whiff of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Back in 1991, he was vocal in his annoyance that Warner Bros had chosen Norman Jewison to direct its Malcolm X movie, arguing that the white, Jewish film-maker could have no affinity for his subject. On that occasion, Jewison eventually moved away from the project, allowing Lee to fill the role. </p> <p>This time around, Columbia's jitters and the commercially-minded influence of Will Smith appear to have conspired against him. The studio source claims that in the end, the choice of director was Smith's call alone: \"If he really wanted Spike, he could have had him.\"</p>",

Columbia bosses are reported to have been relieved by the decision, who worried that in Lee's hands the Ali project would be more racially charged and therefore less marketable. \"They felt it would become a narrow, militant movie,\" admits an unnamed studio source. \"They thought Mann could deliver a more mainstream movie.\" For Lee, the current controversy boasts a distinct whiff of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Back in 1991, he was vocal in his annoyance that Warner Bros had chosen Norman Jewison to direct its Malcolm X movie, arguing that the white, Jewish film-maker could have no affinity for his subject. On that occasion, Jewison eventually moved away from the project, allowing Lee to fill the role. This time around, Columbia's jitters and the commercially-minded influence of Will Smith appear to have conspired against him. The studio source claims that in the end, the choice of director was Smith's call alone: \"If he really wanted Spike, he could have had him.\"",

A strategically crucial town, Brcko, only three miles wide, commands road, rail and river links across Republika Srpska, the boomerang-shaped Serbian statelet in Bosnia. Since the end of the war, more than four years ago, the town has been under international control because of tensions between its Serb, Muslim and Croatian residents. Radical Serbs have opposed its new status, arguing that this marks the beginning of the end for their mini-republic, but supporters of a reunited Bosnia strongly support the new Brcko district. To stress the importance western countries attach to Brcko, the ceremony was attended by the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and the EU commissioner for foreign affairs, Chris Patten. Barely 100 yards from where the inauguration took place stands a statue to the Serb heroes who liberated Brcko in April 1992. Local Muslims remember them as murderers. Sadeta Kadric fills a bucket beside the single-storey, two-room building where she lives with her husband, two teenage children and her in-laws. It is international women's day and the water is for the flowers she will take to her mother's grave. Sadeta, a Muslim, fled Brcko when the Serb army overran the town.

      "body": "<p>The surfer's dream of unlimited free internet access moved a step nearer this week with announcements from web search company <a href=\"http://www.altavista.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">AltaVista's</a> UK operation and <a href=\"http://www.ntl.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">NTL</a> about plans to offer 0800-based internet access facilities. And as Online went to press, there were rumours that <a href=\"http://www.freeserve.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Freeserve</a> was about to respond with its own cut-price service. </p> <p>Unlike America Online's (AOL's) 0800 internet service, neither AltaVista nor NTL plans to make a per-minute charge to access the net. The toll-free (unmetered) access will, they hope, be paid for by a mixture of advertising and e-commerce. </p> <p>From an internet user's perspective, of course, how the service is financed is irrelevant, since the money does not come directly from his/her pocket. The service is \"free\", just like most of the web. </p> <p>There are now more than 200 internet service providers (ISPs) jockeying for position in the internet user community. Last September, Freeserve teamed with Energis, the telecommunications carrier, to offer rebates on internet calls in return for users routing their voice and modem calls via the Energis network. </p> <p>This \"indirect access\" method works by users prefixing their calls with 162 - Energis's access code - and seeing their calls sent across Energis' network. </p> <p>Rebates of between three and 10 hours' worth of off-peak (ie evening and weekend) internet surfing are available on the Freeserve/Energis deal, providing the user makes a given amount of voice calls over the Energis network. </p> <p>Partly or wholly-financing offpeak internet access with regular voice call revenues is nothing new. Localtel started an unmetered off-peak internet access service late in 1998, subject to BT phone users transferring their line rental and calls over to the Localtel phone service. </p> <p>The service, known as Screaming.net, was a runaway success, with tens of thousands of BT line users migrating en-masse and overloading Localtel's - and BT's - signup/transfer systems. Even with Oftel's intervention, the farrago is only just settling down. </p> <p>Jeremy Stokes, Localtel's managing director, said on BBC TV's Newsnight current affairs program this week that a typical Screaming.net user makes internet calls around three times as long as a \"normal\" internet user (ie one paying for the calls). </p> <p>This is the potential problem facing all discount and unmetered call ISPs: make the service free and the floodgates open as users surf the net rather than watch TV. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aol.co.uk\" targey=\"_new\">AOL</a>, the largest ISP in the UK, charges \u00a39.95 a month for its service, plus 1p a minute at all times. This strategy, of offering off-peak rates all the time, is sensible, since it spreads the load on AOL's internet access net work. Users don't have to wait until 6pm on weekdays to log on (and save money). </p> <p>BT has adopted a similar, and cheaper, strategy of charging users \u00a39.99 a month, but offering unmetered access between 6pm and midnight on weekdays and all weekend. </p> <p>But BT is nobody's fool. As it runs most of the network and the phone lines leading into our homes and offices, it knows unmetered internet access can place an intolerable load on its network. It too, is planning to offer 24-hour unmetered access under its Surftime service, which will be available through BT Internet and third-party ISPs later this year. </p> <p>BT has been working very hard since last summer on upgrading its network to cope with the demand that Surftime will create. Charges will vary between \u00a37 and \u00a335 depending on which periods (off-peak, office hours or 24x7) users want unmetered access to the internet. Most serious users will probably opt for the \u00a334.99 service, and surf the net for hours on end. </p> <p>Cable companies, such as Telewest and others, offering unmetered net access at \u00a310 a month, are learning about the problems of demand. </p> <p>Reports suggest that Telewest is rebating some customers their monthly charge because of network access problems caused by customers sitting online for hours. Telewest has responded by logging off inactive users after a certain period, as well as \"rolling\" the IP numbers every three hours or so. This stops clever users from hosting their web sites on the Telewest network \"on the cheap\". Most users are not concerned about such nuances. They can surf the web for hours without watching the clock. </p> <p>AltaVista knows this. That's why it doesn't plan to start its unmetered internet access service until May at the earliest, and will restrict the service to half a million users for the first six months to assess the effect on its network partners. </p> <p>AltaVista plans to charge a \u00a335 signup fee then \u00a310 per annum. NTL's offering is even bolder. From April 17, its unmetered access service will be totally free, provided users sign up for its indirect (ie across BT lines) or direct (cable) telephony service. </p> <p>NTL already offers a discounted net access service, NTLworld, for 1p a minute, plus a handling charge of 3.5p a call. This puts it in the same discount league as AOL. </p> <p>Unknown to many, NTL is actually a major telephony service carrier and a carrier's carrier for many third-party ISPs. Like BT, it knows its network can handle the flood of unmetered access calls. </p> <p>AltaVista has no such luxury. Like Freeserve, with its Energis linkup, it must team up with a third-party carrier to handle its internet calls. That's why it needs three month's lead time on its service. </p> <p>NTL chief executive Barclay Knapp's announcement to the press reflects his company's strong position: \"NTL has a vision to bring the internet to all UK homes, either via the PC or the TV,\" he said, making e-commerce, e-entertainment and e-education available to all. </p> <p>\"We're able to announce this today because we own a high-quality national network and have a track-record of providing innovative services at great prices,\" he said. </p> <p>He does, too. As do BT, Cable and Wireless and a select band of other carriers. The rest are also-rans in the dash to offer unmetered internet access. </p> <p>Yes, almost any ISP can offer unmetered access to customers, but to do so requires a link-up with a third-party carrier - one whose network can handle the flood of calls. </p> <p>Suddenly, the number of ISPs capable of handling unmetered internet access shrinks to a handful. Time for Oftel to intervene, perhaps? </p> <p><strong> Web addresses </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> AltaVista </strong> &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.altavista.co.uk\"</p> <p><strong>\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.altavista.co.uk </strong></p> <p><strong> AOL</strong> </p> <p>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.aol.co.uk\"</p> <p><strong>\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.aol.co.uk </strong></p> <p><strong> BT</strong> </p> <p>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.bt.com\"</p> <p><strong>\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.bt.com </strong></p> <p><strong> Freeserve </strong> &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.freeserve.net\"</p> <p><strong>\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.freeserve.net </strong></p> <p><strong> NTL</strong> </p> <p>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.ntl.com\"</p> <p><strong>\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.ntl.com </strong></p> <p><strong> Screaming.net</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.screaming.net  \">www.screaming.net </a></p>",

From April 17, its unmetered access service will be totally free, provided users sign up for its indirect (ie across BT lines) or direct (cable) telephony service. NTL already offers a discounted net access service, NTLworld, for 1p a minute, plus a handling charge of 3.5p a call. This puts it in the same discount league as AOL. Unknown to many, NTL is actually a major telephony service carrier and a carrier's carrier for many third-party ISPs. Like BT, it knows its network can handle the flood of unmetered access calls. AltaVista has no such luxury. Like Freeserve, with its Energis linkup, it must team up with a third-party carrier to handle its internet calls. That's why it needs three month's lead time on its service. NTL chief executive Barclay Knapp's announcement to the press reflects his company's strong position: \"NTL has a vision to bring the internet to all UK homes, either via the PC or the TV,\" he said, making e-commerce, e-entertainment and e-education available to all. \"We're able to announce this today because we own a high-quality national network and have a track-record of providing innovative services at great prices,\" he said. He does, too. As do BT, Cable and Wireless and a select band of other carriers. The rest are also-rans in the dash to offer unmetered internet access. Yes, almost any ISP can offer unmetered access to customers, but to do so requires a link-up with a third-party carrier - one whose network can handle the flood of calls. Suddenly, the number of ISPs capable of handling unmetered internet access shrinks to a handful. Time for Oftel to intervene, perhaps?

The three intend to invest a further $550m in mainland Europe. </p> <p>The move comes just two days after Benchmark Capital, the US fund behind eBay, announced plans to open a London office and invest $500m of its own in European start-ups. </p> <p>Tokyo-based Softbank, run by Masayoshi Son - whose shareholding is on the verge of making him the world's richest man - is the driving force behind both funds. </p> <p>As part of a global reorganisation of its net investment strategy, Softbank is investing $275m in SoftBank UK Ventures. It will be managed by E*partners, a News Corp and Softbank-backed venture fund contributing $150m. Softbank Europe Ventures will be made up of $400m from Softbank, $100m from Vivendi and $50m from strategic partners. </p> <p>Softbank denied suggestions that its entry to the market was late or that it would merely distort deal prices as a mass of venture capital chases a limited number of quality business plans in London and the regions. </p> <p>\"We won't participate in any kind of feeding frenzy just to ensure our capital is at work,\" insisted Eric Hippeau, president of Softbank's international investments. </p> <p>However, E*partners chief executive Mark Booth, the former head of BSkyB, admitted it would be \"a challenge\" to spend the $450m. \"There is no question that there is a lot more risk capital in the UK than before, that people will make mistakes with their investments and that there will be deal inflation,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This offering is not just about the capital, it is about a unique blend of experience, capital and assets. </p> <p>\"We offer unrivalled speed to a global market and we're very comfortable about what we can bring to the entrepreneur.

      "bodyText": "Softbank, News Corp and Vivendi yesterday announced plans to pour $450m (\u00a3284.8m) over the next two years into backing internet start-ups and new business concepts in Britain. The three intend to invest a further $550m in mainland Europe. The move comes just two days after Benchmark Capital, the US fund behind eBay, announced plans to open a London office and invest $500m of its own in European start-ups. Tokyo-based Softbank, run by Masayoshi Son - whose shareholding is on the verge of making him the world's richest man - is the driving force behind both funds. As part of a global reorganisation of its net investment strategy, Softbank is investing $275m in SoftBank UK Ventures. It will be managed by E*partners, a News Corp and Softbank-backed venture fund contributing $150m. Softbank Europe Ventures will be made up of $400m from Softbank, $100m from Vivendi and $50m from strategic partners. Softbank denied suggestions that its entry to the market was late or that it would merely distort deal prices as a mass of venture capital chases a limited number of quality business plans in London and the regions. \"We won't participate in any kind of feeding frenzy just to ensure our capital is at work,\" insisted Eric Hippeau, president of Softbank's international investments. However, E*partners chief executive Mark Booth, the former head of BSkyB, admitted it would be \"a challenge\" to spend the $450m. \"There is no question that there is a lot more risk capital in the UK than before, that people will make mistakes with their investments and that there will be deal inflation,\" he said. \"This offering is not just about the capital, it is about a unique blend of experience, capital and assets. \"We offer unrivalled speed to a global market and we're very comfortable about what we can bring to the entrepreneur. This is like Christmas for British entrepreneurs.\" Mr Hippeau said Softbank would seek to take significant minority stakes in ventures. \"We will be a very active investor and take board seats, but we do not want control,\" he said. \"The market will dictate the size and number of investments we make.\" Softbank has already made about 300 net-related investments around the world, Mr Hippeau said. The company is most famous for its 20% stakes in Yahoo and E-Trade. \"We expect all our investments to succeed but realistically not all of them will,\" he said. \"The UK in particular has some excellent entrepreneurs but there are also some flimsy business plans out there we need to avoid.\" The majority of Softbank's investments have been made in privately held companies. Softbank's total investment, including public companies, was estimated at around $2bn by Mr Hippeau. \"I'd say the part of our portfolio that is publicly quoted is worth around $50bn.\" The strategy and investors' appetite for hi-tech stocks has transformed the company into one of the world's most valuable, at around $60bn. Mr Son's claims that Softbank holds more than 7% of the publicly listed value of the world's net firms. His holding has put his personal wealth on a par with that of his friend, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Mr Hippeau said Softbank's enormous exposure to hi-tech investments did not put the company at undue risk, even if the 15% to 20% correction in internet valuations many analysts predict does materialise. \"These changes are as profound as the industrial revolution. They are not an overnight phenomenon ... We are long term believers, and will not be put off by a selloff.

The only certain thing about them is that their form is unpredictable. Vladimir Putin and George W Bush have that in common. Though they may be the pairing we must live with for the next few years, their international performance is as unfashioned in their own minds as it is in ours. Against that miasmic background, Al Gore shines out as a beacon of global experience. It now looks more possible than it did at Christmas that he may be the next president. But the looming Putin-Bush duopoly invites us to make an anxious reconnaissance around the perimeter of the unknown.</p> <p>Mr Putin has risen from total obscurity to a 30% lead over his nearest rival in the contest to be Russia's second president, on 26 March. He spent most of his life in junior and unglamorous KGB work, before becoming a city administrator in St Petersburg and then, very briefly, head of the FSB, the KGB's successor as the domestic security agency. That is all. An American official who saw him last summer, when Putin was in that job, said recently he would have been crazy to predict Putin would become prime minister, and certifiable to say he'd be president. Yet that is what, after Boris Yeltsin's coup-de-theatre exit last December 31, he will soon become.</p> <p>There are some encouraging signs. Putin will be the first Russian leader since Lenin to speak a foreign language. He did KGB work in the German provinces for a few years, and told David Frost on Sunday that he had twice visited the US. This points to slightly more spacious horizons than Gorbachev or Yeltsin. Since he became acting president, he has received numerous foreign ministers from the west, reflecting the fact that he plainly does not see Russia in the old way as an autarkic society and knows it must engage with the global economy. This weekend, Tony Blair is invited as the first foreign leader to visit: an interesting signal. Blair is not the leader of Europe, but he's the strongest leader in Europe, who Putin presumably thinks can tell him about reform.</p> <p>So the burgeoning industry in Putin studies, hard at work in foreign offices everywhere, has concluded it will be good to do business with a Russian leader who is neither drunk nor (perhaps) corrupt. Putin's reputation so far gives him the benefit of the doubt on that account, though it remains to be seen which of the thieving oil-to-aluminum plutocrats who have drained Russia of billions of dollars claims his close acquaintance.</p> <p>On the other hand, he is the war candidate. He wouldn't have the slightest chance of being president but for Chechnya, and has pursued the conflict there with a vote-winning brutality that is the primitive equivalent of a chancellor's giveaway budget. Everything is electoral, without necessarily being democratic. The best informed view is that, having been elected, Putin will set about more serious economic reform than Yeltsin, with help from a variety of mad American economists, ever got off the ground, but will be an unreliable custodian of the people's liberties. The revived police state will coexist, at best, with the beginnings of an honest market economy.</p> <p>Within this mix, Russia's front to the world will have to become stronger. Moscow craves respect, which is partly why Chechnya is being crucified to the last rebel body. The contradictory message emerges of a man who, on the one hand, murmurs to Frost about Russia possibly joining Nato (though the line was subsequently spun away) and, on the other, openly reaffirms the possibility of a nuclear response to a non-nuclear crisis. According to the Economist, Putin toasted Stalin at a recent banquet, and speaks fondly of Yuri Andropov, his Soviet predecessor as KGB-chief-turned-political-boss. If he was an Austrian, Mr Blair would not be flying to schmooze with him at the opera.</p> <p>Facing Mr Putin could soon be a different breed of ing\u00e9nu. Unlike the Russian, George W Bush was born and reared to rule. He has be longed to the governing class from the beginning. His pedigree is far superior. But his approach to the world is that of the rank amateur, whose experience may be even narrower than the other guy's.</p> <p>He makes little secret of his ignorance of foreign affairs, and the occasions of his unscripted interventions on the subject have produced a fair amount of embarrassment. Being tricked into showing he didn't know the names of obscure foreign leaders made him the victim of a poor TV stunt. But what should we make of this, from the Iowa caucus campaign? \"When I was coming up,\" he said, \"with what was a dangerous world, we knew exactly who the they were. It was us versus them, and it was clear who the them were. Today, we are not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.\"</p> <p>Behind the syntactical bumbling, this paean of regret for the enemy-strewn simplicities of the old order could soon be ringing through the White House. Behind the free-range nostalgia are cohorts of advisers who, when they write the words, usually prevent Bush from talking gibberish. The empty man has some capable people around him, alongside the mega-rich favour-seekers who have bought him the nomination. But the advisers all come with toughened-up cold war credentials from the Reagan and Bush-pere years, and take a harsher view of China and Russia than presently prevails in Washington, not to mention an unreservedly bullish attitude to national missile defence.</p> <p>Insofar as one can make sense of it, the Bush view of the world in which he may become the most powerful man is very awkwardly poised. Part of it seems to favour some American withdrawal. The candidate himself has talked, in his Texas home state, about a foreign policy that paid more attention to \"the neighbourhood\", meaning Mexico and the rest of Latin America. His leading adviser said she thought that in Kosovo \"it may be necessary for the US to have fewer troops or no troops at all\". But there is another trajectory, towards sharper-edged security involvements, with several advisers advocating outright withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.</p> <p>Across the range of foreign policy, in short, the president-presumptive himself offers little reliable compass-guidance. He's the epitome of a modern American politician who expends more energy defending hand-guns and overseeing state executions than addressing the unmatched power and responsibility that have accrued to his country. If he wins, he will be starting a dialogue with someone groping with equal immaturity, and perhaps the same distracted indifference, to shape internationalism in the new era: for each, surely his most vital task. The prospect is more disturbing than it is creatively exciting. Bill Clinton may not been much of a role model in global diplomacy either. But with Al Gore, there would at least be one man at the table who knew the shape of it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cordiant Communications, the advertising and marketing group that owns the Bates worldwide network, yesterday became the latest media business to reshape itself for the internet age. The company announced plans to strip out the internet consultancy offices of its existing agencies to form a new separately branded business. The as-yet unnamed company will advise on everything from online strategy to web design, IT and media sales on the web. \"Gradually the whole group will change,\" said Cordiant chief executive Michael Bungay. \"The day is not too far away when a substantial amount of sales promotion or direct marketing will be online and we want this new business to spearhead that change. We need to get ourselves in shape for the future.\" Shares in the company, which have almost trebled in value in the past year, climbed 15p to 354p. Cordiant, which was given little credence by analysts when it demerged from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi two years ago, was reporting a 32% leap in pre-tax profits during 1999 to \u00a332.3m. Revenues were ahead by 10% to \u00a3335.8m and the dividend was lifted by 29% to 1.8p a share.",

      "bodyText": "Sony's Playstation 2 video games console, which sold nearly 1m units in two days of going on sale in Japan, appears to have run into teething troubles less than a week after its launch - for which Tokyo teenagers queued all night. Specialist web-sites were yesterday reporting that Sony had recalled the separate memory cards shipped alongside the hi-tech console, after conflicts between the memory cards and the console's DVD player caused the machine to crash. The memory cards are a vital piece of equipment for the regular video-gamer, as they allow players to store information at the end of a playing session. The memory cards are also the home of the Playstation 2's anti-piracy system, called \"MagicGate\", which could cause the sort of malfunction that would affect DVD playback. So far, there has been no official announcement from Sony. The companyhas also recalled two models of its InfoLithium battery packs, following customer reports of overheating, which could cause skin burns.",

The plan would mean hiving off the big loss-making parts of the network which rely on considerable subsidies. This could give the bigger companies the opportunity to flourish without an added financial burden. The idea, revealed yesterday by Mike Grant - the SSRA's chief executive - is a step back from the move towards reducing the number of franchises at present held by 11 companies following privatisation four years ago. Bigger players such as Virgin, Stagecoach and National Express are regarded as the companies most likely to swallow up some of the smaller operators when the franchises come up for renewal. Under the SSRA's plans, at least six micro-franchises could be established. The most prominent are a new trans-Pennine franchise and a possible single franchise for Wales. The trans-Pennine franchise would operate between Newcastle, Leeds, York, Manchester and Liverpool. It would promote the development of a high quality, limited stop service between regional centres. Mr Grant said that the SSRA might also replace the Central Trains franchise, based on Birmingham, with additional changes around Shrewsbury. The two remotest parts of the network which could be left to survive on their own are the lines between Salisbury and Exeter, and the route from Shrewsbury, west to Pwllheli and Aberystwyth in Wales. The object of the current programme of negotiations is to replace most of the seven-year franchises, which expire by 2004, within two years.

Pakistan's army, led by Gen Musharraf at the time, was understood to be angry at the apparent climbdown. \"Kargil was one of the most serious crises in Pakistan's history, which posed a grave danger to the integrity of the country,\" Mr Sharif said. \"I saved my country from major crises, but unfortunately could not save myself and the system.\" He said Gen Musharraf turned against him because of the Kargil episode. \"He was playing hide and seek on this issue not only with me but also with the armed forces. My objection to this conduct became a source of resentment for him,\" said Mr Sharif, who claimed that prosecution witnesses had been tortured to give evidence against him.",

      "body": "<p>A bore? Nope. Beardy? Obviously not. A shagger? Who cares? The greatest challenge facing Ken Livingstone's opponents is finding an appropriate slur. Watching Frank Dobson trying to nail Ken is like watching Tom trying to squish Jerry: Livingstone just bounces back, grinning. The man is insult-proof. This week, as Dobbo and the rest did their worst, the barrage of abuse either pinged harmlessly off, or boomeranged straight back to its authors.</p> <p>\"Liar\" left him intact, even though it was true. \"A disaster\" was just wishful thinking. The nastiest comment Dobbo could contrive, presumably after days of reflection, was to accuse Ken of self-interest - \"the ego has landed\" - which you can only really imagine being effective if it came from a person who had set their face against all forms of personal advancement - an unidentified anchoress, say, or a Tory backbencher. Even so, the charge has been echoed often enough by his supporters to suggest that there were hopes of making it stick: Don't Vote for Ken the Egoist! They should perhaps reflect that it didn't do too badly as an aftershave.</p> <p>The latest accusation is Livingstone's unpopularity with the City: Don't Vote for Ken, the Man the Business Community Abominates! A party spokesman led the way with: \"There is no doubt this man is bad for business\" - a charge echoed, uncannily, by Trevor Kavanagh in the Sun. He reported that foreign investors are already shivering with fright: \"Bharat Desai, head of information technology giant Syntel, described Mr Livingstone as 'dangerous for business'.\"</p> <p>Over here, the chairman of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain said: \"If Mr Livingstone became mayor I would strongly advise companies not to invest in London.\" Another businessman, quoted in the London Evening Standard, complained that Living stone is not the man to \"enhance the image of the capital and create a bit of fun for the capital\".</p> <p>I'm afraid this is no more likely to stain Livingstone's reputation than the charge of egotism. For one thing, many people will find it hard to imagine a more magnetically attractive attribute than being despised by the chairman of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain; moreover, Ken's alleged antipathy to all things glossy, fun and capitalistic no longer bears examination. Quietly, almost stealthily, Livingstone has transformed himself from the frugal geek of City mythology into a knowing gourmand-about-town, whose commitment to lunch is only rivalled by that other fabulous trencherman, Fatty Soames. Back in 1981, the Evening Standard described Ken's impoverished diet: lunch in the GLC canteen followed, occasionally, by a bag of chips on the way home: \"The asceticism seems real enough,\" marvelled Max Hastings. \"He is simply a man consumingly dedicated to politics. And to power.\"</p> <p>And now, as a regular restaurant reviewer for the Standard, he brings that same consuming dedication to lunch. And dinner. And wine. \"Over the past year,\" Livingstone wrote recently, \"I must have visited some of the newest, most talked-about restaurants that London has to offer.\" As he regularly, sorrowfully concedes, those restaurants are not cheap. \"Daphne's is an expensive evening out,\" he observed after a meal in the notorious celebrity pit where the grilled Dover sole costs \u00a325. \"But who can knock it when they can bash out a side-order like zucchini fritti?\" Quite.</p> <p>Again, visiting Teca, which he describes as \"a modern, elegant restaurant\", he discovered that \"cost is an issue here\", though not an issue that seems to interest him very much. Inevitably, most diners in these places are on expenses. When he went to Teca, for instance, \"almost everyone there was a business person\". The very business persons who are meant to be paralysed with fear at the prospect of Livingstone are in fact his dining companions.</p> <p>While some old-fashioned socialists might be unable, in such circumstances, to resist making disparaging comments along the traditional pig-and-trough sort of lines, Livingstone is all unabashed enthusiasm. Even in the restaurant in the old County Hall, which was \"sold off cheaply to become a posh hotel\", he refuses to bear a grudge: \"To be fair, a great deal of effort has gone into preserving County Hall in all its glory . . . On my most recent visit, Geoff Hurst was at the next table.\" The Ivy he pronounces \"gorgeous\"; Orso is like \"a secret gathering devoted to good food and wine\"; the Blue Print Cafe will \"keep the public coming back here year after year\"; while Pied A Terre, the Michelin-starred restaurant (\"very much a posh night out\") has him in stammering ecstasies.</p> <p>\"What I think was a peppered snail was heavenly . . . I was on a different planet with the heavenly seared scallops . . . a friend's foie gras was described as the best they had ever tasted . . . It's difficult to see how you could go wrong with sole fillets poached in champagne velout\u00e9 with asparagus, oysters and caviar . . .\" Alas, the cost of this feast is \u00a342.50 for two courses.

Risotto is a Livingstone staple, praised when of a good or \"perfect consistency, as opposed to the stodgy risotto you sometimes get lumbered with\". New Labour loyalists who fear that years of treacherous sniping lie ahead, should perhaps take heart that Ken dotes on Italian cuisine as much as the next cabinet minister, never tiring of garlic or truffle oil. Indeed, though our future mayor has, himself, mocked \"polenta-eating Islingtonites\", this turns out to be a favourite dish, particularly at Vasco and Piero's Pavilion, where \"they do an excellent polenta.\"</p> <p>Clearly, the more widely circulated Livingstone's restaurant reviews, the more - if such a thing is possible - they will enhance his reputation. When he began this sideline in 1993, he playfully told readers of Esquire magazine that his column had \"a vital role to play in convincing the British people that the good life and socialism are not incompatible\". He has gone on to prove something even more remarkable: that writing for Associated Newspapers and socialism are not incompatible - no, not even when one of those newspapers regularly attacks you as an unreconstructed loony whom the business community cannot possibly trust.</p> <p>So that's another insult gone.

Is it possible the Bishop of Rochester saw an early copy? For now, he too attacks non-breeders, describing married couples with no children \"self-indulgent and incomplete\". Normally, one would dismiss this as just the kind of tactless, interfering twaddle that bishops are paid to produce, and still not a patch on anything Cardinal Winning has come up with lately. But this episcopal idiocy deserves some response. For no good reason, other than the British tradition of pretending that the Anglican church is an intellectual and moral force: the Bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir-Ali, is the Chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Association's Ethics Committee.</p> <p>The job of the HFEA is to regulate medical treatment for infertile people. As the HFEA points out: \"About one in six couples suffer from problems of infertility at some time in their lives.\" Many of these couples will never have children: they may be too old, or unable to afford private treatment, or beyond the help of current reproductive medicine. The bishop as good as tells them their lives are worthless, warning that \"the pleasures of career and travel will cloy after a while\". He adds that the church should look kindly on people whose marriages break down because one partner does not want children. Does this also apply to the non-afflicted partner in involuntarily childless couples? The bishop is nearing the end of his term on the HFEA committee.

Watching Frank Dobson trying to nail Ken is like watching Tom trying to squish Jerry: Livingstone just bounces back, grinning. The man is insult-proof. This week, as Dobbo and the rest did their worst, the barrage of abuse either pinged harmlessly off, or boomeranged straight back to its authors. \"Liar\" left him intact, even though it was true. \"A disaster\" was just wishful thinking. The nastiest comment Dobbo could contrive, presumably after days of reflection, was to accuse Ken of self-interest - \"the ego has landed\" - which you can only really imagine being effective if it came from a person who had set their face against all forms of personal advancement - an unidentified anchoress, say, or a Tory backbencher. Even so, the charge has been echoed often enough by his supporters to suggest that there were hopes of making it stick: Don't Vote for Ken the Egoist!

      "byline": "Polly Toynbee in New York",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>George W Bush has just purchased his party's nomination. Anti-sleaze candidate Senator John McCain is beaten but his charismatic warnings about democracy for sale will still ring out in this election. As Gore and Bush now both head off for another vigorous round of greedy fundraising to buy multiple short, sharp, TV attack ads, campaign money will be a big talking point. But the money that in the end may really count is the money Bush plans to buy the voters with: tax cuts. The question is whether enough of the people can be bribed enough of the time to let Bush buy the White House the way he has bought himself everything else.</p> <p>The Bush message is simple, primal and potentially deadly: money, money, money. Lashings of it, golden promises ladled out at every rally, pouring like a lava flow from his website, handed out in IOU leaflets at every rally with a ready-reckoner to show every taxpayer how much richer they will be through his phenomenal tax cuts. Slashing and burning his way through the whole tax system, he will abolish death tax altogether and let inheritance rip. Crudely this appeal to greed is clothed in the high moral tones of the right: government is essentially evil, so keeping money out of its hands is virtuous. Doing good to yourself by not paying tax is doing good to your country too.</p> <p>He has whistle-stopped 100 airports. As everywhere else, in Rochester, upstate New York, bands, Republican dignitaries and some 2,000 people turn out to hear the speech he has been selling from coast to coast. Dapper, slightly simian, too small eyes too close together, he is a feeble shadow of a feeble father. That president without qualities has brought forth a man with only negative qualities and less than nothing in his past history to recommend him. (He seems even worse in the flesh than on television.) \"My priorities are my faith and my family!\" he declares, but the one punch in his every speech is mammon. And why not? The power of money has bought this unaccomplished man everything he has - a place at Yale, a place in the National Guard to avoid Vietnam, an oil business, then rescue by his dad's good ol' boys when it went bust, the Texas governorship and now the greatest slush fund ever accumulated by any candidate, making him the creature of every unsavoury interest including big tobacco and the National Rifle Association.</p> <p>So is it surprising that his unique selling point, the one that raises the roof in stomping and cheers, is money? He learned these words at his Daddy's knee: \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" But his father lost next time partly because those same lips failed to deliver. This time this Bush is handing out an electoral bribe of colossal proportions the like of which no one has tried before. No doubt William Hague and Michael Portillo will be watching what happens with eager fascination.</p> <p>His standard speech is larded with untruths: \"Taxes are the highest since world war two when we had 7m men in uniform.\" To great cheers he promises to give away the big budget surplus, which currently goes mainly on repaying national debt. \"I know the surplus is not the government's money, I know it is the people's money! It's risky, they say, to give people their money back. I'll tell you what's risky - to leave money in Washington DC!\" Bush calls himself a \"compassionate conservative\" but on his lips \"compassion\" has a new meaning: \"It's conservative to cut taxes. It's compassionate to give people their money back.\"</p> <p>To be sure he says other things too in his standard text. \"Sharpening the military sword\" is a favourite - a return to the mythical star wars missile shield costing unimaginable trillions. (But where will the money come from?) And education, a critical voter concern in this election. Bush will take away money from failing poor schools and give it to parents as vouchers.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush has just purchased his party's nomination. Anti-sleaze candidate Senator John McCain is beaten but his charismatic warnings about democracy for sale will still ring out in this election. As Gore and Bush now both head off for another vigorous round of greedy fundraising to buy multiple short, sharp, TV attack ads, campaign money will be a big talking point. But the money that in the end may really count is the money Bush plans to buy the voters with: tax cuts. The question is whether enough of the people can be bribed enough of the time to let Bush buy the White House the way he has bought himself everything else. The Bush message is simple, primal and potentially deadly: money, money, money. Lashings of it, golden promises ladled out at every rally, pouring like a lava flow from his website, handed out in IOU leaflets at every rally with a ready-reckoner to show every taxpayer how much richer they will be through his phenomenal tax cuts. Slashing and burning his way through the whole tax system, he will abolish death tax altogether and let inheritance rip. Crudely this appeal to greed is clothed in the high moral tones of the right: government is essentially evil, so keeping money out of its hands is virtuous. Doing good to yourself by not paying tax is doing good to your country too. He has whistle-stopped 100 airports. As everywhere else, in Rochester, upstate New York, bands, Republican dignitaries and some 2,000 people turn out to hear the speech he has been selling from coast to coast. Dapper, slightly simian, too small eyes too close together, he is a feeble shadow of a feeble father. That president without qualities has brought forth a man with only negative qualities and less than nothing in his past history to recommend him. (He seems even worse in the flesh than on television.) \"My priorities are my faith and my family!\" he declares, but the one punch in his every speech is mammon. And why not? The power of money has bought this unaccomplished man everything he has - a place at Yale, a place in the National Guard to avoid Vietnam, an oil business, then rescue by his dad's good ol' boys when it went bust, the Texas governorship and now the greatest slush fund ever accumulated by any candidate, making him the creature of every unsavoury interest including big tobacco and the National Rifle Association. So is it surprising that his unique selling point, the one that raises the roof in stomping and cheers, is money? He learned these words at his Daddy's knee: \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" But his father lost next time partly because those same lips failed to deliver. This time this Bush is handing out an electoral bribe of colossal proportions the like of which no one has tried before. No doubt William Hague and Michael Portillo will be watching what happens with eager fascination. His standard speech is larded with untruths: \"Taxes are the highest since world war two when we had 7m men in uniform.\" To great cheers he promises to give away the big budget surplus, which currently goes mainly on repaying national debt. \"I know the surplus is not the government's money, I know it is the people's money! It's risky, they say, to give people their money back. I'll tell you what's risky - to leave money in Washington DC!\" Bush calls himself a \"compassionate conservative\" but on his lips \"compassion\" has a new meaning: \"It's conservative to cut taxes. It's compassionate to give people their money back.\" To be sure he says other things too in his standard text. \"Sharpening the military sword\" is a favourite - a return to the mythical star wars missile shield costing unimaginable trillions. (But where will the money come from?) And education, a critical voter concern in this election. Bush will take away money from failing poor schools and give it to parents as vouchers. He sneers at the head start programme, saying he'll get money back from that too - though its phenomenal success with deprived pre-school children made it one of the few LBJ \"great society\" programmes that survived the Reagan era. But all that is just a little flannel in which to dress up his shameless main message: money.

You will have set back many parents' optimism about the future - local people are involved in the East Brighton Community Partnership, which is bidding' for up to \u00a350m from the new deal for communities initiative.

      "bodyText": "Prior to becoming the local MP for Brighton Kemptown in 1997, I was a councillor for Marine ward, which includes both Roedean and Stanley Deason schools. Your article took me back to that bleakest of times, five years ago when the previous government showed it did not care about the conditions the children were growing up in. I was especially dismayed when they introduced blunt league tables that failed to recognise the social challenges that many of Stanley Deason's pupils faced. Since then much has changed, with a new education authority, education action zone status and a new school replacing Stanley Deason. You will have set back many parents' optimism about the future - local people are involved in the East Brighton Community Partnership, which is bidding' for up to \u00a350m from the new deal for communities initiative. Residents have found the solutions to be complex, including education, unemployment and crime, but shown themselves willing to take on that challenge. What a pity that you failed to say what has happened for the better in recent years and thereby blamed David Blunkett rather than his predecessors. Dr Des Turner MP \u0095 One of Whitehawk's major problems is a media stereotype that presents only a picture of intensely negative events. Good news about the area includes a new youth club run by local volunteers, excellent musical and dramatic productions at both primary and secondary schools in the area, the development of a local credit union with a training programme that has enabled a quarter of the participants to obtain paid work, a new children's playground and three new tenants' and residents' associations. Cllr Catherine Shelley Brighton, Marine ward \u0095 Last July Stanley Deason was closed down and given the New Labour \"fresh start\" treatment. Everything changed: staff, curriculum, name, only the buildings and the children are the same. Now it's called East Brighton Media &amp; Arts College. Supported by partnerships with business it will bid for a specialist school status if it manages to improve exam results. We are assured it will work. But the latest school reports suggest there is just as much unrest as before, with pupil behaviour still bad and staff turnover high. It will take more than a lick of paint and spinning tales of success to achieve the progress the pupils so desperately need.

After 18 years of financial squeeze, teachers welcomed a new Labour government, with a record majority, and one clear priority standing above its otherwise modest promises: education, education, education. Three years on, as our Guardian Education poll this week demonstrated, deep disillusion has descended: over half believe their job is declining, with only 16% perceiving an improvement; and large numbers are so fed up that they are getting ready to quit. Our three-part special investigation into schools by Nick Davies this week helps explain why. </p> <p>The first reason is hype. Last April's new three-year spending programme was described as \"the biggest single investment in education in the history of our country\". Even the NUT believed the now infamous figure cited - \u00a319bn - meant an end to \"the famine in funding\". One year on, schools are still waiting to be fed. Part of the problem is the severe squeeze which education services suffered in the previous two decades, as set out by Davies yesterday. But a more important part is the fundamentally dishonest way in which the \u00a319bn was aggregated. Study Davies's disaggregation in Tuesday's Guardian. Neither teachers nor the public have been fooled. The hype has been counterproductive because it helped generate the cynicism picked up in our poll. As Tony Travers, the London School of Economics analyst, has shown, Labour at the end of this first term will still be spending less than John Major in his first year. </p> <p>A second lesson is the stark conditions facing teachers in state schools, vividly contrasted by Davies with private schools which spend twice as much on each pupil. Pay is not the main factor. It is only 10% higher. Far more important is the extra staff private schools employ, allowing teachers to concentrate on their specialty and giving more time for preparation and homework marking. As our survey shows, unrelenting pressure on state school teachers is a major cause of their dismay. Ministers were right to raise pay, but they must dramatically increase staff numbers too. Then there is the problem of the neighbourhood comprehensive. By definition neighbourhood schools will generate more inequality, since neighbourhoods are unequal. The solution is not a return to the 11-plus and a selection system which stamped 80% of children as failures. Instead we need new ways of widening catchment areas. The development of new specialist schools in technology, modern languages and sports is one. </p> <p>Finally there are the private schools. Every country has them, but in none are they as dominant as in England. They seriously distort the system. Labour dropped its plans to abolish them two elections ago. That was right. The European Convention on Human Rights protects them. Removing their charitable status would not eliminate them. Far better would be to require them to share their superior facilities more widely with surrounding schools. New summer schools for state pupils, which universities started last year and will now extend, should widen access. Two-thirds of all pupils who get three As at A-level are in the state sector, but only 50% of Oxbridge applicants come from it. There should be more of them in all our top 15 universities. Britain should also use scholastic aptitude tests, as the Americans do. They would identify pupils with degree potential who for reasons of poor schooling or an impoverished home have poor A-levels.

The talks broke off in January over demands that Israel commit to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. \"How can we guarantee these frontiers when there are tens of thousands of refugees in Palestinian camps?\" asked Mr Lahoud. He added that Lebanon was \"not disposed to assure Israel's well-being\". A unilateral withdrawal would leave a question mark over the refugees' right to return to the land from which Israel drove them. He said the solution to the refugee problem lay primarily with Israel, adding: \"The Israelis call for security guarantees after their withdrawal; the threats they make in case these are not given are completely unacceptable because acceptance would amount to accepting the settlement of Palestinians on our soil.\" He said that Lebanon wanted a settlement of the refugee problem and a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights, as well as from south Lebanon, before it could respond to Israel's security demands. There are 367,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. All religious communities are united in the belief that a settlement could not allow the refugees to stay. It was to thwart attacks by Palestinian guerrillas that Israel first established its \"security zone\" in south Lebanon in the late 70s. Since the expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon, Palestinian raids have been very rare. Palestinians in Lebanon and the occupied territories do not disguise their admiration for Hizbullah's achievements, leaving many Israelis asking when they might start emulating this militancy. Since Israel's withdrawal decision, Lebanon has been making plain its full alignment with Syria's strategy. Asked if there would be no peace for northern Israel before Israel ended its occupation of Golan, the information minister Anwar Khalil said: \"Obviously. This is what I believe, what everyone familiar with the situation in Lebanon believes and this is definitely the position of the Lebanese government.\" His comments reinforce the growing assumption that, barring a wider agreement involving Syria, Lebanon will not seek to establish its authority, through the deployment of the army, in areas evacuated by Israel. It is also likely to oppose any similar proposal for UN forces. \u0095Israel and the PLO will resume negotiations in Washington later this month in an attempt to seal a final peace treaty by September 13, the US Middle East peace envoy, Dennis Ross, said yesterday. The breakthrough followed the second summit in less than 24 hours between Mr Barak and the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat.",

The effect on what the Serbs appeared to know about Nato's bombing plans was immediate, it concludes.</p> <p>The existence of the report is revealed in a BBC2 programme, Moral Combat: Nato at War, to be broadcast on Sunday night.</p> <p>It says that the leaking of secret Nato war plans meant that the Serbs also knew when Nato's \"detection assets\" - spy planes and unmanned reconnaissance drones - would be deployed. Serb army and police units could move their men and equipment around with less risk of detection and in advance of bombing raids.</p> <p>The report - an investigation into the lessons learned from the Kosovo conflict, which ran from March to June last year - says Belgrade's secret source was human and was not the result of hacking into Nato's coded computer system, called Chronos.</p> <p>General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, suspected early in the bombing campaign that Belgrade had a spy in the organisation's Brussels headquarters, according to a senior source there. \"I know I've got a spy, I want to find him,\" he is said to have told colleagues.</p> <p>Nato military chiefs immediately checked the distribution of the daily \"air tasking orders\" or ATOs. To their horror, they discovered that 600 people had access to them. \"You could have knocked me down with a feather\", said one senior US air force officer who asked not to be identified.</p> <p>The large distribution list - understood to comprise military personnel and unlikely to have included diplomats or members of Nato governments - was based on the number of people authorised to see operational details of the alliance's earlier no-fly zones over Bosnia. The Bosnia plans had been agreed with the Serbs, so were not sensitive.</p> <p>The top-secret Nato air orders were an entirely different matter. As soon as US commanders knew how many people were on the distribution list, they narrowed it to 100.</p> <p>Another source, in the Pentagon - the US defence department - also said there was evidence of a Serb spy.

      "bodyText": "A spy in Nato provided the Serbs with top-secret details of allied bombing raids against Yugoslavia last year, including targets to be hit and precise flight paths, according to high-level US sources. An internal classified report drawn up for senior US defence officials concludes that the Serbs had access to Nato's daily orders for air raids and reconnaissance flights during the first two weeks of the allied bombing campaign, which began on the night of March 24. By the end of the second week of the campaign, according to the report, Nato started to change the way the orders about bombing raids were distributed. The effect on what the Serbs appeared to know about Nato's bombing plans was immediate, it concludes. The existence of the report is revealed in a BBC2 programme, Moral Combat: Nato at War, to be broadcast on Sunday night. It says that the leaking of secret Nato war plans meant that the Serbs also knew when Nato's \"detection assets\" - spy planes and unmanned reconnaissance drones - would be deployed. Serb army and police units could move their men and equipment around with less risk of detection and in advance of bombing raids. The report - an investigation into the lessons learned from the Kosovo conflict, which ran from March to June last year - says Belgrade's secret source was human and was not the result of hacking into Nato's coded computer system, called Chronos. General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, suspected early in the bombing campaign that Belgrade had a spy in the organisation's Brussels headquarters, according to a senior source there. \"I know I've got a spy, I want to find him,\" he is said to have told colleagues. Nato military chiefs immediately checked the distribution of the daily \"air tasking orders\" or ATOs. To their horror, they discovered that 600 people had access to them. \"You could have knocked me down with a feather\", said one senior US air force officer who asked not to be identified. The large distribution list - understood to comprise military personnel and unlikely to have included diplomats or members of Nato governments - was based on the number of people authorised to see operational details of the alliance's earlier no-fly zones over Bosnia. The Bosnia plans had been agreed with the Serbs, so were not sensitive. The top-secret Nato air orders were an entirely different matter. As soon as US commanders knew how many people were on the distribution list, they narrowed it to 100. Another source, in the Pentagon - the US defence department - also said there was evidence of a Serb spy. Pilots at Nato's operational headquarters at Vicenza in northern Italy were expressing concern that the Serbs were \"picking up on our runs\". Speaking on the record to the BBC, Gen Clark was asked if he thought there was a spy \"at Nato headquarters\". He replied: \"Absolutely not\". When asked whether there was a spy \"in Nato\", he said: \"I don't think so.\" He confirmed, however, that there was an investigation into Nato's procedures. \"We restricted who had access to the air tasking orders and we tightened them up and we kept some sensitive items off the ATOs,\" he said. He added: \"I think they [the Serbs] knew about the categories we were going after on the first night.\" It was reported last year that the US F117A Stealth fighter shot down by a Serb anti-aircraft missile in the first week of the bombing campaign may have been attacked after its secret flight plan was passed to Belgrade by a spy at Nato headquarters. A Nato official was quoted last August as saying that an alliance military officer had passed details of the Stealth mission to a Russian intelligence official who tipped off Belgrade. In November 1998, a French officer, Pierre-Henri Bunel, admitted that the month before he had passed on Nato's overall target plans to a Yugoslav diplomat in Brussels. This was in October last year, five months before the bombing began. He was reported as saying that he had acted out of hatred for the US. Of Nato's 19 member countries, two - Italy and Greece - maintained diplomatic missions in Belgrade during the conflict. The secret US report is understood to give no indication of how a Nato spy could have passed information to Belgrade. Nor does it speculate about his nationality. The BBC programme also reveals that a Swedish financier was sent on a secret mission to Moscow and Belgrade during the war. He told President Slobodan Milosevic that the Russians had agreed to a peace plan saying: \"We cannot help you ... so exit now.\" Moral Combat: Nato at War will be broadcast by BBC2 on Sunday.

      "bodyText": "US officials at the United Nations yesterday withheld authorisation of an airlift of medical supplies to Iraq organised by the Labour MP George Galloway and supported by Britain. They demanded an explanation of the \"purpose\" of each person travelling on the aircraft. Accusing the US of \"overruling and humiliating\" the British government - which backed the application to the UN sanctions committee after temporarily supporting a ban last weekend - Mr Galloway announced he would fly the \u00a3115,000 of vaccines and medicines to Jordan and take them overland to Baghdad instead. The decision to call off the first direct civilian flight between Britain and Iraq since the 1991 Gulf war, scheduled for Saturday, was taken after the Glasgow Kelvin MP and anti-sanctions campaigner was given a three-hour deadline to supply technical air craft details along with the intentions of the 29 passengers. He was told by the foreign office yesterday that he would have to leave supplies of typhoid vaccine behind because, contrary to earlier assurances, they were covered by sanctions as a potential \"dual use\" ingredient in biological weapons. A foreign office spokesman said that, while British officials had not anticipated that \"these questions were going to be asked\" by the New York-based sanctions committee - which has administered sanctions against Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 - they did not amount to a \"wrecking proposal from the Americans or anyone else\". The government had still hoped to win agreement for a humanitarian flight, the spokesman said. Mr Galloway, who has been working privately with the foreign office minister Peter Hain for a couple of months to win British support for the flight, said that the questions had been \"unanswerable and aimed at wrecking a fledgling attempt by the British government to take a slightly more conciliatory approach to relations with Iraq\". But Mr Hain last night accused him of a \"cynical and dishonest\" manoeuvre in cancelling the flight and insisted that there had been no need to do so in response to what he said were routine inquiries. Mr Galloway intends to press ahead with legal action against the government, seeking a judicial review of its decision to refer the airlift to the sanctions committee, and damages for the cost of the cancelled flight. Earlier this week, the numbers of passengers on the flight - which was backed by the crown prince of Dubai - had been reduced from 207 to 29 to win the support of the foreign office, after Mr Hain expressed alarm that it was turning into an anti-sanctions publicity stunt.There are also said to have been pressure from Downing Street.",

The weary: \"Oh Mu-um\" is all too familiar to any woman who has watched a girl become a woman.</p> <p>Adrienne Rich remarked in her book Of Woman Born that the mother-daughter relationship is \"the great unwritten story\". But what remains largely unwritten is not its dark side - not the conflict, the supposed envy, the competition, the interference. These appear in fairy tales, with the dark side of a mother's love represented by the stepmother who cannot tolerate her daughter's maturing beauty (Snow White) or freedom (Rapunzel) or coming of age (Sleeping Beauty). From Pride and Prejudice, where the shallow and silly Mrs Bennet constantly acts against her daughters' best interests, to Bridget Jones' Diary, where a mother triggers groans in both character and reader by praising someone else's job, child or marriage, we see that familiar \"impossible mother\".

The stereotype of the mother is someone who stays close so she can make you feel bad about yourself.</p> <p>Many problems that occur in women have been attributed to mothers who won't let go. Explanations of eating disorders have, until very recently, come in various versions of \"it's all the mother's fault\". An anorexic girl is thought to deny her own appetite because her mother made her feel guilty or confused about her own, independent needs. Only recently have social pressures and physiological brain function been highlighted as causes, with mothers portrayed as willing to do anything to help their daughters.</p> <p>Then there is the problem of girls' and women's ambivalent motivation. Why do so many women step off the career fast-track? Well, the story goes, women are afraid of a mother's envy; pass her by and there's hell to pay. Only recently has women's so-called fear of success been highlighted as a shrewd assessment of the costs of high-pressure careers.</p> <p>There's no doubt, though, that the air between a mother and daughter is highly charged. The fact is, if you take any parent/child pair, the one that comes up with the most arguments is the mother/daughter one. A few years back, I did some research on mothers and teenage daughters. What I expected to find was that their quarrels arose from a daughter's attempt to reject her mother so she could survive as a woman. I expected that because that's what established theory told me I'd find.</p> <p>But these quarrels were shaped within a deep and loving bond. As the teenage girls jumped through their ritual mother abuse (\"You don't understand anything!\" and \"I can't believe you said that!\"), they had a positive goal. They wanted to shake a mother out of her old patterns of seeing a daughter, to force her into a new awareness of the young woman they were becoming. They kept fighting because they hoped that, this time, they'd get the right response: that their mother would see them for who they really were and love them all over again. Mother-daughter arguments are often exercises whereby the girl turns to her mother to help her build up her own sense of self.</p> <p>In the past, hating one's mother has had a political thrust. The critic Elaine Showalter said mother-hating was the feminist enlightenment of the 1950s and 1960s. It was a metaphor, really, for disliking certain aspects of one's own womanhood. Catching out persistent female traits within ourselves, we blamed our mothers. And if we wanted to be women who stood on our own two feet, then we had to be wary of a mother's helping hand. We might get used to her support and forget we could stand alone.</p> <p>But no one should have to stand alone, always. The need for a mother who thinks well of us and will champion us is long-lived. Research on midlife women shows women's overall wellbeing is related to their relationship with their mother. Adult women who have a good and close relationship with a mother have higher self-esteem, are less anxious and less depressed than are women who are at odds with their mothers. They also value these relationships - even though they are somewhat abashed. \"I know it sounds silly,\" 38-year-old Beth says, \"but when I'm low, there's nothing like going home and having Mum look after me.\"</p> <p>So maybe I shouldn't have been so startled when a colleague of mine burst into tears during a meeting because she had heard earlier that day that her mother was seriously ill. Instead of expressing worry about her mother's pain or her father's anxiety, she said: \"If Mum dies, who will look after me?\" As I stared at this 36-year-old woman, with her newly published article and photos of her baby displayed on the desk, I thought: \"You don't need anyone to look after you. You can look after yourself.\" But her panic registers the all too familiar need for someone to be our champion as only a mother can.</p>",

Well, the story goes, women are afraid of a mother's envy; pass her by and there's hell to pay. Only recently has women's so-called fear of success been highlighted as a shrewd assessment of the costs of high-pressure careers. There's no doubt, though, that the air between a mother and daughter is highly charged. The fact is, if you take any parent/child pair, the one that comes up with the most arguments is the mother/daughter one. A few years back, I did some research on mothers and teenage daughters. What I expected to find was that their quarrels arose from a daughter's attempt to reject her mother so she could survive as a woman. I expected that because that's what established theory told me I'd find. But these quarrels were shaped within a deep and loving bond. As the teenage girls jumped through their ritual mother abuse (\"You don't understand anything!\" and \"I can't believe you said that!\"), they had a positive goal. They wanted to shake a mother out of her old patterns of seeing a daughter, to force her into a new awareness of the young woman they were becoming. They kept fighting because they hoped that, this time, they'd get the right response: that their mother would see them for who they really were and love them all over again. Mother-daughter arguments are often exercises whereby the girl turns to her mother to help her build up her own sense of self. In the past, hating one's mother has had a political thrust. The critic Elaine Showalter said mother-hating was the feminist enlightenment of the 1950s and 1960s. It was a metaphor, really, for disliking certain aspects of one's own womanhood. Catching out persistent female traits within ourselves, we blamed our mothers. And if we wanted to be women who stood on our own two feet, then we had to be wary of a mother's helping hand. We might get used to her support and forget we could stand alone. But no one should have to stand alone, always. The need for a mother who thinks well of us and will champion us is long-lived. Research on midlife women shows women's overall wellbeing is related to their relationship with their mother. Adult women who have a good and close relationship with a mother have higher self-esteem, are less anxious and less depressed than are women who are at odds with their mothers. They also value these relationships - even though they are somewhat abashed. \"I know it sounds silly,\" 38-year-old Beth says, \"but when I'm low, there's nothing like going home and having Mum look after me.\" So maybe I shouldn't have been so startled when a colleague of mine burst into tears during a meeting because she had heard earlier that day that her mother was seriously ill. Instead of expressing worry about her mother's pain or her father's anxiety, she said: \"If Mum dies, who will look after me?\" As I stared at this 36-year-old woman, with her newly published article and photos of her baby displayed on the desk, I thought: \"You don't need anyone to look after you. You can look after yourself.\" But her panic registers the all too familiar need for someone to be our champion as only a mother can.",

      "body": "<p>Fresh from decisive victories over their party opponents in this week's Super Tuesday primary contests, Al Gore and George W Bush shifted decisively into presidential election mode yesterday, beginning an eight-month battle for the hearts and minds of middle America in the race to succeed Bill Clinton.</p> <p>With Bill Bradley expected to pull out of the Democratic contest today and John McCain consulting colleagues about whether to fight on in the Republican race, Mr Gore and Mr Bush lost no time in positioning themselves for the general election in November.</p> <p>Mr Bush abruptly softened the tone of his Republican campaign by quickly emphasising the education issue and stressing his racial inclusiveness in victory remarks in Texas after his big win over Mr McCain on Tuesday.</p> <p>Meanwhile Mr Gore told supporters in Tennessee that he was the \"mainstream candidate\" and pointed to the economy, gun control and a pro-choice stance on abortion as key issues in his emerging contest with Mr Bush.</p> <p>The abruptness of the change of tone and direction in the campaign reflects the decisive quality of the Super Tuesday results, in which 11 states held presidential primaries for both parties, with a further five states holding caucuses for one or both parties. The overwhelming wins for the two frontrunners mean that the primary dogfight, in which the candidates have spent nearly $200m, could in effect be finished this week.</p> <p>Mr Gore was the undisputed big winner of the night, defeating Mr Bradley in every contest from coast to coast. The New Jersey senator failed to get within 10 percentage points of the vice-president in any contest, and was crushed in New York and California, the night's biggest prizes, as well as in his home state of Missouri.</p> <p>\"He won. I lost,\" Mr Bradley confessed in a speech to supporters in New York late on Tuesday, and aides confirmed yesterday that Mr Bradley will today withdraw from the contest and endorse Mr Gore, a move that has fanned speculation that the erstwhile challenger may be in the running for the vice-presidential slot on the Democratic ticket.</p> <p>On the Republican side, Mr Bush stopped Mr McCain nearly as comprehensively. The Arizona senator won four New England states on Tuesday - though failing to pick up the ancestral Bush holiday home state of Maine - but he fell emphatically short in each of the three key states, California, Ohio and New York, in which he had counted on winning at least one big victory. The ease of Mr Bush's win, combined with the daunting arithmetic for Mr McCain of the battle for delegates in remaining states, led to widespread speculation yesterday that the Republican contest may also soon be over.</p> <p>\"We may meet again in future primaries,\" Mr McCain said of his rival in post-election remarks in Hollywood, a remark that suggests the senator now sees the writing on the wall.

      "bodyText": "Fresh from decisive victories over their party opponents in this week's Super Tuesday primary contests, Al Gore and George W Bush shifted decisively into presidential election mode yesterday, beginning an eight-month battle for the hearts and minds of middle America in the race to succeed Bill Clinton. With Bill Bradley expected to pull out of the Democratic contest today and John McCain consulting colleagues about whether to fight on in the Republican race, Mr Gore and Mr Bush lost no time in positioning themselves for the general election in November. Mr Bush abruptly softened the tone of his Republican campaign by quickly emphasising the education issue and stressing his racial inclusiveness in victory remarks in Texas after his big win over Mr McCain on Tuesday. Meanwhile Mr Gore told supporters in Tennessee that he was the \"mainstream candidate\" and pointed to the economy, gun control and a pro-choice stance on abortion as key issues in his emerging contest with Mr Bush. The abruptness of the change of tone and direction in the campaign reflects the decisive quality of the Super Tuesday results, in which 11 states held presidential primaries for both parties, with a further five states holding caucuses for one or both parties. The overwhelming wins for the two frontrunners mean that the primary dogfight, in which the candidates have spent nearly $200m, could in effect be finished this week. Mr Gore was the undisputed big winner of the night, defeating Mr Bradley in every contest from coast to coast. The New Jersey senator failed to get within 10 percentage points of the vice-president in any contest, and was crushed in New York and California, the night's biggest prizes, as well as in his home state of Missouri. \"He won. I lost,\" Mr Bradley confessed in a speech to supporters in New York late on Tuesday, and aides confirmed yesterday that Mr Bradley will today withdraw from the contest and endorse Mr Gore, a move that has fanned speculation that the erstwhile challenger may be in the running for the vice-presidential slot on the Democratic ticket. On the Republican side, Mr Bush stopped Mr McCain nearly as comprehensively. The Arizona senator won four New England states on Tuesday - though failing to pick up the ancestral Bush holiday home state of Maine - but he fell emphatically short in each of the three key states, California, Ohio and New York, in which he had counted on winning at least one big victory. The ease of Mr Bush's win, combined with the daunting arithmetic for Mr McCain of the battle for delegates in remaining states, led to widespread speculation yesterday that the Republican contest may also soon be over. \"We may meet again in future primaries,\" Mr McCain said of his rival in post-election remarks in Hollywood, a remark that suggests the senator now sees the writing on the wall. Mr McCain spent yesterday closeted with family and close advisers on his ranch north of Phoenix as he weighed his options. Senior aides were reported to be divided about whether to stay in the contest, although the balance of power seemed to favour withdrawal. Mr Bush, meanwhile, took time in Austin yesterday to cast an absentee vote for himself in next week's Texas primary, which looks now like being more of a formality than ever. After sitting at a voting booth and putting on glasses to mark the ballot paper, Mr Bush said \"I'm ready\" for the contest with Mr Gore. The Texas governor signalled a future line of attack on Mr Gore, dubbing him \"an agent of Washington\" and a partner in an administration that had set the wrong tone for America. Mr Bush said he wanted to reach out to Mr McCain's supporters and described the bruising primary contests as a helpful experience to his candidacy. \"People saw I could get whipped and bounce back,\" Mr Bush told reporters. \"I feel battle-tested.\" Mr Gore went on television yesterday to call for the general election to be a contest of \"ideas and not insults\". He lost no time in challenging Mr Bush to set aside his millions of campaign dollars and agree to a mutual ban on TV advertising in the forthcoming battle. The two men should conduct two televised debates each week, Mr Gore proposed. Officially, the presidential election campaign does not begin until after the party coventions in July and August - at which the vice-presidential nominees are also agreed - with formal campaigning between early September and election day on November 7. In practice, however, the Gore-Bush campaign began yesterday, with both men well aware that in 1996 Mr Clinton used this period to establish an irreversible advantage over Senator Bob Dole.",

      "body": "<p>I can't help it, I love Otis Redding. That man's music has invaded my head and soul a million times and will undoubtedly do so again in the future. His oeuvre may be limited, but Otis was that rare singer, someone whose voice told you immediately of the man within. When I hear Otis I hear a warm, compassionate man. I hear a man not yet scarred by cynicism. It is one of the cruellest acts I know that he should have died at the age of 27 in a plane crash, an absolute tragedy that he was taken from us just as he was reaching his peak. </p> <p>That year, 1967, Otis had heard The Beatles' Sgt Pepper and, like the rest of the world, he found himself transfixed and then ultimately inspired. His aim was to produce soul's answer to Lennon and McCartney's achievement. And he would do so through Stax Records, the only label that would have understood and then successfully realised such a brave and intriguing project. Otis's first move in this direction was to record his latest song, Dock Of The Bay. An example of the experimental impulse that was slowly growing inside him is the whistle that Otis breaks into as the song nears its conclusion. Amazed, nervous looks shoot around the recording studio. A soul record with whistling on it? </p> <p>A week later, on December 10th, Otis Redding's private plane plunged into Lake Minona, Wisconsin. You will not learn any of this Redding history on this Saturday's Top Ten 60s Soul show. But, incredibly, you can watch Otis's body being pulled out of the river. The footage is stomach churning and I am mystified as to why it was included in a programme of such a light nature. </p> <p>Surely those involved would never want to see a loved one of theirs exposed in such a manner on national television. So why display a man who took such great pride in his appearance in this manner. For the ratings? Surely not. Such footage makes for uneasy viewing, and anyway their programme is filled with enough drug stories to hook the casual viewer. </p> <p>One can only conclude that whoever inserted such footage simply has no love or care for the subject. Of course, this is Saturday night TV and despite Channel Four's original remit to provide innovative intelligent television they too find themselves embroiled in a ratings war that is stripping television of its potential. You want music on television? Fine. Just as long as you insert as many salacious stories about the artists as you can. Oh, and don't forget to keep it simple. (I know for a fact that Four insisted that the All Back To Mine show insert subtitles under their footage: \"This is Marvin Gaye. He is a singer. He was shot by his father\"). </p> <p>This approach probably works when you're dealing with drug-addled megastars who are now in rehab and don't take themselves or their music too seriously (as in the same series' show on Stadium Rock a while ago). But no such remit exists here. A lot of the artists featured are dead. Few can complain. So we find out that Smokey Robinson was a crack addict in the 80s, and we hear of the drug and alcohol abuse that tore apart the fabulous Temptations and left just one original singer standing - yet we hear very little of the tribulations that touring in a segregated America cost these performers. Likewise, we hear nothing of the psychological scars caused by performers having to travel hundreds of miles, performing in front of huge crowds and then having to spend the whole night searching for an all-black caf\u00e9 to eat in, and very little of the financial rip- offs and mistreatment they all suffered. </p> <p>Now maybe I am taking the show too seriously but soul music is one of the greatest gifts America has given to us and I think it deserves a little bit more than its underbelly being used as a vehicle to gain advertising revenue. Soul is an amazing music, full of drama and emotion. As the show's presenter Smokey Robinson tells us, \"On the surface it is glitter, glamour, sharp suits - underneath blood, guts and raw emotion.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, in Britain, despite it causing far more political change than, say, punk, soul music has always run second to rock's dominant culture. From the day 50s singer Ray Charles took some old Gospel tunes and added the Devil's words to them, Soul has brought people together, provided the soundtrack to black protest movements and given us records that are unparalleled in their musical genius. </p> <p>Time and time again it has seen enthusiastic white boys adopt the form and use it as a springboard to much bigger success. But soul has never been resentful. It has just forged ahead. But when it sees one of its own being treated with such disrespect, soul gets enormously angry. Like the man said, all he ever wanted was a little respect. So give it to him.</p>",

You want music on television? Fine. Just as long as you insert as many salacious stories about the artists as you can. Oh, and don't forget to keep it simple. (I know for a fact that Four insisted that the All Back To Mine show insert subtitles under their footage: \"This is Marvin Gaye. He is a singer. He was shot by his father\"). This approach probably works when you're dealing with drug-addled megastars who are now in rehab and don't take themselves or their music too seriously (as in the same series' show on Stadium Rock a while ago). But no such remit exists here. A lot of the artists featured are dead. Few can complain. So we find out that Smokey Robinson was a crack addict in the 80s, and we hear of the drug and alcohol abuse that tore apart the fabulous Temptations and left just one original singer standing - yet we hear very little of the tribulations that touring in a segregated America cost these performers. Likewise, we hear nothing of the psychological scars caused by performers having to travel hundreds of miles, performing in front of huge crowds and then having to spend the whole night searching for an all-black caf\u00e9 to eat in, and very little of the financial rip- offs and mistreatment they all suffered. Now maybe I am taking the show too seriously but soul music is one of the greatest gifts America has given to us and I think it deserves a little bit more than its underbelly being used as a vehicle to gain advertising revenue. Soul is an amazing music, full of drama and emotion. As the show's presenter Smokey Robinson tells us, \"On the surface it is glitter, glamour, sharp suits - underneath blood, guts and raw emotion.\" Unfortunately, in Britain, despite it causing far more political change than, say, punk, soul music has always run second to rock's dominant culture. From the day 50s singer Ray Charles took some old Gospel tunes and added the Devil's words to them, Soul has brought people together, provided the soundtrack to black protest movements and given us records that are unparalleled in their musical genius. Time and time again it has seen enthusiastic white boys adopt the form and use it as a springboard to much bigger success. But soul has never been resentful. It has just forged ahead. But when it sees one of its own being treated with such disrespect, soul gets enormously angry. Like the man said, all he ever wanted was a little respect. So give it to him.",

The ambivalent relationship between Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi is battered by political events, by betrayal and suspicion; and mainly by the arrival of Gong Li, who, like the film, looks ravishing. It won the Palme D'Or at Cannes in 1993. Wilde (Brian Gilbert, 1997) 2.05am, Sky Premier Absorbing, Julian Mitchell-scripted account of Oscar Wilde's relationship with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas - played by the much feted, Oscar nominated Jude Law - and his subsequent imprisonment. Stephen Fry in the title role physically resembles Wilde and portrays the generous warmth behind the acute wit with touching pathos",

      "bodyText": "A row has broken out over what MPs are calling a \"Janet and John\" guide to security issued by parliament in the wake of the sword attack which killed a Liberal Democrat councillor trying to shield Nigel Jones, the MP for Cheltenham, at his constituency office. It has been intensified by parliament's finance officers telling MPs that they cannot have any extra cash to protect themselves or their staff - after advising them that they must take extra security measures. This position is in direct contrast to ministers' treatment, many of whom have extra security at their homes and offices paid for by the taxpayer. The guide sent out by parliament's sergeant at arms office from the home office - with pictures of Jaguar cars parked outside executive-style homes and anxious children clutching teddy bears - has infuriated some MPs by the childishness of some of the advice. For example, MPs are advised to \"try to be as inconspicuous as possible when in public\", and to \"walk in company and near the kerb, if possible facing oncoming traffic\". Other advice on the road is to \"avoid shubbery, dark doorways or other places where people might hide\". In public life MPs are warned: \"Try not to be predictable by using the same restuarant, bar and place of entertainment\". On protecting their families it contains such gems as: \"keep young children within sight or earshot or in the care of a trustworthy adult who is aware of the special risks your children may be under.\" MPs are warned when driving: \"It is inadvisable to pick up strangers or open doors or windows to unknown persons\", adding: \"It is inadvisable to accept a policeman or other official in uniform as bona fide - ask to see his warrent card.\" While being driven MPs are warned: \"It is inadvisable to daydream. If you are a passenger be alert to anything suspicious.\" They are also told to change their route home every day and keep a look out to see if they are being followed. Peter Bradley, Labour MP for the Wrekin, said: \"This guide seems to be treating MPs like children. It is like that basic nursery reading book, Janet and John.\" But he and a number of backbench colleagues are particularly angry at a decision by the office to issue the guide - and then tell MPs that they have to find the money themselves to provide protection for their own staff. \"I don't think MPs anyway can live a life behind padlocked doors and nor would I want to,\" Mr Bradley commented. \"But I do feel we have a responsibility to protect our own researchers, particularly when we are not there ourselves.\" The MP, elected in Labour's landslide in 1997, has already had one nasty incident. He had a recent visitor to his surgery, a man known to have mental health problems. \"He came in to tell me about people staring at him and then started brandishing this carving knife which he said he carried around with him to protect himself. Luckily he didn't use it, but it was frightening.\" In a letter to the MP, Gillian Crowther, assistant head of parliament's fees office, said: \"You should be aware there is no source of funding anywhere ... to cover such costs for members or their staff.\" She said that MPs would have to find the money from their office costs allowance which is used to buy computers and pay for two or three staff already.",

      "body": "<p><strong> How long have you been involved with the net?</strong> About three years. I never really had a great deal of interest in it before my involvement with mobile phones. My main interest now is trying to deliver a service to a small-screen device and to access that content quickly and smoothly. </p> <p><strong> Any favourite sites?</strong> I'm a Leeds United supporter so I visit <a href=\"http://www.lufc.co.uk\">www.lufc.co.uk</a> all the time. I'm also a regular visitor to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk\">BBC site</a>, and when the Superbike racing is on, I visit the Yamaha site at <a href=\"http://www.yamaha-motor.com\">www.yamaha-motor.com</a>. </p> <p><strong> How important will mobile technology become?</strong> Penetration of PCs is so small, but the penetration of mobile phones is reaching 40 to 50% even in quite under-developed countries. So there's now this massive potential to deliver a service through an internet backbone to the real populous. I started getting interested when I found that you could put an internet-type browser on the SIM itself. Every single mobile phone has got a little smart-card and it's only really used for security. There's loads of spare capacity. </p> <p><strong> How secure are mobiles for e-commerce?</strong> Mobile phones are capable of delivering a digital signature that is acceptable for legal documents. If you can accept that as a signature then you can start using it to sign leases, buy cars and all sorts of other things. The public infrastructure for smart-cards isn't going to be secure enough to be acceptable until about probably this September. In the meantime there's Symmetric Security which basically means you do a little sum on the SIM and a little sum on the network then compare the results. If you both have the same result then it's taken as being correct. However, that's only really as good as anybody who trusts you as an operator. </p> <p><strong> Do you see it as an extension or an alternative to the internet?</strong> I don't think anyone can really envisage themselves browsing the internet on their mobile phone - tiny little screen, tiny little keyboard. If, however, someone enabled you to view the top10 albums or the Premier League football results then that's the kind of information you want to know when you're on the move. It's more a kind of internet buddy which gives you information and e-mail while you're mobile, but doesn't try and swamp you with stuff. </p> <p><strong> How do you see the net developing?</strong> I really think that the net is going to take on the fact that mobile is big - providing that it can be delivered over the mobile range. I have a little browser that we developed which is set up to send me only the information I'm after. </p> <p><strong> Anything you dislike about the net?</strong> Intrusive advertising. You get a page up and you have to go through another six pages before you get to what you want! If that's the only way people are able to pay for their sites then the fewer people visiting the site, the more advertising they'll need for revenue. Hence less of the information you want to look at is there for you. </p>",

I'm a Leeds United supporter so I visit www.lufc.co.uk all the time. I'm also a regular visitor to the BBC site, and when the Superbike racing is on, I visit the Yamaha site at www.yamaha-motor.com. How important will mobile technology become? Penetration of PCs is so small, but the penetration of mobile phones is reaching 40 to 50% even in quite under-developed countries. So there's now this massive potential to deliver a service through an internet backbone to the real populous. I started getting interested when I found that you could put an internet-type browser on the SIM itself. Every single mobile phone has got a little smart-card and it's only really used for security. There's loads of spare capacity. How secure are mobiles for e-commerce? Mobile phones are capable of delivering a digital signature that is acceptable for legal documents. If you can accept that as a signature then you can start using it to sign leases, buy cars and all sorts of other things. The public infrastructure for smart-cards isn't going to be secure enough to be acceptable until about probably this September. In the meantime there's Symmetric Security which basically means you do a little sum on the SIM and a little sum on the network then compare the results. If you both have the same result then it's taken as being correct. However, that's only really as good as anybody who trusts you as an operator. Do you see it as an extension or an alternative to the internet? I don't think anyone can really envisage themselves browsing the internet on their mobile phone - tiny little screen, tiny little keyboard. If, however, someone enabled you to view the top10 albums or the Premier League football results then that's the kind of information you want to know when you're on the move. It's more a kind of internet buddy which gives you information and e-mail while you're mobile, but doesn't try and swamp you with stuff. How do you see the net developing? I really think that the net is going to take on the fact that mobile is big - providing that it can be delivered over the mobile range. I have a little browser that we developed which is set up to send me only the information I'm after. Anything you dislike about the net? Intrusive advertising. You get a page up and you have to go through another six pages before you get to what you want! If that's the only way people are able to pay for their sites then the fewer people visiting the site, the more advertising they'll need for revenue. Hence less of the information you want to look at is there for you.",

This assertion does not detract from the point that (on average) males score higher than females in points-based computer games. The difference in spatial ability skills between males and females may itself be a reason why females prefer co-operative as opposed to competitive games. Gender differences in \"competition vs co-operation\" has been well researched in relation to the effect of computers (rather than computer games) on educational learning. It has been clearly demonstrated that girls working together on computers will complete tasks faster than boys working together because boys will compete rather than co-operate with each other. However, when boys are explicitly told to co-operate, they complete problem solving tasks on the computer just as fast as girls.

It's no coincidence that the most popular interactive feature on Virgin Mobile is one that allows you to listen to chart music over an ordinary mobile. Next generation mobile devices, much more powerful than today's, are due to arrive in a few years' time, with bidding for licences happening now.

The range will include televisions with built-in internet access, starting from under \u00a3200, and set-top boxes for under \u00a3100, and should go on sale in May. The internet appliance market could hot up in the months to come: watch out for announcements from Amstrad, Sony, Microsoft and even Apple later in the year. (NM)</p>",

It's no coincidence that the most popular interactive feature on Virgin Mobile is one that allows you to listen to chart music over an ordinary mobile. Next generation mobile devices, much more powerful than today's, are due to arrive in a few years' time, with bidding for licences happening now. Might we begin to see radio and data come over the same device? Virgin Radio seems to be betting on it. Internet TV Television maker Alba is to team up with Pace to launch internet-capable television products. The range will include televisions with built-in internet access, starting from under \u00a3200, and set-top boxes for under \u00a3100, and should go on sale in May. The internet appliance market could hot up in the months to come: watch out for announcements from Amstrad, Sony, Microsoft and even Apple later in the year. (NM)",

      "body": "<p>Microsoft will announce its plans for the games console market tomorrow, perhaps unveiling prototypes of its long-rumoured X-Box. And because of the time difference, when the company's co-founder Bill Gates makes his keynote speech at a game developers conference in San Jose, California, British enthusiasts will already have heard the news. </p> <p>According to rumours, the X-Box will be a $299 games console based on PC technology, and it will plug into a TV set instead of using a monitor. It's expected to sport a Pentium-compatible Athlon processor from AMD, an Nvidia GeForce graphics chip, and a modem. The rest of the specification is malleable, but the new machine is unlikely to promise anything that hasn't been developed for the PC games market. It's using PC parts, and Windows software, that makes the enterprise viable. </p> <p>The key questions are, first, is Microsoft going into the hardware business, or can the X-Box be made by anyone who fancies the idea? And second, when will it be available? With Sony's PlayStation 2 already on sale in Japan, isn't the rumoured Autumn 2001 date leaving it too late? </p> <p>It would send shockwaves through the industry if Microsoft decided to market the X-Box under its own name. That would mean going head-to-head with Sony, Nintendo, and Sega - and Sega is a Microsoft customer, using Windows CE in its Dreamcast console. But it's not impossible, because Microsoft has already built a healthy market for hardware add-ons including mice, keyboards, joysticks, and steering wheels. </p> <p>Microsoft's usual approach is to provide operating software to all comers and let them duke it out in the marketplace. That way, consumers get a variety of hardware to choose from, and competition drives down prices. Some of the hardware suppliers may lose their shirts, but Microsoft usually wins. </p> <p>Usually, but not always. Microsoft has been in the games business for two decades, and has already had at least two goes at the consumer market. </p> <p>The first effort came in the 1980s, with a system called MSX. At the time, the home computer market was struggling with a lot of incompatible formats from companies such as Acorn, Amstrad, Atari, Commodore and Sinclair Research. Software houses couldn't keep up with them all. Microsoft tried to rationalise the business with a single system, MSX, supported by numerous manufacturers. </p> <p>Canon, Panasonic, Philips, Sony, Toshiba, Yamaha and another dozen companies all made MSX machines, but the system was not very successful outside Japan. Partly this was because it wasn't good enough: MSX was designed to be a versatile home computer but most buyers wanted a hot games machine. It was also too late. The home computers that MSX targeted were already being replaced by a new generation of more powerful models such as the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga. </p> <p>Microsoft had another skirmish with the consumer market a decade later when CD-rom seemed the format of the future. The idea was a versatile \"edutainment\" player that would sit under the TV in the living room and run audio CDs, encyclopedias and games. Philips and others tried it with the CDi (CD Interactive) system, Commodore with the Amiga-based CDTV, and Apple and Japan's Bandai with the Mac-based Pippin. They all flopped. Hardly anyone noticed the Microsoft offering - a $699 VIS (Video Information System) running \"Modular Windows\" - which was sold in the US by Tandy. </p> <p>Although it was meant to capitalise on the success of Microsoft Windows 3, only about two dozen companies offered VIS titles. The bare handful of games included Chuck Yeager's Air Combat (Electronic Arts), Lemmings (Psygnosis), and The Manhole (Activision). </p> <p>However, Microsoft soon got serious about games, for very good reasons. It wanted consumers to move to Windows 95 but the games market was still dominated by DOS. Indeed, the Software Publishers Association said that at the start of 1996, DOS games were outselling Windows 95 games by 10 to one. But installing DOS games was a messy business; some people could never get them to work. It was also bad for strategic reasons: how could Microsoft get rid of DOS if the games market depended on it? The growth of games companies such as Electronic Arts also suggested that - altruism be damned - there was money to be made. </p> <p> To succeed, Microsoft had to put better, faster games technology into Windows, which it did with its DirectX system. Not all versions of DirectX were fully debugged, and it sometimes seemed that every new game installed a new version of DirectX, but eventually the idea worked. </p> <p>Microsoft also had to forget about writing everything itself and work with third-party developers. In January 1996, it announced link-ups with four US-based developers: Atomic Games, Crystal Dynamics, Rainbow America and Terminal Reality. </p> <p>To bump up its in-house expertise, Microsoft also bought the Bruce Artwick Organization and hired Alexey Pajitnov. Artwick had developed Microsoft's best-selling DOS game, Microsoft Flight Simulator, while Pajitnov, a Russian, had created the compulsive puzzle, Tetris. </p> <p>Another astute move was to put a keen gamer, Ed Fries (rhymes with fleece), in charge of the entertainment division. He'd already spent a decade at Microsoft and had worked on Word and Excel. At the time, he said: \"I would like to be the number one games publisher. That won't mean I'll have 80% of the market - if you had 15% you'd be number one today. I think the games market will always be very fragmented, but being number one is always the right target.

What's reasonably certain is that the Paramount Pictures film will be directed by Simon \"Con Air\" West and written by Michael Werb and Michael Colleary, of Face/Off fame. Other snippets, in decreasing order of reliability, are as follows: \u00a320m-\u00a330m budget; Rene Russo and Brian Blessed to play Lara's parents; opening sequence somehow incorporating the Millennium Wheel; and Angelina Jolie, well-turned star of Hackers (above), The Bone Collector and Girl Interrupted, in negotiations for the leading role. If the film gets as many sequels as Eidos's game, Ms Jolie would be a fool to say no. </p> <p><strong> The game of the film</strong><br> Last year's Film Most Likely To Be Made Into A Game seems to have realised its potential at last. Rumour is that Interplay is about to sign a deal to publish a title based on The Matrix, the techno phobic special-effects blockbuster starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. No word yet on whether any of the movie's stars will be involved; if so, they might even have to do some acting. </p> <p><strong> Best of inmates </strong><br> Ever wondered what would have happened if Kingpin had been caught? Find out later this year in Gothic, a real-time 3D role playing game from German developer Piranha Bytes which begins, of all places, in the slammer. In the first part of the game, you must bribe, intimidate and fight your way up the prison pecking order. Then, of course, you break out and start cutting up goblins. After three years in development, the game will be presented at the E3 exhibition in May. See <a href=\"http://www.piranha-bytes.com/  \">www.piranha-bytes.com</a> </p> <p><strong> The final frontier </strong><br> The massively multiplayer boom continues with the announcement that Activision is to release Star Trek: Conquest Online.

      "bodyText": "The season to be Jolie Most of the week's idle gossip has been dedicated to the forthcoming Tomb Raider movie. What's reasonably certain is that the Paramount Pictures film will be directed by Simon \"Con Air\" West and written by Michael Werb and Michael Colleary, of Face/Off fame. Other snippets, in decreasing order of reliability, are as follows: \u00a320m-\u00a330m budget; Rene Russo and Brian Blessed to play Lara's parents; opening sequence somehow incorporating the Millennium Wheel; and Angelina Jolie, well-turned star of Hackers (above), The Bone Collector and Girl Interrupted, in negotiations for the leading role. If the film gets as many sequels as Eidos's game, Ms Jolie would be a fool to say no. The game of the film Last year's Film Most Likely To Be Made Into A Game seems to have realised its potential at last. Rumour is that Interplay is about to sign a deal to publish a title based on The Matrix, the techno phobic special-effects blockbuster starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. No word yet on whether any of the movie's stars will be involved; if so, they might even have to do some acting. Best of inmates Ever wondered what would have happened if Kingpin had been caught? Find out later this year in Gothic, a real-time 3D role playing game from German developer Piranha Bytes which begins, of all places, in the slammer. In the first part of the game, you must bribe, intimidate and fight your way up the prison pecking order. Then, of course, you break out and start cutting up goblins. After three years in development, the game will be presented at the E3 exhibition in May. See www.piranha-bytes.com The final frontier The massively multiplayer boom continues with the announcement that Activision is to release Star Trek: Conquest Online. Some time later this year, Trekkers worldwide will be able to join forces in order to obliterate alien hordes (or, more likely, find a mutually beneficial solution).

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Universities are dead. Campuses are defunct and everyone gets their degree online. Welcome to the future. Or is it? It's a spectre that haunts the education system, and it is already sending ripples of change through the world's learning communities.</p> <p> In almost all areas of modern life, the internet revolution has smashed down barriers and blurred boundaries. And education is no exception. Education and employment secretary David Blunkett recently announced plans for a global education alliance - provisionally called the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN) - which will involve eight British and American institutions. He also outlined plans to invite bids for Britain's first e-university, which will be able to award degrees. </p> <p> If the future of learning is online, who are the key players? And what aspects of education, as we know it, will remain? Revolutions have to start somewhere. At the lowest level, we know the internet allows discussion via email, chat rooms and newsgroups. Next there's the idea of online groups, learning as the \"community mind\", where you both gain from, and contribute to, collective understanding. Beyond this point, ideas become more hypothetical, like those offered by Xerox chief scientist and distance learning theorist Dr John Seely Brown. </p> <p>He sees the internet generating a shift from linear learning in books to the idea of \"multiple intelligences\". Multiple formats such as hyperlinks (highlighted phrases you click on within a body of text, which lead to another web page), video, sound, graphics, all embedded within an online page, mean students learn in more flexible ways. \"Learning is a fundamentally social process,\" Dr Brown says.</p> <p> \"The power of the internet is not just that it provides the content... it provides communities of specialised interest in which to facilitate learning.\" The institution at the forefront of distance learning over the past 30 years has been the <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk\" target=\"_new\">Open University</a> which has shown that such education can be of high quality. So is the OU rushing to put all its degree courses online? </p> <p> Professor David Sewart, director of student services, is responsible for the delivery of education to the 156,000 students. He says they are \"looking to attract the widest possible market\". With half of its students online, the OU looks to provide learning through a wide variety of media. Sewart not only has the OU Business School MBA degree, he teaches it. It uses the First Class conferencing system, where students learn as part of an online community. Each has access to chat and gains from other students and teachers online. </p> <p>The technology to obtain a degree purely through online study does not exist yet. Sewart even says he \"remains to be convinced that online learning is going to take over completely within any time frame yet definable\". </p> <p> \"Students simply don't want anything to get in the way of their learning experience,\" he says, adding: \"Few technologies teach more effectively than the book.\" \"It's portable, you can access multiple pages at once and annotate them too. Screens just aren't as easy to read from. We find with web courses people are printing more and more.\" But with companies like Xerox and Microsoft developing technologies to improve text clarity on screens, a challenge is being mounted to the printed page. Would you trust a doctor with just a virtual degree? There is a strong argument for saying certain experiences simply can't be digitised. </p> <p>Pilots can be trained in simulators, but there comes a point when a surgeon needs to see someone's insides. This is one reason the OU has never offered distance medicine courses. But it does have one completely online course: T171, You, your computer and the net. One of the T171 students is called John. He's no ordinary student. Most people call him Sir. Sir John Daniel is the Vice Chancellor of the OU. \" It was a practical way of finding out what I thought of T171 as a teaching tool,\" he says. \"I was glad I took T171 because it attracted over 18,000 applications this year. That makes us the biggest university in cyberspace.</p> <p> \"Because of our history we have a level of sophistication that allows us to be more cautious than those who rush in from scratch. It sets us apart from those who just put their notes on the web and think they have a wonderful distance learning course.\" There has, nonetheless, been a rush by academic institutions into the distance learning market. It remains to be seen whether those first online will clean up. Unlike books, where Amazon has done so well, what sets education apart from many \"products\" is the requirement for service after the initial \"sale\". In the US, large ventures have begun to make an impact online. Phoenix university has also set up more than 60 campuses worldwide employing university lecturers on a consultancy basis. </p> <p>Jones International, a for-profit university, recently caused controversy by gaining full degree accreditation. The traditional universities have had it good for some time and might find the going getting tougher as overseas institutions start selling distance learning courses . A forthcoming report, Borderless Education, and a recently issued Foresight report both issue warnings. \"British universities are ill prepared to cope with the rising forces of globalisation,\" senior academics have been told. </p> <p>\"Universities need to wake up and see what their role is,\" argues Dr Robin Mason, a global education expert, based at the OU. What is increasingly possible, she suggests, is collaboration. Cambridge and MIT recently announced an \u00a385m link-up. So are universities dead and campuses defunct? Many people will always want the campus experience. Harvard business school, with its invaluable old boy network, simply wouldn't translate on to the net. Professor David McConnell, of the department of education studies at Sheffield university, points out: \"Students need a sense of belonging to learn.\" </p> <p>He is one of the British academics looking at how to create that magic social interaction online. For most students, the campus learning experience has always extended beyond the lecture hall. It also educates students in what Sir John Daniel describes as \"love, liquor and life\". \u00b3\"The death of the campus is grossly exaggerated,\" he adds. But the shift in online possibilities, coupled with the introduction of fees, has meant students increasingly perceive higher education as an investment. And students expect high returns. </p> <p> One organisation with its roots in online life-long learning is the University for Industry (Ufi). Dr Brian Sutton, director of information and computer technology, says: \"We're trying to attract new learners, people who dropped out of the education system early.\" The university offers \"byte-size\" courses that can be as short as two hours. It's learning without a big commitment, in a way that fits into people's lives. Ufi is conducting free trials now, and plans to be fully operational by the autumn. </p> <p> The big movement in educating industry has come from within. Over recent years many corporate big guns have been wielding serious money in the name of education. There are now more than 1,200 \"corporate universities\", most of which are based in the US. Take for example software giant Microsoft and computer hardware company Cisco Systems, the first and third most valuable corporations in the world respectively. Their computing qualifications, now available to the public, are more highly valued than a degree. </p> <p> Targeting a completely different market is a new Channel 4 online service, Homework High. Launched in mid January, the site is a well-designed balance of functionality and good looks. Aimed at nine-16 year olds, it is a free service designed to help with homework and revision. Twice daily, Monday to Friday, teachers go online and help tackle pupils' emailed problems. So do kids like it? \"The response has been fantastic. Our server melted recently,\" says Sophie Walpole, Homework High's managing editor of interactive services. But she does stress: \"We do not give out all the answers.\" </p> <p>Parents can rest easy. What is distance learning going to be like in 50 years time? \"The only generalisation you can make about the future is that all generalisations are false, including this one,\" concludes the OU's Sir John Daniel. But for now the view looks good. Education is online and it is in campuses. It is in commerce and in pieces of every size. There are more players in the field, appealing to more sections of the global public, than ever before. Indeed, it is as fractured and diverse as modern life is itself. \"Living and learning are two sides of the same coin,\" concludes John Seely Brown. Here's to a life of both. </p> <p><strong>I may live in Munich, but I go to my classes in Milton Keynes</strong><br> Three weeks into her Open University MA in Open and Distance Education, Frieda Pattenden's experiences have not run to cybersex in freshers' week, although she doesn't rule it out as a possibility some students might wish to explore in the virtual campus's cybercafe. </p> <p>Pattenden, who teaches English at Munich's Ludwig Maximilian university, has paid \u00a32,500 for the privilege of studying from home, and that's just for one module (you must complete three to gain the MA). But she and the other students, many of whom are already designing courses, are convinced that online learning is a growth area, and some of their employers have contributed towards their fees. </p> <p>A lot of thought has gone into creating a smooth-running campus, says Pattenden, and there is a real sense of community within her 10-strong tutorial group. The other tutees are based all over the world - Canada, Greece, Portugal - and back in Milton Keynes, the tutor, John Pettit, encourages students to introduce themselves, and be as relaxed with each other as possible. </p> <p>\"The first time you log on, you are invited on a guided tour of the virtual campus, the student union, the library, the tutorial area, where your tutor group conference discussions take place. Each member of staff has a smiling photo alongside their name.\" </p> <p>A debate is under way about whether students should post their own photos on site. \"Such debates are integral to the course. Through collaborative learning via computer conferencing, we are trying to assess how online education can be productive and worthwhile,\" says Pattenden. </p> <p>The course is not trying to emulate face-to-face courses. \"I don't feel I'm typing into a void. People's personalities come through clearly in the comments they post up on the conferencing system,\" she says. </p> <p>Motivation, it seems, is high. The tutor gives the students a task, and as a group, via the conferencing system, they must present their findings. \"Collaborative learning reflects what employers want in the workplace - team players - whereas traditional university courses encourage competition between students,\" says Pattenden. </p> <p>Next month those who have graduated will be presented with their certificates. And the ceremony will, of course, be online . <br> <strong> Lucy Blincoe</strong> </p> <p><strong>Learn online</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.aln.org\">www.aln.org</a><br> A forum for online networks. <a href=\"http://www.jonesinternational.edu \">www.jonesinternational.edu</a> <br> First online accredited university <br><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.bbc.co.uk/education/gcsebitesize</a><br> Revision guide for GCSE <br> <a href=\"http://www.blueu.com \">www.blueu.com</a><br> IT and corporate training <br> <a href=\"http://www.homeworkhigh.com\">www.homeworkhigh.com</a><br> Channel 4's kids learning site. <br> <a href=\"http://www.uophx.edu\">www.uophx.edu</a><br> University of Phoenix online <br> <a href=\"http://www.cisnet.com/~cattales/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cisnet.com/~cattales/Deducation.html</a><br> Library of online courses. <br> <a href=\"http://www.hungryminds.com\">www.hungryminds.com</a><br> Database of 37,000 courses <br> <a href=\"http://www.theNode.org\">www.theNode.org</a><br> Online forum <br> <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk\">www.open.ac.uk</a><br> Open University <br> <a href=\"http://www.ufiltd.co.uk\">www.ufiltd.co.uk</a><br> University for Industry.</p>",

But she and the other students, many of whom are already designing courses, are convinced that online learning is a growth area, and some of their employers have contributed towards their fees. A lot of thought has gone into creating a smooth-running campus, says Pattenden, and there is a real sense of community within her 10-strong tutorial group. The other tutees are based all over the world - Canada, Greece, Portugal - and back in Milton Keynes, the tutor, John Pettit, encourages students to introduce themselves, and be as relaxed with each other as possible. \"The first time you log on, you are invited on a guided tour of the virtual campus, the student union, the library, the tutorial area, where your tutor group conference discussions take place. Each member of staff has a smiling photo alongside their name.\" A debate is under way about whether students should post their own photos on site. \"Such debates are integral to the course. Through collaborative learning via computer conferencing, we are trying to assess how online education can be productive and worthwhile,\" says Pattenden. The course is not trying to emulate face-to-face courses. \"I don't feel I'm typing into a void. People's personalities come through clearly in the comments they post up on the conferencing system,\" she says. Motivation, it seems, is high. The tutor gives the students a task, and as a group, via the conferencing system, they must present their findings. \"Collaborative learning reflects what employers want in the workplace - team players - whereas traditional university courses encourage competition between students,\" says Pattenden. Next month those who have graduated will be presented with their certificates. And the ceremony will, of course, be online .

When it is time to zip up, he cradles his cell-phone on his shoulder and goes on talking. But then the phone slips out from under his chin, and tumbles - splash - you guess where. The answer to this dilemma, according to the ad, is a new \"hands-free\" cellular phone service. </p> <p>The real answer, of course, is not to bring one's business into the bathroom. But today, no place, and -more importantly - no time is sacred. In an internet-accelerated transaction society, we are to be available to our business associates through our mediating technologies at any hour, day or night. We are \"on call\" 24/7 (web-slave slang for working 24 hours, seven days a week). We feel we are beating the game if we've programmed our cell phone to ring with a unique melody, so that we don't reach into our coat pockets when someone else's phone rings in the same restaurant. </p> <p>Thanks to the way that technology accelerates and exacerbates nearly every cultural and economic trend, an increasing number of people, including me, are coming to the conclusion that our time, and by inference our lives, are no longer our own. We work six-days or more, usually answering work-related email well into the night, then use our nominal \"day off\" to go to the mall and shop - or, if we're feeling particularly guilty, take our kids to a historic shopping centre like Covent Garden instead. There, we buy products at a store with a name like Ye Olde Kite Shop instead of Toys \"R\" Us, and rationalise that it's an educational, family activity. </p> <p>We live in an age when online marketers measure human attention in quantities called \"eyeball hours.\" Any moment spent thinking instead of spending, or laughing instead of working is an opportunity missed. And the more time we sacrifice to production and consumption, the less any alternative seems available. My radical proposal to combat the contraction of personal time has been borrowed from the book of Exodus, and it's called the Sabbath. What if we all decided that for one day each week, we would refrain from buying or selling anything? Maybe the ancients didn't pick the number seven out of a hat. Perhaps they understood that human beings can only immerse themselves in commerce for six days at a stretch before losing touch with anything approaching a civic, social, or spiritual reality. </p> <p>Sabbath is a way to reclaim one's time and, as American kiddie-television hero Mr Rogers might tell us, celebrate that we are special, even sacred, \"just the way we are.\" We don't need to do anything to justify our existence. Not answer the phone, not go online, and not pull out the Visa card. It doesn't require that we retreat to the backwoods, purchase generators, and live off the land, only that we find something to do with our friends or family that's not about money. No, the ball game and movies don't count. Try playing ball in the park, or telling your own stories, instead. You might notice just how few public parks and community activities we have left. If the Sabbath's religious overtones offend your secular humanist sensibilities, then call it the \"one-seventh rule.\" </p> <p>Take back just one-seventh of your time. I imagine it would throw America into a recession - as well as any other nation that has decided to adopt corporate capitalism as its sole cultural imperative. It's not as if we'll get all that buying and selling done during the other six days. We already spend every waking minute doing that as it is. No, it would mean we would buy and sell one-seventh less stuff. And worse, once we get a taste of what that's like, shopping and spending might even lose some of its appeal.

      "body": "<p>Bill Hamilton, who has died aged 63 after weeks in intensive care following a biological expedition to the Congo, was the primary theoretical innovator in modern Darwinian biology, responsible for the shape of the subject today.</p> <p>Educated at Tonbridge school, he came across RA Fisher's Genetical Theory Of Natural Selection while a Cambridge university undergraduate. When he prompted one of his tutors about the book, he was told it was mistaken and that the author, still then lecturing in Cambridge, had \"no standing to write about biology\".</p> <p>Bill was captured by the intellectual excitement of this remarkable book, and spent his working life pursuing its line. In so doing, he provided the conceptual foundation for our understanding of how natural selection acts on social behaviour, opened up the area of \"extraordinary\" (that is, unequal) sex ratios, transformed thinking on sexual selection and produced a corpus of work that demonstrates the capacity of parasite-host interactions to support the maintenance of sexual reproduction. These are the primary Darwinian themes of the second half of the 20th century, and can be understood only in the context of Bill's contributions. He, like Fisher before him, took many steps at once away from conventional paths, and found that eventually biologists would change their conventions.</p> <p>The career of a typical Hamilton paper can be caricatured as follows. In review, it is panned by referees who demand shortenings and revisions. Immediately after publication, it attracts criticism for obscurity. Its significance slowly emerges through secondary works, further work is inspired, and one or more literatures develop around its themes. Later more mathematical work may even be rather patronising about the paper, and emphasise discrepancies, while the primary finding is that the original idea is abundantly confirmed.

      "bodyText": "Bill Hamilton, who has died aged 63 after weeks in intensive care following a biological expedition to the Congo, was the primary theoretical innovator in modern Darwinian biology, responsible for the shape of the subject today. Educated at Tonbridge school, he came across RA Fisher's Genetical Theory Of Natural Selection while a Cambridge university undergraduate. When he prompted one of his tutors about the book, he was told it was mistaken and that the author, still then lecturing in Cambridge, had \"no standing to write about biology\". Bill was captured by the intellectual excitement of this remarkable book, and spent his working life pursuing its line. In so doing, he provided the conceptual foundation for our understanding of how natural selection acts on social behaviour, opened up the area of \"extraordinary\" (that is, unequal) sex ratios, transformed thinking on sexual selection and produced a corpus of work that demonstrates the capacity of parasite-host interactions to support the maintenance of sexual reproduction. These are the primary Darwinian themes of the second half of the 20th century, and can be understood only in the context of Bill's contributions. He, like Fisher before him, took many steps at once away from conventional paths, and found that eventually biologists would change their conventions. The career of a typical Hamilton paper can be caricatured as follows. In review, it is panned by referees who demand shortenings and revisions. Immediately after publication, it attracts criticism for obscurity. Its significance slowly emerges through secondary works, further work is inspired, and one or more literatures develop around its themes. Later more mathematical work may even be rather patronising about the paper, and emphasise discrepancies, while the primary finding is that the original idea is abundantly confirmed. The original paper is frequently, indeed often obligatorily, cited in papers in the new literatures, but is not read nearly as often as it deserves to be, since it retains a reputation for obscurity. The joy of reading the original paper is becoming aware of remaining steps. We can look forward to decades of catching up with Bill's biological thoughts. He fused mathematics and natural history.

Staying on in New York, Gray took the title-role in The Right Honourable Gentle man (1965), a Victorian politician and sexual hypocrite. Plenty of other stage credits followed. Among small screen credits were Strickland in The Moon And Sixpence, rated as rivalling George Sanders in the film, the bland brother-in-law in Pinter's The Tea Party, the amorous TV personality in Fay Weldon's The Three Wives Of Felix Hull, an overbearing Randolph Churchill in Hugo Charteris's Asquith, the trouble-making judge in Blind Justice, the acerbic Sir Cathcart in Porterhouse Blue, an impoverished peer in The Upper Crust series and an imperious old buffer in Longitude. Among film credits were Narrator in Jim Sharman's The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the satanic priest who duelled with Christopher Lee in The Devil Rides Out, the sinister butler in The Mirror Crack'd and Judge in Shock Treatment. Charles Gray never married. \u0095 Charles (Donald Marshall) Gray, actor, born August 29 1928; died March 7 2000",

      "bodyText": "Pope John Paul II's imminent apology for the Catholic church's errors was snagged yesterday on his decision to beatify a predecessor who kidnapped a Jewish child. Italy's Jews denounced the elevation of Pius IX as in effect condoning the 1858 snatching of Edgardo Mortara, who was raised as the pope's son after a maid said she had baptised him. They said putting a \"criminal\" like Pius on the road to sainthood had soured the build-up to Sunday's long-awaited, sweeping mea culpa for 2,000 years of mistakes and persecution. They did not want to spurn the offer of reconciliation, but said it was necessary to speak out against the beatification of a pontiff who herded Rome's Jews into a ghetto and forcibly converted their children. Liberal Catholics fear that the ailing John Paul's increasingly frantic pace of canonisations and beatifications is elevating unsuitable subjects and provoking backlashes. Protests have flared in Spain over a proposal to sanctify as martyrs 10,000 priests, monks and nuns who backed Franco in the civil war. Italy's Jews hesitated to speak out just before the mea culpa, but said that Pius's beatification, planned for September, could not go unchallenged. \"He was a criminal, a theological kidnapper,\" said Enrico Modigliani at a press conference of Jewish organisations. Pius IX, who reigned for 32 years until 1878, was initially a reformer, but the revolutions of 1848 shook him. He executed enemies, promulgated the doc trine of papal infallibility and ordered Jews back to the ghetto which had been torn down. Jewish children were kidnapped, but the most sensational case occurred in Bologna when papal police seized the six-year-old Edgardo Mortara. Even though his wealthy parents petitioned papal and Italian courts, and Britain, France, the US, the Netherlands and Spain lobbied for his return, Pius adopted the boy as his son. The Vatican considered beatifying Pius in 1954, but it emerged that he had humiliated and psychologically scarred his charge. The idea was dropped until 1986, when an alleged miracle was submitted for scrutiny. In his eagerness to supply Catholic role models, John Paul has outstripped his combined 20th-century predecessors in beatifying and canonising more than 1,200 candidates. Israel, aware that a bigger fight looms next year when the Vatican may beatify Pius XII despite claims that he failed to help Jews during the Holocaust, has not protested over Pius IX. Yesterday's protest ratcheted up tension over how specific and how contrite Sunday's apology should be. Some conservative Catholics are appalled at the initiative.

Truth to tell, quite a lot; and the least of it was in the article of mine, commemorating the Labour Party's 100th anniversary, which provoked this retaliation. That article, which contained only a passing reference to George, was just the last straw, so to speak, which broke - in the absence of a funny bone - George Walden's back.</p> <p>We used to be friends. As an aspiring official in the foreign office, he was a bit too prone to suck up, and continued to do so in his early days as a Conservative MP. Indeed, I recall with pleasure at least one lunch as his guest at the House of Commons, the purpose of which was to tell me that he agreed with every word I wrote. Relations grew even friendlier when he became brother-in-law to my friend, Paul Johnson, having married Marigold Johnson's beautiful and talented sister, Sarah, the art expert.</p> <p>So what went wrong? I rather suspect that the rot set in one day when we were, by chance, lunching at the communal table in the Garrick Club and I overheard George pontificating to a number of glazed-eyed members about English literature and the modern novel. What had set him off was the fact that the Booker Prize judges of that year had just chosen Kazuo Ishiguro's, The Remains of the Day - \"nostalgic snobbery\", as he put it, \"about a pre-war English butler\" - instead of Martin Amis's much more \"relevant\" London Fields, about contemporary dropouts and drug addicts.</p> <p>Annoyed by such Philistine trendiness I tried to point out that Ishiguro's novel was a subtle study of loyalty, showing it to be as much a vice as a virtue, and as such a subject of perennial interest and importance. Then, hitting a bit below the belt, I went on to inquire whether he thought an English butler too lowly a figure to be expected to do justice to such a grand theme?</p> <p>Looking back, I cannot quite remember why I had become so angry. I think it must have been because, for the first time, I began to see in George the outlines of that monumental prat which he has gone on to become.</p> <p>That, however, would have been that, had not, a few years later, George Walden been made chairman of the Booker Prize judges.</p> <p>Do you remember when the narrator of Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time rubs his eyes with horror on hearing that the insufferable Widmerpool, of all people, has been chosen to chair the Arts Council, or some such body? Well, my reactions were exactly of that order. It was too bad to be true and I wrote a column in the Daily Telegraph saying so. Then, most recently of all, I piled on the heat by writing a vicious review in the Spectator of his self-aggrandising autobiography, Lucky George.</p> <p>So, as I say, his retaliation in this week's New Statesman is more than justified and long overdue. I had certainly asked to be given the old heave-ho, and deserved everything I got. The trouble though, is that, in his letter, he goes to great lengths to insist that he has not read a line that I have written \"for a decade or more\"; has not read, that is, the very words which might be thought to justify him in hitting back.</p> <p>What can the trouble really be? I fear that it all comes down to the servant problem, which seems to have got under George's skin. Arguing with me, he writes, is quite beneath him; \"it would be like arguing with the servants\". Then, searching around for a way to deliver the coup de grace, he can think of no worse insult than to say that I have \"the intellect and manner\" and even the appearance of, wait for it, \"an under butler\", a de haut en bas putdown worthy of that most superior person, George Nathaniel, Marquis Curzon of Kedleston.</p> <p>Oddly enough, in the book section of the same issue of the New Statesman in which George's abusive assault on me appears, there is a review of a recently published diary of a Prussian aristocrat who, on meeting Hitler in 1936, writes him off as the very \"stereotype of the head waiter\".

      "body": "<p>There are crowds of teenagers outside the London Weekend Television studios all Saturday morning while Ant and Dec record SM:TV and CD:UK. Once the shows are over, out come Mel C (who signs every single autograph book offered to her), Savage Garden, the Bluetones and various boy and girl bands who are largely indistinguishable.</p> <p>The girls go mad, jump up and down, and scream a lot. And when they spot Ant and Dec up in the bar being photographed against the huge glass windows, they form a drop-jawed semi-circle like triffids, staring and waving up at us until I, uncomfortably, suggest moving. \"Nah, they're all right,\" says Dec, smiling easily down at them and waving back. \"This isn't actually as bad as when we were doing the music side of stuff.\" Ant smiles and waves, too. \"That was full-on, that was, girls standing outside your house and stuff. Now it's calmed down, apart from Saturdays, when they come for the bands, really. You get used to it. Really.\"</p> <p>They're both small and slim, with their three-letter names and floppy, boy-band haircuts. Ant (Anthony McPartlin) is the dark-haired one, while Dec (Declan Donnelly) is frequently referred to as the Paul McCartney lookalike: cheery, open-faced and always likely to make a joke if he feels all is not going smoothly.</p> <p>A year ago, few people over the age of 17 would have been interested in telling the difference between them; but SM:TV and CD:UK have changed all that. As friend and journalist Jordan Paramor says: \"When they went into pubs a couple of years ago, big blokes used to want to beat them up. Now they come over and tell them the answer to that week's Wonky Donkey.\" Their children's Saturday morning TV show has become a cult favourite, with at least half its 2.2m audience made up of 16 to 34-year-olds. Sections like Chums, their take-off of Friends, has celebs ringing up and asking to appear (the week that I meet them, Caprice has turned up to play Ant's girlfriend).</p> <p>Although no one will ever know for sure, rumours flew in early 1999 that the reason Zoe Ball was quitting Live and Kicking was because, for the first time in television history, ITV was beating the BBC on a Saturday morning.</p> <p>Their new show for the BBC - Friends Like These, designed to capture even \"people who hate game shows\" - is showing signs of doing even better. The ad at the end of the one-off pilot last year, asking for teams of friends to take part, received 2,000 answers, and the programme has been getting ratings around the 6m mark: not much below Blind Date. The BBC have already commissioned a second series.</p> <p>Ant and Dec have enjoyed quite extraordinary success at almost everything they've tried from the age of 13. Originally, they were both cast in the BBC series Byker Grove, a kids programme set around a Newcastle youth club, in which they played PJ and Duncan, a couple of boys forming a pop band. Then it seemed like a good idea for the boy band in the series to really release a single. Although Tonight I'm Free, their first single, went absolutely nowhere, the next single went to number 15, and suddenly they were a real pop group, touring and being screamed at and followed around by teenage girls wanting to have their babies. Of the 14 singles they released, most reached the top 15.</p> <p>They won Smash Hits awards, and Brit awards (plus a Bafta in 1996), and their albums - the first two under the name of PJ and Duncan, the last as Ant and Dec - went platinum. But music was not really what they wanted to be doing. They're both self-confessed television addicts: when Dec moved house last year, he sorted out cable before he'd even bought a bed. \"They just decided not to renew their contract with Telstar,\" says Paramor. \"They got to the studio, and were due to be working on the next album, and just looked at each other and realised they didn't really want to be there, and phoned up the record company and said, 'Sorry, that's it'.\"</p> <p>Ant and Dec had had a couple of good mornings on the Big Breakfast, then they sold their breakfast TV show to London Weekend Television in late 1997, but the launch was a disaster. \"For the first six months, the BBC were thrashing us - every week,\" remembers Dec. \"Each Saturday, we'd just think, 'They're going to can us'.\"</p> <p>Executive producer Conor McAnally describes the way they tried to redesign the show while they were on air, \"which is never a good idea. But there were things we had to get rid of, like outside broadcasts that were supposed to be live interviews at places like record stores. We'd get there and there wouldn't be anyone around because, of course, no one buys records on a Saturday morning, for God's sake.\" At the time, he points out, the BBC had dominated Saturday morning scheduling for as long as anyone could remember. \"They had about 45% of the viewing audience, while we trailed along with about 28%. But we made the decision to keep running over the summer, when Live &amp; Kicking shut down for the holidays. Slowly, things changed. Now those figures are completely reversed.\" Exit Zoe.

      "bodyText": "There are crowds of teenagers outside the London Weekend Television studios all Saturday morning while Ant and Dec record SM:TV and CD:UK. Once the shows are over, out come Mel C (who signs every single autograph book offered to her), Savage Garden, the Bluetones and various boy and girl bands who are largely indistinguishable. The girls go mad, jump up and down, and scream a lot. And when they spot Ant and Dec up in the bar being photographed against the huge glass windows, they form a drop-jawed semi-circle like triffids, staring and waving up at us until I, uncomfortably, suggest moving. \"Nah, they're all right,\" says Dec, smiling easily down at them and waving back. \"This isn't actually as bad as when we were doing the music side of stuff.\" Ant smiles and waves, too. \"That was full-on, that was, girls standing outside your house and stuff. Now it's calmed down, apart from Saturdays, when they come for the bands, really. You get used to it. Really.\" They're both small and slim, with their three-letter names and floppy, boy-band haircuts. Ant (Anthony McPartlin) is the dark-haired one, while Dec (Declan Donnelly) is frequently referred to as the Paul McCartney lookalike: cheery, open-faced and always likely to make a joke if he feels all is not going smoothly. A year ago, few people over the age of 17 would have been interested in telling the difference between them; but SM:TV and CD:UK have changed all that. As friend and journalist Jordan Paramor says: \"When they went into pubs a couple of years ago, big blokes used to want to beat them up. Now they come over and tell them the answer to that week's Wonky Donkey.\" Their children's Saturday morning TV show has become a cult favourite, with at least half its 2.2m audience made up of 16 to 34-year-olds. Sections like Chums, their take-off of Friends, has celebs ringing up and asking to appear (the week that I meet them, Caprice has turned up to play Ant's girlfriend). Although no one will ever know for sure, rumours flew in early 1999 that the reason Zoe Ball was quitting Live and Kicking was because, for the first time in television history, ITV was beating the BBC on a Saturday morning. Their new show for the BBC - Friends Like These, designed to capture even \"people who hate game shows\" - is showing signs of doing even better. The ad at the end of the one-off pilot last year, asking for teams of friends to take part, received 2,000 answers, and the programme has been getting ratings around the 6m mark: not much below Blind Date. The BBC have already commissioned a second series. Ant and Dec have enjoyed quite extraordinary success at almost everything they've tried from the age of 13. Originally, they were both cast in the BBC series Byker Grove, a kids programme set around a Newcastle youth club, in which they played PJ and Duncan, a couple of boys forming a pop band. Then it seemed like a good idea for the boy band in the series to really release a single. Although Tonight I'm Free, their first single, went absolutely nowhere, the next single went to number 15, and suddenly they were a real pop group, touring and being screamed at and followed around by teenage girls wanting to have their babies. Of the 14 singles they released, most reached the top 15. They won Smash Hits awards, and Brit awards (plus a Bafta in 1996), and their albums - the first two under the name of PJ and Duncan, the last as Ant and Dec - went platinum. But music was not really what they wanted to be doing. They're both self-confessed television addicts: when Dec moved house last year, he sorted out cable before he'd even bought a bed. \"They just decided not to renew their contract with Telstar,\" says Paramor. \"They got to the studio, and were due to be working on the next album, and just looked at each other and realised they didn't really want to be there, and phoned up the record company and said, 'Sorry, that's it'.\" Ant and Dec had had a couple of good mornings on the Big Breakfast, then they sold their breakfast TV show to London Weekend Television in late 1997, but the launch was a disaster. \"For the first six months, the BBC were thrashing us - every week,\" remembers Dec. \"Each Saturday, we'd just think, 'They're going to can us'.\" Executive producer Conor McAnally describes the way they tried to redesign the show while they were on air, \"which is never a good idea. But there were things we had to get rid of, like outside broadcasts that were supposed to be live interviews at places like record stores. We'd get there and there wouldn't be anyone around because, of course, no one buys records on a Saturday morning, for God's sake.\" At the time, he points out, the BBC had dominated Saturday morning scheduling for as long as anyone could remember. \"They had about 45% of the viewing audience, while we trailed along with about 28%. But we made the decision to keep running over the summer, when Live &amp; Kicking shut down for the holidays. Slowly, things changed. Now those figures are completely reversed.\" Exit Zoe. Enter Ant and Dec. The boys at the heart of all this are stunningly normal. No one has a bad word to say about them: down-to-earth and nice are the words that crop up. \"We learnt early on to get on with it: as kids on Byker Grove, it wasn't possible for us to muck around.\" Everyone who works with them talks about what a pleasure it is. \"Utterly professional,\" is how David Young, head of light entertainment at the BBC and the inventor of Friends Like These, describes them. \"They're really nice guys, very intelligent.

As if to confirm the vision, he later wrote: \"My penis sprang to attention with joy and ecstasy.\"</p> <p>In recognition of this brave, if indisputably barmy, attempt to propel a small, dozing Catalan town to cosmic fame - Dali, driving up to Paris from his native Spain, would often stop there to send his luggage ahead by train - the local authorities in Perpignan promptly named the square outside the station Place Salvador Dali. The surrealist master himself was to feature the building in future canvases, several of them filled with the bizarre, grotesque and sexually violent imagery that is a hallmark of his work. One painting titled The Railway Station at Perpignan includes a depiction of a man preparing to sodomise a young woman.</p> <p>All of which would probably be reduced to a mere footnote in the art history books by now were it not for the fact that, in the past five years, three young women have gone missing in Perpignan, and in a very macabre fashion. One, Tatiana Andujar, aged 17, took a train into town and was never seen again. The horribly mutilated bodies of the other two - Mokhtaria Chaib, 19, and Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gonzalez, 22 - were found near the station.</p> <p>Short of other clues, police are wondering if they are not dealing with a serial killer inspired by the tortured visions of Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dali i Domenech, born May 11 1904, died January 23 1989. \"It's a theory they've tested and are continuing to test,\" says Mohamed Iaouadan, a lawyer for the Chaib family. \"I've seen the files, believe me. They've commissioned analytical reports from art experts on the significance of Dali paintings. They're looking for anything that could tie in with the killings, anything.\"</p> <p>Dali's world, on display in an otherworldly museum in his hometown of Figueras, just over the Spanish border a few miles from Perpignan, is a weird one. The artist had a marked preference for masturbation over intercourse. His obsession with vaginas, says one biographer, stems from a profound \"loathing of the female genitalia\". He was, writes Ian Gibson in The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali, \"an impotent outsider\", desperate to join in his friends' sexual escapades but incapable of doing so.</p> <p>Dislocated body parts, notably female breasts, began to appear in his work when the artist was in his early 20s. Later productions feature sprawling, limbless, decapitated bodies; in some, unattached vaginas and anuses fly across the canvas. In the grotesque 1934 The Spectre of Sex Appeal, a small boy stares up at a naked female body without a head and a hand, and with sacks replacing her breasts and womb.</p> <p>That's the point. The naked body of Gonzalez, who worked in a butcher's shop at the seaside resort of Argel\u00e8s-sur-Mer, a few miles south of Perpignan, was found on wasteland near the motorway to Barcelona in June 1998. She had been dead for 10 days. Her head and hands had been cut off. Her vagina had been neatly sliced out, and some of her internal organs had been removed and placed carefully in a cardboard box by her side.</p> <p>Gonzalez was independent and bubbly, says her family's lawyer, Etienne Nicolau. She had come into Perpignan on June 16, on the 8.33pm train from Argel\u00e8s. She had left the station, crossed in front of the Htel Paris-Barcelone, turned right into the Rue Courteline, lined with apartment blocks. Four hundred yards further on, she had passed the Caf\u00e9 Figu\u00e8re before plunging into a dodgy district of lock-up garages and disused workshops.</p> <p>She was, Nicolau is sure, planning to hitch a ride to her parents' home in Toulouges, a small village just outside Perpignan. The route she took is one used by a lot of young people who arrive at the station and want a lift out of town. The favoured spot is the Avenue Julien Panchot, 20 minutes' walk from the station. That afternoon, she had told her parents she would be with them by 10pm.</p> <p>For the Perpignan police, the killing was a grisly echo of another unsolved murder from December 1997. Five days before Christmas, Mokhtaria Chaib had spent the evening with a boyfriend in the Avenue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Gaulle, 200 yards from the railway station. She left his apartment at 11pm, planning to walk back to her campus lodgings at the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire three miles away.</p> <p>A sociology student of Algerian origin, Chaib had fought long and hard with her father and stepmother to lead a life free from the constraints of Islam. She had run away from home at 16, spent a year in a teenage hostel, but completed her baccalaur\u00e9at exam successfully and enrolled at the university in September. She had worked that summer in a beach restaurant at Collioure, just down the coast, to fund her studies. She was a laugh, her friends say: the plaque they paid for on her tomb reads: \"A funny lady.\"</p> <p>Like Gonzalez, Chaib's route took her past the station, down the Rue Courteline, across the Avenue Julien Panchot, and on past a cemetery to the campus. Someone out walking their dog found her nude body the next morning. She had died from three stab wounds to the heart. Her breasts had been cut off and her uterus removed. Her anus, too, had been expertly sliced out. According to the police doctors, the whole operation could only have been done with a scalpel, and must have taken close to an hour.</p> <p>After Chaib's murder, investigators made the link to Tatiana Andujar, a secondary school student who disappeared on the evening of September 24 1995. Another rebellious teen, Andujar had left home for two months that summer, sharing an apartment with friends and working as a waitress in the beach resort of Port Leucate. Back with her Spanish parents in the nearby village of Llupia for her last year at school, she was heading home after a weekend in Toulouse. She called her father to ask him to pick her up at Perpignan station when she arrived, at about 7.30pm. He couldn't leave home.</p> <p>\"So she says no problem, I'll hitch,\" says Nicolau, who also represents the Andujars. \"And she leaves the station - she was seen there by two schoolfriends - and walks down Avenue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Gaulle and turns into the Rue Courteline. And disappears, completely.\"</p> <p>For a while, the police had a suspect who was almost too good to be true. Picked up in the wake of the Chaib murder, Andres Palomino-Barrios was an unemployed Peruvian-born doctor. A homosexual drifter and down-and-out eccentric, he had been kicked out of - or let go from - half a dozen hospitals in south-east France, and was banned from practising further. He had a police record, for illegal residence, trafficking in stolen passports and stealing hospital equipment: stethoscopes and surgical instruments. He lived 300 yards from where Chaib's body was found, little more than half a mile from the station. And, almost unbelievably, he was in training to become a butcher.</p> <p>Palomino-Barrios was arrested, and placed under formal investigation for \"murder and acts of barbarity\". But there was not a shred of forensic evidence against him. Minute searches of his sordid apartment and minivan - which one witness saw him washing vigorously the morning after Chaib was killed - revealed nothing. No blood, no fingerprints, no semen, no hair, no DNA.</p> <p>Police did turn up traces of blood on his clothes, but they proved to be from an animal - which was put down to his butcher's apprenticeship. And while the chief suspect was nearing the end of the six months he spent in Perpignan prison, Gonzalez was murdered, dismembered and partially disembowelled. The doctor was released.</p> <p>Plenty of policemen in Perpignan, however, believe he is guilty of at least one murder. Plenty - there are 15 on the case, full-time, and they have so far interviewed 2,000 people - also believe that, if he is guilty, this pretty, pastel-coloured town with its terrace cafes, Catalan restaurants and winding medieval streets has not one but two sickos on the loose.</p> <p>\"Barrios is definitely the man for me,\" says one senior policeman, who asked not to be named. \"But there could well be two or even three killers here. There's absolutely nothing to say that the last murder, the Gonzalez girl, wasn't done to throw us off the scent - by some guy who owed Barrios something.\"</p> <p>The same investigator is, perhaps understandably, less forthcoming about the Dali angle. \"Yes,\" he sighs, \"we've looked at it. It's improbable, but this whole thing is so murky you have to look everywhere. At present we have nothing, sweet nothing. And some of those paintings show women with their heads off, their bowels removed, no genitals to be seen. They do . . . well, they do remind you.\"</p> <p>Stare long enough at a particular strain of Dali painting and you can see almost anything you're looking for: so many twisted, butchered bodies; so many grotesque imaginings. The artist himself once said, famously, that the only difference between himself and a madman was that he was not mad.</p> <p>\"I'm not sure what I think,\" says Iaouadan, the Chaibs' lawyer. \"Maybe it's madness, this Dali stuff. But killers are inspired by films, aren't they? Why not by decapitations, eviscerations and dismemberments in the painting of the man who made this town famous?\"</p>",

The watchdog body said that 500,000 customers were last year prevented from switching to a new company or had their transfer severely delayed because of objections from their original supplier.

Despite the fact that Commerzbank remains wedded to an independent strategy and that HypoVereinsbank is rather bigger in Bavaria than anywhere else, they are seen as ideal marriage partners by those infected with merger mania. And because the insurer, Allianz, is set to play a key role in the Deutsche/Dresdner tie-up - it is expected to take a large minority stake in the two banks' merged retail business and then outright control somewhat further down the line - another big German insurer, Munich-Re, finds itself caught up in the speculative fray. There will be more to come. The Deutsche/Dresdner deal will be a big challenge to the German tradition of universal banks. German bankers will now have to draw up strategies to deal with the growth of internet banking, domestic consolidation and pan-European alliance building. Bags of scope for the speculators there. Even more German investors might start to believe the equity game - played to Anglo-Saxon rules - is much more fun than boring old bonds.",

      "body": "<p>Astonishingly, 32 years have passed since the Danish Royal Theatre last premiered an opera that it had commissioned. But it made stunning reparation with Poul Ruders's The Handmaid's Tale. The Margaret Atwood novel on which it is based paints a bleak picture of a future totalitarian state, Gilean - the former USA - ruled by Christian fundamentalists, in which women are valued solely as breeders. </p> <p>The problem for an opera composer is that much of Atwood's story is told as a dream-like inner monologue, full of flashbacks and flash-forwards, with the final outcome left tantalisingly open. But Paul Bentley's libretto is a triumph. Though faithful to the spirit of the novel, it reshapes the order of events so that the opera tells a simpler story. The life of the central character (we know her only by the name given to her after the revolution, Offred) is told in two parallel stories, before and after the Christian regime seizes power. Both Offreds, past and present, are frequently on the stage simultaneously, the latter contemplating earlier horrors - the loss of friends, rights, partner and child - from the vantage point of her present powerlessness. </p> <p>There is nothing tricksy about this in Phyllida Lloyd's superb production; in fact, it leads naturally to the opera's most telling moment, in which the two Offreds sing together, sometimes in unison, sometimes taking alternate words, sometimes in free-flowing counterpoint. </p> <p>Ruders's music at this point is unbearably moving. He has never been the kind of composer to distance himself from his emotions. But there is nothing in his large output which is as tenderly, simply heart-breaking as this marvellous duet. </p> <p>Ruders's music is remarkable at every stage. The scoring - for full, colour-enriched orchestra, with exotic percussion and keyboards with samplers - is fabulously inventive; Ruders is the Richard Strauss of the computer-age orchestra. At first, tonal music, larded with all the cliches of fashionable Holy Minimalism, represents all that is false and stifling about the new regime, while real, forbidden emotions are expressed in pained atonality. There are some gruesome variations on the old hymn Amazing Grace. But later, these distinctions are blurred. </p> <p>The orchestra is pushed to the limit. The writing for the singers, however, is sensitive. There is superb singing and acting here from the versatile Anne Margrethe Dahl. Equally outstanding were Marianne Rorholm as the \"present\" Offred, and Susanne Resmark as the TV gospel singer Serena Joy. In the orchestra pit, conductor Michael Sch\u00f8nwandt worked wonders. Hair-raisingly challenging as this score is, there was nothing tentative about playing or singing in this first hearing. </p> <p>There is talk of bringing The Handmaid's Tale to London; after this performance, I'd say a British staging was just about essential. </p> <p><strong> La La La Human Steps **</strong> Sadler's Wells, London/touring <br> </p> <p>For years Edouard Lock has been having a passionate argument with gravity. The performers in his company La La La Human Steps have made a special skill of vaulting through space. They've moved as if they feared the stage would scorch their feet, or a pause for breath would put their mission in peril. So even though Lock is one of the most muscularly postmodern of choreo- graphers, it's not entirely surprising that his latest work, Salt, turns to the classical pointe shoe in its pursuit of flight. </p> <p>The pointe shoe may have evolved as the footwear of sylphs and princesses, but it also facilitates a vocabulary of predatory, high-speed dancing.

      "bodyText": "Astonishingly, 32 years have passed since the Danish Royal Theatre last premiered an opera that it had commissioned. But it made stunning reparation with Poul Ruders's The Handmaid's Tale. The Margaret Atwood novel on which it is based paints a bleak picture of a future totalitarian state, Gilean - the former USA - ruled by Christian fundamentalists, in which women are valued solely as breeders. The problem for an opera composer is that much of Atwood's story is told as a dream-like inner monologue, full of flashbacks and flash-forwards, with the final outcome left tantalisingly open. But Paul Bentley's libretto is a triumph. Though faithful to the spirit of the novel, it reshapes the order of events so that the opera tells a simpler story. The life of the central character (we know her only by the name given to her after the revolution, Offred) is told in two parallel stories, before and after the Christian regime seizes power. Both Offreds, past and present, are frequently on the stage simultaneously, the latter contemplating earlier horrors - the loss of friends, rights, partner and child - from the vantage point of her present powerlessness. There is nothing tricksy about this in Phyllida Lloyd's superb production; in fact, it leads naturally to the opera's most telling moment, in which the two Offreds sing together, sometimes in unison, sometimes taking alternate words, sometimes in free-flowing counterpoint. Ruders's music at this point is unbearably moving. He has never been the kind of composer to distance himself from his emotions. But there is nothing in his large output which is as tenderly, simply heart-breaking as this marvellous duet. Ruders's music is remarkable at every stage. The scoring - for full, colour-enriched orchestra, with exotic percussion and keyboards with samplers - is fabulously inventive; Ruders is the Richard Strauss of the computer-age orchestra. At first, tonal music, larded with all the cliches of fashionable Holy Minimalism, represents all that is false and stifling about the new regime, while real, forbidden emotions are expressed in pained atonality. There are some gruesome variations on the old hymn Amazing Grace. But later, these distinctions are blurred. The orchestra is pushed to the limit. The writing for the singers, however, is sensitive. There is superb singing and acting here from the versatile Anne Margrethe Dahl. Equally outstanding were Marianne Rorholm as the \"present\" Offred, and Susanne Resmark as the TV gospel singer Serena Joy. In the orchestra pit, conductor Michael Sch\u00f8nwandt worked wonders. Hair-raisingly challenging as this score is, there was nothing tentative about playing or singing in this first hearing. There is talk of bringing The Handmaid's Tale to London; after this performance, I'd say a British staging was just about essential. La La La Human Steps ** Sadler's Wells, London/touring For years Edouard Lock has been having a passionate argument with gravity. The performers in his company La La La Human Steps have made a special skill of vaulting through space. They've moved as if they feared the stage would scorch their feet, or a pause for breath would put their mission in peril. So even though Lock is one of the most muscularly postmodern of choreo- graphers, it's not entirely surprising that his latest work, Salt, turns to the classical pointe shoe in its pursuit of flight. The pointe shoe may have evolved as the footwear of sylphs and princesses, but it also facilitates a vocabulary of predatory, high-speed dancing. When Lock's five women dancers bourr\u00e9e across the stage, their toes stab the floor like needlepoint drills; when they balance high on their pointes, they tip and tilt like suicidal tightrope walkers; when their feet are fully arched, they slice the air like scimitars. Yet Salt is not just about speed and danger. When the women dance with their male partners, the duets are intense, garrulous conversation, hands gesturing and legs flickering with an energy that is both sensuous and mocking. These formal contrasts are enhanced by the design, essentially a play of white spotlights on a darkened stage. The circles of light abruptly expand and contract, so that the dancers move now in bright, open spaces, now in close confinement. David Lang's music for live cello, piano and electric guitar also ranges between introspective riffs and angry howls, and with all nine dancers performing at an extreme pitch the piece has the potential to be one of Lock's finest. At 100 minutes, though, it is way too long. Lock invents a mass of interesting steps, but his unwillingness to venture beyond solos and duets into group composition severely limits his range. It also deprives the work of a compelling structure. The occasional film clips that project human faces from infancy to adulthood are too intermittent to create a coherent logic, and by the end our sensation of Salt is less of pungent intensity than of ideas being scattered to the winds.",

      "body": "<p>I already knew the story of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter when I flew to see him in Toronto. Wrongly jailed for a triple murder in 1966, the boxer became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the early 70s, even inspiring a Bob Dylan song, but it wasn't until 1985 that his conviction was finally overturned. So I was expecting to meet this very angry and bitter man, but I didn't. I met this sweet guy who will tell you to this day that he wouldn't change a thing, that everything that has happened to him has made him a better person, the person that he is today. </p> <p>I was talking to Rubin as preparation for The Hurricane, the movie based on his life story (and that recently won me an Oscar nomination for best actor). After we had talked for a while - after I'd figured out how much he weighed and the fact that I could run faster than him - I said, \"Maybe you got exactly what you deserved,\" and he said, \"I did.\" </p> <p>There's a line in the film: \"Hate put me in prison and love got me out.\" I took that to mean more than the hatred that was sent his way from different forces - police, the judicial system. I told him that I thought it was the hatred in his own heart that put him in the position that he was in, and once I'd opened my eyes and stopped worrying about getting hit, he said, \"You're right.\" </p> <p>Rubin was a mean, angry person in the 60s. He was also living at a time in America when if you spoke about what you believed as a black man, it could cost you your life, as it did Malcolm X and many others. He was very much under the eye of the FBI and other powerful organisations, and he knew that, but for me the journey was a personal journey. It's the story of his spiritual evolution and that's the way I attacked the role. </p> <p>We all have anger in us. We've all had some level of injustice - 20 years in prison, or 20 minutes sitting in your car waiting for a police officer to determine your future. Or even a few moments in an elevator with some woman clutching her purse thinking you're going to rob her - regardless of celebrity. That has happened to me. Nothing like what has happened to Rubin has happened to me, but I can relate. In fact, the reason I'm in America is the result of it, so I understand that racism. I understand that's how America was founded, I understand that that history and hatred are passed down from generation to generation. I understand especially now because I'm a father, so I use those kinds of things to fuel my own fire. </p> <p>I spent a lot of time just talking with Rubin, and he walked me through his past and how those agencies and individuals affected him in his life. So I related to the experiences I had and drew from the experiences he told me about, to try and shape my character in The Hurricane. When we were sitting around and talking before shooting, he said to me, \"If you don't get this right, Denzel, I'm a-gonna come and see yah.\" I said to him, \"If I didn't think this was bigger than you and I, then I'd be worried about that.\" </p> <p>Racism is a factor in the US, if not in the world. It's also obviously a factor in Hollywood. Where I think the most work needs to be done is behind the camera. One of the things we've seen in the 80s with the Spike Lees and the Robert Townsends and other film-makers is that if you really go for it - make the effort to write your own material and insist on making your film - it is difficult whatever colour you are. But I think that's where the future lies. I think that if there is racism, it's to do with the lack of opportunities for writers and producers and the people behind the camera. </p> <p>That said, it's very difficult for women of any colour in Hollywood. The men get older and the women get younger, and I think the bottom of the totem pole is African-American women, or women of colour. They get the fewest opportunities. I've been very blessed. I've made 26 films in 20 years. But I'm an exception to the rule and we've got a long way to go. The NAACP have been putting a lot of pressure on the studios to hire more people of colour, and I think that's good, 'cause I know the minute they stop doing that there'll be fewer and fewer in those positions. </p> <p>One good thing about acting is that it's good therapy. I express a lot of my emotions and anger in the work itself. As Malcolm X used to say, it's one thing to be angry, and another thing to know. Just to be angry and out of control won't do you any good. If you have an enemy, then learn and know your enemy - don't just be mad at him or her. My career for a long time has been about doing something about the anger that I felt through the roles that I play - like Malcolm X and The Hurricane. I'm not afraid to upset people. </p> <p>What would upset me is if I didn't use the abilities I'd been given. Yes, I'm just making movies, but I receive thousands of letters a year and I see the impact they have on people.</p>",

Peter Baxter, pro ducer of Test Match Special, was also present along with representatives of Radio 5 Live. </p> <p>It was an impressive line-up, a wheeling out of big guns designed to convince the ECB of a real wish to hold on to the rights. The BBC might not have the money but it could cash in on years of cricket expertise. </p> <p>Using a combination of vintage commentary, slide shows highlighting letters from Test Match Special listeners, and video footage from last year's Cricket World Cup, the BBC went out of its way to demonstrate the role cricket has played in the corporation. </p> <p>Perhaps in the past it has been blase about the institution that is Test Match Special and its importance, but under the guidance of the sports-loving Dyke things were about to change: that was the BBC message. It was also pointed out that Test Match Special had been nominated for a Sony radio award for its coverage of last year's World Cup. </p> <p>The director general's enthusiasm won over the ECB, which was impressed with the commitment to spread cricket across national and local radio stations. What won the day, however, was not the BBC's money offer, a fraction of Talksport's, but the innovative idea of spreading the popularity of cricket to younger listeners. One of the ECB's stated aims is to increase cricket's appeal to a younger, wider audience; the BBC's presentation involved outlining how Radio 1, with a large number of listeners under 25, could be used to cover cricket. </p> <p>There would be regular reports of Test matches on Newsbeat, the station's main news programme; and other programmes aimed at the young would highlight cricket and its personalities. The BBC would also market cricket and sponsor a young cricketer of the year award. </p> <p>The only problem that remained was money. The BBC refuses to reveal how much it paid for the five-year rights, claiming it is commercially sensitive information. However, it is known that four years ago, when the current radio deal began, the corporation paid about \u00a3200,000 for the rights. This time it is reckoned to be 10 times as much. </p> <p>The ECB came away delighted with what it had seen. Originally it was not supposed to announce its decision for another two weeks but, given that cricket in general is at a crossroads, it saw virtue in taking a positive route swiftly.</p>",

The director general's enthusiasm won over the ECB, which was impressed with the commitment to spread cricket across national and local radio stations. What won the day, however, was not the BBC's money offer, a fraction of Talksport's, but the innovative idea of spreading the popularity of cricket to younger listeners. One of the ECB's stated aims is to increase cricket's appeal to a younger, wider audience; the BBC's presentation involved outlining how Radio 1, with a large number of listeners under 25, could be used to cover cricket. There would be regular reports of Test matches on Newsbeat, the station's main news programme; and other programmes aimed at the young would highlight cricket and its personalities. The BBC would also market cricket and sponsor a young cricketer of the year award. The only problem that remained was money. The BBC refuses to reveal how much it paid for the five-year rights, claiming it is commercially sensitive information. However, it is known that four years ago, when the current radio deal began, the corporation paid about \u00a3200,000 for the rights. This time it is reckoned to be 10 times as much. The ECB came away delighted with what it had seen. Originally it was not supposed to announce its decision for another two weeks but, given that cricket in general is at a crossroads, it saw virtue in taking a positive route swiftly.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England left interest rates on hold today but the sense of relief felt by businesses and homeowners is likely to be temporary. The \"no change\" decision was widely expected after the bank's forecast last month that inflation was on target over the next two years. However, with consumer spending continuing to grow strongly and the labour market tightening, borrowing costs are unlikely to have peaked at 6%. After raising rates four times in the past six months, the Bank's monetary policy committee has paused for breath for fear of further increasing the value of sterling. The strong pound is making it hard for manufacturing to compete in international markets and exposing them to extra competition from cheaper imports, resulting in widespread job losses and a widening trade deficit. But unless the booming service sector shows decisive signs of slowing down, the Bank is likely to raise rates again soon to prevent the economy overheating irrespective of the state of manufacturing. How much further rates will rise is the key question. Some City analysts predict that they will go above 7%; others forecast just one more quarter point increase. The eventually peak of borrowing costs will be determined by the economic data over the coming months. In particular, the Bank has indicated that it is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the labour market. Figures released last month showed average earnings growth accelerating to 5.5% a year in January, a worrying sign if the figures are reliable. It suggests falling unemployment is allowing workers to bargain for higher wages not justified by productivity gains, forcing firms to raise prices to protect their profit margins. Some members of the bank's monetary policy committee think the figures have been artifically boosted by one-off millennium bonuses. They are therefore prepared to wait for a few months to see if earnings growth slows. If earnings are still accelerating in a few months time, however, they may well change their minds.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>The problems</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I am currently doing my third-year apprenticeship at a garage where I am doing car body repair, and I feel that I should be getting paid more as I basically work alone. </p> <p>The thing is, I'm getting paid \u00a32.50 and hour and I just cannot afford to work there any more as I have so many money problems. </p> <p>Can I ask for a minimum wage as I am 18? </p> <p> \u0095 I work for my family's company (a landfill site) as an administration clerk.</p> <p>When I started 18 months ago my duties solely consisted of working with the purchase ledger, inserting weighbridge tickets onto a spreadsheet and answering the phone. </p> <p>18 months later I'm designing spreads and overheads for company growth as well as designing spreadsheets and completing them to send to the environment agency. </p> <p> I literally run the office myself every afternoon, as well as doing all the little jobs that nobody likes doing. </p> <p>Since I've been here, more labourers have been taken on, trained in absolutely nothing, and are being paid more than me. Please give me some sound advice.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>Both these questions are related so I'll answer them together:</p> <p>First of all, everyone has the right to be paid the minimum wage, which, from the age of 18, is \u00a33 an hour (\u00a33.60 when you are over 21. Also, the first twelve months of an accredited training apprenticeship should net you \u00a33.20 when you are over 21).</p> <p>You can and should ask for it, and cannot be sacked for doing so since you are asserting a statutory employment right. Put your request in writing, politely pointing out that they must pay you the legal minimum wage.</p> <p>The second issue here is asking for a pay rise. There are sound and unsound reasons for wanting a rise, and I'm afraid that comparisons with your colleagues do not generally cut much ice with employers. </p> <p>However, it does seem that you have sound reasons too - going beyond your job description, taking on more responsibility or saving/making your company money are all good reasons to negotiate a pay rise (doing the 'little jobs that nobody likes doing' is not).</p> <p>Follow this three-point plan in order to maximise your chances of getting that well-deserved rise:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Arrange a meeting with your boss or line manager.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Prepare your case. Get a copy of your job description and craft a new one, pointing out new responsibilities or changes from the original. Or, provide data showing money you have saved or made the company. List any special achievements or examples of where you have represented the company well. Calculate a reasonable salary that you feel you ought to be on, based on your current market value (have a scout around and see what other companies pay for someone doing your work).</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Go through your report with your boss at the meeting. Avoid being aggressive or demanding and never threaten to leave (unless you intend to). State your case reasonably, emphasise how much you enjoy your job but be firm about the fact that you deserve to be paid more.</p> <p>If the answer is still 'no', find out why and what would be needed to get that rise. If it is, for example, more training or experience that is needed, send your boss a letter confirming any agreement that you are likely to get your rise on completion of x, y or z. If, on the other hand, your boss indicates that a rise is never likely to be forthcoming, that is the time to start thinking about finding a firm prepared to pay you what you are worth.</p> <p><strong>Dr Sandi Mann is author of <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501952039,00.html\">Psychology Goes To Work</a><br> (Purple House, \u00a39.99) and <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501007347,00.html\">Hiding What We Feel, Faking What We Don't</a> (Element, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p>",

      "bodyText": "The problems \u0095 I am currently doing my third-year apprenticeship at a garage where I am doing car body repair, and I feel that I should be getting paid more as I basically work alone. The thing is, I'm getting paid \u00a32.50 and hour and I just cannot afford to work there any more as I have so many money problems. Can I ask for a minimum wage as I am 18? \u0095 I work for my family's company (a landfill site) as an administration clerk. When I started 18 months ago my duties solely consisted of working with the purchase ledger, inserting weighbridge tickets onto a spreadsheet and answering the phone. 18 months later I'm designing spreads and overheads for company growth as well as designing spreadsheets and completing them to send to the environment agency. I literally run the office myself every afternoon, as well as doing all the little jobs that nobody likes doing. Since I've been here, more labourers have been taken on, trained in absolutely nothing, and are being paid more than me. Please give me some sound advice. The solution Both these questions are related so I'll answer them together: First of all, everyone has the right to be paid the minimum wage, which, from the age of 18, is \u00a33 an hour (\u00a33.60 when you are over 21. Also, the first twelve months of an accredited training apprenticeship should net you \u00a33.20 when you are over 21). You can and should ask for it, and cannot be sacked for doing so since you are asserting a statutory employment right. Put your request in writing, politely pointing out that they must pay you the legal minimum wage. The second issue here is asking for a pay rise. There are sound and unsound reasons for wanting a rise, and I'm afraid that comparisons with your colleagues do not generally cut much ice with employers. However, it does seem that you have sound reasons too - going beyond your job description, taking on more responsibility or saving/making your company money are all good reasons to negotiate a pay rise (doing the 'little jobs that nobody likes doing' is not). Follow this three-point plan in order to maximise your chances of getting that well-deserved rise: 1. Arrange a meeting with your boss or line manager. 2. Prepare your case. Get a copy of your job description and craft a new one, pointing out new responsibilities or changes from the original. Or, provide data showing money you have saved or made the company. List any special achievements or examples of where you have represented the company well. Calculate a reasonable salary that you feel you ought to be on, based on your current market value (have a scout around and see what other companies pay for someone doing your work). 3. Go through your report with your boss at the meeting. Avoid being aggressive or demanding and never threaten to leave (unless you intend to). State your case reasonably, emphasise how much you enjoy your job but be firm about the fact that you deserve to be paid more. If the answer is still 'no', find out why and what would be needed to get that rise. If it is, for example, more training or experience that is needed, send your boss a letter confirming any agreement that you are likely to get your rise on completion of x, y or z. If, on the other hand, your boss indicates that a rise is never likely to be forthcoming, that is the time to start thinking about finding a firm prepared to pay you what you are worth.
