General secretary Eddie Punch said the Fischler reforms “represent the policy of the future and that the challenge facing Ireland is to embrace the change and seek to proactively influence the detail in the best interests of Irish farmers”.
Macra na Feirme, the voice of young Irish farmers condemned the CAP plan as a landlord’s charter.
Speaking from Brussels where Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, announced the much-leaked document yesterday afternoon, Macra’s national president Seamus Phelan said the proposals to decouple direct payments from production would make it very difficult for new people to get into agriculture in the years ahead.
New entrants will not have the single payment entitlements that will in future attach to the land instead of production and will be forced to pay high prices to farmers who want to get out of agriculture.
The real winners from the new system would ultimately be non-farming landowners, he said.
With only 11% of farmers under 35 and 45% over 55 introducing further barriers to entry would be disastrous for the long-term sustainability of farming, he concluded.
ICMSA president Pat O’Rourke warned “the cuts in direct payments of up to 20% will further and substantially reduce incomes of the cattle and beef sector”.
“In particular, the proposal to introduce stringent restrictions on exports in the beef sector is a major concern and one that Ireland will have to completely oppose,” said Mr O’Rourke. “And the introduction of farm audits will replace one lot of red tape with another,” he said.
He added: “The fact that the commission has made no proposals to change the milk sector does not remove the need for the commission to introduce increased levels of support in the milk sector in the aftermath of the US Farm Bill.”
Tom Parlon, Minister of State for Agriculture dismissed the proposals saying the CAP review was a “major departure from the Agenda 2000 policy which was negotiated only a couple of years ago. It is essential Irish farmers do not lose out as a result of this review”, he said.
Meanwhile the country’s biggest farm body, the IFA, lashed out at the moves by the EU to rewrite Agenda 2000.
President John Dillon said: “The deep cuts proposed are a breach of faith with farmers by the European Commission. He dismissed claims by the commissioner that the reforms would be good for Irish farmers.
Initial assessment of the strategy suggests a loss of 300m annually of EU transfers to Ireland and to Irish farmers which cannot be regarded as positive in an true meaning of the word, said Mr Dillon.
Green MEP Patricia McKenna welcomed the general direction taken by the European Commission in the CAP mid-term review published today.
She called on farmers, to welcome the changes outlined as an absolute
necessity to put a halt to the severe environmental impacts of intensive farming and address consumer concerns
regarding food safety and animal welfare.
“The commission’s position paper is a timely and welcome step in the right direction and it should be followed up as soon as possible with concrete proposals,” she said.
Ms McKenna also called on the EU to ban subsidies on live exports."

And it's expected emergence of world markets from prolonged downturn would lift all boats, including those of agri-exporters.
In general, the Brussels report on Prospects for Agricultural Markets: 2002-2009, is broadly positive for most agricultural products.
In particular, a continued increase in consumption and a ""sustained recovery in EU cereal exports"" are projected.
In beef, the industry could not be blamed for expecting greater benefits from measures like the ""Purchase for Destruction"" scheme and the ""Special Purchase"" scheme, which together withdrew and destroyed the meat of around 1.1 million animals.
In addition, culling linked to the Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Ireland took out about 850,000 cattle, mostly in the UK.
As a result, and with an unexpectedly smaller backlog of animals, beef production for the year 2001 dropped to 7.26 million tonnes, down 1.8% from the already relatively low production level of 2000.
However, the dramatic drop in beef consumption by about 12%, compared to 1999 put strong pressure on beef prices, which dropped below intervention level and even below the safety net (for a short period and only in Germany and the Netherlands).
Intervention stocks grew rapidly, and reached around 259,000 tonnes.
Signs of recovery appeared since March 2001, with beef prices continuing to improve, reaching about 90% of intervention level by the end of the year (except for cow meat, where prices remained low throughout 2001).
Net beef production in the EU is estimated to increase in the year 2002 and 2003, as it returns to more normal conditions, with improved prices and no destruction schemes in place except for the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) in the UK, which is assumed to be maintained until Spring, 2004.
There is some impact from the special measures decided in June 2001, notably a stocking density reduction and temporary changes in the suckler cow premium for 2002 and 2003.
But EU beef and veal production is estimated to increase up to 7.7 million tons in 2004 and then decrease slightly in the following years, as the beef production cycle reaches its low point by the year 2005/06, at around 7.6 million tons.
Producers are then expected to respond to market improvements, lifting production slightly to reach 7.75 million tons by 2009.
Overall, the lower production in 2001; the assumed prolongation of the OTMS scheme in UK; the quick recovery in beef consumption; and the impact of the special measures taken in 2000 and 2001, indicate that the balance of the EU beef market is likely not to worsen in the next few years.
Intervention stocks could be cleared in 2003, and no buying in is expected by Brussels over the forecast period up to 2009. Export outlets are expected to be sufficient to cope with cyclical ups and downs in production.
The one major new feature in the farming decade ahead to be taken into account by the European Commission is the US Farm Bill.
The main conclusion in Brussels is that the Bill's increased level of US support will generate higher agricultural production in the US, and this should put further downward pressure on market prices.
The greatest impact would be felt in the cereal sector where the Farm Bill is expected to increase the competitiveness of US products, as well as boosting their grain production levels.
Oilseed production may decrease somewhat, releasing some pressure from market prices.
For the EU, the largest kickback from increased farmer subsidisation in the US is expected in the wheat sector, and in coarse grains and meat production to a lesser extent.
So there could be a US sourced impact on Irish cattle farmers.
At least, Irish farmers can count their blessings that they are not growing rice or rye. Preferential trade agreements, notably the ""Everything But Arms"" (EBA) Agreement with the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) is projected to have a ""dramatic"" effect on the EU rice market.
And the rye market is foreseen ""to display a continuous and structural imbalance"", largely due to its relatively high market prices and lack of market outlets."

Question 2: Do you want milk quotas scrapped?
These are the questions that matter to farmers, and if they were on the ballot there would be a record turnout in rural areas. Instead, we have limited influence over such matters.
They must be negotiated jointly by the agriculture ministers of the 15 member states in the upcoming CAP mid-term review, or by heads of state if the ministers fail to agree.
Maybe that is why Ireland voted No to Nice last June; just for the opportunity of flexing our muscles in a 15-member club where compromise has to be the order of the day, and you can never get what you really want.
Although we have individual voting power to halt progress towards enlargement of the huge and powerful EU trading union, by voting No to Nice, we have little say in really important developments for our farming and agri-food industries, such as these review proposals which now could turn farming and food industries upside down.
But do we even know what outcome we really want?
That is one of the questions arising in the reaction to these radical proposals sprung on the EU's agriculture industry by the European Commission,
under the guise of a CAP mid-term review.
These proposals may be of little interest beyond farmers, agri-food industry leaders and politicians, but their implications are more significant than the foot and mouth epidemic which galvanised the nation last year.
At their centre is the far-reaching idea of cutting the links between farm subsidies and farm production. That would leave EU farmers still getting plenty of cash subsidies, but the money would no longer be tied to how much they produce.
For the first time in many decades, they could be guided by the demands of the market in deciding what to grow or produce. A farmer would get his average of EU direct payments received over a specified three year period for example, 1997 to 1999. The new lump sum subsidy per farm would be linked to environmental and animal welfare standards. It is proposed that any premiums received in excess of €5,000 would be cut back by one-fifth, over several years, with the savings redirected towards rural development.
The end product, it is hoped, is an agriculture policy more oriented towards consumers, and less towards very big farmers.
The EU's larger farms would get no more than 300,000 each.
The proposals are radical for drystock farmers; fewer changes are suggested for tillage or dairy farmers, although the proposals have been interpreted as very unfavourable for Irish grain growers. Across the board, they have different implications for groups of farmers, for agri-business and for food processors.
Many drystock farmers will welcome these proposals, but Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh is unlikely to go to Brussels with a mandate to accept area-based payments to farmers. Not only will the main farming organisations here instruct him to maintain the status quo, he will also be keen to save the food industry from as big a threat as it faced from foot and mouth.
Our huge beef industry would suffer a huge supply slump, if farmers were allowed take life a little easier, giving up the chase after the cattle and sheep which each bring in a few euro of extra premium, in the current CAP system, and which guarantee strong supply levels for processors.
The mountain of paperwork, which many farmers dread, would shrink if they no longer had to account to Brussels for each animal they claim a premium on. If beef prices slump, they simply cut back numbers, instead of losing money on their huge, premium-earning herds, as they are this year.
Minister Walsh is expected to oppose that scenario, principally because jobs in Ireland's food industry could be at stake. However, that consideration must be weighed against the proposals' benefits the most striking of which may be the decisive move away from 80% of subsidies going to the largest 20% of the EU's farms.
Unfortunately, 14 other member states, few of which share Ireland's concerns, will decide if these proposals are passed or shot down.
Our fate lies in their hands.
The powerful French influence in Brussels may be against the proposals because their relatively intensive agriculture stands to lose out; for them, 9.4bn of the total EU farm budget of 43.6 bn is at stake.
The Spaniards, Italians and Greeks may offer their support to the proposals because their Mediterranean products, such as wine and olive oil, are exempt from the proposed abolition of production subsidies.
The proposals are obviously designed to win over Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, which grumble that they foot the CAP bill. They will welcome the move towards market-based reform that will benefit consumers and the environment, and eventually lessen their nett payments to Brussels.
Lurking in the background is the imminent enlargement of the EU to include poorer and more rural countries in Central Europe.
If the 40 billion per year CAP spend is not cut back before the new farmer-heavy applicants join the EU, they will form an unbreakable anti-reform bloc once they are inside the Union.
Some fear the CAP budget will explode, if the EU expands from 15 member states to 25 in 2004.
That's just one of the pressures on the negotiators of this week's radical new CAP proposals. With vastly different consequences for dairy farmers and grain growers, broadly welcomed by consumers but feared by food processors, and member states split down the middle, these proposals could prove just as unpredictable as the foot and mouth virus, and at least as important for Ireland."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10067356.html,2002-07-12 02:00:00,"CAP reform will force beef plant closures, says expert","In the past five years the number of processors has increased from 37 to 45 in this country, despite efforts by Enterprise Ireland and the industry to streamline the sector in the interest of profitability.
However, the Fischler plan is likely to shake up the industry, Brian Britton, managing director of Britton Consultants, warned yesterday.
Mr Britton is best known as financial director of the Goodman Group but he has been an independent consultant to the sector since 1991.
With the switch from direct payments to the farm-based system, Britton forecasts that the long-awaited reform will kick in rapidly if the new system is introduced in 2004.
“People move when they start to hurt,” he said.
He warned also that the changes foreshadowed by the Fischler reform plan point to a whole new era of agriculture in the EU.
Others suggest beef production is set to fall by as much as 30%, as the farm-based plan will make it unprofitable and unnecessary to produce in order to ensure the cheque in the post from Brussels.
Mr Britton said the plan suggests the first steps towards a level playing field for agriculture and we should plan now for that day, which will come about far sooner than many in the sector realize.
In his view, agriculture should be no different to any other sector of the economy, all of which have to compete head to head in whatever market they find themselves operating.
He said it was inevitable that the EU would ultimately move towards a market-driven system of agriculture and the CAP initiatives are the first step in that direction.
To survive, he said, “We will have to add value to what we produce if farmers are to continue to have a livelihood on the land.”
The full implications of the CAP reform will not become clear until the Commission files the legal documents required to implement the radical proposals in the autumn.
But it is already becoming clear that the value of some farms will be seriously undermined by the shift from the production-based priced support system. Farm values will be determined by how the payments system is decided on by the Commission.
And when farmers come to sell on their land, its value will be enhanced or undermined depending on how much income the farm has been allocated under the new CAP regime."

Falling beef prices for four weeks in succession, which has knocked 40-50/head off finished cattle has been enough to cause concern by producers on the possibility of worse to come, and their message at last night's IFA-convened meeting in Co Laois was enough is enough as they demanded a base of 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) for the Autumn.
That is 11 cents/kg (4p/lb) more than the quoted rates for R grade cattle this week.
Supplies to the factories have been very strong over the past fortnight.
Week ending July 6 the kill was up 3,000 head on the corresponding week in 2001 at 28,234 head compared to 25,307 head last year. Last week's kill at 30,000 head was approximately 20% higher than the same week last year.
Any fall off in the supply this week could have more to do with farmers being more occupied with silage and hay making and the improvement in the weather reducing pressure to lighten stocking on farms, than influenced by any deliberate decision to hold back on cattle.
Trying to balance the trade for the Autumn is like juggling a poor hand in poker. There is going to be bluff called on both sides between producers and processors.
However, the outcome of the meeting at Abbeyleix, which had just got under way as we went to press last night, is important for straight talking between producers and processors on the prospects for the Autumn."

""For organic milk producers to have comparable incomes to those in conventional dairying, they would need a price premium of 36%,"" said Liam Connolly, at the Teagasc's organic farming open day at Johnstown Castle, in Wexford.
Mr Connolly warned against the Danish syndrome. An increase in their organic milk production in the past decade led to over-production.
As a result, organic milk producers received no price premium for their milk, and many have reverted to conventional production.
Beef is the most profitable organic system in Ireland. A Teagasc survey showed organic beef incomes in 2000 were almost 60% higher than conventional incomes. This was attributed to significantly lower costs, a 20% price premium, and a REPS top-up payment of 91 per hectare.
The survey showed little difference between organic and conventional producers of lamb.
""Irish, organic wheat and barley growers are making incomes between 20% and 80% higher than their conventional counterparts. Incomes from organic potato production are around 50% higher"", said Mr Connolly.
""As a high proportion of organic vegetables are sold locally, outlets can be easily over-supplied, leading to a rapid decline in price premia,"" he said.
Dr Noel Culleton, leader of the Teagasc organic research programme, said only farmers who operate to the highest production standards will survive in organic farming.
""In livestock farming, getting maximum production from clover, and high skills in dealing with animal health and welfare, are crucial. Organic farming is not an easy option,"" he said.
""Farmers who run good, commercial, conventional operations are the ideal candidates for successful organic farming,"" Dr Culleton said.
""Poor conventional farmers will make poor organic farmers,"" he said.
A recent Government report projected a trebling of organic food sales by 2006.
Liam Connolly said it was difficult to see more than 5% of the land area of Ireland being devoted to organic production for the foreseeable future."

Outlining her arguments in her newly published, ‘The First Department: A history of the Department of Agriculture’, Daly shows how the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) increased the value of Irish agricultural exports.
And by relieving the exchequer of most of the burden of agricultural expenditure, the CAP made it possible to introduce major improvements in health, education and social welfare in Ireland.
Among the statistics Daly uses to illustrate her case is the £20m saving by the Department of Agriculture in Ireland’s first full year in the EEC.
By 1978, the EU was picking up 70% of the bill for public spending on agriculture, freeing up exchequer spending for development of our industrial, social welfare and education policies.
No-one can say just how valuable EU membership was during the unstable economic conditions of the mid-70s, which precipitated 20 years of high unemployment, inflation, currency volatility and low economic growth in western Europe.
But it came to the rescue of farmers in a big way after cattle prices fell by one quarter from 1973 to 1974, and more than two million tonnes of Irish beef had to bought into intervention over the next 19 years."

Producers met in Co Laois last night to discuss the situation and decide what course they should pursue to restore prices, which moved closer to free-fall this week even before any build-up of autumn supplies to the factories.
While last week's prices were still being paid at some of the factories yesterday, the majority educed their quotes when they re-opened after the holiday weekend.
Supplies of cattle appeared to have tightened and some producers held back on supplies in resistance to the latest cut in price, but others accepted their fate yesterday, fearful that there may be worse to come Galtee Meats maintained their prices at last week's rates yesterday, paying 241-232 cent/kg (86p-83p/lb) for R/O grade bullocks and heifers. Kepak at Watergrasshill have reduced their
kill for the week to two days and cut their prices to 235-224 cent/kg (84p-80p/lb) for R/O grades.
Dawn Meats at Midleton were not quoting for cattle having sufficient booked in by noon yesterday to supply their requirements for the week.
Fair Oak, Clonmel, quoted 232-227 cent/kg (83p-81p/lb) for R/O grade bullocks and heifers.
There is a little more being secured by suppliers to factories in the midlands and northern areas, but the higher prices are mainly for the top quality cattle at some of the best paying plants.
The one stable sector this week is cow prices. In general 168 cent/kg (58p/lb) is available for cows with an extra 6 cent/kg (2p/lb) for carcasses over 700 lb available at some factories."

Devon farmer and livestock farmers' spokesman Richard Haddock has been explaining how a wave of cut-price imported beef is causing major financial problems for British abattoirs.
He said the problem lies with beef trim the off-cuts of steaks and other primal joints, which are removed at meat processors.
With demand for beef falling across the continent as a result of growing fears about BSE, huge quantities of boxed trim are arriving on British shores, much of it from Ireland, according to Mr Haddock.
He said because of the strength of sterling against the euro, trim is available for 31c a kg less than half the cost at which British abattoirs can supply it.
Used for mince and a huge range of pies and other highly-processed products which are big sellers in the UK, trim represents a crucial element of the meat trade.
It accounts for 60% of UK volume sales and is where the meat industry's profits are made.
According to Mr Haddock: ""It's not the primal cuts that make the money, it's the trim. And the imports have now reached such a huge tonnage that a lot of British abattoirs are seriously struggling.
""The next logical step is they will have to close and we shall simply export another sector of our industry abroad. But the Government still peddles its cheap food policy as though nothing was happening,"" he said.
He warns that only a massive consumer campaign will save the day for UK beef processors.
""The problem is that when you buy a ready-meal or go to a pub or a restaurant and eat lasagne or spaghetti there is no way of telling where the meat ingredients have come from and no way that the supplier can be forced to declare it.""
The United Kingdom has become the main market for Irish beef exports, taking 210,000 tonnes last year. By the end of the year, Bord Bia reported that seven multiples were selling identifiable Irish beef."

IFA's analysis is that the CAP review proposals would reduce the volume of output in the sectors affected by over 20%, equivalent to 355m annually, and the income loss in the total agri-food sector would be close to 300m annually.
Mr Dillon said lower agricultural production means a reduced demand for farm inputs and services, and less raw material for the food processing industry.
""At a time when rural Ireland is already under pressure, if 300m of spending power is taken out of the rural economy, it will have a major impact on jobs and on the viability of our rural towns and villages. We estimate that it would mean 19,000 lost jobs in rural Ireland,"" he said.
Mr Dillon said the Fischler proposals are a particular attack on farmers who are trying to produce beef, lamb and grain on a committed and commercial basis.
""These farmers were just coming to grips with the requirements of the Agenda 2000 changes, but the Commission is now proposing the most radical of reforms to the CAP in its decoupling plan. It must not be forgotten that committed farmers are the mainstay of a modern Irish food industry and the main customer of the farm inputs and services sectors,"" he said.
The IFA leader said decoupling is an insidious plan because it may appear to some people to be positive but its purpose is to cut farm output. This might be acceptable in other member states but in Ireland agriculture is still important to the rural economy.
""The Fischler proposals are not the end of the CAP reform agenda. The likely longer-term agenda of the Commission, in decoupling support from production, is to prepare the road for further winding down of direct payments over time.""
Mr Dillon said the Agenda 2000 CAP Reform was agreed to run to the end of 2006. Such a fundamental new reform as now proposed by Commissioner Fischler is not justified by the current market and budget situation in the EU.
""The Irish Government must reject the proposals on two grounds. They are not necessary, and they are bad for the Irish economy,"" he said.
IFA chief economist Con Lucey said it estimates that the annual income loss at farm level would be about 150m due to a combination of output loss on suckler and sheep farms, the 20% cut in direct payments, and the cereals price cut.
""The likely impact of decoupling would be a 35% cut in the national suckler cow herd, a 32% cut in the national ewe flock and a 35% reduction in cereals production. The loss in terms of national agricultural output is estimated at 355m annually,"" he said.
Mr Lucey said that while the Commission argues that the budget savings from the direct payment cuts would be used to fund ""rural development"" measures, the IFA view is that at least one half of the loss would not be restored for three main reasons.
These are: a ""prosperity clause"" contained in the Fischler proposals, which could militate against Ireland; the existing high uptake of the CAP rural development measures in this country; and, the extra cost to farmers in the case of some proposed new measures such as animal welfare and the farm audits."

Despite heavy showers, this marvellous feast of rural pursuits proved to be yet another huge success. The statistics behind Tullamore Agricultural Show, incorporating the Powers Gold Label National Livestock Show, gave a flavour of what was involved. It cost over €350,000 to organise and had a total prize fund of €120,000 for 850 classes.
Overall entries of 7,500 including 1,300 cattle and 1,100 horses were up 6.8%. There were 300 trade stands. And there was a tented village covering four acres. A total of 650 stewards, helpers and executives were involved in running the country’s premier show, organised by an executive committee of thirty-five people.
It is headed by John Cleary, chairman, Michael Fox, vice chairman and Freda Kinnarney, secretary, with John O’Hanlon as site operations manager.
Matt Dempsey, editor of the Irish Farmers Journal, who officially opened the event, where 40 national titles were decided, said Tullamore Show continues to gain in size and status.
“We need a good summer livestock show and Tullamore meets that need, with a combination of a wonderful venue in a central location, together with first class organisation and a hugely hard working voluntary corps.”
IFA president John Dillon called on Farm Minister Joe Walsh to address the worsening situation on farm incomes with beef, milk and grain prices all falling in an extremely difficult year for farmers. He said he had requested an urgent meeting with the minister to address the key issues affecting farm incomes and falling prices across the main commodities.
ICSA president Charlie Reilly said the various livestock exhibitors at the show demonstrated a dedication and work ethic in the pursuit of excellence that would prosper under any reformed CAP.
He said he was disappointed to hear farm leaders and Mr Walsh imply that farmers were looking for an opportunity to sit around doing nothing.
ICMSA president Pat O’Rourke said the wage bill in the food processing sector will have to be capped if Ireland is not to lose competitiveness on international markets.
Any new national agreement must address the escalating costs in all areas including food processing. Costs generally, but wages and insurance in particular, must be controlled and reduced where possible, he said."

Some producers are arguing that this is another ploy by factories to break farmers’ confidence and make them accept lower prices.
It did not appear to be a big problem at most factories yesterday, where procurement managers reported getting more cattle than they wanted.
Word around the industry was that supply needs for the week were light.
There was an improvement in prices of up to 6c/kg for the heavy cows.
As for bullocks and heifers, nearly all factories are now on a base line of 235c/kg for R-grade and some quoted producers 232c/kg yesterday.
There was 227c/kg on offer for O-grade, while most factories have reduced prices to 224c/kg opening up a difference of 11c/kg, or double the previous norm between R and O-grade.
There is up to 168c/kg for the good cows this week, with prices ranging back to 156c/kg and demand is good.
In the marts, there were signs of an easing back in store prices yesterday.
Demand was good at Doyle of Blessington, but prices for the heavy bullocks were back 3-4/head.
There was an increase in bullock numbers at Bandon Mart, where prices were marginally easier also.
Dungarvan Mart had good trade, with bullocks up by 10-15/head and single punched bullocks making up to 420/kg.
The trade for heifers was steady at Dungarvan and improved for the quality continental stock at Bandon, where the entry was also up on last week."

Fine Gael agriculture spokesman Deputy Billy Timmins, who called on Mr Walsh to bring a targeted plan to Government to assist the agriculture industry “which is facing into its worse crisis in years”, said there is an unprecedented despondency among farming communities following the severe weather and the uncertainty over the Common Agriculture Policy.
Labour Party agriculture spokesperson Deputy Jack Wall said the plummeting crop and milk yields were having repercussions far beyond the farming sector. The average weight of beef animals is down by 25%, milk output is down by 15% and fruit and vegetables yields are down by up to 70%. Consumers might soon experience price increases on these products as demand exceeds supply.
Mr Walsh said last week-end he had asked Teagasc to work closely with the farming community and to help it in every possible way. Changes had been made to help farmers in difficulty because of the weather and the EU Commission had approved a derogation for the use of set-aside land, which would benefit the worst affected.
Minister Walsh also announced yesterday that two senior officials from his Department, Tom Moran, Assistant Secretary General, and Paddy Rogan, Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, are in Egypt this week to discuss the beef export trade with the Cairo authorities. A huge effort had been put into opening this market and he was pleased the Egyptian authorities had agreed to do so, following detailed assessment of Ireland's food safety controls.
Teagasc, in an updated assessment ten days ago on the impact of the weather on farming, carried out countrywide during the week to August 2, stated that, while progress had been made in recent weeks in hay and silage making, there was still wide variation between the drier and wet land areas in winter feed supply, grass growth, animal performance and damage to soil.
While all first-cut silage had been made in dry land areas, the figure for the wetter farming areas varied from 40% to 80%.
IFA president John Dillon said that, given the extremely difficult income situation facing farmers, he had called for an urgent meeting with Mr Walsh, urging him to take immediate action to restore beef and milk prices and bring forward direct payments to livestock and grain farmers.
Mr Dillon said vegetable and fruit growers are in an extremely serious financial situation with more than 50% crop loss in some cases. On cattle prices, he said Mr Walsh must tackle the factories in their relentless drive to cut prices, deliver an increase in export refunds to offset devaluation of the dollar, boost exports to the Russian market and reopen beef exports to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Gulf States, Indonesia, South Africa and the Philippines.
ICMSA president Pat O'Rourke said an assessment of the weather crisis by dairy and livestock co-ops in the northern part of the country is that it is unprecedented in its severity.
He said he would be seeking Government action and support for an animal fodder scheme. There was also a need for the banks to restructure loans and provide longer term finance to allow farmers to farm their way out of difficulties."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10061078.html,2002-08-22 01:00:00,Steady week isn’t conclusive evidence,"It would be a brave prediction to deduce from the steadier tone to the trade this week, that the next price movement will be upwards.
But at least the easing of the downward slide is welcome.
There were some slight changes in prices at the factories on Monday, mainly confined to the R grade category, but they were minor, some offering slightly improved prices for R grade and others slightly easier.
There was no change in the prices for O grade steers and heifers.
The general run of prices for R grade steers and heifers under 30 months is 235 cents/kg (84p/lb) with a minority of factories having dropped 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) below that. Most factories are paying 224 cents/kg (80p/lb) for O grade.
Demand for cattle is not very strong at the factories, and they are getting plenty to meet their requirements without any difficulty, so there is not much pressure on them to increase prices.
In this, the peak holiday month of the year, there is normally weak demand for beef. Some retail promotions for beef in Britain over the past week resulted in a slightly firmer demand, but overall, the trade is relatively quiet. The result of the UK promotions was mainly an increase in demand for round cuts. The wholesale market is experiencing its usual quiet pattern for the holiday period.
Across the continental markets, in France, Holland and Germany, there has been very little change over the past week. The limited quantities of Irish beef going into Holland are reported to be doing reasonably well. In Germany, supplies of finished cattle have tightened and demand is best for the prime cuts.
The kill here last week was slightly increased, but it is still 5,000 head lower than the corresponding week in 2001 In the marts, the trade for store animals eased through the second half of last week. That trend continued into the opening sales this week, although there were some exceptions on Monday, with smaller numbers on offer at Bandon Mart and an improved trade for the forward bullocks with a premium, which made up to 340 over for the tops.
There was also a lighter supply of heifers but the trade for them was a bit quieter.
Trade was also back at Dungarvan on Monday, where there was an increase in the supply on offer, while at Blessington Mart, there was a complete clearance at prices improved by 10-15/head."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10037057.html,2002-08-22 01:00:00,Yes to Nice ‘an uphill struggle’,"Mr Dillon said: “I know that there are farmers who are not happy with the position which the IFA have adopted, but the IFA is not telling any farmer what to do. It is up to themselves how they vote and I know it is going to be difficult for the IFA to deliver on the recommendation for a Yes vote.”
At Adare, Co Limerick, he also told farmers: “The IFA position is quite clear. We are recommending a Yes vote for a number of reasons. Every gallon of milk sold at the moment has an element of EU support. The world market is returning only 42p per gallon, and we need the EU supports and we need to have them increased. The level of EU support for beef is nearly as high as what is coming from the market place.” He confirmed that the IFA national council’s Yes vote recommendation stands, despite the flood of anger from farmers.
“That is not saying that farmers are going to vote along that line. Farmers are totally frustrated. Prices are down, incomes are down. I can certainly understand how farmers are feeling, and it will be an uphill struggle for a Yes vote,” he said.
Mr Dillon strongly refuted the challenge from farmers that the Association should have laid down a ‘price’ with the government in return for the farmer Yes vote. “That is not the way that we do business,” he said.
“I said clearly at national council that we were supporting Nice, but we are going to talk to the Taoiseach and the Minister and request them to tell us what they are going to do to ensure that Nice is approved in the referendum. We believe that is the best way of doing it.
“There is nothing conditional. We have decided to recommend a Yes vote for Nice, but we need help to make it happen and we require the help of the Government and the Minister.”
He said that Irish farmers need the support of the EU and of member states which may face difficulties in the aftermath of another rejection of the Nice treaty.
“As a country, we try to lobby in Europe for support and help and we need to have friends out there, and to have those friends we need to support Europe,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10033886.html,2002-08-22 01:00:00,Beef market at mercy of more variables than ever,"For snakes, read steaks, from Argentina. Or, choose from the release of intervention beef, the strengthening of the euro, or the whims of international beef buyers.
You could get a leg up the ladder from changes to the age limit for bone-in carcasses, or rising demand for foot-and-mouth replacements in the UK.
Unpredictable though prospects are, there are a few things you can be sure of, barring disasters like the disease flare-ups of the past two years.
You can be sure of relatively stable beef-production levels, and improving consumer demand within the EU.
Forget about Egypt; it will not be a serious market outlet this year, says Bord Bia, while access to other traditional international markets is likely to remain limited.
At home, steer supplies are expected to decline by 4%, compared to last year. Slightly more heifers are expected and there will be no Special Purchase Scheme; that scheme removed 180,000 cows in the second half of 2001.
For optimists, breeding-heifer exports to Scotland and the north of England should offer some justification. Demand is expected to be strong in the autumn, as the British beef herd recovers from foot and mouth. UK farmers should be looking for premium, quality Irish breeding heifers to satisfy stringent veterinary regulations.
Keep an eye on the EU requirement to remove the backbone from carcasses of cattle over 12 months, which curtailed our strong trade for carcass beef to Italy.
Brussels has signalled a move to raise the age limit, which would boost our exports to Italian wholesalers for the remainder of 2002, and enable the expansion of our customer base to traditional customers who do not possess an SRM removal licence.
Replacements for the UK, and carcasses to Italy, would add momentum to the steady EU beef market recovery, since the end of 2001. Irish export prospects could equally be pulled in the opposite direction. Steaks from Argentina could cause this because the UK food-service sector important to Irish exporters has access, since July 1, to an extra 10,000 tonnes quota, for Argentine steak-cuts, into the EU.
This product tends to have a long storage life, which means that steaks imported before July could also be in the system at the end of the summer, dragging down prices.
Any further releases from the 250,000 tonnes of EU intervention beef will have much the same effect, but on manufacturing rather than retail beef sales.
Shipping beef out of the EU is another route to stronger markets; that prospect dims with every cent the euro gains on world currency exchanges.
The EU beef market will be nicely balanced this year, if Europeans keep eating more beef, and if exports out of the EU increase by 85,000 for the rest of the year.
Unfortunately, two thirds of the international markets for EU beef remain closed, as a result of BSE.
Russia is the only significant market open but it's not much use to cattle farmers in the six Irish counties banned by Moscow because of their high BSE incidence.
Still, Russia took more than 38,000 tonnes of Irish beef in the first six months of 2002. Their import demand should be maintained, but the weakening US dollar is a worry for Russian suppliers, and there is strong competition from Germany and Brazil.
The first consignment of Irish beef for Egypt was despatched recently. That's probably all for 2002, says Bord Bia; Egypt is in the middle of an economic downturn that has seen its currency devalued by 40%.
Also, Irish beef has been absent from this market for nearly 20 months, and has been substituted by cheaper imports from Brazil, India and, more recently, China.
For the remainder of the year, access to other traditional international markets is likely to remain limited, according to Bord Bia analysts.
However, a number of technical delegations are due to visit Ireland over the coming months, and it is hoped this will result in the re-opening of some markets to Irish beef.
Since the beginning of 2002, the US dollar has weakened by 13% against the euro, which has reduced the competitiveness of EU beef, and made the level of export refunds more important than ever.
Exports of live cattle in the first six months of 2002 were 44,000 head, four times that of 2001, but 200,000 head lower than the first half of 2000.
Northern Ireland took 15,000 cattle (including replacements bound for the UK mainland), some 20,000 went to the Continental EU, and 9,000 head went to the Lebanon.
There's a new cloud over Northern Ireland trade; beef from southern cattle can no longer be labelled as British, and can't be sold outside of the province.
The live trade to the Continent has improved to about 2,000 head per week, with 70% going to Spain.
Spanish feed-lots mainly want 75kg to 80kg calves, and five- to six-month-old weanlings, to allow time for finishing under 12 months and to avoid the T-bone ban. Some eight- to nine-month-old heifer weanlings have been exported, to be finished at a year old.
Irish cattle prices have recently become more competitive, compared to French and German supplies; the live export trend will depend largely on this competitiveness.
Exports to the Lebanon are expected to improve gradually for the remainder of 2002, but will depend, to a large extent, on the level of competition from other suppliers, particularly Germany"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10031464.html,2002-08-27 01:00:00,Doubts remain over beef industry’s ability to deliver on rationalisation,"Those close to the latest efforts who are trying to get the industry to take a hard look at itself in order to and radically cut capacity are far from convinced that the sector has the willingness to deliver on such a programme.
Such is the nature of the business that has 42 EU-approved plants operating in Ireland at this point.
That the numbers of cattle being slaughtered have been falling dramatically, down from a high of 2 million a few years ago to 1.5 million today, has not acted as a deterrent. Slaughtering capacity has risen consistently since the publication of the 1998 McKinsey report that advocated radical reform of the beef processing industry.
Money in the form of Compensation has been the dividing issue ever since the report was systematically leaked when it became obvious that it would take more than the prestige of McKinsey to kick-start the reforms outlined by consultants.
Smaller processors fear that the bigger players will find their balance sheets and their positions in the beef industry doubly enhanced if the reforms, as envisaged under McKinsey, are agreed in the coming months.
There are concerns too that the latest attempts at reform could see the biggest players gaining even tighter control of the industry; this is a sector already dominated by a few key and powerful players such as Dawn Meats, Kepak and Goodman International.
From a processor perspective, however, reaction to these latest attempts at reform raise concerns that some of the biggest players could end up getting even tighter control of the industry.
Beef producers are bemused at the prospect of the plan helping the industry and others are quite furious that the reforms will do much to resolve their dilemma of rock-bottom prices.
It is far from certain that the plan outlined four years ago in the McKinsey report will ultimately be delivered on. It envisages a cut of 25% in overall capacity which, given the new entrants to the sector and the sharp dip in cattle numbers, would no longer realistically require an even bigger cut in capacity at this stage be enough if the reforms are to have any real impact on future costs and profitability in the future.
Beef farmers, however, have a different take on the industry. They still see a cartel where prices quoted across all factories and processors are the same.
While the report into the sector said there was no evidence of a cartel, in essence the end result is the same for farmers that’s what farmers confronted with every week even if it is pure coincidence that every week with plants paying the same for beef.
It has also been argued that the industry is harming itself by running a flat pricing structure. Buyers of our beef need only make one phone call on any given day to know what the factories are paying for beef.
One angry beef producer argues that overseas buyers have the industry against the wall because of the price uniformity in the Irish market. “All any buyer need do is pick up the Farmers Journal any Thursday to know the going rate for beef in Ireland,” he said. In other words, the argument from the producer point of view is that the industry has left itself a sitting duck in overseas markets in terms of the prices it can command at any given time. If it had the wit to vary its prices, then those buying our beef might have less leverage on us because processors could argue that prices vary, thereby strengthening their case for charging higher prices for Irish beef.
Of equal concern among producers is the undeniable truth that the plan, as envisaged, will reduce competition in the Irish beef market.
One angry producer put it fairly forcibly when he said reducing competition would not be tolerated in any other sector of the economy, so why should it be acceptable in a sector he seriously believes operates a cartel in the first instance?
It’s a fair point, but the counter-argument is that, despite the extension of the number of plants in Ireland the price of beef has remained uniform throughout, and it has continued to fall in spite of farmers’ best efforts to force factories to pay better prices for beef.
It has been put to this column, with some conviction, that in the case of lamb, where the price does vary from plant to plant, the sector is more profitable for the simple reason that price variation gives processors more bargaining clout on international markets.
This debate is destined to run on. And while culling plants may be part of the answer, cheesed-off producers will want a better deal from this reform package if Irish beef is to have any real chance of becoming a coherent, dynamic force in the Irish food chain.
Looking back at the sector over the years, that kind of ambition probably sounds starry-eyed to those who know the sector well."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10036405.html,2002-08-30 01:00:00,Beef prices steady as supplies tighten,"Processors have been at pains to point out to producers that there has been no change in the quiet climate of the market place for beef, and the requirement for supplies is not strong, but the fine weather has probably been the strongest factor in the development which is returning unchanged or marginally firmed prices to the beef men.
There was a slight drop in supplied to the factories last week, as producers availed to the fine weather to concentrate on harvesting.
It also eased the pressure on some producers in heavy land areas to sell as ground conditions improved and they can avail of some benefit from the improved grass growth of the previous weeks. There were some indication on Monday that supplies were coming out a little freer than last week, but it is a case of wait and see how the week pans out.
Generally 235 cents/kg (84p/lb) is being quoted this week for R grade steers and heifers, although some are on 232 cents/kg (83p/lb) which varies between similar to last week and 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) less.
Slightly higher prices of up to 238 cents/kg (85p/lb) are being negotiated in direct deals with factories for quality cattle and 241 cents/kg (86p/lb) is on offer at Galtee Meats for quality steers over 400 kg.
Galtee are paying the same for these animals whether they are under 30 months or not - a good price for over 30 months cattle presently.
The price for O grade is generally 224 cents/kg (80p/lb) maintaining the wider than previous difference between the grades.
The cow prices have also been stable this week and demand is generally good.
On the markets a marginal improvement in the demand for topsides in Britain is being regarded as a positive sign while the overall trade has continued quiet over the past week.
The markets in France, Italy, Germany and Holland have all remained unchanged and generally not taking any huge volumes.
In the marts the prices continued firm for the quality cattle, particularly the forward animals with a premia, but tended easier for the plainer lots and some of the younger animals, unlikely to make the grade at beef were being the worst hit.
Numbers on offer at the marts were back, probably because of the weather.
On Monday prices were improved by 30-40/head at Blessington Mart.
There was a good steady trade at Dungarvan with pressure on prices for plain cattle and a solid trade with prices similar to the previous week at Bandon."

They flag these quality ingredients on their menus and prominently display a blue-framed Féile Bia Certificate - all to provide customers with the reassurance that the food they are serving is quality sourced locally.
The Bord Bia-organised programme is supported by the Restaurants Association of Ireland; the Irish Hotels Federation, and the farming community. Euro-Toques, the European community of chefs, is also endorsing it and actively encouraging its member chefs in Ireland to sign up to the celebration of quality food. Campbell Catering; Supermacs; the Gresham Hotel Group and the Jurys Doyle Hotel Group are among the outlets that have joined the scheme this year, pushing the number of outlets beyond expectations.
Féile Bia provides Bord Bia with an opportunity to support the growing food service sector in Ireland, which was valued at 1.4 billion last year, part of the overall food and drink industry valued at 15 billion.
The initiative also provides tourists with the opportunity to experience quality produce in Ireland and in turn become ambassadors for Irish food abroad, assisting the growth of the 6.6 billion of Irish food and drink exported annually.
Campbell Catering, which has some 300 outlets throughout the country, is Ireland’s leading contract catering company with a 45% market share.
Bord Bia chief executive Michael Duffy said Féile Bia food service operators were committed to sourcing products from quality-assured schemes and Campbell Catering’s participation reinforces the high standard of Irish food and drink.
Campbell Catering managing director Joan O’Shaughnessy said it was using fresh, quality, local produce where possible.
“We prepare food for over 150,000 customers daily. Féile Bia now offers us the opportunity to exhibit our commitment to food traceability and food quality.”
Féile Bia, now in its fourth year, is putting more emphasis on the sourcing and provenance of food in hotels, restaurants and pubs. The target it set for participating outlets has already been met.
Bord Bia home market manager Georgina O’Sullivan said consumer research shows that people are concerned about where their food comes from.
“Bord Bia believes there is room for improvement by the food service sector in sourcing their ingredients through traceability systems and providing information to the consumer.” An ongoing promotional campaign has been undertaken to encourage the public to look for the certificate in their eating establishment.
Bord Bia’s focus going forward is to build on the momentum of the last six months and to bring a majority of food service operators into the promotion by the year end.
Georgina O’Sullivan said the range and quality of establishments now participating demonstrates that Féile Bia is achieving its objectives.
“Our message to prospective members is that Féile Bia is a clear and unambiguous way of demonstrating their commitment to sourcing the best quality food and, ultimately, meeting the demands of customers in a positive and mutually beneficial way,” she said.
IFA president John Dillon has repeatedly called on all hotels, restaurants, pubs and the catering sector throughout the country to support the Féile Bia campaign and to use high quality local produce and produce from Bord Bia-approved quality assurance schemes. He said he was delighted so many outlets have now fully committed to supporting quality Irish food and have the blue-framed Féile Bia Certificate on prominent display on their premises.
“These hotels, restaurants and caterers have shown commendable commitment and loyalty to high quality local produce and meat and egg products from Bord Bia quality assurance schemes, and they should in turn be supported by farm families and consumers throughout the country.”
Mr Dillon said an Agri Aware survey has shown that more than 90% of consumers want the country of origin identified when meat and poultry is purchased in hotels, restaurants and at retail point of sale.
But, unknowingly to Irish consumers, far too many hotels and restaurants still use imported product.
“In many cases, they pretend it is Irish because they know their customers expect to be served Irish food. They should commit to and support local high quality food products. The unnecessary use of imported product is putting the livelihood of Irish farmers at risk.”
Mr Dillon said local hotels, restaurants, caterers and pubs in the towns and villages throughout the country need to recognise that many of their customers are farmers, farm families and farm related businesses, whose survival depends on demand from the overall catering sector for products supplied by them.
“In an extremely difficult year for farming, caused by excessively wet weather and low market prices for farm produce, support from other sectors of the community is essential for the long term viability of rural areas.
“We all are in the business of food production and food preparation for the long term.
“Farmers as primary food producers are interdependent with hotels, restaurants and the catering sector.
“We need to support each other and together we can have a viable future,” he said."

The good weather has a lot to do with the tighter supply situation the factories are experiencing this week as good ground conditions and a plentiful supply of grass is being taken advantage of to finish off cattle.
There was an all round firmer tone to the trade yesterday with improvements in price of up to 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) in the quotes for R grade bullocks and heifers and up to 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) being added to last weeks quoted prices for O grade.
The general quote for R grade is 235 cents/kg (84p/lb) while O grade prices range from 230 cents/kg (82p/lb) back to 224 cents/kg (80p/lb).
There was no rush of cattle being booked in at the factories yesterday to take advantage of the higher prices and export plants requiring large supplies were finding the sourcing a little more difficult than previous weeks.
No one was admitting a shortage. The factory buyers were stressing that markets are still quiet with no demand for large volumes of beef, but it was clear some of them were getting somewhat less than they required to keep their orders supplied.
The result was more dealing with producers and up to 5-8 cents/kg (2p-3p/lb) over the quotes were being paid to get good cattle in particular.
The bullock kill at the factories last week was 1,200 up on the previous week at 17,945 head - and 1,400 head more than the same week in 2001 - out of a total kill for last week of 33,043 head.
On the continent, other than in Holland, where the demand for beef improved, there was no change in the pattern of quiet trade."

Within factory groups there were small variations in the average prices paid at the different plants for the same category and grade of cattle and poor prices for some categories at individual factories.
One factory up-country paid an average of 202 cents/kg (79p/lb) for R3 grade heifers by far the lowest average factory price in the country and a variation of up to 36 cents/kg (13p/lb) was revealed between factories for the same category of cows.
The highest factory average for R3 bullocks was 244 cents/kg (87p/lb) paid by Carrigans of Donegal, followed by Slaney Meats, Bunclody, Excel at Kilbeggan, Bergins of Kildare, Newgrange Meats at Navan, and the Dawn plants at Midleton and Waterford all paying over the average for the category of 234 cents/kg (84p/lb) which was the generally quoted price for the week.
The best available for O3 grade bullocks was an average of 238 cents/kg (85p/lb) at Dawn Meats, Waterford ahead of Carrigans, Duffys of Gort and Fair Oak at Bagenalstown all of whom were well ahead of the overall average of 228 cents/kg (81p/lb).
The leading price for R3 heifers was an excellent 253 cents/kg (90p/lb) at AIBP, Waterford just ahead of Kepak, Clonee and Watergrasshill. The average for R3 heifers was 237 cents/kg (84.6p/lb). One factory paid an average of 202 cents/kg (72p/lb) exposing a difference of 50 cents/kg (18p/lb) between the best and worst prices paid.
The top price for O3 heifers was 236 cents/kg (84p/lb) at Meadow Meats, Rathdowney. The average was 224 cents/kg (80p/lb) and the lowest factory average was 214 cents/kg 77p/lb)."

The quoted rates at the factories were increased by 3-6c/kg for O grade, which brought them into line with the pay-sheet returns for last week (as reported in yesterday's edition).
However, the reported prices from producers to the IFA for this week show that unlike a few weeks ago, there is no top-up on the quoted rates being paid this week. The weanling trade is now in full swing, with larger numbers on offer at all centres.
The earlier expectation that weights would be down on last year because of the difficult farming season is being confirmed.
Average weights for bulls are back by 50-75kg/head. The trade eased back a little this week, but there are still strong prices being paid for the quality weanling bulls, and good shipping demand for the heifers.
The best of the bulls sold from 300 over to 450 over this week, about 10-20/head back on last week.
The best of the continental heifers are making 140 over to 160 over. The shippers are buying in the range 100 over to 150 over which appears to be the general cut-off point for their cheque books. What is becoming more obvious in the adult cattle is the widening price range between quality and the potentially poor-grading animals.
Friesian stores are being seriously discounted because of the emphasis being placed on quality at the factories, and this is a trend that will be worth watching into the autumn as larger numbers come on to the market.
The quality bullocks over 500kg with a premia were an improved trade at Kilkenny Mart yesterday.
There was a smaller sale of 660 there due to the Iverk Agricultural Show taking place at Pilltown.
Prices were up 10/head.
All other categories of store bullocks were back 10-15/head.
Beef heifers were improved by 5-10/head.
At Midleton Mart, there was a firm trade for a small supply of cattle.
Heavy bullocks single punched sold from 150 over to 266 over.
Light bullocks with both premia available made up to 310 over.
The weanling trade at Athenry Mart yesterday went contrary to the trend with prices improved by 20-30/head for the bulls and dearer by 10-15/head for heifers.

Absence of information on food, particularly in hotels, pubs and catering outlets, leads two-thirds of consumers to assume that the country of origin is Ireland. This assumption is compounded by the fact that only 12% of consumers check that the food they buy when eating out is Irish. This is in stark contrast with consumer behaviour when purchasing food in shops as two-thirds of them check the country of origin and buy Irish when the information is available.
Agri Aware chairman Mike Magan, noting that consumers are clearly in favour of purchasing Irish food, called in particular on hotels, pubs and catering outlets to give them what they want quality food produced in Ireland. ""This study shows that the consumer wants to buy Irish produce at every opportunity. However, many consumers are not aware that imports make up 22.6% of domestic beef use, 31% of domestic pigmeat use and 34% of domestic poultry use,"" he said.
Mr Magan, stressing that farmers' are proud and committed producers of safe food in a quality environment, called on all those involved in the sale of food to join the Féile Bia initiative.
In doing so they would be showing a commitment to food produced in Ireland and meeting the consumers' clearly expressed demand for Irish food.
""If we want Irish food we must ask the question when shopping and eating out as too many of us are hoodwinked into assuming that the food we are purchasing is Irish,"" he said.
Dr Pat Bogue, Shannon Showcase Consultants, carried out the study over the summer at 10 locations.
It found that consumers consider the quality of food, the price, country of origin, health, taste, and convenience as important factors when shopping and eating out. While 33% of consumers consider price as the most important factor when buying food, over 40% rate quality as the most important factor when purchasing food.
Overall, the majority of consumers consider basic food items to represent good value for money. Seventy-seven percent of consumers consider milk to be excellent, good or reasonable value.
Fifty-seven percent of consumers believe meat to be expensive or very expensive. Vegetables were also seen to represent poorer value for money than milk and bread.
Consumers regard the price returning to farmers as not being fair for their efforts in producing quality food. Over 50% of them felt the retailer was the main beneficiary from the price of meat.
Mr Magan said the study indicates that retailers and catering outlets have questions to answer, as, in the mind of the consumer, the price paid for food bears no relation to the price paid to the farmer.
Eight out of ten consumers believe the farmer benefits least from the price of food across all the basic food items. The study also concludes that consumers believe the introduction of the Euro has resulted in an increase in food prices.
The study shows that 75% of consumers are confident in Irish food safety standards. Most consider Irish food to be of higher quality than that of other countries."

This does not include the feeding and feedlot costs to bring them to beef.
Many US farmers are discouraged by these high costs from purchasing cattle even though there may be profit potential in cattle feeding.
It's a familiar story for farmers here who have fattened for many years, and often showed good profits, but are finding it harder and harder to stay in the business without running down their assets.
The answer in the US comes in the shape of a company called BullTrend. With their help, anyone can play at cattle farming.
The investor sits back and lets BullTrend take the risk. The man in the street can invest in this custom cattle feeding operation, but experienced cattle farmers are also invited to get involved in feeding cattle.
The investor purchases a fraction of a pen of cattle, and BullTrend covers the rest of the cost.
Services offered include purchasing and placing cattle in feedlots, marketing finished cattle, and setting up futures accounts in order to hedge against unfavourable cattle price trends. BullTrend has its own trucking services and a database of cattle feedlot information spanning the last 20 years. The company claims to have developed a break-even programme to assist investors in hedging against losses, and projecting their returns.
The company's location in the Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska borderlands is seen as an advantage, being dry and relatively bio-secure, with low pollution risks even for the huge open air feedlot system of producing beef in the US.
There are numerous local sources of low cost, but high quality, feed.
Several meat packers are within 70 miles of the company's feedlots, where the animals are checked each day by staff who include two vets and a nutritionist.
The BullTrend lots hold 20,000 head, and have three cattle hospital facilities if needed however, a low loss rate of under 1% is claimed. If Irish cattle farmers could match that kind of performance, maybe the way to stay in beef try is by inviting investors who will contribute some of the start-up costs. On the other hand, maybe the unpredictability in Irish cattle production is too much for investors to bear, just as it is for more and more farmers."

IFA president John Dillon said the final straw for farmers was this week’s latest price cut by the factories in the week that the Russian market was re-opened for all counties.
Mr Dillon, accusing the meat factories of driving down cattle prices, said over the last ten weeks the factories have cut beef prices to farmers by 25c/kg or 9p/lb or 84/head.
All along, the meat factories said the key issue was securing full access to the Russian market. When this was achieved within the past week, their only response was to close ranks and cut prices again. Producers simply cannot afford to sell cattle at a price of 2.27/kg or 81p/lb, he said.
AIBP said last month that it has always had a policy of paying its farmer suppliers a good and fair price for cattle on the day of slaughter, in an honest, honourable and transparent fashion, a policy which continues to this day.
AIBP also stressed that the prices paid to farmers for cattle are dictated by the markets available for those cattle."

Farmers receive 38 cent out of every euro spent on beef and, in the case of bread, they receive only 8 cent per euro: “According to the CSO national average figure for July 2002 the current price paid to farmers for liquid milk is 30 cent per litre, whereas the price paid per litre of milk at retail level is 85 cent. The widening food price gap is certainly not due to the amount paid to farmers. The percentage of consumer expenditure on basic food items which goes to farmers has declined sharply over the years.”
Consumers Association of Ireland chairman Michael Kilcoyne said he fully favoured a combined approach by consumers and farmers to get Government action to stop profiteering by the supermarket middlemen. Both Mr O’Rourke and Mr Kilcoyne pointed out that the actions of retail multiples are ensuring that both farmers and consumers are suffering. This power is leading to an abuse of a dominant position which is outlawed under competition legislation. The ICMSA president said a compulsory system of beef price transparency that protects both farmer and consumer interests operates in the US under federal legislation. The ICMSA has proposed a similar system to the Government and to the EU Commission. Mr O’Rourke and Mr Kilcoyne jointly called on Tanaiste Mary Harney to act on her own statement that there was need to examine the growing price gap between the farm gate and consumer plate.
They said the ICMSA and the Consumers Association of Ireland would most definitely welcome this examination and would participate in any committee the Tanaiste may wish to establish to ensure that the interests of both farmers and consumers are properly addressed and protected."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-10061930.html,2002-09-21 01:00:00,Big Mac’s golden arches are starting to crumble,"Shares have slumped to a seven-year low, in their biggest single-day slide since Black Monday in 1987, and a series of public relations disasters and anti-globalisation protests have wiped the smile off Ronald McDonald's face.
Ordinarily, McDonalds could shrug off such problems. It is, after all, a multinational with 30,000 restaurants in over 120 different countries. But the shares plummet is another indication of a company in crisis.
At the height of its powers, McDonalds was seen as a triumphant symbol of global capitalism. At the end of the cold war, the golden arches appeared in Moscow and former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev fronted McDonalds adverts. In 1996, the company overtook Coca-Cola to become the most recognised brand in the world.
But now Ronald McDonald has been made redundant. Once referred to by McDonalds as ""the smile known around the world"", the television days of the cheery clown are over. In the heyday of the 1970s and 80s, he captured millions of consumers for McDonalds with family-friendly ads. But modern consumers viewed him as out of touch and even slightly sinister.
Now that Ronald is gone, McDonalds is still running family-orientated ads but the message isn't getting through. ""Every time is a good time,"" is the slogan but the problem is consumers are worried about fast food as part of their daily diet.
Caesar Barber is one of seven people suing McDonalds in the US. He ate there five times a week since the 1950s and now weighs almost 20 stone.
""Those people in the advertisements don't really tell you what's in the food"" he said. ""It's all fat, fat and more fat. Now I'm obese."" Mr Barber has been ridiculed in the US but the worldwide coverage of the story hasn't helped burger sales.
It is just one of a litany of problems that has left the McDonalds image looking like a crumpled Big Mac carton. The company has agreed to pay $10 million to American Hindus after trouble with its veggie fries. In 1990 McDonalds proclaimed that it would fry its french fries in vegetable oil to suit the tastes of vegetarians. When the news emerged that the 'veggie fries' were actually being fried in beef fat at manufacturing plants, there were riots in India and lawsuits in America.
There have been other off-the-wall lawsuits. In 'Coffeegate', customers successfully sued the company for burning their mouths on ""too hot"" beverages. But the most damaging of all was initiated by McDonalds itself.
In 1994, the company sued environmentalists Dave Morris and Helen Steel for libel for distributing fliers entitled ""What's wrong with McDonalds?' outside its restaurants. The 'McLibel' case dragged on for two and a half years and became the longest trial in British legal history. McDonalds won the battle Morris and Steel were ordered to pay £60,000 in compensation but lost the war. The trial brought out a wealth of evidence about McDonald's food, its treatment of workers and its effect on the environment. Mr Morris, a postman and Ms Steel, a gardener, were not even able to pay compensation. McDonalds had spent £10 million in court to vindicate itself but ended up funding a public relations disaster.
After the trial, McDonalds, rather than being the golden boy of capitalism, was held up as a symbol of all that was wrong with it. The first target for the anti-globalisation activists in London two years ago was a McDonalds restaurant. A French farmer Jose Bove became a hero for ransacking a McDonald's restaurant in Millau in southern France with a tractor, chainsaws and axes. There have marches against McDonalds on the streets but even more damagingly to the company, crusades from the academic world as well. Last year, Eric Schlosser wrote Fast Food Nation, an indictment of McDonalds and other companies, and it became an instant bestseller.
McDonalds, according to Schlosser, is a company that automates the food process for speed and efficiency. The result is a quick Big Mac for the customer but an alienated workforce.
""The organisation cannot trust the individual,"" said Ray Kroc, the founding father of McDonalds. ""The individual must trust the organisation.
All McDonald's franchises receive an instruction book known as the 'Bible', 750 pages long, weighing four pounds. But this distrustful attitude towards ordinary workers is another concept that is out of touch with today's workforce.
So too is the whole concept of fast food. People are no longer content to munch a Big Mac when other outlets are offering alternative food at a reasonable price. So now even the McDonalds management is talking of ""adding value"" to its products.
The chief executive of McDonalds, Jack Greenberg, believes he can save the company.

Ronald McDonald is out in the cold and the company he personified will struggle not to follow him."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-10061930.html,2002-09-21 01:00:00,Big Mac’s golden arches are starting to crumble,"Shares have slumped to a seven-year low, in their biggest single-day slide since Black Monday in 1987, and a series of public relations disasters and anti-globalisation protests have wiped the smile off Ronald McDonald's face.
Ordinarily, McDonalds could shrug off such problems. It is, after all, a multinational with 30,000 restaurants in over 120 different countries. But the shares plummet is another indication of a company in crisis.
At the height of its powers, McDonalds was seen as a triumphant symbol of global capitalism. At the end of the cold war, the golden arches appeared in Moscow and former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev fronted McDonalds adverts. In 1996, the company overtook Coca-Cola to become the most recognised brand in the world.
But now Ronald McDonald has been made redundant. Once referred to by McDonalds as ""the smile known around the world"", the television days of the cheery clown are over. In the heyday of the 1970s and 80s, he captured millions of consumers for McDonalds with family-friendly ads. But modern consumers viewed him as out of touch and even slightly sinister.
Now that Ronald is gone, McDonalds is still running family-orientated ads but the message isn't getting through. ""Every time is a good time,"" is the slogan but the problem is consumers are worried about fast food as part of their daily diet.
Caesar Barber is one of seven people suing McDonalds in the US. He ate there five times a week since the 1950s and now weighs almost 20 stone.
""Those people in the advertisements don't really tell you what's in the food"" he said. ""It's all fat, fat and more fat. Now I'm obese."" Mr Barber has been ridiculed in the US but the worldwide coverage of the story hasn't helped burger sales.
It is just one of a litany of problems that has left the McDonalds image looking like a crumpled Big Mac carton. The company has agreed to pay $10 million to American Hindus after trouble with its veggie fries. In 1990 McDonalds proclaimed that it would fry its french fries in vegetable oil to suit the tastes of vegetarians. When the news emerged that the 'veggie fries' were actually being fried in beef fat at manufacturing plants, there were riots in India and lawsuits in America.
There have been other off-the-wall lawsuits. In 'Coffeegate', customers successfully sued the company for burning their mouths on ""too hot"" beverages. But the most damaging of all was initiated by McDonalds itself.
In 1994, the company sued environmentalists Dave Morris and Helen Steel for libel for distributing fliers entitled ""What's wrong with McDonalds?' outside its restaurants. The 'McLibel' case dragged on for two and a half years and became the longest trial in British legal history. McDonalds won the battle Morris and Steel were ordered to pay £60,000 in compensation but lost the war. The trial brought out a wealth of evidence about McDonald's food, its treatment of workers and its effect on the environment. Mr Morris, a postman and Ms Steel, a gardener, were not even able to pay compensation. McDonalds had spent £10 million in court to vindicate itself but ended up funding a public relations disaster.
After the trial, McDonalds, rather than being the golden boy of capitalism, was held up as a symbol of all that was wrong with it. The first target for the anti-globalisation activists in London two years ago was a McDonalds restaurant. A French farmer Jose Bove became a hero for ransacking a McDonald's restaurant in Millau in southern France with a tractor, chainsaws and axes. There have marches against McDonalds on the streets but even more damagingly to the company, crusades from the academic world as well. Last year, Eric Schlosser wrote Fast Food Nation, an indictment of McDonalds and other companies, and it became an instant bestseller.
McDonalds, according to Schlosser, is a company that automates the food process for speed and efficiency. The result is a quick Big Mac for the customer but an alienated workforce.
""The organisation cannot trust the individual,"" said Ray Kroc, the founding father of McDonalds. ""The individual must trust the organisation.
All McDonald's franchises receive an instruction book known as the 'Bible', 750 pages long, weighing four pounds. But this distrustful attitude towards ordinary workers is another concept that is out of touch with today's workforce.
So too is the whole concept of fast food. People are no longer content to munch a Big Mac when other outlets are offering alternative food at a reasonable price. So now even the McDonalds management is talking of ""adding value"" to its products.
The chief executive of McDonalds, Jack Greenberg, believes he can save the company.
""We have recently announced an acceleration of our plans to give customers even better value, service, menu choice and experience,"" he said. Under Greenberg, McDonalds is changing rapidly but there is more than a hint of desperation about the moves The company has set up a range of McCafe's, a coffee shop beside the main restaurant, aimed at taking customers away from the coffee chains.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10084307.html,2002-09-23 01:00:00,Farmers protest cattle prices,"The protests, which began outside plants owned by Anglo Irish Beef Processors (AIBP) in Nenagh, Cahir, Bandon, Waterford, Rathkeale and Clones at teatime last evening, are expected to continue today.
AIBP, the Goodman group, totally rejected IFA suggestions that it does not pay a fair price for cattle, and the Irish Meat Association (IMA), which represents processing companies, described the protests as misguided.
But IFA president John Dillon said the protests were sparked by persistent cutting of cattle prices since early July. In the last 10 weeks, meat factories had cut cattle prices five times, amounting to 95 per head.
Farmers were now losing more than 220 of their premium payments. Mr Dillon said the final blow which brought about last evening's action was a cut in prices again last week despite strong export markets and the lifting of a six-county ban to the important Russian market.
He also described the British market as rock-solid and pointed out that European cattle prices were rising in response to increased demand.
Mr Dillon said farmers were determined to take whatever action was necessary to stop the factories in their drive to cut prices, which was destroying the livelihoods of beef farmers, who can not afford to sell cattle at the unviable price of 2.27/kg (81p/lb). IFA Livestock Committee chairman Derek Deane said there was a groundswell of support for the cattle price protest.
There was a real sense of injustice among farmers and a determination that the factories must be tackled on the issue.
AIBP, the country's largest meat processor, said it paid some of the highest prices in the industry. In many cases it paid the highest price across the various grades of steers, heifers and cows. It always paid and will continue to pay a fair market price to its farmer suppliers.
IMA chief executive John Smith said the IFA was misleading farmers into believing that artificially high cattle prices can be sustained.
Over 90% of cattle slaughtered in Ireland have to be sold to export markets. The prices that meat factories pay for cattle are determined by the returns from the market outlets that are available.
Despite difficulties in finding commercial market outlets for an increased volume of beef, the average price paid for cattle in Ireland this year was about two percent higher than the same period last year.
Mr Smith said while the decision by Russia is a vote of confidence in Irish beef, it does not mean that Russia will buy more Irish beef, nor does it mean higher prices are or will be available.
Traditional markets for Irish beef such as South Africa, the Gulf States, Indonesia and the Philippines remain closed, while Egypt, which has been reopened, has not resumed trade.
The majority of Irish beef exported to Britain is destined for the wholesale, manufacturing and food service segments of the market, where stiff competition from lower priced South American beef dampens the returns available.
The IMA also said the factory price paid for cattle cannot be looked at in isolation. Returns to farmers comprise both the factory price paid for cattle and premia which are paid directly to them by the EU.
In the case of steers, these direct EU premia payments amount to 520 euros per animal (160c/kg or 57.5p/lb).
In 2002 direct premia payments on steers increased by 24c/kg, 8.7p/lb. (on top of the 2% increase in factory prices)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10078558.html,2002-09-24 01:00:00,AIPB plants to resume slaughtering after protests,"The IFA said meat factories had cut cattle prices five times by 95 per head over the last 10 weeks, despite strong exports, high prices in British and European markets and increased access to the Russian market. It said Irish male cattle prices are now the lowest in Europe.
However, the Irish Meat Association, representing processors, said that despite difficulties in finding enough outlets for an increased volume of beef, the average price paid for cattle this year is about 2% higher than last year.
AIBP, the country's largest meat processor, said it always paid and will continue to pay a fair market price to its farmer suppliers. The prices it pays are among the highest in the industry.
But IFA leader John Dillon said the protest at the AIBP plants was just the first stage in a more intensive campaign to secure viable cattle prices for farmers. He said an IMA statement in yesterday's papers was ""a charter for failure for the Irish beef industry"".
By their own admission the beef factories are incapable of marketing Irish beef at viable prices, he said, leaving producers with only two options: secure a significant increase in live exports to bring competition into the trade, or substantially cut production.
""The abject failure of the meat factories in marketing Irish beef has left livestock farmers with uneconomic low prices and the lowest incomes of any farming sector.""
Mr Dillon said the British market remains very strong with increased demand and prices equivalent to 2.81/kg (100p/lb). Exports to Britain will increase again this year and are expected to reach 270,000 tonnes.
He said cattle prices across European markets have increased by 40 a head since July and demand for Irish beef has increased. Exports to Europe will increase by 36% this year, with increased exports to the high-priced markets of Holland, Italy, Sweden and France.
The lifting of the six-county Russian ban provides market access for an additional 36% of our prime cattle, he said In its statement, however, the IMA accused the IFA of misleading farmers into believing that artificially high cattle prices can be sustained.
It said that over 90% of cattle slaughtered in Ireland has to be sold to export markets. The prices that meat factories pay for cattle are determined by the returns from available market outlets.
While the decision by Russia is a vote of confidence in Irish beef, it does not mean that Russia will buy more beef, nor that higher prices are or will be available. The IMA said the majority of Irish beef exported to Britain is destined for the wholesale, manufacturing and food service sectors where stiff competition from lower-priced South American beef dampens the returns available."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10086437.html,2002-09-27 01:00:00,Record crowds cut a dash to ploughing event,"National Ploughing Association managing director Anna May McHugh said the wonderful weather was a major factor in attracting such huge crowds to the event.
But another contributing factor was the fact that the championships were not held last year due to the foot-and-mouth scare and people were anxious to make up this year for what they had missed.
Despite the current gloom in agriculture, the mood among the crowds that flocked to Ballacolla was good and the championships which cost 1.5 million to stage, was deemed an outstanding success. Mrs McHugh said farmers had a very difficult year and they needed that uplift. It was their annual holiday and it was tremendous that the weather came right for them this week.
“Everything went very well,” said a delighted Mrs McHugh.
She confirmed that next year’s ploughing championships will be held in Co Meath.
Meanwhile, the ICMSA announced that a farm survey it had conducted at the championships confirmed the depressed state of farm incomes, with virtually all farmers (97%) suffering an income decline this year.
A total of 56% of farmers surveyed expressed pessimism about their future in farming.
Sixty-three percent of farmers expect their incomes to decline by 15 and 20% this year and a further 20% of farmers expect to see their income fall in excess of 20%.
ICMSA president Pat O’Rourke said that 90% of farmers expect no improvement on their income situation in 2003. “This points to the central issue of farm incomes that needs the Government’s attention and this was the message we conveyed to the Taoiseach when he visited the ICMSA stand.”
Mr O’Rourke again proposed to the Taoiseach the establishment of a Commission on Farm Incomes to direct national and EU policies to restore profitability in farming. “I am encouraged that the Taoiseach now has a full grasp of the severity of the problem and the need for action.
“It was agreed that further discussion on this issue will take place in the coming days,” he said.
Concerning the current difficulties in the beef sector, Mr O’Rourke said there must be a collective approach involving the minister, farmers and the meat processors.
In this regard, Mr Walsh has a key role to play.
Mr O’Rourke urged a summit meeting of farm leaders and meat processors representatives to address the current difficulties of lack of markets and low cattle prices."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10121836.html,2002-09-27 01:00:00,Teagasc warns of tight beef profits,"Bernard Smyth, beef adviser with Teagasc, said a 500kg continental steer costing 800 today will need to be to be sold at 250c/kg (90p/lb) carcass weight next spring in order to have a profit of 70.
“Farmers who are paying up to 850 at present for these animals will be operating on a financial tightrope,” he said.
Mr Smyth said that lower quality silage on many beef farms this winter will add to feeding costs, putting additional pressure on margins.
Mr Smyth also said that given current beef prices and expectations for beef markets over the next 12-18 months, young stock are currently over-priced in the marts.
“Based on Teagasc guidelines, male weanlings are currently worth 2/kg, but are making upwards of 2.20/kg in the marts. Weanling heifers are worth 1.40/kg compared to current market prices of 1.50/kg or more.
“Eighteen-month-old steers are currently making at least 1.60/kg in the marts compared to a Teagasc guideline price of 1.50/kg. This is not to suggest that farmers who are selling these animals are making big margins.
“It merely highlights that overall margins in beef production are tight and emphasises the importance of high animal performance, tight budgeting, low fixed costs and utilising all available EU premium payments,” he said.
Mr Smyth said current strong prices for weanlings and stores may well be influenced by farmers seeking to build up maximum premium payments in 2002 following the publication of the EU mid-term review proposals."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10036123.html,2002-09-28 01:00:00,Farmers praise export refund hikes,"The increase was announced yesterday by Agriculture and Food Minister Joe Walsh. An increase in the advance payments of cattle premia from 60% to 80% was also announced.
IFA president John Dillon said the increase in the export refunds will effectively kick-start Irish beef exports to Egypt. ""The factories must reflect this important improvement in the market by responding with an immediate increase in cattle prices, which could defuse the dispute between livestock farmers and the meat factories.""
John Smith, chief executive, Irish Meat Association (IMA), representing the processors, said the EU Commission, in granting the refund increase, recognises the substantial additional veterinary and related costs that are associated with the Egyptian market. Mr Walsh said the special Egyptian refund rate is on average 22% above the normal refund and for some cuts is as high as 30%."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10048198.html,2002-10-01 01:00:00,'Timely boost' for beef exports,"For it comes just as the Egyptian market moves into the peak demand period for Ramadam, the Muslim festival, which this year commences on November 6.
According to Bord Bia’s market monitor, the increase in export refunds should help to facilitate the resumption of Irish beef exports to Egypt.
“However, overall beef imports are 40-50 percent lower than the last time Irish beef was exported to Egypt, with the market being principally supplied by competitively priced South American produce.
“The lower import demand is largely due to the weaker economic situation prevailing in Egypt over the last two years.” Bord Bia said the increase in refunds will help to restore the competitiveness of Irish beef on the market and provides a timely boost ahead of the key Egyptian demand period. John Smith, chief executive, Irish Meat Association, said while there were a number of technical issues outstanding, Irish meat companies will be using their best endeavours to reactivate the market. Arrangements will also have to be made to get Egyptian veterinary delegations sent to Ireland. Resolving these issues will give rise to delays before any production can take place.
“It is important to recognise that the market in Egypt for Irish beef is confined to beef from younger animals. Cattle are getting older as the year progresses.”
Mr Smith also said the overall economic climate in Egypt was difficult and there was a shortage of hard currency. “While good progress has been made on Egypt, the Irish Government must continue to push for the removal of the veterinary restrictions on beef exports to other traditional third country market outlets for Irish beef. Minister Joe Walsh described the decision by the EU Beef Management Committee as extremely significant for the Irish cattle and beef sector. Mr Walsh said the decision follows on from very strong representations, which he and his department had made to the commission over the past number of weeks.
An increase in the advance payments of cattle premia, which was also announced, will improve the cash flow of farmers by about €88 million.
He said he had sought this increase in order to improve the cash flow of beef farmers generally and, in particular, of those affected by the weather earlier this summer.
The IFA and the ICMSA both welcomed the increase in the export refunds."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10034776.html,2002-10-01 01:00:00,Disease had 'positive' impact on farming,"Trinity College academics Prof Alan Matthews and Ronnie O'Toole, writing in the current edition of the Irish Banking Review, noted that significant costs, however, were borne by the tourism and distribution sectors, as well as by taxpayers.
They called for a full inquiry, involving all stakeholders, to address all of the issues arising from the outbreak.
Using model simulation, the Trinity College academics reveal that, due to shortages of beef, pork and lamb on the British market, arising from foot and mouth there, agricultural prices here were 2.7% higher than would otherwise have been the case.
At the same time, manufacturing and service sector prices were between 0.1% and 0.4% lower.
In overall terms, the outbreak cost the economy 0.16% in lost consumption, according to Matthews and O'Toole. The tourism industry was particularly hard-hit with an estimated loss in international tourism receipts of 200 million alone.
The Government is estimated to have spent 100 million in tackling the problem. In addition, the loss of VAT revenue because of restrictions on cross-border shopping and trade is considered to have been significant although no estimates exist.
The overall impact of the 2001 outbreak was relatively modest, due to the speed and effectiveness of the control strategy put in place. But they point to the significant damage caused to some sectors, as well as to the importance to the economy of agriculture and trade, as grounds for a full inquiry of all the issues arising from the outbreak. ""It is thus imperative to adopt an animal health strategy that minimises the likelihood and extent of future outbreaks."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10119697.html,2002-10-03 01:00:00,Farmers to target Kepak factories in protest,"The protest is also to be extended in duration with this weekend's protest to continue until late on Tuesday evening.
The plants to be targeted on the third consecutive week of the protest are at Watergrasshill, Co Cork, Clonee, Co Meath and Athleague, Co Roscommon which between them process about 12% of the country's beef production.
A reduction of 1p/lb in beef prices paid to farmers supplying the factory at Athleague last week, confirmed in official Department of Agriculture prices yesterday, is understood to have influenced the decision by farmers to target factories in the Kepak Group next.
However, it is understood that there will be no action at any of the six AIBP factories this weekend, and neither will there be protests at the five Dawn Meat Group factories all of which were picketed last weekend.
The protest at the Kepak factories will commence at 7 p.m. on Sunday evening and continue until 4 p.m. on Tuesday evening, the first time that the protest has been extended beyond 24 hours in the current dispute. Official prices for last week show that overall there was a slight weakening in returns, but more pronounced for heifers than bullocks.
At the AIBP factories which have been targeted over the past two weeks prices for R3 bullocks remained at average or higher at Waterford. Clones, Nenagh and Cahir while prices at Rathkeale and Bandon were lower than average. In the Dawn Group, the target of protest last weekend, the prices were at average with the exception of Ballyhaunis.
The average for R3 bullocks last week was just under 83p/lb, about 0.5p/lb lower and O grade average at 80p/lb, also slightly lower. The average for R3 heifers was down 5 cents/kg (2p/lb) at 233.6 cents/kg (83.5p/lb), while the average for O3 heifers was unchanged at 224 cents/kg (80p/lb)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10083225.html,2002-10-03 01:00:00,Forests branch out with modern technology,"After meeting thousands of farmers at last week's National Ploughing Championships, forest industry leaders were confidently predicting a rise of as much as 1000 hectares in afforestation this year.
Planting in 2001 was 15,500 hectares, compared with an industry target of 20,000 hectares, and there were fears of a fall this year.
But farmer interest has jumped in the past six to eight weeks, said Kevin Hutchinson of Coillte at the Ploughing.
According to a spokesperson for Green Belt, the biggest non-state forestry company, forestry premiums are now the only support guaranteed to farmers by the Irish government and the EU for the next 20 years.
Jim Reidy, Forestry Development Officer in Teagasc, also reported increased farmer interest. ""We are expecting very big attendances at our new series of farm demonstrations in the next few weeks,"" he said.
He forecasts that within 10 years, more farms will have trees than traditional tillage crops.
A new interactive system of forestry training was launched by Forestry Minister John Browne on the Teagasc stand at the Ploughing.
The new training system uses DVDs (digital video discs), to bring virtual reality to the classroom.
They will be used in Teagasc training programmes for the 14,000 landowners currently involved in forestry, and for the additional 1,500 landowners who develop a forestry enterprise on their farms each year.
For people contemplating a forestry enterprise, there is detailed instruction on the economic implications, the initial preparation and the alternative systems of planting on the DVDs.
And for people with an established forestry enterprise, there is guidance on maintaining the plantation in the critical early years and on best management practices for quality timber.
The importance of environmentally compatible afforestation is also given prominence. The training programme will be run by specialist forestry advisors in local Teagasc centres throughout the country.
Jim Reidy said, ""Farmers now own 250,000 hectares of forestry, most of which has been planted during the past decade. A potential additional 400,000 hectares could be planted, without any impact on income from conventional agriculture."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10091908.html,2002-10-09 01:00:00,"Reward top-quality beef producers, says minister","Speaking at the Bord Bia Quality Beef Producer awards 2002 presentation in Dublin, he said it is vital for the successful development of the beef industry that the signals of the market place are transmitted back to the producer.
“Unfortunately, that is not always the case in the sense that it is generally accepted that producers are not adequately rewarded by the processing Industry for producing the type of high quality beef demanded by the EU market in particular,” he said.
He accepted that the issue of appropriate price differentials for the different qualities of cattle produced and slaughtered in this country is primarily a matter for the industry itself.
But, he said, the reality is that if the beef industry wants to move up the value chain and, more importantly, if it wants to increase its presence on the European market; it is in the long-term interests of both producers and processors to put in place a price structure, which rewards quality on a consistent and sustainable basis.
He said his department and the various State agencies have also an important role in promoting the production of quality beef.
To this end, it introduced the National Beef Assurance Scheme some years ago, to restore consumer confidence in beef and to meet ongoing changes in consumer demands.
This scheme is compulsory and it underpins the voluntary beef quality assurance scheme, operated so successfully for many years by An Bord Bia."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10122245.html,2002-10-10 01:00:00,Walsh refuses to interfere in cattle price row,"Speaking with reporters at the Bord Bia poultry and egg conference in Athlone, he said delivery of beef to the market place was a matter for industry itself and price was a matter for negotiation between the producers and the processing industry.
""I do not set prices. It would be inappropriate for me to get directly involved.""
Minister Walsh said he was concerned that any disruption of the supply line to vital markets would not be in the best interest of the industry, and he called on the producers and processors to seek to find a resolution to this particular problem. Mr Walsh said the cattle and beef industry every year at this time reached a bottleneck in terms of production coming off the land and needing a market place. This year was no different.
""In July-August, I put a lot of work into seeking to ensure there were as many outlets and there was as much access to markets as possible,"" the minister said. Mr Walsh recalled that two matters were brought to his attention that would be helpful to the industry.
One was the lifting of the Russian six-county ban and the other was a possible increase in export refunds to help with the Egyptian market.
He had achieved success in both of those issues.
A big factor now in the margin for beef producers is the premia.
He was asked if it would be possible to expedite the payment of the current tranche of premia and that he had done.
As well as that, the advance premium is payable at the rate of 60%. He made a case to Brussels to have that advance increased to 80%.
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler acceded to his request. The advance payments will be going out at the rate of 80% rather than 60%. Payments going in the next 10 days will be in excess of 500 million. Minister Walsh said his single greatest disappointment in his time as minister for agriculture was the fact that virtually all of the co-ops, apart from Dairygold, have got out of beef processing.
""I am disappointed with that and I think it is retrograde,"" he said, adding that it was a pity that the example of the dairy industry where co-op plcs have farmers controlling the processing end of the sector, could not be the case in the beef industry as well."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10078352.html,2002-10-11 01:00:00,ICOS warn against North cattle embargo,"ICOS National Marts Committee acting chairman Tom Doyle said this would serve to undermine cattle prices during the critical autumn sales period in livestock marts.
Traditionally, up to 20,000 weanlings and forward stores have been exported to the North in the last quarter of the year and northern dealers are normally strong buyers in livestock marts all over the country, particularly in western and border counties.
Beef plants in the North have reportedly instructed some suppliers not to continue to import southern cattle. In addition, it is believed there are several thousand southern cattle on farms in the North, for whom there is no apparent market. Mr Doyle said action must be taken to counteract this market failure. The situation had been brought about by British retailers discriminating against beef from cattle exported to Northern Ireland.
""Steps must be taken now to rescue this vitally important market for Irish cattle,"" he said.
ICOS explained that EU Beef labelling regulations, implemented since January of this year, require that all beef presented for sale must be clearly labelled with country of origin and, if animals are exported at any stage in their lives, the label must indicate the country of birth (Ireland), both countries of rearing (Ireland and UK) and the country of slaughter (UK).
A number of leading British retailers have refused to purchase beef from animals that have crossed the border, preferring to purchase beef that has only one country of origin - either wholly Irish or UK-produced.
According to ICOS, this development has prompted the northern processors to dramatically reduce the number of southern cattle that they handle."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10105805.html,2002-10-15 01:00:00,"War of words, but no beef price change","However, there has been no overall change in beef prices at factories for the week. Slaughtering at the AIBP factories at Nenagh and Cahir, Dawn Meats at Waterford, Meadow Meats at Rathdowney, and Kepak at Athleague will not resume until tomorrow.
Supplies of cattle under 30 months have tightened in some areas this week but there has been no change in overall quoted prices at the factories, which are at 232c/kg for R grade and 224c/kg for O grade.
Up to 3c/kg quoted by some factories last week is not available this week. Cattle over 30 months are being quoted back to 215c/kg this week.
IFA leader John Dillon has called on Enterprise Ireland to put rationalisations plans for the beef processing industry on hold ""until the industry comes forward with a proper marketing strategy"".
He accused the factories of price-fixing and claimed their marketing failure had left Irish cattle prices at the bottom of the European league.
IMA chief executive John Smith responded by saying the price reference grade (R3) used by the IFA accounts for only 7% of all slaughtered steers as the scale of quality grading cattle in Ireland is the lowest in Europe at 11% grading R3 or better.
He said when factory prices and premia are taken into account Irish producers are on a par with other EU states on total return."

He praised farmers for the very substantial increase in the number of Irish cattle slaughtered under 30 months of age this year.
Export market requirements switched to younger cattle last year due to the BSE scare.
“Clearly, beef producers are responding positively to the signals from the market place,” said Mr Treacy. But he made it clear that the Government is unhappy with the price signals coming back to farmers from processors.
He said the beef task force of some years ago concluded that producers are not adequately rewarded by the processing industry for the high quality beef demanded by the EU market. “There has been little improvement in the situation, since the publication of that report,” said Mr Treacy.
He said the appropriate price differentials for different qualities of cattle was primarily a matter for the industry.
“But the reality is that, if the beef industry wants to move up the value chain and, more importantly, if it wants to increase its presence on the European market, it is in the long-term interests of both beef producers and beef processors, to put in place a price structure, which rewards quality on a consistent sustainable basis,” said Mr Treacy. “Unless producers are rewarded for quality, the beef industry will not have an adequate supply of high quality beef to meet the constant demand."

The AIBP factories at Nenagh and Cahir, Dawn Meats factories at Ballaghadereen and Waterford, and Kepak at Clonee will be picketed from Tuesday evening until Friday afternoon in the fifth week of action.
IFA leader John Dillon said that farmers were determined to succeed in the cattle price campaign and claimed that over the past four weeks, the
action had held more than 40 per
animal, or 6 million, in farmers’ pockets as opposed to factory pockets.
Mr Dillon said that the supply of young cattle was tightening and with market returns remaining strong and set to rise in November, factories would be forced to pay higher prices.
IMA chief executive John Smith said that the escalation of the action by farmers in a week when processors were trying to put their best foot forward to sell Irish beef at SIAL was not in the interests of Irish farmers or the beef industry.
“The markets are weak, meat companies are losing money. Even during the course of the action, which was aimed at forcing up the price of cattle in an artificial manner, the prices have actually come down, and ultimately the market place has to determine what price is paid for cattle, not any concerted action by the IFA,” he said.
Official factory prices for last week, issued yesterday, confirmed a slight easing of prices, with a tightening of margins between factories, most of which paid close to quoted prices.
The average price for R3 bullocks at 231.8 c/kg was slightly down, as was the average for O3 grade at 223.6 c/kg. Heifer prices were generally in line with bullock prices."

Bord Bia has also been asked by Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association president Pat O'Rourke to convene an ""urgent, high-level meeting"" of farm organisations and meat processors to solve the dispute, now in its fifth week.
Some processors reduced the price for R grade bullocks to 229c/kg yesterday, while the price for over-age cattle dropped to 218-212c/kg for R/O grades.
IFA leader John Dillon confirmed last night that the planned protest at five meats plants, AIBP at Cahir and Nenagh, Dawn Meats at Waterford and Ballaghadereen, and Kepak at Clonee, would begin at 7pm and run until late afternoon on Friday.
No processing of cattle is expected to take place at these factories over the next three days.
Mr Dillon said he had offered to suspend the protest for negotiations as long as the factories agreed to hold current prices for three weeks.
The IMA, in a statement from chief executive John Smith, said: ""The price of cattle is a matter of negotiation
between the individual meat factory and the individual farmer, the Irish Meat Association does not buy cattle and will not be involved in negotiating cattle prices on a centralised basis on behalf of its members.""
CSO figures released yesterday show that there were 103,000 fewer cattle over two years old in the country at the end of June compared to the same time last year, which should indicate tighter supplies for the rest of the year than for the last quarter of 2001.
Supplies of cattle to the factories yesterday were strong, with a big increase in the number of over-age cattle."

According to ICSA (Irish Cattle and Sheepfarmers Association), U and R grade beef producers are ripped off to the tune of 15p/lb (42 cent per kg) and 3p/lb (8.4 cent per kg) respectively by factories.
“Even at today’s unacceptably low prices, U grade steers would be £1/lb (2.80/kg) if a proper price differential was applied between various grades of cattle. Likewise, R grade steers would make 86p/lb (2.41/kg) under a proper pricing structure”, said Mr Reilly.
He said, “Beef pricing policy is now at a crossroads, the main problem for specialist beef producers is the lack of price differential between the better and the poorer quality grades of cattle. The vested interests in the beef sector need to decide whether we want a pricing system, which rewards the better, or the poorer quality cattle”.
He was responding to last week’s European Commission figures, used by the Irish Meat Association (IMA) to show that only 11% of Irish steers grade R3 or better, the lowest proportion in Europe.
According to the IMA, our poorer grading cattle are heavily penalised in European markets. “In Ireland, cattle in the better grades cross-subsidise the poorer grades”, said the processors’ association, which repeated its condemnations of the continuing IFA cattle price protest.
“IFA misrepresents market reality, the grade profile of Irish cattle and the overall returns paid to farmers. The overall return on Irish steers is on a par with young bulls in France, Germany and Italy”, said the processors’ organisation.
But IFA President John Dillon said on Monday that cattle farmers would continue their protest this week at AIBP Cahir and Nenagh; Dawn Meats Grannagh and Ballaghadereen; and Kepak, Clonee."

It's the first of two weeks of a 'cooling period' in the IFA action over low prices for cattle.
Talks between farmers and processors on the price forward are already being underpinned by the IMA claim that ""protests over the past five weeks have done severe damage to the industry"", impeding their ability to service customers needs and restricting forward sales contracts, adding to industry difficulties.
They have again insisted negotiations on cattle prices can only take place between individual farmers and processor.
This leaves the IFA in a very difficult position as a negotiating body.
If numbers of finished cattle are back by 5,000 head per week average, as suggested by the CSO figures last week, over the coming weeks tighter supplies of cattle should secure higher returns for producers.
Supplies of cattle under 30 months are getting scarce, which should influence a rise in price.
But the bad weather will bring out whatever numbers are still in the system and this may lighten pressure on factories to pay more.
But there appears to be no shortage of over-age cattle ineligible for the UK market. They will have to find outlets in other, less remunerative markets.
Many producers have been holding onto these animals over August and September with the plentiful supply of grass and the good weather combining as a boost to increased weight gain. The gains compensate for some of the loss in thrive during the winter-like months of summer this year.
Factories have been discounting these animals by 2p-4p/lb, but producers hope the scarcity of young cattle will lift demand and prices on offer over the coming weeks."

Many were frustrated when they were told that the requirements for the week had been booked out and they could not be given a slaughter date. The price being offered for O grade cattle was similar to other factories at 224 cents/kg (80p/lb).
Quoted prices generally remained unchanged from last week at most factories when they re-opened after the holiday weekend and there were mixed reports as to the supply of young cattle while cattle over 30 months are very plentiful again this week.
The general price on offer for under 30 months cattle is 232-229 cents/kg (83p-82p/lb) for R's and 223 cents/kg (80p/lb) for O grade.
Some factories say that supplies are lighter this week, while most report that they are getting sufficient without any difficulty and some were booked up for the week by noon yesterday. There is plenty of cattle over 30 months available which is leading to downward pressure on prices. Supplies were strong for the early days last week, easing off in the second half of the week and concluding with a drop of 1,800 head in the steer kill for the week at 19,162 with the overall kill down 1,200 head at 37,521 head, which is 3,000 head more than for the same week last year.
There is still a big question as to the supply of cattle left in the system with the CSO figures last week indicating the throughput for the factories should be back on average by 5,000 head per week for the remainder of the year on the kill for the same period in 2001."

But rather than join critics of Burger King and McDonald’s Mr Ronay said he approved of the rest of their menu.
In particular he described the fries they sell as “some of the best in the country.”
His comments come at the end of a two-year contract to improve catering at motorway service areas operated by the Welcome Break chain.
Along with his team of inspectors Mr Ronay monitored the food and drink on offer to travellers, including a number of Burger King and McDonald’s franchises.
While praising the two companies for the quality of their salads, chicken and desserts, he added: “The beefburgers are between two nice rolls but the meat is inedible. They are terrible.
“The meat tastes like it comes from clapped-out cows but they can’t afford decent meat at the price they serve it at.
“If you take a piece of rubbish, wrap it up in tissue paper and add a pink bow it is still rubbish underneath.”
Mr Ronay and his team produced more than 5,000 reports over the past two years on the food and drink served in Welcome Break’s 40 motorway service areas.
About 1,500 different raw materials were initially vetted to ensure they were of good enough quality for the company’s main restaurants.
Along with better training schemes and reward programmes Mr Ronay says he is pleased with the changes.
“Having been a restaurateur for 25 years before publishing my guides it was most satisfying, after my years of criticism, actually to do something about the quality of motorway catering of at least one major operator,” said Mr Ronay.
Ian Tokelove, from the Food Commission pressure group which campaigns for wholesome food, questioned whether it was just the beef served by Burger King and McDonald’s that was “unhealthy.”
“Their food is very high in fat and salt, that is why it tastes good and what our bodies are programmed to like,” he said
Burger King said in a statement: “We pride ourselves on the high quality of beef used in our products.”
McDonald’s said: “All McDonald’s products are made from the highest quality ingredients and are produced in accordance with McDonald’s strict quality control standards.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10040810.html,2002-11-07 00:00:00,Beef industry renews call for better prices,"IFA president John Dillon said the key was the price paid by meat factories for cattle.
John O'Leary, Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association beef and cattle committee chairperson, also stressed that improved returns for beef farmers was the key to re-examination of the industry.
The renewed focus on cattle prices followed a procedural row in the Dáil.
Mr Dillon insisted that the economic reality was that livestock farmers needed a return to profitability.
""The prices paid by the Irish meat factories are the second lowest in
Europe,"" he said.
""Irish livestock farmers cannot survive when the meat factories set cattle prices at below the cost of production.
""That is how this autumn's dispute erupted. Livestock farmers cannot and will not be price-takers, if cattle prices are being forced below the cost of production.""
Mr Dillon stressed that Irish livestock farmers would respond to market
demands and had shown this.
He said the IFA would welcome any initiative by Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Minister Joe Walsh that would increase cattle prices and restore profitability to livestock farmers, who have the lowest incomes in Irish agriculture.
Mr O'Leary said a widening gap
between prices in cattle aged over and under 30 months, and a drop in the price of beef cows, was unacceptable and unjustified.
Farmers were seeing the price of their stock falling at a time when markets, generally, were improving, he said.
""The current beef price drops do nothing to instil confidence or trust between farmers and factories and they should be immediately reversed, as they are totally unjustified.""
Mr O'Leary said the ICMSA agreed with Minister Walsh that a major re-examination of the beef sector was required.
He said the Mid-Term Review provided the minister with an opportunity to seek improvements in the support policy for the beef sector and he must deliver for beef farmers.
Other proposals included objective grading of cattle and supply contracts targeting specific markets, and the ICMSA had long advocated this
approach, he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10100669.html,2002-11-08 00:00:00,"Consultative process with department worsens, say farmers","President John Dillon said policy announcements with serious impact on individual farmers' livelihoods have been made with inadequate or no prior consultation. Policy positions in some cases have been adopted when it should be clear to the department that these were not in the spirit of a partnership approach.
""There is rarely an acknowledgement by the department of the seriousness of the farm income situation, and comments from the minister seem to be mainly concerned with the off-farm income component of farm household earnings,"" he said.
Mr Dillon said the IFA wishes to take the opportunity of the negotiations on a new National Partnership Agreement to review the consultative process between the association and the Department of Agriculture in
particular. ""In the event that there is not a new agreement for reasons unrelated to the farming pillar issues, such as pay, IFA, based on its democratic mandate and regional and local structures, wishes to discuss the basis of future consultative arrangements in the spirit of partnership between the association and government departments."" Mr Dillon, speaking ahead of bilateral negotiations yesterday, said any new agreement would be a test of the political will of the Government to agree a balanced and equitable social partnership deal in which the interests of farm families would be properly respected.
""Against the background of the ever-widening income disparity between farmers and other economic sectors, IFA membership will require a balanced and equitable approach to the farming pillar as a requirement of participation in a new National Partnership Programme,"" he said. Mr Dillon said the level of income is the one true measure of comparison between the different sectors.
""As our starting-off point in the negotiations, IFA wishes to remind the Government and all the other parties of the facts in relation to income levels.
""Average pay in the private sector is 26,000. Average pay in the public sector is 37,000, but average farm
income is only 14,000, equivalent to 38% of average pay in the public sector,"" he said.
* Fine Gael deputy agriculture spokesman Tom Hayes, Tipperary South, who tried to raise the cattle price issue in the Dail, was formally suspended from the House following a procedural row.
Deputy Hayes said he had been trying to raise the concerns of beef producers and meat consumers who are, he claimed, getting a poor deal at the factory and shop counter respectively."

climate in which the price difference at factories between quality grades and poorer type animals is widening.
Supplies of cattle in the marts have been strong through the week with the winter weather driving out any stock that is not being housed. There has also been an increase of medium-quality cattle appearing in the sales rings.
There was a big sale of 1,450 head at Ennis yesterday where the quality lots sold well, but demand and prices for the plainer lots were noticeably easier than last week. There was good demand for the near-finished double
-punched animals which made up to 240 over /kg for the tops of the continentals. A lot of two Charolais 658kg sold for 895, a lot of four Charolais 642kg made 872 and two Belgian Blues 610kg sold for 820. The next run of continentals and Herefords sold from 70 over to 140 over.
In the single-punched ring the tops of the Continentals made from 250 over to 300 over with lighter animals ranging from 190 over to 230 over.
At Kilkenny Mart there was 850 head on offer. There was a definite easing of the trade for bullocks which will not qualify for the 21-month SBP in 2002 with prices back up to 15/head. The plain cattle were also an easier trade and the animals with poor grading potential coming from the high merit dairy herds are difficult to sell and well back in price. At the other end of the scale some exceptional prices were paid for quality lots with five single-punched Charolais 598kg selling for 1,015 and a Belgian Blue 578kg making 910.
The trade for forward heifers was improved by 10-20/head with beef lots making up to 240 over /kg. One Continental 540kg sold for 780 and a Limousin weighing 556kg made 760.
There was a good entry of quality cattle at Midleton Mart yesterday where the heavy bullocks sold from 85 over to 295 over and there was a good demand for a bigger entry of heifers with beef making from 40 over to 145 over and stores selling from 28 over to 80 over.
There was an improved shipping trade for weanling heifers at Athenry Mart where the shippers paid up to 120 over /kg.
However, they could not match the farmer trade which pushed the prices for the stronger lots of continental weanlings to a top price of 205 over /kg.
The trade for weanling bulls was
improved by up to 20/head ranging from 150 over to 380 over."

All factories are finding it more difficult to source young cattle this week. The availability of supply varies from region to region, but the overall tightening in numbers is now beginning to pinch at the factories as they head into the run-up to busy Christmas trade.
Prices for O grade young cattle have remained stable on 224c/kg (80p/lb).
A target of 252c/kg (90p/lb) is now being freely spoken of as achievable for R grade cattle under 30 months within the next 10 to 14 days as pressure for supplies increases with further decline in numbers available.
But producers must be very careful to check the ID cards to ensure that animals do not go over 30 months before slaughter.
All factories slaughtering older cattle are reporting the continuation of very strong supplies. The general price on offer this week is 213-207c/kg (76p-74p/lb) for R/O grades, but some producers were offered as low as 190c/kg (68p/lb) yesterday for O grade cattle over 30 months.
In the marts yesterday trade for single punched bullocks was improved at Bandon where they sold for up to 260 over with a similar size bullock sale to last week. Heifers met with improved trade with prices up 30/head. At Dungarvan the store bullock trade remained firm .

The Grouch Marks comment: “Just because I’m paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get me”, springs to mind.

At the most basic level, farmers are convinced that the Sheehy report missed the point, not deliberately or maliciously, but that it, nevertheless, missed the point.

Farmers suggest that perhaps the report looked at the wrong set of statistics. They continue to ask why it is that the price paid by the consumer in the supermarket is so high compared to the rate paid to the primary producer, or indeed, the margin enjoyed by the processors.
Is it the case that farmers and processors are being screwed by the multiples because they have a major hold over the processors in this country?
Experience has shown that those in other sectors have had margins eroded to a bare minimum because of their failure to stand up to the multiples.

This is a question that has been asked before and perhaps it ought to be investigated again, this time viewing both farmer and the processor as victims in this business.

All of the indications are now favourable for the young cattle, with a further hardening of prices expected to end in 90p/lb being realised within the near future, as demand outstrips supply in the lead into the Christmas trade.
The young cattle have been quite scarce this week, with most of the factories reporting a sharp fall-off in supplies. There are some exceptions, where supplies appear to be holding up, but that pattern is far from the general rule.
As a result, prices have hardened and 238 cents/kg (85p/lb) has been readily available and a bit more has been paid for good quality stock.
All of the indications suggest that this welcome trend for cattle farmers will lead prices upwards over the coming days, and it will not be very long until the 90p/lb barrier is broken for the under 20 months animals.
The date of birth, however, remains all-important, and farmers should very carefully ensure that the animals are marketed before they reach 30 months, to avoid a heavy price penalty, which is being strictly enforced this week.
That penalty is as much as 10p/lb for animals over 30 months.
The general run of prices on offer for the older cattle is 213 back to 207 cents/kg (76p to 74p/lb) for R/O graders, with some prices back to 190 cents/kg (68p/lb) being reported for O grade animals over 30 months.
There have been a few reports of stronger prices than those being quoted and paid for older cattle, but they are few and far between.
There is a good market for heavy cattle over 30 months at Galtee Meats but they must be heavy, and they must be good quality.
The prices for cows have slipped a few more cents this week. The trade for cows is weak and supplies have increased.
In the marts, the trade continued very strong for the single punched forward animals on Monday, with heavy punched out cattle showing an improved trade at Bleesington on Monday. Heifers were a stronger trade at Bandon on the same day. At Dungarvan, prices for beef and store heifers were improved by 20 or 30 per head on Monday."

About 300 farmer creditors are believed to be owed €3.5 million by the former owners of the plant placed in receivership last year and subsequently sold.
The IFA and ICMSA have been seeking the help of the new owners to establish a compensation fund for farmers left unpaid by the previous owners for cattle supplied.
One of the new owners, Micheal O'Shea, was reported last week as saying farmer creditors were looking for as much money as the place cost them, ""so at this stage I'd say we'll just cut our losses and sell it.""
ICMSA Beef and Cattle Committee chairman John O'Leary, who farms at Coolbane, Ballyhar, Killarney, said yesterday this slaughtering and meat processing facility was very important to Kerry farmers.
When the company went into receivership, ICMSA set three objectives - maximum payment for farmer creditors, re-opening slaughtering facilities and a change in the law to provide for preferential creditor status for farmers.
The sale of the premises to new owners provides an opportunity to re-open this facility as a going concern to service Kerry farmers.
""As much as any other farmer, I find it totally unacceptable that I am left with debts and that I have not been paid for cattle that I have supplied to the Tralee Beef and Lamb company.
""However, the time has come where we have to decide whether or not to facilitate the re-opening of the Tralee slaughtering facilities under new ownership.
""I believe that time has arrived and that the new owners should be facilitated in resuming slaughtering as soon as possible.
""The greater the number of outlets we have for our cattle, the more likelihood we will get a proper price,"" he said.
Mr O'Leary said the whole issue of money owing to farmer creditors for cattle supplied to the previous owners of Tralee Beef and Lamb company is a related but separate issue.
The new owners must make a contribution as part of a goodwill gesture to farmer suppliers who are owed money, he said.
Mr O'Leary said the ICMSA is pursuing outstanding issues regarding monies owed to farmers and the change in law to provide for preferential creditor status for farmers.
Dairygold milk suppliers, who have had 2p per gallon deducted for not having dairy hygiene certs from March 1998, will hold a public meeting at the Hibernian Hotel, Mallow, on Monday night next.

The price to be paid by farmers for the inferior quality winter fed conserved last summer is being calculated at up to double the normal bill for winter concentrates, for maintenance of their livestock and to achieve beef and milk production levels.
Tom O’Dwyer, Teagasc Specialist Advisor at Kildalton College, says, “With the poor weather of late May and early June leading to later harvesting of silage on most farms, it is not surprising that while yields are up, silage quality is lower than normal. Poorer quality silage will result in poorer animal performance or higher levels of supplementation for the same level of performance“.
He said that the early results from analysis of the 2002 first cut silage showed digestibility (as measured by DMD) lower by 4% and crude protein levels down by 2%, compared to the 2001 crop.
Results from Teagasc monitor farms show that DMD has dropped from 71.2 in 2001 to 68.3 for 2002 and dry matter is down from 23.2% to 19.7%, and crude protein levels 2% lower.
In general it is expected that a drop of up to 5% in DMD will be experienced in this year’s crop requiring an increase in concentrate feeding of 1.5 kg per head per day to make up the loss of feed value, adding about 11 per animal per month to feeding costs over the winter and spring.
Mr O’Dwyer says that in most cases, the crude protein level of the ration will have to be increased by 2% to compensate for the drop in crude protein in the silage.
Because of the expected wide variation in silage quality from one farm to another, silage analysis is being recommended to assess the quality and the concentrate supplementation necessary to maintain performance."

The increase in the kill of over 30 months cattle at low prices is continuing to mask the real prices which are being paid for young cattle.
Of some interest however is an analysis of four factories from the three largest groups in the country where only young cattle are being slaughtered.
This showed that last week the average for R/O grade showed that three of the four paid an average of less than 82p/lb with one factory recording an average of 83.3p/lb.
There was an increase of between one-third of a penny and 1p/lb showing in last weeks prices.
The highest average of the four factories was paid at the AIBP factory at Nenagh where a firm 85p/lb was paid for Rs and O grade prices ranged 80-81p/lb.
The average for heifers edged ahead of the bullocks last week by 2p/lb at 84p/lb for R3 with the highest factory average being paid by Liffey Meats, Ballyjamesduff at 89.4p/lb followed by Kepak at Clonee and Carrigans all paying an average of over 88p/lb. The average for O grade heifers was on a par with bullocks returns showing 78.8p/lb and 78.4p/lb respectively.
Meanwhile butchers lambs showed an increase of up to 3/head."

Irish Meat Association chief executive John Smith told the Macra na Feirme's conference in Kilkenny that the Government and EU were pulling back in terms of costs subsidisation.
During a head-to-head debate with the IFA on cattle prices, he said increased costs must be the first issue faced in the new year.
This followed the Government decision to withdraw subsidies on BSE testing of steers and heifers of over 30 months, the dilution of its contribution towards waste disposal costs and the doubling of the disease eradication levies from the beginning of January.
These will add major costs in the post-Christmas period, warned Mr Smith.
He said any dilution of Government subvention and any increase in charges will hit farmer returns. He said the returns from the international marketplace, where 90% of Irish beef is sold, determines what meat factories here can pay for cattle. He also confirmed rationalisation of the meat processing industry is being actively discussed.
IFA National Livestock Committee chairman Derek Deane said a beef summit meeting called by Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh for early next month must address the critical issue of viable cattle prices.
He said Mr Walsh and the beef processing sector must realise Irish livestock farmers cannot survive financially with cattle prices at the bottom of the EU price league.
Mr Deane said the IFA had tackled the meat factories directly on the cattle price issue this autumn and successfully prevented a total price collapse.
He said Mr Walsh must also address the problems of market access and competitiveness, in terms of efficiency, and of costs, which were way too high, particularly in the area of veterinary and meat inspection.
Mr Walsh told the conference he had called a meeting of the main players in the beef industry to seek some way of avoiding the difficulties between processors and their suppliers.
Without trust there was no possibility of the industry developing, he said"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10112720.html,2002-11-26 00:00:00,Lively trade for young cattle at factories,"But just as the 90p/lb could be foreseen approaching two weeks ago, the signs are that the peak of the current high prices may be reached over the next 10 days, and within a fortnight may be more difficult to secure.
Preparations for the kill for the buoyant Christmas beef trade are expected to be well under way before the end of this week and likely to peak during the early days of next week, when producers can expect to be on the receiving end of the highest prices for the season for young cattle.
Quotes for the young cattle increased at all factories yesterday by 2p-4p/lb with quotes for R grade ranging from 90p/lb to 87p/lb. In
reality it was hard for factories to buy many for less than 90p/lb and some were induced into paying more for nice lots and dependent on supply and demand in a particular area.
Quotes for older cattle which are still plentiful have improved by up to 4p/lb with quotes of 80p-78p/lb freely on offer and a bit more being negotiated for individual deals. The total kill for last week was almost similar to the previous week, but the number of bullocks dropped by 1,500 head to 17,979 last week, 5,000 head lower than the same week last year.
In the marts yesterday cattle numbers eased off at all centres and plainer cattle are becoming more difficult to sell in some areas of the country. But the demand and prices for quality stock are being maintained."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-10071252.html,2002-11-28 00:00:00,"EU is beef industry’s best hope, says Deane","Derek Deane was elected to head the Beef Meat Standing Group of the Commission’s Livestock Products Standing Group in Brussels.
The group, which advises the Commission on all aspects of the beef and livestock market and on European beef policy, includes producer, processor and consumer representatives from across the European Community.
Mr Deane, the IFA livestock committee chairman from Hacketstown, Co Carlow, said the European beef market has made an exceptional recovery from the BSE crisis of November 2000 and has now returned to balance.
“We should now be coming into a period of stable consumption and balanced market providing stronger prices,” he said.
Mr Deane said the recent European agreement on the CAP budget has taken the impetus out of the Fischler mid-term review proposals.
“Modulation is now off the table and the large majority of member state Governments are strongly opposed to decoupling,” he said.
Mr Deane said it is now emerging across member states, the significant damage decoupling would inflict on European beef meat production and particularly quality beef production from the suckler herd.
He said he will vigorously defend and promote the European beef sector in his role as Chairman of the EU Commission Standing Group.
“The future of the EU beef sector is dependent on viable incomes for producers through a combination of high product prices and direct payments,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10057589.html,2002-11-28 00:00:00,Prices on course for Christmas peak,"Under 30 months cattle have been quoted at prices ranging from over 91p/lb back to 87p/lb for R grade and, in reality, it has been hard for factories to purchase quality stock for much less than 90p/lb.
But, even if the supplies are scarce and prices high, the factories are also keeping their kill closely in line with actual requirements, because they maintain that the market is getting too hot for them.
Not so, claimed IFA Livestock Committee Chairman, Derek Deane following his election this week as chairman of the important EU Commission Standing Group on Beef Meat of the Advisory Committee on Livestock in Brussels.
He said that the European market has made an exceptional recovery from the BSE crisis and has now returned to balance.
“We should now see a period of stable consumption and balanced market providing stronger prices.”
“At the moment, the average EU male price is E2.72/kg, equivalent to 101p/lb including VAT”.
He admitted that the challenges facing the beef sector in the EU are very significant, but the situation is not without opportunity.
Some of that opportunity for producers with young cattle will arise over the next 10 days, as factories procure supplies for the Christmas trade, generating demand which should bring about a seasonal price the peak, if supplies remain at current levels.
The improved prices are bringing finished cattle out of premia retention and onto the market at the first opportunity, but given the calving pattern of the national herd, the numbers of under 30 months cattle available for slaughter in December will remain low.
Although supplies of older cattle remain high, quoted prices have advanced by up to 4p/lb this week, with factories offering 80p and back to 78p/lb for R/O grades, which is almost as much as some of the young cattle were making a few weeks ago.
Prices for cull cows are unchanged, with the weekly kill running at 9,000 to 10,000 head.
The total kill last week was similar to the previous week at over 40,000.
But the number of steers was down by 1,500 head, which was 5,000 head less than for the same week last year.
In the marts, the numbers of cattle on offer has dropped this week.
Prices have remained firm for the quality cattle, particularly the forward animals with a premium, but plainer lots are becoming more difficult to sell at lower prices."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10101592.html,2002-12-02 00:00:00,Beef plants to negotiate large scale voluntary closure deals,"It was reported yesterday that large scale closures will be agreed in a move that will reduce the capacity of the suffering industry by 40%.
A newspaper report said that while estimates of the number of plants to close varied, some sources said that as many as 15 out of the 30 plants nationwide could shut down.
The closures are expected to be agreed at a meeting of the Beef Industry Development Society next Monday (December 9). The organisation was set up by the beef industry to manage output by closing plants.
Factory owners who agree to close their factories will receive compensation payments from those who are staying in business. The remaining factories stand to make increased profits because of the overall reduction in capacity and the compensation has been worked out on this basis.
The Government has been asking the beef industry to approve a rationalisation plan since the publication of the McKinsey consultants’ report four years ago, but some beef plants have threatened to pull out because so little progress had been made.
Enterprise Ireland, which is handling the plan, said the first round of closures have already been agreed and would be finalised on December 9.
Each plant owner has engaged in individual negotiations and figures have been agreed for them to leave the industry under “a range of formulas”, according to Enterprise Ireland.
However, the state body insisted no individual facility was being targeted in the closure deal. “It is all done on an voluntary basis,” a spokesman said.
Farmers have recently been engaged in massive protests at beef plants around the country in a bid to highlight what they say are the poor prices they have been receiving for beef.
An IFA protest in 2000 shut down beef plants for three weeks and resulted in the farmers body being landed with £750,000 in court costs.
The farmers’ leaders sought a price of 2.52/kg (90p/lb) for their beef, but prices are currently running at around £2.30/kg (85p/lb).
Farmers also complained about failure by the industry to promote the product properly.
In a recent address to a conference in Limerick, Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh fired a warning at both the farmers and the factory owners.
He said that, regardless of the rights and wrongs of the situation, any sector that was subject to ongoing disputes between producer and processor needed to “seriously examine itself”."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10122724.html,2002-12-03 00:00:00,Easier tone to beef trade at the factories,"Producers who were in a position to sell last week and took advantage of the strong demand and higher prices are counting the benefits which they would not have been able to secure for the same cattle yesterday at the factories.
It would have been the exception rather than anything remotely near the rule to secure over 90p/lb yesterday for R grade animals under 30 months.
That was the price paid for a considerable number of cattle last week.
The factory quotes for the young cattle has slipped up to 2p/lb at the top end of the spectrum with 88p-87p/lb the general run of offers for Rs and O grade at 84p-83p/lb with reports suggesting that even for quality R grade cattle it would have been difficult to better a flat price of 88p-89p/lb.
Some factories, clearly not too interested in supplies of young cattle, quoted back to 85p-80p/lb for R/O grades and were making no secret of the fact that they were not anxious for cattle. Some factories are still killing for their Christmas orders this week, which should ensure prices will not slip any further until requirements are met.
Factories report that it is not as difficult to get supplies of young cattle.
More are coming out of retention and there is quite a bit for forward booking of cattle for the next two weeks with the factories, as producers are anxious to move out as soon as the premia retention expires and this is going to take more pressure off the factories for supplies for the remaining weeks before Christmas, when
requirements will be low.
Prices for the older cattle have also slipped back this week.
They are generally being quoted at 78p-76p/lb for R/O grades, a drop of 2p/lb. Supplies of over 30 months cattle continue to be very plentiful."

Rationalisation was not on the agenda for the meeting. It focused mainly on markets, with Bord Bia chief executive Michael Duffy outlining a five-year strategy to significantly increase exports to the Continent, and to target the upper end of the market.
However, six unidentified meat factories, three large and three small, are reportedly prepared to close in long-sought moves to rationalise the industry.
The BIDS is working closely with Enterprise Ireland to facilitate implementation of recommendations in the McKinsey Report and the Government Beef Industry Task Force.
These called for a major rationalisation, among other things, in order to underpin future viability of beef
production and processing in Ireland.
The BIDS, formed by the beef industry, said substantial progress has been made on proposals for funding an exit mechanism for those wishing to leave the sector.
These proposals will be referred to the Competition Authority. The work to achieve agreement on a rationalisation plan is ongoing.
John Smith, Chief Executive, IMA last night said farmers and factories must work together to address the many challenges ahead.
“Confrontation of the type experienced in October can be very damaging for producers and processors alike. The returns from the international marketplace, where 90% of our beef is sold, determine the prices which meat factories can pay for cattle. Accepting that reality, all parties must work together to produce the type of product the market is looking for and to remove the obstacles which are
impeding our access to the better priced markets,” he said.
IFA President John Dillon said lifting Irish cattle prices off the bottom of the EU price league towards the EU average price of 2.82/kg (£1/lb) must be an integral part of any plan to rationalise the beef processing sector.
Farmers have real concerns following recent media reports suggesting a concentration in the beef processing sector through rationalisation will enable the industry to manage output and therefore prices.
The Government and State Bodies such as Enterprise Ireland who are actively supporting the beef industry rationalisation plan must recognise that cattle prices are the only real measurement of performance in the beef
sector, he said.
Minister Walsh has already made it clear that some way must be found of avoiding the recurring difficulties between processors and their suppliers. Without trust there was no possibility of the industry fully developing into the future.
Regarding last evening’s special meeting, he said if they could get a better shared understanding of the market conditions and the factors which are influencing the situation, then an important first step will have been achieved."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10119648.html,2002-12-12 00:00:00,Rationalisation is likely,"On the marketing side, there is limited scope, in an industry where most of the big market decisions are made far away from Ireland.
That was clear to government, processors and farmers last week, all of whom must have been looking over their shoulders at a new threat to their sales in Russia.
Russia has become Europe's largest livestock export market. Now, Moscow's threat to introduce import tariffs on meat imports and limit them by quota is a stark illustration of the short life cycle of artificial markets which depend more on export refunds and politicians than on the quality of the product.
The market manipulators in Brussels allowed huge tonnages of Russian grain into the EU this year. After a predictable backlash from the grain industry in Europe, Brussels has come up with a new recipe, imposing import tariffs on much of the Russian grain.
Moscow has hit back with proposals to impose tariffs and quotas on the huge tonnages of meat it imports from around the world.
Once again, our beef industry's marketing departments must try to predict the vagaries of politicians and the World Trade Organisation; worlds away from food industries in the real world which develop the products which consumers want to eat, and set about producing them to the highest quality standards and distributing them in itself, a challenging enough project.
Beef processors too must get their research and development, quality and distribution right and then all their work can be undone by a diplomatic row over tariffs or veterinary standards.
There are also real world shocks like BSE or foot and mouth. But, if the Egyptians really liked Irish beef, would their markets still be closed a couple of years after the BSE scare. Their markets are closed primarily because EU export refunds are not large enough to deliver Irish cattle at knockdown world prices.
We have grown to depend on export refunds not on consumers or retailers impressed by our quality for half of our beef sales.
That leaves limited scope for some strategies aired this week, such as increasing exports to the Continent and targeting the upper end of the market.
Rationalisation, on the other hand, is a winning bet for the processing industry. Factories handling bigger throughputs are better able to withstand the inevitable shocks in Ireland's unreliable beef markets.
Rationalisation can also be a winner for farmers. Processors have told farmers they cannot take on additional costs for waste disposal and BSE testing, and will have to pass them back to farmers.
But if factory closures are Government aided in a national rationalisation programme, one of the conditions should be that processors continue to absorb any increases in processing costs.
In return, farmers will be only too happy to participate in cattle quality improvement programmes and mechanical grading, now that factories say they are happy to pay for quality."

John Dillon, president, said that while bad weather contributed to the problem, the greatest cause of the decline in farm incomes is low prices in 2002 for the main products, cattle, milk, pigmeat and cereals.
“For beef, cereals and sheep, the sectors that have been subject to CAP reform in the past decade, Irish farmers are now in the unacceptable situation that product prices have been pushed down to levels far below the cost of production,” he said.
The Department of Agriculture and Food said a combination of bad weather, a drop in beef slaughterings from their high levels in 2001 and lower market returns in areas such as dairying, resulted in an overall income decline for the year, following two very good years.
A Department of Agriculture and Food spokesman said Minister Joe Walsh had recognised at an early stage the warning signs with regard to farm incomes and instigated a series of actions within his Department and at EU level to help alleviate the situation.
The fact that the very pessimistic predictions of the middle of the year did not come to pass was a testimony to the efficacy of these measures, he said."

Sources in the British beef industry now fear for their future, , as imports of beef approach record levels.
“If we reduce production further we will lose control of prices,” said Robert Forster, chief executive of the National Beef Association.
“We have to face the fact that if we wish to maintain consumption, then imports will be a factor.”
“The real threat is if producers reduce output much further, then there is a danger of losing control of our market, very much along the lines of what has happened in the pig industry”.
Mr Forster told The Scotsman newspaper: “There has been a sharp decline in production over the last two years, which of course is partly due to foot-and-mouth.”
The UK’s imports of beef have risen 10% from 2001, but are up a massive 39% from 2000.
Neil Stoddart, president of the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers, said: “We are seeing an alarming decline in production and there is a real danger of losing critical mass, especially in Scotland where we are reliant on the suckler herd”.
“We need a kill of 500,000 cattle in Scotland. This year, it is going to be below 450,000 head.”
Ireland is the leading source of UK beef imports, with 75,553 tonnes in the first eight months of this year.
Plentiful supply of cattle in Ireland and low prices relative to UK values make Irish beef highly attractive for UK supermarket buyers, but for the catering trade.
From mainland Europe, the UK took 26,000 tonnes in the first eight months of this year, 34,000 tonnes from South America (nearly a threefold increase), and 3,500 tonnes from Australia."

Cattle prices are the only real measurement of performance in the beef sector, said John Dillon.
Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh welcomed new efforts by processors to break into the Egyptian market.
He and his Department will examine points identified at the summit meeting, and a further meeting will be convened in the New Year.
Processors, represented by Irish Meat Association chief executive John Smith, warned that CAP review proposals threaten the viability of beef-processing in Ireland.
This year was one of the worst for the industry. It could not take on additional costs, and remain competitive, said Mr Smith.
Since 1995, increased slaughtering and deboning costs and falling returns from offal totalled more than 150 per head.
If the Government proceeded to reduce State subventions for waste disposal costs and BSE testing, the additional costs would have to be passed back to the farmer.
“Getting better access to EU markets and a re-opening of third country markets to Irish beef will be essential in order to cope with the additional 130,000 cattle which the industry is expecting to process next year”, added Mr Smith.
He said meat factories are trying to encourage better quality cattle with differentiated prices based on the age of cattle and grades.
He said Teagasc should focus research on feed systems to help farmers finish cattle under 30 months, with better conformation and reduced fat, in line with market requirements.
“Farmers and factories must work together to address the many challenges that lie ahead”.
“Confrontation of the type experienced in October can be very damaging for producers and processors alike”, said Mr Smith."

Supplies of young cattle appeared to be lighter than had been expected for the final week before the Christmas holidays and factories were having to pay a little more in certain areas. However, the pattern was not uniform across the country.
Some producers may be holding back on young cattle in the expectation of stronger prices after Christmas and others, who wanted to be out before the holidays, had moved ahead to avoid being unable to get the cattle killed this week the result was a light run of cattle yesterday.
Some are booked in for later in the week the first day after retention and a number of the factories were anxious to get cattle for the earlier days this week and have processing completed for Christmas.
Up to 249c/kg (89p/lb) was quoted at Exel Meats yesterday for underage R grade cattle with a drop of 14c/kg (5p/lb) for O grade.
The general run was around 243c/kg (87p/lb) for Rs and 235c/kg (84p/lb) for O grade but flat prices above the rates were paid for quality cattle where demand warranted in direct deals between producers and factories.
The trade for the older cattle varied from factories not taking in any over 30 months to those who were paying prices improved by up to 11c/kg (4p/lb) on last week.
The best price on offer was at Galtee Meats, where quality overage cattle over 400kg were being quoted at 229c/kg (82p/lb), but they were not taking any lighter animals over 30 months for this week's kill.
Fair Oak at Clonmel improved the quote for the older cattle to 224-218c/kg (80p-78p/lb) for R/O grade with an interest in getting fairly strong supplies for the week.
In Britain, the retail trade has been continuing well but the wholesale trade and supplies to catering are disappointing and are running below normal for the season.
In the marts yesterday there was a good steady trade for smaller supplies of cattle on offer at the final Monday sales for the year. It also marked the last of the Monday cattle sales at Bandon Mart where the weekly cattle sale moves to Thursday with the first cattle sale of 2003 taking place on Thursday, January 9.
Calf sales will continue to be held on Mondays in the New Year.
The forward bullocks with a premia made from 200 to 310 over yesterday and beef and butchers heifers made from 70 to 120 over.
Trade at Kilmallock was also strong. Forward single-punched bullocks made up to 360 over /kg and heavy heifers sold for up to 70 over."

Up to 249 cents/kg (89p/lb) was available for R grade cattle under 30 months this week and some producers managed to get close to the same prices as a flat rate for quality cattle, where the demand exceeded the available supply.
Most of the factories quoted 235 cents/kg (84p/lb) for O grade cattle under 30 months this week, similar to last week.
Most factories had some cattle booked in advance for this week’s kill by producers who had planned to move at the first opportunity after clearing the premia retention.
The impact of this appears to have been a reaction by other producers to move also, rather than be left with cattle which they had not planned to keep over the Christmas. At the same time, others are looking hopefully at the early weeks of the New Year, in anticipation of a rise in price and are holding back young cattle.
There was an excellent trade after Christmas last year for beef, but there is no guarantee that the same will happen this year.
A lot will depend on the supply and demand, which we cannot predict with certainty.
The retail trade in Britain has been very strong over the past week, while the market in the wholesale sector has been described as disappointing and orders from the catering industry have also been lighter than hoped for.
As always, there is stiff competition from other imports, particularly supplies from South America.
In contrast, a sharp rise in demand for Irish beef has been experienced in Italy over the past week, which is in keeping with the pattern for the trade prior to Christmas. The demand has been matched by a small increase in price.
Although the trade for supplies to Russia has eased off, there is a good demand for over-age cattle at some of the factories this week, at improved prices.
Up to 224 cents/kg (80p/lb) has been quoted for over age R grade cattle, an increase of 11 cents/kg (4p/lb) over last week. Cow prices remain unchanged.
As this is the final edition for 2002, may I take the opportunity to wish all readers a very happy Christmas and prosperity in 2003."

Local farmer Michael Walsh expressed amazement at the surprise closure.
Plant owner Michael Beahan, who owns a second meat plant in Bagenalstown, said he intends to be a long-term player in the beef sector in Ireland.
However, that does not mean he will be running two plants, farmer suppliers were quick to point out last night.
As fears grow that the Clonmel area is to face a further 100 job losses, the Fine Gael deputy spokesman on agriculture, Tom Hayes, called on Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh, and the owners of Fair Oaks to clarify the situation in Clonmel.
Fair Oaks said it lost money in January/February last year by keeping two plants open. By shutting Clonmel temporarily it hopes to avoid those losses at this time of the year.
Farmer suppliers are sceptical about this, maintaining it will never reopen as they face another serious threat to their livelihoods.
Farmers say the site is a prime property location that could be sold for housing development while they face the loss of a plant that has been substantially modernised in recent years.
It is understood to be worth several million euro as a highly-prized development site in the town.
Another industry source described the whole process as “nothing short of sinister.”
This announcement came the day farmers took to the streets to protest their loss of income. Now they face further pressure if competition is about to be taken out of a market that many regard to be a cartel.
If plants are taken out of operation, then farmers would have no hope of a fair price ever again, warned one angry supplier, who regards the entire Enterprise Ireland rationalisation move to be anti-competitive and another move to further downgrade farm incomes.
The loss of marts due to the edict from the Department of Agriculture that they had to go electronic is a further blow to the farming community which many regard to be a payback for the last blockade of the meat plants.
In response to the growing fears about the situation in Clonmel, Fine Gael Tipperary South TD, Tom Hayes, called on the owners of the Fair Oaks plant and the Minister for Agriculture to immediately issue a statement on the future of the factory, in order to put to bed suspicions and to allay workers’ fears.
“The long-term commitment of the company to its future in Clonmel is now in serious doubt,” he said.
“Rumours over the past number of weeks that the company would be axed under an agreement with the meat factories and the Minister for Agriculture have been circulating in the area,” he said."

But unlike the start of 2002, the higher prices do not appear to have carried over to the trade this week, as more cattle became available to the processors.
Producers received the early December prices for supplies last week when an average of almost 90p/lb was paid for R3 heifers - and more by the top-paying factories - and R3 bullocks averaged 87p/lb, with some factories paying up to 90p/lb.
The kill for the week was 17,859 head, down 2,000 head on the same week last year, and the steers accounted for 8,389, which was slightly lower than last year.
The AIBP group paid strong prices across their factories for R3 bullocks with the factory averages ranging from 90p/lb at Bandon to almost the same price at Cahir and averages of over 88p/lb at Nenagh and Waterford, with the remaining factories coming in close behind.
Dawn paid an average of 89p/lb at Midleton and a fraction under 88p/lb at Ballaghadereen and Waterford for the R3 Bullocks, with a similar price being averaged at Kepak at Watergrasshill.
The average of all factories was 87p/lb, with prices ranging from 90p/lb to 80p/lb which was clearly for over-age cattle. The cow trade was sharper all round with prices improved by up to 5p/lb, a trend which has continued in the trade for this week, as demand remains strong. The highest average was paid by Dawn Meats, Waterford at 62p/lb for 04 grade cows.
Fair Oak at Bagenalstown paid a strong price of over 60p/lb for O5 grade and Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff were also strong on price for O grade cows.
There is an improvement in the market for cows and good cows in particular are in keen demand."

At the moment farmers were only getting whatever price was on offer from the cartels so they were operating in an artificial marketplace, he said.
Leading milk co-ops have been fixing prices for years, an RTÉ Prime Time investigation claimed last month.
“The farmers are attacking the wrong target. The whole agri-business sector needs to be hammered by the Competition Authority as it is riven with cartels. Cartels cause severe damage to the economy and add to inflation. Nobody benefits from the operation of cartels,” Mr Hobbs said.
As the nationwide protest by farmers entered its third day with up to 2,000 tractors taking to the roads, Opposition parties criticised FF backbenchers for squabbling publicly over the demonstration.
Former Junior Agriculture Minister Ned O’Keeffe backed his farming colleagues stating that agriculture was in crisis and many farmers were living in poverty. The Cork East TD said the Government should defer extra costs imposed on farmers But FF Dublin South-Central TD Seán Ardagh said the farmers should abandon their protest He said farmers had done well in recent years and should not strangle the city.
Labour agriculture spokesperson Mary Upton said the split among FF backbenchers did nothing to solve the crisis and they should lobby the Minister for Agriculture to intervene and negotiate with farmers.
Socialist Party TD Joe Higgins said Mr Ardagh was engaging in a cynical attempt to take attention away from his Government’s programme of cuts and extra charges which hit rural and working class communities.
Scheduled to enter Dublin tomorrow, tractorcades will travel from: Arklow to Bray, Kilkenny to Carlow to Naas, Durrow and Mountrath to Portlaoise, Kilbeggan and Edgeworthstown along the N2, Cavan to Dunshaughlin, and Ardee/Ashbourne/ Castlebellingham towards Swords."

But he warned their patience with Government neglect was at breaking point. He said there was a real income crisis in farming Unless the Government has turned its back on agriculture there will have to be concrete evidence of a meaningful plan for the way forward and an urgent response to the crisis,” he said.
Mr Dillon said the IFA has been seeking a response from Government over the last six months to key demands including:
Acknowledgement of the true income situation in farming and a clear statement of strategy on the future of family farming in Ireland.
Delivery by the minister at Brussels level of stronger market management to raise CAP product prices (milk, beef, grain) and the effective re-opening of export markets.
Reversal of 2003 estimates-budget cuts, including those in breach of earlier agreements with IFA, such as the doubling of disease levies, and the removal of rollover relief on CPO lands.
Implementation of pre-election Government commitments including those on Disadvantaged Areas. No tampering with third-level education grant assessment.
An increase in the flat rate VAT refund to compensate for the increase in the low VAT rate to 13.5%.
A proper agri-environmental package including agreement with the Department of Environment on the Nitrates Directive implementation.
An improved REPS scheme based on original National Development Plan funding allocation.
A more vigorous and effective defence of Irish agriculture by the Government in the upcoming EU negotiations on WTO and CAP Reform. A structural reform package to enable full-time commercial farming to develop including implementation of IFA’s proposal on land leasing.
A commitment to restore the funding levels for agriculture and rural development in the NDP, funding key measures including REPS, On-Farm Investment and Forestry.
Reduction in bureaucracy and red tape, including use of computerised systems to minimise paper work and inspections.
Renegotiation of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designation procedures, compensation and realistic stocking levels in commonages.
Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh, speaking on RTÉ television news last night, said he had no difficulty doing business with the IFA and farmers.
He said Mr Dillon is a robust advocate for farmers and their issues and he had found him to be one of the most effective farm leaders in recent times.
Mr Walsh said he had no difficulty, either personally or in negotiation, with John Dillon and his senior representatives.
Mr Walsh said farmers have made a strong case and have come out in great numbers.
The Government recognised the problems of 2002 as far back as last May, when it took corrective action to alleviate the worst aspects of the difficult weather and the weak markets."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10066581.html,2003-01-15 00:00:00,31.4% increase in beef exports as commercial markets recover,"The recovery in commercial markets for beef was outlined by Bord Bia in its annual review and outlook
published yesterday.
It was combined with the absence of any market support schemes, which in 2001 accounted for 160,000 tonnes of Irish beef production. The recovery resulted in the volume of beef exports increasing by 29% to reach 445,000 tonnes for the year as a whole.
Britain remained the principal market for beef during 2002, as increased consumption levels resulted in a
further 5% increase in their overall beef import requirement.
Bord Bia expects beef to maintain its strong presence in that market, despite a recent call by Prince Charles on consumers there to buy British product. Exports to continental EU markets recovered by more than 50%, while shipments to international markets were almost 70% higher.
Exports of live animals increased considerably in 2002. The sector saw an increase of 81% to 105 million. The key factor in growth was the recovery in the Lebanese market and increased exports to Northern Ireland and the continent. Bord Bia chief executive Michael Duffy said the return to a better balanced EU beef market is expected to continue as consumption edges back to pre-BSE levels.
However, the anticipated increase in volumes being imported from South America, combined with a more active release of intervention beef onto the market, is expected to result in a competitive EU beef market in 2003.
This was reflected in the EU Commission's latest price forecasts for next year, which are predicting very little upward movement, leaving male cattle prices some 6% below pre-BSE levels.
An anticipated increase of 8% in Irish export cattle supplies during 2003 is expected to result in 40,000 tonnes more beef being available to export."

The average for R3 bullocks was 1p/lb higher and the average for R3 heifers was higher by 0.5p/lb with the pattern on prices somewhat similar for O3 grades in both sexes.

Tighter supplies are underpinning the prices and given that supplies continued tight this week the outcome for the week should show the trade being maintained firm or a further slight improvement.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10122212.html,2003-01-22 00:00:00,BSE test cost transfer delayed,"The Enfer test is presently required to be carried out on all carcasses of animals over 30 months being slaughtered for the food chain, so as to confirm no presence of BSE. The cost of carrying out the test is currently at 23/head.
As part of the restriction on expenditure in farming by the Department of Agriculture, the cost of the test, which has been paid for by the department since it was introduced, was scheduled to transfer to factory/producer from early this month.
The Department of Agriculture will continue to pay for the carrying out of the test on cows slaughtered, and it is understood that working out the procedures for differentiating between heifers and cows at factory level has delayed the transfer.
However the Department of Agriculture has confirmed that the transfer is still going ahead and will take place within a few weeks. Factories are expected to pass it on directly to producers as an additional levy on the older cattle rather than adjust the price being paid to take account of the additional cost amounting to about 3p/lb.
Either way, it will have a direct impact on bullocks and heifers over 30 months going through the processing plants.
Presently, the number of overage cattle have reduced to a trickle and it is felt that the impact overall will not be enormous.
However, unless the pattern of production changes considerably to a much higher percentage of animals being slaughtered at a younger age, it will reduce returns significantly for the peak autumn kill and will have a knock-on effect on the plainer cattle going through the marts which are unlikely to be finished to beef at under 30 months.
The flavour of the week in the marts so far has been the forward store heifers and cows, both of which are meeting with a very strong trade.
Heifer prices were improved by 20/head at Athenry Mart yesterday where the heavy heifers made up to 245 over /kg one Charolais 515kg sold for 760 and a Limousin at 395kg made 605 in very strong demand with plenty of customers present. There was also a strong trade for cows, some of which made up to 65 over.
The store heifers at Fermoy Mart made up to 190 over /kg with a very good trade for the quality heifer.
At Ennis Mart, where there was a big sale of 640 weanling/yearlings, exporters dominated to a great extend for the middle run of heifers at 100-150 over.
However, they were outbid by farmers for the top quality heifers which made up to 190 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10040212.html,2003-01-22 00:00:00,Farmers fear EU proposals will erode incomes,"It is expected to include decoupling the separation of farm subsidy payments from production and some form of modulation diverting a percentage of farm subsidies, possibly to rural development.
The radical changes to the Common Agricultural Policy would drastically alter the way Europe's eight million farmers go about their business.
But the moves are likely to provoke furious debate that will not be confined to the EU but will extend across the frontiers of world trade.
Most of the Irish farm lobby fear the proposals will adversely impact on their members through production cuts, especially in beef, and knock-on effects on the rural economy.
But the package is also likely to include some enticements for the country's 130,000 farmers including greater transparency and less of the EU's bewildering red tape.
The CAP was created some 40 years ago to encourage a constant supply of home-produced food in post-war Europe by providing farm price supports.
By the early 1990s, Europe's consumers had a constant supply of high-quality food at reasonable prices and its farmers were so successful they had become significant food exporters on world markets.
The average Irish farmer, for example, produced enough food to feed seven people in the early 1950s. By the 1990s, he was producing enough to feed 50 people.
Prior to 1992, farm product prices were supported through price and market support mechanisms, such as the removal of surplus product off the market and restricting imports from outside the EU.
In 1992, the method of supporting EU agriculture was changed with reforms of the CAP and ongoing free trade pressures.
European farmers were asked to produce less, get paid less for what they produce, import more food from outside the community and in return receive direct compensatory payments from the EU.
In addition, quotas on the production of most farm produce were introduced over the years to curtail production and balance market demands.
Direct payments to Irish farmers, which totalled €1.6 billion last year, are seen as being crucial to their economic survival as food producers.
The ""cheques in the post"" are also vital to the well being of rural Ireland, where the money is spent, and where the agri-food industry supports over 340,000 jobs.
But the CAP, with its direct payments system as a cornerstone, has come under pressure as the EU expands and world trade talks resume.
Critics of the system, which this year will gobble up almost €45 billion, nearly half the entire EU budget, say it distorts world trade and helps to keep people poor in the developing world by subsidising European farmers.
But supporters maintain it has helped protect farmers in Europe from the most severe fluctuations in supply and prices and has provided quality food to consumers.
Europe today, however, is more concerned about food safety, animal welfare and the environment than food shortages, which was the case when the EU set up the CAP.
Against this background, Dr Fischler, a wily Austrian, is set to embark on his farmyard revolution, which is expected to represent a whole shift in philosophy.
It is also geared towards putting the EU on the high moral ground in world trade talks, particularly with the US, which spends billions each year in domestic farm subsidies.
Dr Fischler's proposals are expected to cut the link between direct payments to farmers and production levels, which CAP critics argue has encouraged wasteful over-production.
Leaks suggest that a single annual payment that each farmer would receive in future would be linked to good environmental and other practices.
The payment would be related to past income in an historical reference period, which some sources believe will be 2000, 2001 and 2002.
Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh yesterday launched a study by the FAPRI-Ireland Partnership, which includes Teagasc and universities, on the likely impact on Irish agriculture of decoupling direct payments.
The study, which the Minister requested, said Irish beef and sheep production would be likely to decline by 12% by 2010 as a result of a reduction in suckler cow and ewe numbers.
Cattle prices would fall by 8% next year and 5% by 2005 as suckler cows are destocked but would then recover at a lower level of production and would be 8% above the baseline by 2010.
Sheep prices would fall by 15% initially, but would then recover and would be 21% above the baseline in seven years time.
Ireland's suckler cow herd would decline by 30% and although beef exports would fall by 12% by 2010, the study predicts there would be more likelihood of finding EU markets.
Cereal production would fall by around 4% but there would be minimal effect on prices.
Aggregate farm income (operating surplus) would decline initially (by 5% in 2004 and 3% in 2005) but would then recover to reach 11% above the baseline by 2010.
Dr Fischler firmly believes his reform proposals will benefit both farmers and consumers. But his task will not be easy.
For a combination of European farm lobby fury and governments protecting their own interests will ensure months of tough negotiations in Brussels."

Irish Meat Association chief executive John Smith said it is difficult to reconcile claims that producer prices will increase as a result of decoupling with offers being made by the EU to reduce both import tariffs and export subsidies.
The proposals put forward by the EU to reduce import tariffs will allow lower-priced product coming from non-EU countries to have increased access to the EU markets, making it difficult for Irish producers to receive higher prices, he said.
Calling on the Government to strongly reject the proposals, he said the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) analysis on the impact of decoupling shows that the proposals would have a far more negative impact in Ireland than in other EU member states.
Other independent analysts have concluded that the impact of the proposals on Irish beef and lamb production would be even greater than that forecast in the FAPRI analysis.
Cattle output could fall by up to 30% or 600,000 head per year, equivalent to the throughput of ten meat factories employing almost 2,000 people. National sheep output could fall by 500,000 head per year, putting a further 300 jobs at risk, Mr Smith said.
He added that the volume and quality of the cattle and sheep produced in Ireland would suffer if these proposals are implemented. The reduction in agricultural output would quickly translate into job losses in the Irish beef and lamb industries and export losses of €500m per year.
As commercial farmers scale back their activities the progress which Ireland has made in building up a high quality, consumer-orientated food processing industry would be quickly undermined, he said.
Mr Smith said Minister Joe Walsh has the full support of the meat processing industry in Ireland when he insists decoupling is bad for Ireland and that the existing support arrangements, as negotiated in the Agenda 2000 agreement, must remain in place at least until 2006."

In a exclusive interview for Examiner Farming, the recently retired Professor of Agricultural Economics at University College Dublin says Commissioner Fischler has made a radical step on decoupling which he had not expect to feature until the next world trade round.
""Commissioner Fischler has decided otherwise, and it looks increasingly likely that he will get his way, though there is some resistance being recorded, including opposition from Ireland and France,"" said Sheehy.
In this wide-ranging interview, the award winning UCD economist has said decoupling would not be all bad news for Irish farmers.
Although reductions of the Irish beef cow herd by 30% and of ewes by 12% are predicted, which would severely affect the meat processing industry, farmers could benefit from better livestock prices.
Professor Sheehy says dairy farmers will be freed from the shackles of quotas by EU milk price cuts in the coming years, but full quota elimination is essential for establishing a dynamic, competitive Irish dairy industry.
On Irish agriculture in a ""virtual free trade"" world, he says Ireland will rely on a core of young and not so young farmers and on our successful multinational food companies which have the ability to compete with the best.
They need freedom from quotas and regulations, lower land prices and rents, to achieve scale and efficiency. 'Small is beautiful' can no longer be the aim.""
""Farm numbers will continue to decline, thus enabling others to expand, as has been the case since the Famine. In fact, we need to accelerate the decline,"" says Professor Sheehy."

If the Fischler proposals were approved, the Irish suckler herd would decline by 30%. The total EU suckler herd would decline by 18%.
By 2010, Irish beef production would have fallen by 12% and total EU production by 6%.
Irish cattle prices would fall initially (by 8% in 2004 and 5% in 2005), as suckler cows are destocked. As supply falls, prices would then recover, and would be 8% above the unreformed CAP baseline by 2010. EU prices would be 6% above the baseline by 2010.
Irish beef exports would fall by 12% relative to the baseline by 2010. However, there would be an EU market for 95% of these exports.
The predictions are made by the FAPRI-Ireland Partnership of Teagasc, a consortium of Irish Universities, and the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri in the USA.
They predict that decoupling of sheep direct payments would cut Irish ewe numbers and sheepmeat production. After an initial price decline, sheep prices would increase to a higher level than would be the case without CAP reform.
Having fallen 15% in 2004, sheep prices would recover to 21% above the baseline by 2010. Exports would have fallen by 3%. The findings are subject to various assumptions and qualifications.
Less dramatic effects on the cereals sector are predicted, but there would probably be some reduction in production. Total Irish farm income would decline initially, by 5% in 2004 and 3% in 2005, but would recover to reach 11% above the baseline (no policy change) by 2010."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10067360.html,2003-01-24 00:00:00,Analyst sounds death knell for quotas,"Paul Meade, NCB Stockbrokers, also claimed the proposed expansion of dairy quotas signals higher milk volumes for processing leading to their eventual elimination.
He said the EU is removing support from the bulk commodities like skim milk powder and butter which will force the sector to produce more added-value products like cheese and casein. The Commission is proposing to extend the quota system until 2015.
He said the plan envisages gradually increasing the EU’s dairy quota volume by 1% in 2007 and 2008 and reducing support prices for skim milk powder by 3.5% and 7% for butter over a five year period.
Mr Meade said this process will increase EU milk supplies, and reduce the institutionally guaranteed market price by 28% over a five-year period in line with the EU’s world trade negotiating position.
Corresponding producer-compensation payments, including additional ones in respect of changes in 2007 and 2008 for the price reductions, will be calculated along the already agreed mechanism and included in the annual farm payment system proposed.
Mr Meade was assessing the likely impact of EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler’s proposed CAP reform on Irish food producing plcs.
He said the impact may well be neutral for Glanbia given its diversified manufacturing capabilities, increased availability of milk for processing and the possibility of some margin improvements in its consumer milk-based products.
Mr Meade noted dairy is less than 10% of Kerry’s cost of sales and less than 2% of its profits following disposals last year. Kerry has already provisioned for new investment in the Golden Vale dairy business to add in manufacturing capability.
Regarding Greencore, he said sugar is excluded from the reforms. Savings over time on the existing farm spending will be channelled into reforming sectors like sugar, cotton, olive oil.
Mr Meade said it will be at least 2009 before the first substantial savings (€400m) are available for any additional reforms.
But since sugar is not a budgetary cost item, it is not top of the EU’s reform agenda and the existing regime will continue for some time yet. The group’s malt division is already operating at or near world prices.
IAWS currently generates about 30% of group earnings, before interest and tax from animal feed and fertiliser.
With EU policy shifting towards decoupling and environmental friendly farming systems, the size of the national beef herd will decline reducing demand for animal feed and fertiliser requirements.
Mr Meade said the key issue for IAWS is whether it will expedite a restructuring/sale of these businesses, possibly to its founding co-op, ahead of any significant reduction in profitability."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10071013.html,2003-01-28 00:00:00,Walsh takes aim at CAP reforms as battle begins,"The Irish and French came out most vehemently against the changes proposed by Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler, with Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium and Greece not as strong in their opposition.
IFA President John Dillon said Mr Walsh will need a lot of stamina to fight and win this battle on behalf of Irish farmers.
""He will have to be in Brussels a lot more than he was in the past. This battle will need to be fought on a daily basis,"" Mr Dillon said.
The French were the only country to completely support the Irish position at yesterday's meeting of agriculture ministers where they discussed the proposals for the first time.
Spain and Greece were more cautious while Portugal accepted modulation a reduction of direct payments and the Italians wanted to end milk quotas.
Irish farming organisations say the reduction in subsidies for beef and dairy farmers will cost hundreds of jobs and export earnings.
Mr Walsh, in condemning the proposals, even criticised the FAPRI report commissioned by his own Department and released last week.
He said it assumed a drop in beef production would lead to an increase in price for farmers, but Mr Walsh said it was more likely the gap would be filled by beef imports from non-EU countries.
He described the reforms as dismantling the system of producing good, safe and wholesome food for Europe put in place after the second world war.
""The emphasis has now shifted to a dole type of payment, a supplementary payment without the need for production,"" he said.
Decoupling the breaking of the link between subsidies and production will have a greater effect on Irish farmers than on those in other EU countries.
""It will reduce the Irish suckler herd by a third and have a devastating impact, especially on the less-favoured areas where farming is the main source of income, and cost jobs down stream in feed mills and butchers,"" Mr Walsh said.
Switching money from subsidies to rural development the other major change proposed will affect subsistence farmers since those who receive any more than €5,000 a year in direct payments face losing 12.5% of this money.
""One of the best ways of maintaining vibrancy is to maintain families on the farm and it does not make sense to reduce their income by 12.5%,"" Mr Walsh said.
ICOS President Dessie Boylan said: ""ICOS is very concerned that the proposals for the milk sector will have a more serious impact on Ireland than on other states because of our portfolio of products.""
Foreign Affairs Minister Brian Cowen said there was a danger that concessions to developing countries could affect Irish farmers more than those in other EU countries.
Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain are pushing to reduce the €45 billion a year spent on agriculture by the EU. Commissioner Fischler's proposals are a response to this and the demands of the WTO to reduce farming subsidies.
Speaking from Brussels yesterday evening, ICSA president Charlie Reilly said Mr Walsh's opposition to the CAP reforms was very strange and uninformed.
He said he was shocked at Mr Walsh's attitude towards his FAPRI report. ""Either the Minister is choosing to ignore the report's findings completely or he is completely out of touch with what Irish cattle and sheep farmers have been calling for over the last number of years,"" Mr Reilly said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10036651.html,2003-01-28 00:00:00,Improved prices for overage cattle,"This should be an interesting week in the beef trade with more cattle coming out of premia retention, increasing the supply available to the factories, where a clear policy of lower prices was being adopted yesterday.
Higher paying factories eased back by 3 cent/kg (1p/lb) for R grade under 30 months cattle in their quotes yesterday morning and some knocked up to 6 cent/kg (2p/lb) off the prices for O grade which was meeting with some producer resistance.
Nevertheless, the factories claimed that the numbers were coming freely and by mid-afternoon some factories in the south were advising farmers that they had their requirements for the week booked in.
Supplies were also improved up the country, but did not appear to be as strong as in the southern counties where the dairy/beef farmers in particular were selling off beef animals after taking the 21-month SBP.
Having paid over the quoted prices for the past three weeks to get sufficient cattle, more cattle available for marketing this week will test the strength of producers to hold the price. There was little indication yesterday that producers were holding back but there is still four days to go.
The trade for beef on the continent has eased back over the past week.
Restocking after Christmas is coming to an end and supplies are increasing the combination which has made holding prices more difficult.
Producers who retained overage cattle against the tide are being rewarded for their decision with an improvement of up to 9 cent/kg (3p/lb) in the official quotes, and reports of a bit more being secured almost wiping out the differential with the young stock.
Flat prices of up to 238 cent/kg (85p/lb) were quoted yesterday for the older cattle, for which there is good demand this week.
The trade for cow beef has improved in Holland, where prices are up at least 3 cent/kg (1p/lb), which is being reflected in the factories at up to 173 cent/kg (62p/lb) being quoted for cows and a shade more being paid.
There was a good trade for all types of cattle in the marts yesterday.
At Kilmallock, the forward single punched stores made up to €340 over, while heavy punched-out bullocks sold for up to €250 over. The heavy heifers made up to €155 over and stores sold for up to €130 over.
Heifer prices were improved by 10-20/head at Dungarvan Mart, where the heavy heifers made up to €160 over. Single punched bullocks made up to €300 over.
At Blessington, heavy punched-out bullocks made up to €185 over and single punched forward bullocks sold for up to €322 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10101988.html,2003-01-30 00:00:00,Beef prices continue to hold steady,"The changes overall last week in the returns from the pay sheets at the factories showed very little change in the trade. Average prices paid for O grade bullocks were 2 cent/kg (1p/lb) higher, probably as a result of more flat price buying of bullocks, than a conscious decision by the factories to pay more for O grade than the previous week. Heifer prices were generally easier by about 3 cent/kg (1p/lb) but were still over the quoted prices for the week.
There was a significant improvement in cow prices an increase of 6p-8p/lb for some grades with factory averages of almost 66p/lb being paid for O grade carcasses as demand for cows because of improved continental markets pushed prices to get sufficient supplies. Against the overall average of 88p/lb, some 10 factories paid an average of 89p/lb or better for R3 grade bullocks with a top price of over 93p/lb at Carrigans of Donegal, followed at over 90p/lb by AIBP Waterford and Dawn Meats, Midleton, and AIBP, Nenagh. There was a low factory average of 80p/lb, which is difficult to justify, given that overage animals are now generally making considerably more than that.
Within the three major players in the market there were minor changes in the averages for individual factories from the previous week.
AIBP paid an average of 1p/lb more for R3 bullocks at Waterford at 91p/lb average. There was no change in the average at their Nenagh plant at 90p/lb or Bandon at 89p/lb, but Clones dropped 2p/lb at 88p/lb.
In the Dawn Meats group, there was no change at Midleton with an average of 90p/lb, or at Ballghadereen at 89p/lb or Ballyhaunis at 86p/lb (lower average probably due to mix of older cattle), while the average at Waterford dropped 2p/lb at 88p/lb.
The average for O3 bullocks was 86p/lb with a top factory average of over 88p/lb."

On Monday, he gave a commitment to 34 young FETAC-Teagasc certificate graduates in Co Cork that he will not agree to changes to the Agenda 2000 version of CAP that would impact negatively on the young farmers’ futures.
“These proposals constitute, in my view, the most fundamental change in the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy since it was established,” he said.
Minister Walsh said he sees no reason, either within the enlarged EU or from the point of view of the forthcoming negotiations on agriculture in the World Trade Organisation, to embark on such significant reform at this time.
He said he believed that Irish farmers and the Irish economy would have to bear a disproportionate share of the adjustments which would result from decoupling direct payments from production and from modulating the direct payments of farmers receiving over €5,000 a year.
“The combined effect of decoupling and developments at the WTO is likely to be a reduction in EU production of beef and sheepmeat, with a disproportionate share of this reduction taking place in Ireland, and the prospects of a price increase being negatived by third country imports”.
“I have reminded my EU colleagues that we are not really talking about agricultural sectors. It is individual farmers and farm families who will be affected by these measures.”
“I am not prepared to contemplate the damage to the economic and social life of Irish rural areas implicit in the present proposals,” he said."

The WTO is pushing for open markets and is no longer prepared to tolerate a global market economy where the EU can subsidise exports on the one hand and keep trade barriers up against imports on the other.
That juggernaut has been coming down the tracks for quite some time and the current round of talks are likely to open up food markets big time to non EU exporters.
For Ireland, the implications are very serious given the reliance we have on exports where over 90% of beef is sold overseas and a vast quantity of our dairy produce as well.
In effect, as a peripheral nation our primary producers and our processors are facing difficulties on several fronts as the EU moves to reform CAP and the WTO demands free markets.
As we are so heavily export-driven Ciaran Fitzgerald, who is director of IBEC’s food and drinks division says a strong case exists for making some extra concessions to Ireland under the proposed changes to recognise our unique situation as an economy reliant on overseas sales.
What is clear in the context of what’s gong on in Europe and the world stage is that market forces are driving prices and what we can hope to get for our produce in the years ahead.
For farmers, and those reliant on them for raw materials, the challenges are huge.
Fitzgerald believes that the food and drinks sector selling into Britain, and to a lesser extent continental Europe, is facing the realities of the market place every day as competition challenges us on price and product quality daily.
Looking at the reforms currently taking place Fitzgerald says a ‘whole change’ agenda is taking place in agriculture.
But it is being driven as much, if not more, by the WTO agenda than by Brussels. It has got to the stage that markets ultimately have to be allowed to determine prices.
That does not take from the bottom line reality that farmers who are facing more radical change need support in trying to adjust their lives to the enormous change.
Not that this is new. What’s new is the move to take price supports out of the equation.
In the US farmers get support in a way that attempts not to distort global pricing and Fitzgerald believes this is the way Europe wants to push its policy as well.
As the world becomes more open there is no way the EU can justify food mountains or marketing distorting subventions.
But he insists also that rural Ireland and rural Europe have to be protected in the revolutionary changes coming down the line.
The idea has to be to strike a balance between ranching type farms and the smaller operations.
We are at the point where young farmers need more land and more quota to make it worth staying in farming and Fitzgerald believes there is little point in trying to hold back the tide at this stage.
While the WTO and the CAP reforms look like twin assaults on an already hard-hit sector Fitzgerald says it will be for the best in the long run.
EU citizens are no longer prepared to accept policies that are bad for the environment and bad for the consumer.
However, Ireland will have to ensure the reforms allow an opportunity for Irish agriculture to survive and expand while at the same time fostering rural development.
As a system the Fischler reforms have flaws, but we have to negotiate round them to ensure the proper outcome for Irish farming and the economy."

The meat factories maintain they can't absorb the extra cost and will have to pass it on to livestock farmers.
However, the farmers are vehemently opposed to what they regard as yet another levy and have called on the Government to resolve the impasse.
The IFA claimed the Government’s decision will impose €44 million in extra costs on the sector.
It said this in turn will be passed on to producers at a cost of up to €16 per beef animal, €2 per sheep, €2 per pig and 10c per chicken slaughtered, from today.
IFA president John Dillon, has called a meeting of livestock farmers for Abbeyleix, County Laois, tomorrow night Tuesday) to discuss these issues and falling cattle prices.
He warned of a looming showdown with the Government and Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh over increased levies, charges and penalties. Mr Dillon said the Abbeyleix meeting will be crucial for the sector and the country's 100,000 livestock farmers.
ICMSA president Pat O’Rourke warned that the meat processing sector was facing major disruption with the possibility of some closures.
He said farmers may have to consider withholding a supply of cattle until funding is made available by Minister Walsh.
The Minister told the Dáil that the State has provided €138 million to the rendering industry since January 2001, when meat and bonemeal was banned as an animal feed.
He said the policy of disengaging from exchequer funding in this area of the livestock and meat sector was in line with European Commission guidelines, which require such State aid to be ended by the end of 2003."

The increase in levies, charges and premium penalties being imposed by
Minister Joe Walsh and the Government on the livestock sector, and particularly winter finishers, had reached crisis point. He warned these will bankrupt a large number of winter finishers unless action is taken.
Mr Deane was speaking ahead of an IFA-organised meeting of livestock farmers in Abbeyleix, Co Laois, tonight.
He said a winter finisher with 100 cattle was facing an income cut of over €8,000 as a direct result of decisions by the minister and the Government.
In view of the high cost for meat and bone meal disposal in Ireland compared to other EU member states, the Government must continue to contribute to the cost of disposal, particularly the export element.
Mr Deane also called on the minister to remove a double beef premium penalty of €45 a head on winter finishers and demanded the country’s full national special beef premium back from Brussels.
He said the Abbeyleix meeting would address the income crises for winter finishers, the increase in levies and charges, the double special beef premium penalty and falling cattle prices."

A charolais weighing 660kg sold for €1,075 and a Belgian Blue scaling 565kg made €1,060. The more general run of double punched animals sold from €160 over to €240 over.
In the single punched section the highest price of €1,610 was paid for a 835kg Belgian Blue, while a 690kg red Limousin went for €1,100, a 650kg Charolais sold for €1,115 and a 635kg Simmental made €1,050.
The general run of prices for the single punched ranged from €350 over to €500 over.
Some very strong prices were also paid for heifers, but none better than €1,370 for a 560kg Belgian Blue taking the lead over a 370kg Belgian Blue sold for €1,120.
A 460kg Limousin made €785 and a 540kg Charolais sold for €840.
Prices were maintained at Fermoy where medium weight stores with premia made up to €305 over and heifers made up to €130 over.
At Ennis plainer lots of young bullocks were €20-25 back."

Glenhill Farm is a modern 151-acre holding with an 80,796 milk gallon quota. Although no definite price has been quoted for this landmark sale, land of this quality with quota would be expected to fetch anywhere between 15,000 to 20,000 per acre.
The farm is well known for its commercial herd of Friesian cows. The vendors have concentrated on breeding strains capable of producing high protein levels, some close to 4% of protein per gallon.
The farm at Glenhill has been in the same family since the turn of the century and has been well-husbanded and improved over time.
Right now it comes with over 23,000 square feet of covered farm buildings and level, fertile land with masses of road frontage and excellent internal roadways.
Mr Hodnett is to sell the farm in three lots following the natural division of the land and although it’s all in one block these three divisions would separate naturally.
Because Glenhill is a south-facing farm in a good position, the vendors have practised extended grazing and in their breeding policy have aimed to match the cow to the management system.
So, with extended and New Zealand systems, some dairy-farmers are concentrating on breeding a smaller, lighter cow with high protein levels: there are no quotas on protein. The upside is that feed bills are kept to a minimum and paddocks are kept in good order.
The yard is almost at the centre of the farm and is designed in a flow system to suit a one-man-job. Also, because of the layout it allows a fast reaction to the weather, and with the extended grazing system and good farm roadways, cattle can be brought in swiftly, when necessary.
All enclosed, the farm building has slatted housing for 140 cows, the same stocking level as is used on the farm as well as a 15-unit milking parlour with recording jars.
The beef unit has a 200-head capacity but can also double as calf housing in bad weather. Calf units and housing boxed are provided.
The dairy comes with a 1,3000 gallon bulk milk tank and a large hopper for bulk fertiliser.
Water is from a private 235-foot well and there is a 250,000 gallon slurry tank on the concrete apron.
“This farm is one of the biggest blocks of land, close to the city to come on sale for some time,” says John Hodnett, “and it should create some interest because of its size and quality and what’s on offer.
“This is a renowned early grass farm and is located in an extensive farming region. Its position close Cork city means it’s also attractive in terms of accessibility,” he adds.
“Under the Fischler proposals the dairy industry has until 2004 to build on its quotas and this farm affords someone an excellent opportunity to increase their present quotas and acquire an excellent farm of land into the bargain. This is one of the reasons why we can offer the property in three different lots.”
Glenhill Farm has had a long and interesting history. Bought some time in the early 1890s by the vendors’ antecedents, the farm was used as a stud in the early part of the last century and horses from this part of Knockraha were bought by the British army in World War I.
In later years, the farm was the base for the annual meet of Pigeon Hill Point-to-Point Races and large crowds turned out for the racing."

But the last minute intervention by the Minister for Agriculture, Joe Walsh TD with the offer of a three month partial restoration of the Government subsidy towards rendering costs has left unfinished business which neither the industry or the beef producers are happy about.
An issue of cost on rendering charges, and who pays for the service, remains to be resolved both in then short term and longer term after May 31st 2003 when all Government subsidy will cease.
As factories faced a serious situation of possible closure this week, with the withholding of all cattle supplies by producers over the additional costs being imposed for the rendering, Minister Walsh agreed to provide E7m in funding to pay E250/tonne towards the rendering costs for three months, instead of the previous support of E460/tonne.
Industry sources have estimated the cost of the deficit at equivalent to E5/head on cattle between now and the end of May, increasing to about E15/head when the subsidy is withdrawn on June 1st.
The Renderers Association chairman, David McDowell, has told the processors and the producers that the immediate shortfall will have to be paid by the livestock industry, and the renderers will not continue to provide the service unless they are paid for it.
John Smith, Chief Executive, Irish Meat Association, representing the processors said that his members cannot afford to carry the additional cost and inevitably it will have to be paid for by the producers.
Producers have rejected out of hand any additional costs being borne off the price of beef, which they claim is currently E100/head under the economic price, on top of which they have to bear the increase in disease charges and the additional cost of BSE testing for animals over 30 months.
Some of the processors withheld quoting for cattle on Monday last and others reduced their prices by a further 1p/lb, blaming weak export markets and the impact of sterling and the dollar as justification for the reduction.
Producers are now furious that the generally quoted prices this week of 84p-80p/lb for R/O grades is costly them dearly in losses having dipped below the break even point on top of which they have to carry the additional costs of slaughtering at the factories.
While some relief has been secured in the short term towards the cost of rendering the resolution of the longer term policy, post May 31st next still remains to be resolved, with the prospect of having to carry the burden threatening producers."

The boom magnetised the country, attracting the workers who years before had fled the endless dole queues, EU intervention beef and butter vouchers.
Our economic vital statistics were certainly the pin-up figures of every finance minister in the world, but in our rush to fumble in the greasy till we trampled on the most vulnerable members of our society. Compare Ireland in 1995 to Ireland in 2002.
In 1995 the total amount earned in the economy per head of population was just under 13,000. By 2002, this had more than doubled to 26,600.
Unemployment in 1995 was a staggering 12% of the workforce, which meant 177,000 people were struggling to make ends meet on meagre social welfare payments. By 2002, this figure had been slashed to just 4.5% of the workforce or 84,000 people.
New jobs, better jobs, better lifestyles saw a greater demand for places to live to show off this new-found wealth. It drove house prices beyond the reach of ordinary workers. Local authority housing, previously used by many as a way to save for a mortgage, was now clogged with people who would never be able to even dream of getting their own home. Rents too began to snowball. Evictions soared. Hostels straining under a tidal wave of unprecedented demands started to turn people away. The homeless population exploded.
So while the country never had it so good, the number of people forced to sleep rough on our streets doubled.
Focus Ireland now believes their are 6,000 homeless people in Dublin alone. This figure does not include the people forced to live with relatives or friends because they have nowhere else to go.
According to Alice Leahy, director and co-founder of Trust, a homeless organisation dedicated to trying to restore human dignity to the homeless, homelessness is not just being houseless, it is about not feeling wanted or belonging: “Society has an awful opinion of
homeless people as drunks or down-and-outs, whereas they are only human beings like the rest of us who just couldn’t keep up in the rat race.”
Ms Leahy, who has been working with the homeless since 1975, said the word homelessness sounds self-explanatory, but in relation to people who either sleep rough or use hostels and night shelters, homelessness is merely a symptom of a more deep-seated set of problems. “If these problems have any common factor it has to do with a failure to become, or to remain, a part of the wider community. It is not surprising that many have been in prison or mental hospitals or both. In an intolerant society, imprisonment or admission to a mental hospital is the usual response. In the view of most people, these ‘unfortunates’ are failures; failures who are largely to blame for their own misfortunes; failures whose very existence is an embarrassment and shame.”
She said the human beings she meets on a daily basis are:
ravaged by disease and violence;
suffering from pressure sores from sleeping out in all weathers, sometimes sleeping in urine-soaked clothes for weeks;
suffering from infected and untreated minor skin conditions and major skin problems like leg ulcers;
infected with head lice;
infected with scabies;
suffering from malnutrition;
unable to read or write;
taken over by addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling;
pushed from service to service."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10094955.html,2003-03-25 00:00:00,Supplies tighter at the factories,"Prices are unchanged in the south. In the midlands, R grade animals are bring quoted at 3 cent/kg more (1p/lb) and are proving harder to get this week as the supply drops back for the third consecutive week.
Factories across the south quoted 235-224 cent/kg (84p-80p/lb) for R/O grade cattle yesterday.
Further up the country, there was 238 cent/kg (85p/lb) on offer for R grade and very good cattle were making a bit more where supplies were scarce. The fine weather has increased activity in farm work, with slurry spreading taking priority on many farms over selling cattle as farmers take advantage of the improved ground conditions to empty their farm storage tanks. Beef prices are not strong enough to encourage suppliers to want to sell, and some are considering letting cattle out to grass in the hope of a lift in beef prices in April.
The steer kill at the factories last week dropped to 16,726 head in a short working week out of a total kill for the week of 28,510 head.
There are very few over 30 months cattle on offer. They are making similar prices to the young cattle or close to that, and if they are heavy enough and have the quality, Galtee Meats at Charleville are paying 3-6 cent/kg (1p-2p/lb) more for the over age.
The trade for cows remains steady at 185 cent/kg (66p/lb). Markets for cow beef are holding up well, leading to good demand."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10082887.html,2003-03-26 00:00:00,CAP reform proposes income boost,"According to the studies published by the Commission, farm income would increase by 8.5 % compared to 2001.
As to a scenario based on the existing policy (Agenda 2000), the income impact would be largely neutral for EU-15 (-0.1% in 2009).
While beef production in the EU-15 is expected to fall by 2.7% in the medium-term, the studies state that producers should see a 7% price increase by 2009. For the new Member States, the CAP reform would secure the income gains generated by enlargement.
In 2009, market income is expected to increase by 17% in real terms as compared to the situation in 2002 without enlargement.
Taking account of the phasing-in of direct payments and rural development, the studies predict this real income increase could reach more than 45%.
De-coupling in the new member states would produce similar trends to those in the EU-15, as producers’ decisions would be driven by market considerations.
EU Farm Commissioner Dr Franz Fischler said the studies show the reform will secure farmers a higher income while gearing production more sustainable farming."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10111721.html,2003-03-27 00:00:00,Grass may be profitable feed for beef,"Throughput at the factories was low last week, following the national holiday on Monday, and fine weather has turned farmers thoughts from selling cattle this week, with the improved ground conditions leading to a flurry of slurry spreading and tillage operations.
Most factories in the south quoted unchanged prices, at 224 to 235 cent/kg (80p to 84p/lb) for R and O grades, and buyers showed little interest in getting increased supplies of cattle.
In the midlands, the situation was slightly different, where factories found the going tougher to get sufficient cattle, which resulted in 3 cent/kg (1p/lb) more being quoted for R grade animals, and a bit more being paid for the quality lots in many cases.
The low prices over the past week did not encourage producers to bring out finished cattle, and some are considering letting them out to grass for a few weeks before selling, hoping that the demand will be stronger and prices better in late April and early May, when supplies are likely to be tighter.
It is a gamble, but one that will not have high feed costs attached, and it could be a reasonably good bet if there is any such thing any more in the cattle business.
The throughput of steers at the factories fell to 16,726 head last week, out of a total kill for the week of 28,510, both figures well down on the previous week, and also under the same week last year.
Year to date, the total kill is 4% higher than 2002 and the steer kill is up 6% on last year.
The markets generally have been continuing quiet, but promotions for beef in Britain in the lead up to Easter should result in more demand, hopefully.
There has been some improvement in the market in Italy over the past week and a slight improvement for hind quarters in Holland, while other markets remained unchanged.
The cow trade at the factories is continuing strong with prices largely unchanged at 185 cent/kg (66p/lb), with good demand.
Factory price returns over the past number of weeks confirm that more than the quoted prices are being paid for the heavy cows, and this market appears steady enough to continue."

The overall average price paid for R3 bullocks dropped under 85p/lb at 237c/kg within a range from 87p/lb back to 83p/lb at the individual factories with Carrigans of Donegal the leaders on price. Exel at Kilbeggan and Dawn Meats at Ballaghadereen paid over 86p/lb with Newgrange Meats, at Navan, Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff, Dawn Meats at Waterford and Jennings of Ballinrobe all paying over 85p/lb.
Of the three major players in the processing sector AIBP group averaged 84p/lb across their six factories with a variation of up to 1p/lb between the individual plants, while the five plants in the Dawn Group paid an average of 85p/lb and Kepak group paid just over 84p/lb average. The average of O3 bullocks was 226c/kg (80.7p/lb).
Average factory prices for R3 heifers ranged 258-230c/kg (92p-82p/lb) with Meadow Meats, Rathdowney the leaders, followed by Exel at Kilbeggan, Kepak at Clonee, Liffey Meats, AIBP plants at Nenagh and Bandon and Carrigans of Donegal all on 86p/lb or better. The average for O3 heifers fell just under 80p/lb.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10097855.html,2003-04-01 01:00:00,Prices harden on tighter supplies,"Producers up country were in a position to bargain for 86p/lb for R grade cattle yesterday as the supply of finished cattle tightened leading to processors having more difficulty in getting their requirements. The increase has not been passed on at the same ratio to the poorer grading animals which are still lingering around 80p/lb, except where the majority of a load are in the upper grade and a flat price is agreed.
In the south the effect on supply was less obvious. Some processors were finding the situation “a little tighter” while others confirmed that there was plenty of cattle on offer from dairy/beef farms where retention expired for the 21 month premia they were being moved out in larger numbers.
Across the south all factories were quoting similar to last week for the young cattle at 84p-80p/lb for R/O grades. The trickle of over 30 months cattle is so light that it is scarcely getting noticed now. Quality heavy lots are worth more than the young cattle for the Heinz contract at Galtee Meats. At Fair Oak, Clonmel and Bagenalstown there is no difference from the young cattle for R grade but they are penalising 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) for O grade over 30 months.
The total kill at the factories last week was up almost 5,000 head at 33,234 head of which the bullocks accounted for 18,455 head, an increase of 1,700 head on the previous week. Both the bullock kill and the overall are up on the same week in 2002.

On-going farming difficulties, low prices and cost increases for farmers stemming from the December, 2002 Budget seem to have entrenched farmer opposition to any partnership involvement.
But , in the higher ranks of the IFA and among a sizeable minority of farmers, there is acceptance that remaining outside the partnership may not be the best long term choice for the organisation.
Talks between IFA and the Government over the past week achieved very little, with little or no progress made on the major issues.
The Government hasn't budged from its decisions to double disease levies in 2003 and pass a number of other additional slaughter related charges on to the beef sector. Similarly, it has refused to give way on the abolition of roll over relief for land acquired under Compulsory Purchase Orders, even though this decision undermined a deal negotiated by the IFA with the National Roads Authority for better payments for road development land.
The only ground being yielded on disease levies is talk of a 'review' in respect of 2004, with no pre-commitments on its outcome.
Meanwhile, the Government decision to implement the Nitrates Directive nationally has come as a bitter pill for the IFA. Farmers will have to observe legally binding restrictions on the use of nitrates, and register with local authorities for the spreading of slurry.
Negotiations are ongoing on the revision of payments to farmers in REPS which could be increased by up to 30%, and biased in favour of smaller farms and a higher grant aid ceiling in the Farm Waste Management Scheme, going from 200 units to 300 units.
IFA Council members around the country are now being briefed by local farmers as to how they should vote on the partnership decision at next week's meeting."

Price became the secondary consideration for some producers yesterday as they experienced difficulty in getting cattle booked in for this weeks kill as the “booked out” sign went up at some factories by noon.
While last weeks prices of 85p-81p/lb for R/O grades was available in the morning at some factories - others reduced their quotes for the week by 1p/lb - the requirement for the week was rapidly booked in at a number of the factories. By noon yesterday Galtee Meats, Charleville reported that they were booked out and producers were getting the same message at Dawn Meats, Midleton while bookings for this weeks kill was rapidly being taken up at Kepak, Watergrasshill and Exel Meats at Kilbeggan.
Export orders for the Easter trade were completed last week and demand is reported to be very quiet on export markets this week. Bullock supplies to the factories increased by 1,000 head to 21,567 head last week out of a total kill for the week of 36,010, which is 6,000 head higher than the same week in 2002.
Supplies are particularly strong in the south, while the supply situation has also improved in the midlands this week where intake was more than adequate yesterday and prices were also coming under some pressure.
Another short week coming - with Bank Holiday Easter Monday - is not going to help the situation for producers who are now anxious to get their sheds emptied."

Demand for Hereford bulls was strong, but demand was poor for a small entry of Friesian bulls on offer.
Breeders paid an average of €2,160 for the top 12 Limousin bulls sold.
In the Charolais section the top price was €2,800 with the average for the top 12 of €1,630. Hereford bulls topped at a strong €2,200 with the top 12 making an average of €1,580.
The best price paid for a Simmental bull was €1,200. A further supplementary bull sale will be held at the mart on May 12. In the livestock sales yesterday, demand and prices were well maintained for the forward bullocks punched out and those with a premia, but young single punched animals met with a tougher trade and prices were easier by up to €40/head.
At Kanturk Mart, single punched bullocks in the 500-600 kgs range made up to €400 over €/kg, with those in the 400-500 kgs range peaking at €350 over and lighter lots topping at €300 over.

Into the second half of the month and with an overdue census date on their minds, a lot of finishers were anxious to get their houses emptied, and did not welcome the shorter working week and likely reduction in kill.
Prices unchanged from last week were on offer at some factories on Monday morning, but their requirements were rapidly filled up and lower prices and difficulty in getting cattle booked in quickly became the order.
Prices are back by 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) at most plants for the week.
A number of the factories were booked up for the week by lunch time on Monday, and others were finding that their requirements were rapidly filling, which was not good news for producers anxious to sell.
In general, R grades were making 235 to 241 cents/kg (84p to 85p/lb) and O grades were quoted at 224 to 227 cents/kg (80p to 81p/lb), for under age cattle.
Up to 246 cents/kg (88p/lb) is available at Galtee Meats, Charleville for cattle over 400 kgs and that is being paid for both under and over 30 months provided that the quality and weight requirements are in order.
Cattle aged over 30 months are few and far between presently.
In many cases, they make the same prices as younger cattle, but some factories are discounting, particularly if the quality is not great.
The steer kill was up 1,000 head last week at 21, 567 head, out of a total kill of 36,010 head, compared to 30,080 head for the same week last year.
Last week saw the fourth consecutive weekly increase in the steer kill, but two short working weeks around Easter and weaker demand at the factories this week are likely to end that trend.
Cow prices are showing the first signs of coming under pressure, weakening slightly at the top end of the market. Up to 185 cents/kg is still being quoted, and a little more is being paid for heavy cows, but the 193 cents/kg (69p/lb) of previous weeks may be harder to achieve.
While the weekly kill of cows at the factories is up 10% on last year, the kill for the year to date is trailing 2002 by 2%."

“We had a very big sale today with well over 2,000 cattle and very strong prices with plenty of buyers around,” he said.
Heavy punched out bullocks were a flying trade with up to €300 over €/kg being paid for the tops and the forward single punched with a bit of quality made up to €430 over ranging back to €210 over for Friesians. The heavy heifers also met with a very good trade with lots in the 400 kg plus weight range making up top €210 over.
At Dungarvan Mart there was also a good entry yesterday. Manager Ger Flynn described the trade for all forward store bullocks as “very good”. Heifers also meet with good demand and the trade for suckler cows and calves was “exceptional”. Up to €1,200 was paid for sucklers with one calf at foot and prices ranged back to €700.

Supplies of cattle are plentiful in the south of the country, but less so in the upper regions. Markets are quiet this week after the Easter trade and some of the processors are warning producers of even worse to come. However, it is hard to imagine prices falling below these low levels at the end of April when the trade should be strong, with supplies tightening, and cattle off grass a few weeks away at the earliest.
The turnaround in beef prices has taken finishers by surprise and concentrated their minds at ringsides yesterday where trade for the single punched bullocks was a shade easier, with the edge gone off the very fancy prices in particular. The good heifers remained a firm trade.

Farming has its difficulties, and the farm organisations make sure we hear all about them.
It is nearly impossible for them to say anything positive, with the result that a certain amount of negative thinking has set in the average farmer's mindset.
The tourism industry has suffered a major downturn, but doesn't complain much probably because even more tourists would stay away if their hosts never had an optimistic word to say to them.
Tourism troubles began with their sacrifice of much of the 2001 Irish holiday season, for the good of the farming and food industries.
When foot and mouth struck, tourism providers were hit hardest in the bid to keep the virus outside our borders.
Farmers should think long and hard before they take their next overseas holiday; there is still a debt outstanding to our hotels and holiday towns, who got no compensation for their foot and mouth sacrifices.
Regardless of that debt, farmers should stand by the tourism industry, as a provider of jobs for farm family members, and the sales outlet for huge amounts of Irish farm produce.
The sector employs 30,000 directly and a further 42,000 in seasonal and tourist related industries. and Irish food makes up a large part of the average tourist's 715 expenditure here.
After foot and mouth, the holidays business was picking itself up and looking forward to better times, when terrorists set the world ablaze on September 11, accelerating a worldwide economic downturn and setting the scene for this year's invasion of Iraq, a sequence of events which threatens to erode any remaining confidence in the usually upbeat Irish tourism sector.
If this is a third successive disaster season, expect wholesale closures and huge jobs losses in tourism. That means less work for farm families, less food sales.
With every other farm family now depending on non-farm employment, the labour market is nearly as important as the beef or milk market.
Right now, it is under severe pressure from the 100% plus increase in the past two years in the cost of employers' and public liability insurance.
For the tourism industry, insurance costs are a triple whammy on top of three bad business years, but the Small Firms Association has warned that lack of progress on insurance reform will result in many other company closures, besides those in the holidays sector. They say it is also resulting in job losses and postponement of expansion by companies, and it could yet become impossible to do business in Ireland, with insurance fraud estimated at more than 100 million a year.
Jobs in tourism and in the companies most vulnerable to insurance costs are on the line.
But the competitiveness of our export firms is also under pressure from inflation, high Irish production costs, and low investment levels.
That's why our export and internationally traded sectors shed 21,000 jobs in 2002; a statistic masked by 39,500 new jobs in the public service areas of health, education, public administration and defence.
On the bright side, the war in Iraq will not have the economic effect that was initially feared.
But farmers who thought that low prices, slow markets and CAP uncertainty couldn't get worse, need to keep an eye also on the jobs which underpin survival of half of our farms."

Processors blame export markets weakness, and some of them have cut their already short working week to just two days.
In the south of the country, the Rs are generally making 235 cents/kg (84p/lb).
Some factories have quoted back to 232 cents/kg (83p/lb) for the Rs, and say that they are getting cattle at that price. In the midlands, prices are a bit stronger at 238 cents/kg (85p/lb) and further north, the quality R3 is making a bit more.

These developments will be closely watched by the Irish beef industry, which is coming under increasing pressure to reduce costs, rationalise operations and develop a product that is being sought by consumers in high value markets with demanding lifestyles.
It will also be monitored by the country’s 100,000 beef farmers anxious to improve their returns in a difficult climate and are becoming increasingly worried about the volumes of South American beef being imported into EU member states including Ireland.
Declan Troy of the Teagasc National Food Centre, said the conventional way of handling beef is for the carcass to be chilled immediately after slaughter for up to 48 hours.
It is then boned and the meat allowed to age or mature for up to 14 days.
But with the new system now being developed the high value cuts are removed from the carcass within one-and-a-half hours of slaughter.
Then, through a process called PiVac, the meat is sucked into a tube of elasticated packaging, which effectively means it cannot get tough. The resulting meat is called TenderBound.
Consumer testing and scientific measurements by Declan Troy and his colleagues are showing a more consistently tender product than is produced with the conventional chilling system.
The research results also show the hot-boning system results in only around 0.5% in weight loss compared to up to 2% with the carcass hanging in the chill room.
This, according to Declan Troy, could lead to substantial benefits to processors and beef producers.
“The new packaging system also ensures a consistent shape to beef on the supermarket shelf and for the catering trade, which may be attractive to retailers and consumers,” he said.
Other potential advantages of the new process are longer shelf-life and a reduced interval between slaughter and sale. Beef can be consumed within seven days of slaughter compared with up to 14 days with the conventional system.
“In addition to the consumer benefits, beef companies could look forward to less refrigeration costs, lower weight losses and less labour,” he said.
The research, supported by the National Development Plan, is being carried out by the Teagasc National Food Centre in conjunction with a major German engineering company which specialises in innovative systems of food packing.
While stressing that the research is at a relatively early stage, Declan Troy said he is optimistic.
He said while hot-boning is practiced to some extent in the US, New Zealand and in some northern European countries, this is the first time a scientific trial on the combined hot-boning/ TenderBound system has been carried out.
The next stage will involve an industry trial, where the technology can be tested at meat factory level and the actual advantages quantified. He expects such a trial to get underway over the coming months.
IFA National Livestock Committee chairman Derek Deane has, meanwhile, warned the huge increase in non-EU beef imports to Ireland are being used to keep down farmer prices.
He called on Agriculture and Food Minister Joe Walsh to tackle the serious problem of beef imports and particularly the damage inflicted on the domestic market by non-EU beef imports.
Mr Deane said the latest CSO data for 2002 shows a trebling of Brazilian beef imports to 3,908 tonnes to Ireland over the last three years.
He said in 2001, over 8,800 tonnes of non-EU beef were imported into Ireland, representing 13.4% of our entire domestic market and equivalent to 52 million beef meals or one million meals per week.
Mr Deane said in the light of these alarming figures Mr Walsh must publish the names and the addresses of the various companies and people involved in importing and distributing this product in Ireland."

Farm Solutions Ltd have been bringing workers from the Czech Republic to some of Ireland’s top farms for the past two years, but this is their first time recruiting farmers from Ukraine. They have selected 25 to come to Ireland over the coming months via the work permit system, having interviewed 87 Ukrainian farmers.
They are on their way after months of planning in conjunction with private farm advisory centres in Ukraine.
Farm Solutions Ltd Manager, Tom Bermingham, and Willie Byrne, Development Officer, recently travelled to three rural areas of the eastern country for interviews with farmers interested in coming to Ireland, not just to earn money, but also to see and practice good farming methods.
Tom Bermingham says these young farmers expect the farming knowledge gained in Ireland, and the money they earn to be invaluable in further developing their own farms on their return to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, they will play an important role on the many Irish farms where the need for a full time worker exists, he predicts.
Life in the Ukraine: The Ukraine is a large country, bigger than France, with a population of 50 million.
Life has been a difficult struggle here for centuries. In modern times, during the first half of the 20th century, it is estimated that a combination of war and famine claimed the lives of half the male and quarter of the female population.
Despite gaining independence in 1991, a fragile political structure, noted for its high level of corruption, seems to ensure that almost 40% of the population live below the poverty line.
A recent survey, that should give hope to Irish politicians, indicated that less than 10% of Ukrainian people trust their President and Government.
Even with its rich fertile soil, that led to the country being called “the bread-basket of Europe”, agriculture does not prosper.
Chernobyl, where the nuclear disaster occurred in 1986, is in the Ukraine, but much of the radioactive fall-out was over neighbouring Belarus.
Farmers from the area were amazed that Irish people knew so much about Chernobyl, says Tom Bermingham.
Their main agricultural problem now is not radioactive fall-out; it is the lack of a developed market economy such as we have in Ireland. As a result, prices are very low.
Indeed, it is not uncommon for farmers not to get paid at all for their produce.
However, things are slowly improving, as more people are being exposed to new ideas and opportunities, helped by links such as that between the private farm advisory centres and Farm Solutions Ltd.
A farmer in the Ukraine can expect to sell the average milk yield of 2,100 litres (460 gallons) for 10 cents/litre (45c per gallon).
Beef cattle sell for 66 cent/kg; pigs for 1.20/kg.
Barley yields about a tonne per acre and sells for 75/tonne.
Wheat yields 1.25 tonnes/acre and sells for 75/tonne.
Potatoes yield 12 tonnes/acre and sell for 80/tonne.
The average family farm is 60 hectares (148 acres), but there are many large co-operative type farms where average size would be approximately 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres).
While the average wage in the Ukraine is 50 per month, many of the private farmers are surviving on a farm income of less than 2,000 per year.
In spite of this, says Tom Bermingham, they are warm and friendly people, which is more than can be said for the weather in winter, when the temperature rarely rises above minus 10 Centigrade.
According to Mykhaylo Kapshtyk, Director of the Ukraine’s Private Farm Support Centre in Kiev, “The co-operation with Farm Solutions Ltd will provide Ukrainian farmers with a good opportunity to learn about modern Western European farming methods and expand their farming skills to the long-term benefit of all concerned.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10118553.html,2003-05-01 01:00:00,No sign of pre-grass price lift yet,"Farmers are very angry that prices have been further reduced at a time of the year when seasonally it has been normal for the trade to improve, as supplies of cattle out of the sheds fall back. It will be a few more weeks before cattle commence coming off the grass, but supplies continue quite strong.
Confusion arises as to the reason for falling prices. Some sources are blaming the restricted inspections by vets at the factories; others are saying that the quieter tone to the markets, weaker demand for beef, and lighter export orders are the reasons. But processors are getting plenty of cattle despite the falling prices, and they are unlikely to offer more, with slack order books, and added uncertainty because they do not know how the cut in veterinary staff to inspect slaughter cattle is going to affect their killing lines.
Some of the factories were hesitant to issue any quote this week, adopting a wait and see approach to supply, demand and price.
In the south, up to 235 cents/kg (84p/lb) was available for R grade steers and heifers on Monday, but the prices were quickly slipping back to 229 cents/kg (82p/lb) for Rs, with Os being quoted at 218 cents/kg (78p/lb).
In the midlands, 235-224 cents/kg (84p-82p/lb) were maintained and, further north, the quality Rs were making a bit more.
The over age cattle are a bit of a mixed bag. They are making up to 246 cents/kg (88p/lb) at Galtee Meats, Charleville for quality animals over 400 kg. Fair Oak is paying 224-212 cents/kg (80p-76p/lb) for the general run of over 30 months animals, but they are not interested in stock over 36 months.
There is a strong market for young bull beef at Excel, Kilbeggan where animals up to 12 months are making 288 cents/kg (100p/lb) and those from 12 months to 18 months are worth 246 cents/kg (88p/lb).
The cow prices have remained steady.
Good quality cows are making close to 196 cents/kg (70p/lb), while the more general run is 185 cents/kg (66p/lb)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10048011.html,2003-05-01 01:00:00,IFA sign up for national agreement in €260m deal,"Protracted negotiations took place with the Government over six months before the package, estimated to be worth around €260 million a year, to the farming sector was accepted.
The ICMSA and Macra na Feirme have also signalled their acceptance of the document, while ICOS, the umbrella body for the co-ops, will meet shortly on the matter.
Last night, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the Agriculture and Food Minister Joe Walsh welcomed the decisions of the farming organisations to continue their participation in social partnership.
Mr Ahern said the current round of negotiations had been understandably challenging, given the general economic background. But overcoming challenges through consensus has been a fundamental aspect of the process.
While the agriculture chapter is quite comprehensive and naturally the area of most direct interest to farmers, the Taoiseach said the general overall measures contained in Sustaining Progress are just as important to farmers as to all other sectors of the economy.
Mr Ahern said he is confident ICOS will also sign up to the new agreement very shortly, enabling the entire farming pillar to participate fully in the implementation mechanisms currently being put in place.
IFA president John Dillon said all farmers are seriously concerned over their low-income situation, low prices in milk, beef, grain, and pigs and the major challenges in the CAP reform and WTO negotiations.
Macra na Feirme president Seamus Phelan said elements of the deal did not go far enough in adequately recognising farmers' concerns, but their interests are better served inside the process.
ICSA president John Deegan described the deal as too little too late and said he doubted whether it was right for farm organisations to sign up at this point, particularly when there is such anger among farmers on incomes."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10047798.html,2003-05-01 01:00:00,Farmers warned they may lose control of dairy industry,"John Egan warned the ICMSA officers that farmers lost control of the beef industry, and the dairy industry was now in danger of following the same route.
He said forcing dairy processors to pay more for milk than the market returns or profitability can justify is suicidal, as far as farmer control of the industry is concerned.
Dairygold Co-op’s recent milk price cut was sharply criticised at the meeting.
But Mr Egan said, “Dairygold has served farmers well down the years, and I hope that you can get your problems with the society sorted out, because the Board of Management have to protect the interest of the society, and it is important that farmers retain control of the business in their own interest“.
He said, “Farm organisations can be very critical of the operation of the co-ops, but they have to face reality and look at where the costs of running these operations are to come from“.
“We can’t say pay up on one hand and drive a society into liquidation on the other hand. We saw what happened in a co-op of our own here in 1989, paying the best price in the league, it went belly up. Were it not for two plcs, Golden Vale and Kerry, the farmers who supplied the milk would have been in serious difficulty. That is a situation that should never again arise. It is high time that the farming organisations seriously faced up to the realities”.
Mr Egan said that there was nothing in the recent report on the rationalisation of the dairy sector to show how it could be financed.
Martin Heenan, Kilmeedy told the meeting that smaller co-ops are paying the best prices for milk, and rationalisation is not the solution to the difficulties in the dairy industry.
Gerard Quain, chairman, Co Limerick ICMSA, said the rationalisation recommendation was not the solution, because farmers cannot be expected to come up with the money to have it implemented.
John Egan responded, “If the farmers are not prepared to put in the money, then they won’t own the industry”."

Bord Bia says the devaluation of the Argentinian peso at the beginning of 2002 boosted exports giving beef from Argentina the competitive edge on global markets.
In addition to the chilled and frozen sales they also exported a further 66,500 tonnes of processed beef into the market. Following the re-opening of the EU market to Argentina exports showed an immediate sharp increase.
The largest sales were to Germany at 25,800 tonnes compared to 3,500 tonnes in 2001 with Britain taking in 21,000 tonnes compared to 1,000 tonnes, while other EU member states purchased 25,000 tonnes.
There are no specific figures available for sales into Ireland, but most recent information suggest Argentine’s beef has been much more widely used in this country in the catering trade over the past year.
The Argentines are also making an impact in Egypt.
The increase in sales to Britain has implications for Irish sales due to competitive pricing and together with Brazil it is now taking a significant slice of the British market.
Last year’s sales of Argentine beef to Britain was the equivalent of more than 100,000 cattle.
These are supply sources which have to be factored into the equation when reckoning the extent to which Irish beef supplies can benefit from the shortfall in British production for the rest of this year.

Up to 235 cent/kg (84p/lb) is available for good quality R grade cattle, but most of the factories in the south are offering 229 cent/kg (82p/lb), although some supplies which had been purchased in advance have cost them slightly more than that.
Suppliers maintain that they secured slightly more than the quoted prices from factories last week for cattle this should become cleared later today when the official pay sheet prices for the week become available but it is proving harder to get any top-up on the quoted rates this week.
The markets continue weak and supplies of cattle are plentiful in the south, a combination which is now a recipe for higher prices. The good cattle are making 235 cent/kg (84p/lb) in the midlands and further up.
The good news in the trade is that bulls under 12 months are worth over 280 cent/kg (100p/lb) for those who have them ready for slaughter. At the other end of the scale, the bad news is that any cattle over 36 months are impossible to find an outlet for.
Fortunately there appears to be very few on farms, but there is still a trickle of over 30 months and these are worth 224-212 cent/kg (80p-76p/lb). If they are over 400 kgs carcass weight and good quality the best bet is Galtee Meats, Charleville, where they will make 246 cent/kg (88p/lb), a price which is also applied to the younger cattle if they reach the weight and quality criteria.
The cow trade is remaining very stable with 185 cent/kg (66p/lb) for good cows as a general rule and some factories paying more in direct deals for the right type of animal as they have been for some weeks.

The best of the heavy double punched bullocks made up to €255 over at Bandon Mart yesterday - ranging from €80 over - and at Kilkenny they achieved a few euro’s more. The number of bullocks on offer at Bandon was down on last week and the entry of 560 cattle at Kilkenny was also lower than a week ago in common with the trend at mart throughout the week.
The quality single punched bullocks continue a strong trade. Prices were improved by 10/head at Kilkenny, with the tops of these animals making over €400 with /Kg. A lot of two Charolais 544 kg sold for €945, a Hereford 546 kgs made €895 and a lot of four Charolais 405 kgs made €785."

It examined the effects of the European Commission's proposals for the Mid-Term Review of the CAP and for the current round of WTO trade negotiations.
The FAPRI-Ireland Partnership is comprised of Teagasc, a consortium of Irish Universities, and the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri in the USA.
The purpose of the partnership is to conduct timely and relevant analysis of changes in agricultural policies and markets.
FAPRI-Ireland published a study in January examining the effects of one aspect of the MTR proposals only the Commission's plan to decouple direct payments to farmers. The latest study, published last week, takes account of the full MTR proposals, and proposals submitted to WTO by the Commission.
Minister Walsh said this independent study confirmed that the MTR and WTO proposals have important implications for Ireland.
Irish beef and sheep production would decline by 6% and 5% respectively, as a result of a reduction in the suckler cow and ewe numbers.
""However, following an initial price decline, beef and sheep prices would increase by 2012 to a higher level than would otherwise be the case (beef prices 9% higher, sheep prices 13% higher than the baseline). Irish milk prices would fall by the full 10% price cut set out in the Commission's MTR proposals, although there would be compensation in the form of increased dairy premia and milk quota.
The effect on the cereals sector would not be significant.
Overall, there would be a reduction in the output value of agriculture, but this would be offset by a reduction in input costs.
FAPRI-Ireland concluded that the Commission's MTR and WTO proposals would result in aggregate farm income at the end of the study period (2012) around 8% higher than would be the case if there were no policy change or trading environment changes.
Minister Walsh said the proposals would have significant effects on the structure of farming.
The number of part-time farmers is projected to be higher and the number of dairy producers is expected to fall significantly."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10082155.html,2003-05-22 01:00:00,On course for 1% per year farm income cut,"This was one of the conclusions of Teagasc economists Trevor Donnellan and Kevin Hanrahan at the Teagasc Outlook 2003 conference in Dublin. No change in current policies would result in declining prices for the major dairy products.
This would lead to a drop of around 15% in milk prices compared with prices received over the last three years.
Beef prices would only show a slight fall over the coming decade, they said.
But and overall decline of 8% in the value of output was on the cards, with farm input costs increasing by 3%, combining to cut net income generated in the agricultural sector by 9%.
In contrast, full implementation of the EU’s CAP reform, combined with some changes in world trade policies after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks, would result in agricultural income in 2012 being similar to that in 2002.
The WTO changes involve the EU cutting its export subsidies by 45% and reducing tariffs on imports to the EU by 36%.
The EU proposals would hit prices for the major dairy products, leading to Irish milk prices declining by 10% more than they would apply if current policies were continued.
Beef cow numbers in Ireland would decline by 16% and beef output would fall by 6%. Beef prices would fall initially but, by 2012, would be 8% higher than if current policies continued.
There would be a major re-orientation of beef exports, with 95% of exports going to EU markets.
“The combined CAP reform and WTO changes would lead to a decline of 2% in the overall value of agricultural output by 2012 compared with a continuation of current policy”.
“Under these circumstances, expenditure on inputs by farmers would fall by 7%.
“By 2012, overall agricultural income would remain at the 2000/2002 average”.
“Due to the ‘decoupled’ subsidies and the drop in beef production, the proportion of farm income coming from subsidies would rise from 65% in 2002 to 75% in 2012.”, the economists predicted.
Professor Bob Young, University of Missouri, told the conference that world supplies of meats and milk are likely to keep up with demand levels."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10087899.html,2003-05-22 01:00:00,Plans could lead to decline,"Teagasc economists, who are attached to the FAPRI Ireland economic analysis unit, have reached this conclusion, which they outlined at a conference in Dublin.
They predict, however, that the new policies would result in a rapid acceleration in the decline in the number of dairy farmers.
But they say that dairy farmers who stay in production would be better off due to a substantial increase in milk output. Those who leave the industry would also do better because of EU payments.
Teagasc economist Thia Hennessy said the number of dairy farmers would decline from 26,500 at present to 15,000 by 2012. Average milk output per farm would increase from the current level of 188,000 litres (42,000 gallons) to 320,000 litres (70,000 gallons) while the 15,000 remaining dairy farmers would have incomes 25% higher than if current policies continued.
Their analysis shows that the exodus from dairying would be significantly faster than if current policies were continued.
This would be due to a combination of lower milk prices and the availability of compensatory or ‘decoupled’ payments.
The EU proposals provide for compensatory payments for all dairy farmers, including those who quit production from 2004 onwards.
“The maximum payment of 4.5c/litres (20c/gallon) would be payable from 2008 and would act as an incentive for some farmers to cease production,” said Thia Hennessy.
The Teagasc analysis shows that the implementation of the reforms in the beef sector, which involve the transfer of EU payments from an animal-based to an area-based system, would mean that the majority of beef farmers would experience some improvement in income.
“Two thirds of beef farmers would do better, with some of these getting income increases of up to 50%. These are predominantly smaller producers who are already earning very low incomes.
“About one-third of beef farmers would do worse. These comprise farmers involved in calf production and also the larger producers whose payments would be cut under the modulation element in the new policies,” said Thia Hennessy. The Teagasc analysis also shows that around 10% of beef farmers will completely destock and allow their land lie fallow."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10075131.html,2003-05-22 01:00:00,Mixed reactions to Teagasc predictions,"He said Teagasc once again has produced a report at a crucial time in EU negotiations which is not based on fact. Such reports were harmful to Ireland's case in negotiations. Already, a previous similar report by Teagasc was used by Commissioner Fischler against Ireland at the EU Farm Council, said Mr O'Rourke.
He said Ireland must seek full EU compensation for any reductions in the support prices for milk.
""On the beef side, the Teagasc report highlighted the substantial losses which calf and weanling producers would incur if the Fischler proposals on decoupling were implemented. This must be addressed by the Minister"".
Macra na Feirme's new president, Thomas Honner, said the potential impact on young farmers is being forgotten in the rush to embrace decoupling. Young farmers who started farming after December 31, 2000 would have no decoupled payment entitlement.
""The Commission's planned national reserve for new entrants will not work if private trading of payment entitlements is allowed.""
Mr Honner also expressed concern that large amounts of supports would end up in the hands of individuals who were not actually farming.
Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture and food Deputy Billy Timmins said the FAPRI prediction that 10% of farmers would destock and leave their holdings fallow is in complete contrast to what his party was told by Commissioner Fischler that to avail of EU payments, farmers would have to carry out some farming activity and not using one's farm was a non runner.
John Deegan, president of ICSA, which supports the CAP proposals, said Minister Joe Walsh must now change his strategy on CAP reform. ""This study further vindicates the ICSA position in relation to the Fischler proposals"".
Mr Deegan said the second FAPRI report leaves Minister Walsh with no other option but to support full decoupling and to look for concessions in relation to WTO, hardship cases, young farmers and modulation."

Testing of machines should commence in September or October, with a view to machines being operational by year-end, he said.
Minister Walsh, replying to a Dáil query by Fine Gael TD Paul McGrath, said the beef carcase classification system introduced in all member states in 1982 provided a standardised system.
This ensured an equitable basis for payment to farmers, and a uniform method for reporting fat cattle prices.
He said the weekly price data from each member state provides the basis for EU beef market management.
“I am satisfied that the present grading system is operating satisfactorily. The accuracy of classification is routinely controlled by supervisory staff of my own Department and also by the European Commission’s carcase control group.” However, he confirmed that mechanical classification is on the way."

Meat plant operators were allowed flexibility in the first and second quarters to enable them meet commercial commitments. But they must stay within a reduced annual allocation, and must plan their activities to maximise the efficient use of the resources available.
The cost of the meat inspection service is extremely prohibitive. “I want to have a root and branch examination of inspection with a view to reducing costs while maintaining our high animal health status and ensuring that we have the most rigorous food safety regime in place,” he said in reply to Fine Gael TDs Billy Timmins, Fergus O’Dowd, Tom Hayes and Gay Mitchell.
“Over the next few months, I hope to bring about a streamlining of the whole meat inspection service,” said the Minister.
According to IFA, meat factories used the 20% cut in the meat inspection budget earlier this year to pull back cattle prices. Pig farmers have warned they cannot tolerate any disruption caused by a similar cutback in pig factory inspections.
They fear that these problems will re-occur in the autumn, when annual funding for inspections is on course to run out."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-10104252.html,2003-06-11 01:00:00,Food sector faces home strife but global ease,"It is, however, surprisingly positive about how well the publicly quoted sector has adopted to the major changes that continue to dictate how the global food market is evolving.
It says also that due to their relative small scale, the likes of Kerry, IAWS, Greencore, Donegal Creameries, Norish, Glanbia and Fyffes all look well positioned in the context of the evolving global food market.
It’s a view that should encourage those who have been strong advocates of the added value end of the market where margins tend to be better.
In his review of the sector, Liam Igoe of Goodbody Stockbrokers, reaches two basic conclusions.
For him the ultimate test of any strategy is the return on invested capital and the Irish publicly quoted companies have been best served in that regard when they ventured into high growth niche markets.
In the case of the Irish dairy sector the report concludes that a “federation style approach to each of the basic commodities may be more appropriate than full scale mergers”.
Indeed that viewpoint has been raised before. Jim Murphy, the last chief executive of Golden Vale, now owned by Kerry Group,
argued that the capital costs already in place were so significant that plant closures would come at a very high price and would be only marginally beneficial.
Where then does that leave the Prospectus report that argues for the merger of the processing capabilities of the top three dairy groups in order to cut costs and leave a bit more in profit terms for farmers and the dairy processors.
In his review Mr Igoe is forgiving of the mistakes of the past by Waterford and Avonmore, now known as Glanbia.
Glanbia is positioning itself better to exploit niche market segments in nutritional ingredients as well as fresh dairy products.
But it isn’t that long ago that the two companies combined were worth less than each individually when they were Waterford Plc and Avonmore Plc.
Indeed Greencore, which comes in for strong praise, has had an up and down few years before it got its act together through the acquisition of Hazlewood.
And Mr Igoe believes the group, is in the process of resuming sustainable earnings growth.
If return on investment is to be the guiding feature of the sector going forward the report suggests the Irish dairy sector ought to consider setting up a new company for each of the main commodity lines for butter, powders and cheese.
Over time each of the new companies would facilitate use of excess capacity during shoulder periods,
allow for greater use of the better plants while avoiding complex rationalisation issues.
And as Mr Igoe observes, it would also avoid “political” issues about which part would have to go in any shakeout.
Bearing in mind the difficulties faced in the rationalisation of the beef sector Mr Igoe’s suggestion sounds imminently sensible and deserves consideration.
But his overall view of the food sector is too benign.
His basic premise is that the industry has used niche markets to boost return on capital.
But in that context Kerry and IAWS have done this better than the rest.
His own study showing the two as the best earnings performers over a decade in the global food sector highlights what the Irish food sector can achieve.
It can be equally argued that the food industry in this country, including the beef end of the business, has promised a lot, but failed to deliver.
Both IAWS and Kerry have been highly focused in their niche markets but the sector has failed to produce one global brand despite the massive support from Brussels down through the years and the unstinting support for the farm sector from successive governments."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10118564.html,2003-06-11 01:00:00,Half-hearted CAP reform won’t help developing countries,"This is the main reason given for the reform of EU agricultural policy. The other reasons tend to get less attention because they involve far-off countries and are voiced mainly by organisations that are perceived not to understand economics.
These organisations, such as the World Wildlife Fund and Oxfam, accuse national governments of working together under the aegis of the EU to dump goods on foreign markets.
Most citizens believe that since Europe got rid of the milk lakes and the beef mountains there is nothing to dump.
However, when you get a pan-European consumers group like BEUC, under the direction of Irish man Jim Murray, saying the Common Agriculture Policy is bad for consumers and ethically immoral, maybe its time to listen up.
He says the CAP is a complete failure About 70% of subsidies go to only 30% of farms.
It keeps food prices at an artificially high price which hurts the least well-off who spend more of their budget on food.
European taxpayers' money is used to destroy the economies of the world's poorer countries. The extra money we pay to subsidise sugar, milk, meat, butter and flour allows these European products to be exported and sold at below cost prices.
Local farmers in even the poorest countries cannot afford to compete.
""Every time an EU consumer buys a kilo of sugar he is forced to spend part of that money on dumping sugar on the world market. So every time we buy a kilo of sugar we are forced to pay for an unethical policy and we have no choice in the matter,""
Mr Murray said. Many of these countries could protect themselves through imposing import tariffs. But as part of the deal with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (of which the EU and the US are members) they have been forced to drop these tariffs.
The World Bank and the IMF advised the EU and the US to also drop their tariffs but since they are not dependent on loans from these organisations, they have been able to ignore the advice.
Over the next few days Agriculture Ministers from the EU countries will battle against changing the CAP. They will in the end agree to a few minor adjustments.
But it won't improve the prospects of 70% of the EU's farmers, or the millions of farmers in the world's poorest countries."

Coping with such pressures will be one of the main topics of the Space 2003 agri-food show in Rennes, France, September 16 to 19.
Organisers of the show say poultry breeding, especially for meat, is facing an unprecedented crisis.
Markets have been heavily destabilised, notably due to massive importing from countries like Brazil and Thailand (more than 800,000 tonnes of meat imported).
Production costs for breeding chickens in Brazil are 38% lower than in France and 15% lower than in the US.
EU producers are not only losing their home markets to the low cost competitors; they are also losing previously lucrative non-EU sales.
In France, poultry producers are giving up the struggle, exiting the industry in unexpectedly high numbers.
The Netherlands have their own special problems, losing one quarter of their poultry in the recent bird flu plague.
Imports from South America are also playing a big role in EU pig farming. Brazil’s pigmeat exports increased by 80% in 2002, boosted by production costs at least 25% lower than European costs.
The Brazilians have squeezed Denmark and France out of the Russian market.
Meanwhile, low consumption levels have also hit EU pigmeat markets, now paying a disastrous €0.22 per kg less than cost price, according to the Space 2003 organisers. The show will also aim to advise dairy farmers on how to battle through Europe’s 18 months market slump.
Although disease worries and the agri-food slump have led some companies to back out of the September event, more than 1,600 exhibitors had already confirmed their participation by early May.
This livestock exhibition will feature nearly 650 animals."

Given that the indicators for the autumn trade for beef is not exciting with larger supplies and difficult marketing conditions looming, the demand for the quality forward store bullocks does not show any weakening in farmer confidence.
It is becoming difficult to see how many of these costly stores will leave any return with the prospect of an autumn beef price 76p-78p/lb. Given that there is an expected 140,000 finished animals in the system this year resulting from the very low live exports of 2001 and the latest figures from the UK showing that at best import requirements will be on par with 2002.
There was a flying trade for the quality store bullocks at Kilkenny Mart yesterday with a entry of 510 head for the sale. Single punched bullocks in the 500-600 kg range sold for €260 - €365 over E/kg and a top price of €384 over was paid for single punched in the 400-500 kg range compared to a top of €330 over last week.
Three 486 kg Charolais sold for €870, two 428kg Limousin made €795, three 418kg Charolais fetched €770 and three 4467 Charolais sold for €785 with improved prices all round being paid for these type of cattle. Beef heifer made up to €266 over and stores sold for up to €203 over E/kg.
There was a similarly strong trade for the heavy single punched bullocks at Bandon Mart. The best of the heavy single punched bullocks sold for up to €385 over E/kg last week they topped at €320."

Proposals for a 32% cut in butter prices and a 16% cut in skim milk powder prices will result in a 25% milk price cut, he said.
Mr Murphy said that, even allowing for the partial compensation provided, almost half of this price cut will translate directly into a net income loss for dairy farmers.
The proposal to abolish the target price is a clear attempt by the Commission to abandon dairy farmers to the vagaries of world market prices.
He said Mr Walsh must call a halt to this outrageous proposal and make defending dairy farmers' incomes a make-or-break issue.
As the crucial talks continued, Macra na Feirme president Thomas Honner said the latest compromise paper is particularly bad news for dairy farmers.
Price cuts of 8% per annum for the next four years on the dairy side are totally unacceptable and should be rejected by the minister.
Mr Honner said the proposal to allow member states flexibility on decoupling in the beef sector was a significant , but he was concerned it would lead to an effective re-nationalisation of CAP.
ICSA president John Deegan urged Mr Walsh to accept the 100% decoupling option in the compromise paper.
The alternative option, allowing member states to retain 30% of payments linked to production, is complicated, unnecessary and bureaucratic.
ICMSA president Pat O'Rourke said the compromise proposals must be rejected totally Farm incomes and future development of the food sector face unprecedented risk and challenge.
Mr O'Rourke claimed the proposals would lead to combined losses for farmers of over €1.7 billion by 2012.
Fine Gael agriculture spokesperson Billy Timmins said Mr Walsh must hold the Agenda 2000 position on dairying, where Dr Fischler's proposals would result in a dramatic drop in incomes."

Strong supplies of lamb from Britain at low prices and poor demand from consumers in France remains the underlying cause of the continued slide in prices, the future of which remains uncertain on the export market.
There is a strong home trade for lamb, which is taking a sizeable volume of supplies and underpinning prices to producers. The slight improvement in prices on Tuesday appeared to have brought a few more lambs to the factories, but producers are finding it hard to accept a drop of over 50 cent/kg in two weeks.
The trade for lambs steadied a bit yesterday with prices at Cahir Mart improved on last week. Butchers lambs sold from €30 to €36 over €/kg.
Beef prices at the factories dropped by 0.5p/lb to 1p/lb on average over last week, according to the pay sheet returns. The average paid for R3 bullocks was 87.6p/lb within a range of prices from 90.7p/lb (paid by Carrigans of Donegal) to the lowest factory average of 86.4p/lb. Average prices were slightly higher at AIBP factories at Bandon and Waterford, slightly improved at Dawn’s Waterford factory and slightly lower at the Dawn Midleton plant.
The average price for R3 heifers was just ahead of the bullocks at 88p/lb. The highest factory average of 93.3p/lb was paid by AIBP, Waterford.

An executive member of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association (ICSA), which supports full decoupling of production from subsidies, she runs a 110-acre beef farm plus a pig enterprise in Drumcummer with her husband Dermot. She said the concept of full decoupling is a good one and should positively affect Ireland’s agricultural markets, especially for beef farmers, without causing too many production and income hiccups.
It will also reduce the volume of paperwork, a prospect welcomed by Margaret as she says fine tuning the figures takes up precious time and energy.
She firmly rejected suggestions that cutting the link between production and farm support payments will result in farmers abandoning their land and ceasing to farm.
“Full decoupling will give us back that ability to farm sensibly and allow us freedom to increase or decrease our cattle herds as we choose,” she said.
“As the system was up to now, the factories, with one press of a button, were able to anticipate livestock numbers coming on stream for sale and alter prices to suit.
“But now the reality will be that any farmer will be able to go out and buy or sell without being locked into a timeframe of constraints.”
Margaret said many family members and friends are dairy farmers and she sympathised with them on the bad deal they got. Margaret, a mother of four, said she has always loved farming.
“I love the outdoors. I love the activity involved in farming. I just couldn’t imagine doing anything else,” she said, hoping that yesterday’s deal will now make that task more rewarding."

Figures released yesterday reveal a shocking level of waste in the EU with Irish farmers contributing hugely to waste butter and milk.
For example, last year Irish farmers produced 103 million lbs of butter for intervention to be added to the butter mountain. Based on the €1.90 Tescos charge for a pound of Kerrygold butter, Irish farmers alone produced €197m worth of wasted butter last year.
Last year Irish farmers produced 50,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder for intervention i.e. not for sale. That's €50m worth of waste milk based on the world market price of €1,000 per tonne.
For producing butter and milk which would never be consumed by the market, Irish farmers were paid €1.5bn in subsidies and direct payments.
The CAP reforms announced yesterday are aimed at ending this monumental waste across the EU. Up to now farmers got more money if they had more stock, irrespective of whether they could sell the stock or not, which led to butter mountains and milk lakes.
From now on they will be expected to produce for the market, producing only the quantity and quality consumers are willing to buy.
From 2005 farmers will receive a cheque in the post once a year to replace most of the existing premia.
Dairy farmers and the dairy industry accused Mr Walsh of selling them out and said the deal was a disaster for them. Some predicted losses of upto 40% in income. However, Donie Cashman of the creamery suppliers' group, ICOS accepting the reforms said: ""This is the reality.""
Beef farmers were less pessimistic but the attractiveness of getting a cheque in the post once a year for giving up their stock and doing nothing could leave meat factories short of animals to process.
A recent study carried out for the minister predicted a 16% fall in production which is considered to be a conservative figure.
The deal reached early yesterday morning following three weeks of on-off talks and a grinding all-night negotiating session is the most radical overhaul yet of the 45-year-old CAP.
Countries will have a choice of how they operate the scheme and in some instances will continue to receive partial subsidies. Mr Walsh will decide with the farming organisations over the next few weeks what option they will take in breaking the link between payments and production.
Farmers will have to abide by a list of requirements such as respect for the environment, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare standards.
There will be a reduction in direct payments for bigger farms and the money will be used to finance a new rural development policy in an effort to keep people in rural areas.
The Irish dairy industry has relied heavily on the EU buying their butter and storing it in intervention. That will be phased out by 2008 and there will be a 25% cut in the intervention price.
""Dairy farmers have five years to get closer to the market"", said Mr Walsh who succeeded in increasing the amount of butter that will be taken into intervention in the meantime.
Mr Fischler asked about the effects on the Irish dairy sector said: ""They have to realise there are other dairy products for their milk besides butter.""
Fianna Fáil TD, and former Junior Agriculture Minister Ned O'Keeffe said he was very concerned at the cuts and warned of future job losses in the dairy heartlands of Munster.
""It was the worst deal ever concluded for the dairy industry. There's no future for the smaller producers who have experienced significant milk price cuts since 2001,"" he said.
Fine Gael spokesperson Billy Timmins, TD, said Joe Walsh had accepted a bad deal and he must now account for his decision."

“The problem for Kerry farmers arises due to the pattern of farming where traditionally, calves and weanlings were produced and sold on to farmers for finishing in the eastern part of the country.
“Of the 75,000 male calves born annually in Kerry only 41,000 are retained and a direct premium paid on these cattle goes to Kerry farmers. Under decoupling, this payment will continue to be paid to Kerry farmers. However, the 34,000 young cattle sold off Kerry farms on which no premium is drawn down are causing a major problem. “Up to now these animals obtained a higher price in the market place to take account of future premium rights which will be paid to the farmer purchasing these animals.
“Under decoupling, this extra payment in the market place will no longer apply and the value of these animals will fall by at least 200 a head. This will cost Kerry farmers €7 million annually with a combined loss in beef and dairying for Kerry estimated at €24 million,” he said.
Mr O’Leary, chairman of the ICMSA beef and cattle committee, said many farmers in Cork, Limerick, Clare and along the west coast would suffer serious losses.
“You can’t be happy coming back to farmers with a worse deal than what they had,” he said."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10106593.html,2003-06-30 01:00:00,Doughty Dillon keeps delivering,"But the current leader, John Dillon, now coming towards the end of his first two-year term in office, took to the task like a duck to water and with a lot more energy.
The first Limerick man elected to the post, he has a style that combines a reputation for being a tough and tenacious negotiator, with a tendency for public protest when all else fails.
A non-drinker and former cross country runner, he was elected on the catchy slogan of ""Dillon delivers"" and with pledges to tackle falling farm incomes, growing bureaucracy, increasing costs, environmental and other issues.
He speaks in earthy but occasionally hesitant tones, is respected as a decent man who has been known to travel the length of the country to visit friends in hospital, and is close to his people and their problems.
Dillon's supporters are fiercely loyal to him and point to his first term successes in difficult times, but his critics say he can be impulsive, could show more vision and is sometimes reluctant to compromise. All agree, however, that he is totally committed, direct and without pretence and will never call a spade an agricultural implement.
Last year, he led action against beef processors that initially halted a slide in cattle prices, and then secured an increase worth over 50 per head. Another threatened price drop was prevented with staggered protests outside plants over a period of five weeks.
He also led a lobbying campaign on milk price in Ireland and Brussels. Seven EU increases in skim powder aid and three in casein aid followed talks involving Minister Joe Walsh, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler and the dairy industry.
Less successful was his effort to secure aid for fruit and vegetable growers who suffered serious losses and higher costs due to the wet weather. But changes in Farm Assist helped low-income farmers who were under pressure Dillon said a sheep identification system imposed by the Minister was impractical, unfair and not needed. IFA members returned some 2,000 registers.
""We got some positive results. Reconciliation is being sorted out and we are negotiating to see if we can get a more practical and more simplified system than is there at the moment.""
A grain industry meeting discussing prices was controversially gate-crashed in Dublin by the IFA ""I rushed in myself. I had 300 farmers with me. Eventually, after a period, we got the best possible price for grain, which was in Dairygold.""
Dillon recalled that the IFA made a submission to the Government last year on the farm income crisis in general, met 100 TDs in Dublin and had discussions with the Taoiseach and his Agriculture and Finance Ministers.
""Nothing happened and we went into the social partnership talks. But when the book of estimates was published, it contained cuts, cuts and more cuts, a doubling of disease levies and other changes. The budget later confirmed these proposals.""
Dillon believed it was time for stronger action if he could get the members to back him. The seeds of a week-long countrywide tractorcade protest were sown. But it was a high-risk strategy.
""We knew at that stage the Government or the public did not recognise or understand that we had an income problem. The tractorcade was a problem for me as well.
""Most of the people of Ireland and most of my own very close allies did not want to go with it. ""Eventually, after about three weeks saying we had to go with something, as there was no alternative, the tractorcade got the go ahead,"" he said.
Starting off in the cold sleet on January 6 in Bantry, farmers on tractors moved on Dublin from various parts of the country over the course of a week. They were headed for a rally outside Government Buildings in Merrion Street. Public support increased and so did the spirits of the farmers.
Dillon recalled: ""During all that week Minister Walsh was in denial, saying our income was 45,000 while we knew it was 15,000.
""Teagasc came out and confirmed our income the previous year was 15,800. That clearly showed Minister Walsh was wrong.
""When he found himself in trouble he said 'come into the social partnership process and we will try and deal with your concerns'.
""We went back into partnership but after three weeks of discussions, we had not got one cent for Irish agriculture or Irish farmers.
""At the same time there was 2 billion for the public sector and others. We were effectively pushed out of partnership.""
Dillon said himself and IFA general secretary Michael Berkery, in particular, worked extremely hard behind the scenes with as many officials and ministers as they could.
""We eventually came up with an agreement that went from a position of zero to one that was worth 250 million per year to farmers.
""We also have the strongest possible commitment from the Government that the disease levies, which were doubled in the last budget, will be brought back to what they were in the next budget.""
However, the partnership outcome was hotly debated within the IFA with some claims that Dillon did not secure enough for farmers. He accepts it was not a good deal but insists it was the best possible one in the prevailing economic circumstances.
He said: ""Dillon has delivered and is going to deliver more. I believe I have 95% of the support of the farming community, particularly the members of IFA.""
Recently elected vice-president of COPA, the committee of agriculture organisations in the EU, he loves the challenge of leading the IFA and said he will be seeking a second two-year term in office next November.
John Dillon, who has called a national council meeting in Dublin today to discuss the CAP reforms, believes he is the best person to lead the 85,000 member IFA for another two years.
But should anyone be thinking of challenging him for the post, he has friendly but typically blunt advice ""don't waste your time."""

Addressing more than 1,400 shareholders at the co-op’s annual general meeting at Cork Racecourse, Mallow, he said Dairygold has an excellent supply base.
It has a large milk pool, strong consumer brands in the Irish market and an emerging presence in the larger British market.
The co-op has a significant pigmeat business, an established beef business and a substantial agri-trading business, which has served it well over the years.
Mr Henchy said the question then is why, with this diversity of business, did Dairygold report losses for 2002?
It had done so for a number of reasons, all of which will be addressed decisively in the near and medium term as a matter of priority, he said.
He said dairy market returns fell dramatically by more than were reflected in the fall in milk prices last year.
Continuing downward pressure on market returns, ongoing reduction in EU supports and the impact of currency exchange against the dollar and sterling, pose a substantial ongoing problem for the dairy industry in
Ireland and for farmers.
These outside-our-control factors, and downward price pressure from New Zealand’s dairy industry, has contributed to a significant fall in the returns achievable.
“The challenge facing the Irish dairy sector is reflected in the reality that at one point last year the price that the international marketplace returned for 1kg of cheddar cheese produced in Ireland, was lower than the cost of the Irish milk required to produce it,” he said.
Mr Henchy said Dairygold can do little to change market returns but it is committed to using its financial strength and asset base, its processing capability and its determination to build a new and stronger Dairygold.
“We will build a strong business capable of sustaining profitable dairy processing in Ireland while maximising sustainable returns to farmers from milk production.
“Going forward to re-build the business into a highly efficient major food business, hard decisions will have to be taken and implemented to put Dairygold on a strong footing to meet the challenges that now face Irish farming.
“This will involve reducing costs, improving performance and processing and selling dairy and consumer foods products in the most efficient and profitable way possible,” he said."

IAWS’ north American interests are set to drive the growth story in the shares.
The joint venture with the Tim Hortons chain is set to contribute to profits for the second half of the financial year to the end of July. IAWS is now supplying around 1,600 branches of the chain.
The company’s Cuisine and Pierre brands continue to grow revenue at 10% in Ireland and at 10-20% rate in Britain, Ms Brodie said in a research note.
British brand Delice is growing at 10%. Although the London market has slowed down considerably, the company continues to do well through expansion into regional areas of Britain.
The company is currently fully integrating CdF, Pierres and Delice, combining purchasing, distribution, and telesales divisions. Costs and benefits will not be felt until next year.
Merrion will take $1m or 1.5% of EPS off the model to reflect this delay in the expansion of Cuisine’s margin.
However, this will have benefits for future margin expansion. Roma continues to perform well for the traditional food operation and will be ahead of last year.
Ms Brodie said IAWS management did not regard CAP reform as a material threat to the long-term profitability of its agribusiness operations.
“The key to Ireland maintaining output is the quota for milk and beef within the country.
If smaller producers go out of business, the quota will be recycled back to larger producers, so there will still be a similar level of dairy output and a similar animal population for IAWS products.
“In addition, larger farms and lower dairy prices will drive more intensive farming (using more fertiliser and feed).
""Consequently, the company is happy that while this business is mature, it will continue to produce a steady contribution for the group over the long term,” she says."

Prices for R3 bullocks was weaker by 0.5p/lb on average with the average for O3 bullocks back by upto 1p/lb.
The larger processing groups are a good barometer of the trade and all three paid lower average prices last week for R3 bullocks. Dawn plants were down an average of 1p/lb, with AIBP and Kepak Group both paying around 0.5p/lb less than the previous week.
Nevertheless the average for R3 bullocks at 242 c/kg (86.6p/lb) was just ahead of the quoted prices for the week at most factories.
Carrigans of Donegal Meats led with an average of 255c/kg (991p/lb). Seven factories Newgrange Meats; Slaney Meats; AIBP; Clones; Liffey Meats; Exel; Jennings and Bergins all paid 244-245c/kg (87.1p-87.6p/lb).
The average price for O3 grade bullocks was a shade under 83p/lb.
The mean for R3 heifers was 245c/kg (87.5p/lb) against a top price of under 91p/lb at Carrigans and 89p/lb or better average paid by Kepak, Clonee and Watergrasshill; At AIBP Clones and Waterford, Liffey Meats and Meadow Meats the average for O3 was 82p/lb.
Bergins Moyvalley Meats in Co Kildare dominated on prices for cull cows paying a strong 73.4p/lb average for R4L and averaging 69.8p/lb for O5.

Indeed, judging by her tone of voice, if they don't get a move on, she'll propel them from the dearer to the cheaper pub on the toe of her boot.
She's right, of course. If people have two good legs, there's something severely wrong with them if they don't employ those legs for transport to where they can buy whatever they want to consume at a cheaper price.
Now, OK, what's wrong with them may be basic Irishness. Not being racist, but the Irish would much rather complain than fix.
We'd much rather bear a grudge than a solution. Vocal victim is our default position and where would the phone-in programmes be if we were otherwise?
And now here's the deputy Prime Minister attacking our basic rights. If Sir Bob were her spokesman, he'd be summarising her viewpoint thus:
""If you can't be arsed to go to the cheaper pub, then shut up with the moaning. You're part of the problem.""
It's all very upsetting. We've been raised, educated, trained and accustomed to clapping one hand to our forehead while pointing to the latest outrage with the other and saying,
""This is the Government's fault, they must do something about it.""
Up to now, Government spokespeople have gone along with us.
They've maybe whimpered that throwing money at the problem won't solve it, but we all know that's like our mothers saying if you pick that scab, it won't get better, and we've tried it and it did.
But we don't tell our mothers, because their self-esteem is tied up in advice like that and anyway we have to say the same thing to our own kids.
Everything's grand as long as everybody plays by the rules. But the Tánaiste either doesn't know the rules or isn't playing by them. She's giving us no sympathy for being exploited.
She's not promising a task force or an inquiry or nuthin'. In fact shock, horror she's blaming the victim. More or less telling us all to compare prices and go where we get the best bargain.
This woman clearly has no future. She'd better go out to Europe and be a Commissioner or something.
Being an EU Commissioner is a whole lot easier and better-paid, as jobs go, than being a price comparer. I spent seven years of my life doing the latter.
Not every day, you understand. Just once a week, for a radio programme. Once a week was enough.
One day comparing prices and you're ready to chew the curb on the way home. You cannot, for example, assume that if you pick up a can of Whiskas priced at 89c, all its Whiska companions are the same price.
The Beef and Gizzards variety may be cheaper this week than the Tuna and Sheep kind.
Or the first can could be a leftover from the June batch and accordingly be cheaper than the July arrivals all around it.
Inflation will do that to Whiskas. So committed price comparers must check the labels of three different units of each item in each shop. In a basket of as few as twelve items being compared between, say, Tesco, Superquinn, Dunnes Stores and Centra, that's nearly 150 separate prices. Enough to make you realise the limitations of the back of the average hand as a place to note the differences.
Nor do the complications stop there. Seasonal and store varieties are a nightmare.
Hallowe'en is hell. Every supermarket has its own brack, each one makes it in marginally different sizes and weights, and each accessorises its brack uniquely.
One store will take a minimalist, Bauhaus approach, inserting just one ring, whereas the shop down the road will have the Kelly Osbourne of bracks, decked out in twigs, rags, rings, coins and beads, in a challenge to the buyer's every tooth.
As for comparing the prices forget it. Price comparison has its rewards. There's a kick to finding the occasional quantum leap in cost between one emporium and another.
Except that the quantum leap is always on something inessential, like carbo-covered rice cakes or fruit-of-the-forest air freshener.
Those exceptions aside, the bottom line of comparison grocery-shopping is that it is best done by the bike-riding child-free obsessive jobless.
Bike-riding, because if you use a car, you waste any savings on petrol and worsen everybody's asthma with your emissions.
Child-free, because spending a day comparison-shopping with children has to be some form of abuse in itself yet having them cared for, as we all know, would wipe out the profit.
Obsessive, because a grid or computer program is needed to collate and compare the data, and jobless, because anybody who has a job right now spends so much time getting to and from that job that not even to please the Tánaiste could they find the time to do serious price-comparing.
However, since prices are inflating as fast as the Hulk and likely to run much longer than he is, reviving the tradition of the actively discerning assertive consumer might be a good idea.
I said this to the driver of the taxi in which I was travelling when the Tánaiste gave her bracing advice.
It's always fun to praise a Progressive Democrat to a taxi driver. Especially if you're reasonably near where you're going to when you do it.
This particular taxi man got quietly analytical, rather than hostile. The issue, he said, is not one of individual prices.
The issue was an overall price inflation which left the Irish customer sheared like a sheep when compared to other Europeans, a price inflation which is too frequently justified by the extra costs involved in getting goods to an island nation.
""Lanzarote is an island too,"" he pointed out. ""Same as Ireland. Only worse. Much smaller. Not near a big trading partner like Britain. Volcanic, too, so the only thing that'll grow on it is a few oul' vines. Far away from everything. But it's cheap. Really cheap by comparison with Ireland.""
No matter what item was mentioned, he could give the direct contrast between Lanzarote prices and Irish prices, right down to a steak dinner ""with everything"".
As a holiday-maker, this was important. ""You can't tell tourists to shop around,"" he said. ""They're only here a week. They should be able to trust the Government to make sure they're not ripped off.""
But, I pointed out, he, as a tourist in Lanzarote, had done precisely what he was saying holidaymakers didn't do.
""That's because the wife and meself have decided inflation here is too high,"" he replied.
""We can rent out our place, get a one-bedroom apartment on the beach out there and live better without having to do more than part-time jobs.""
Consumerism + an unregulated market = emigration. It's the new math."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10102742.html,2003-07-17 01:00:00,Reformed CAP will not facilitate ‘sofa farming’,"Anyone looking forward to ‘sofa’ farming in the reformed CAP seemed to have their hopes dashed last week by this announcement from EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler.
In a speech to the European Parliament, he re-clarified the key elements of the reform.
Member States have several single farm payment options. They may choose to introduce it in full. Or they may opt to retain up to 25% of the payments for arable crops; or continue to couple up to 50% of the premiums for sheep and goats; keep the slaughter premium or 75% of the special beef premium, or the suckler cow premium plus up to 40% of the slaughter premium.
They can also retain up to 10% of direct payments for measures that have a positive environmental effect or improve the quality and marketing of agricultural products.
The single farm payment will be brought in on January 1, 2005. “But, in certain, well-grounded cases, its introduction may be postponed until January 1, 2007,” said the Commissioner.
Direct payments for milk will be integrated into the single farm payment scheme, once the reform of the dairy sector has been completed. Payment entitlements in the three year period of 2000 to 2002 will be used as a basis for calculating the decoupled single farm payments.
A transfer of payment entitlements will be possible with or without land between farmers within the same member state. Payment entitlements will trigger direct payments only if accompanied by eligible hectares.
In addition to this standard approach, Member States may implement the single farm payment at a regional level.
If they wish to do so, they have a broad range of options at their disposal, including the redistribution of money between holdings, between regions, and within regions.
“This gesture towards subsidiarity is by no means a step towards
regionalising the CAP, but merely serves to introduce some flexibility where this is warranted and does not distort competition,” said Commissioner Fischler.
Farmers receiving direct payments will be subject to compulsory cross-compliance. For this purpose, a list of 18 statutory European standards in the field of environment, food safety, and animal health and welfare has been established, and failure to comply with these standards will lead to cuts in direct payments, in addition to the sanctions generally applied. The same applies in respect of compliance with good agricultural practice.
A rate of 1% will apply to set-aside, and the system will be integrated into decoupling. This means that farmers will receive set-aside entitlements calculated on the basis of historic references. Organic farming is exempt from the set-aside obligation. Other farmers may continue to rotate set-aside land, and grow renewable raw materials on that land. A new support measure is also being introduced for renewable raw materials, amounting to 45 per hectare.
For cereals, the intervention price is unchanged but monthly increments will be cut by half.
The Commission proposes to extend a reformed milk quota system until the 2014/15 marketing year. The 5% reduction of the intervention price in three steps agreed at the Berlin European Council will be replaced by asymmetric cuts in the intervention prices in four stages for butter and three for skimmed milk powder. The quota increase decided under Agenda 2000 will be postponed to 2006.
New rural development measures are targeted towards enhancing food quality, animal welfare, and compliance with standards. Support measures for young farmers will also be reinforced.
Direct payments to the bigger farmers over and above 5,000 franchise will be reduced by 3% in 2005, 4% in 2006 and 5% from 2007 to 2013.
Up to 2006, CAP expenditure remains within the planned framework. Starting from 2007, a new mechanism for maintaining budgetary discipline comes into play."

The drop in quoted prices for cull cows has been proportionally reflected in the actual prices paid to suppliers which were down by 3p-4p/lb. Bullock supplies were tight last week and some factories paid nearly 1p/lb more on average for their supplies, while at the other end of the scale a few of the processors dropped their prices with one factory paying an average of less than 84p/lb for R3 supplies.
Most factories paid within a very narrow price variation for R3 bullocks with two-third of the operating plants returning an average between 86p/lb and 87p/lb., mirroring the overall average for the grade of 86.6p/lb. Carrigans of Donegal Meats paid the highest average at 91.7p/lb.

Over a full year, from June 2002 to date, sales have amounted to 167,000 tonnes. Bone in beef sales over 12 months amounted to 104,000 tonnes and 63,000 tonnes of boneless beef.
Sales of intervention out of storage in Ireland was at the bottom of the league amounting to 6,453 tonnes of boneless beef, compared to France at 351,997 tonnes of which 14,353 tonnes was bone-in beef. German sales amounted to 42,366 tonnes, of which 30,662 tonnes was bone-in beef and 11,704 tonnes was boneless.

Very few cattle were actually bought at the lower prices quoted last week by some of the plants who reduced their prices by 3 cents/kg (1p/lb). The majority finished up paying more than their quoted prices to get cattle during the week.
Most of the factories quoted 241 to 229 cents/kg (86p to 82p/lb) this week for R and O grades with an additional 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) on offer in the midlands and up to 250 cents/kg (89p/lb) being paid for R3 steers in the north west.
Last week’s factory kill at 31,078 head was 1,600 head higher than the previous week, but 800 head lower than the corresponding week in 2002.
The steer kill last week at 15,475 head was up from 14,000 the previous week while running at 1,000 head less than the same week last year.
The early indications this week were that there is likely to be very little change in the supply of cattle. But an increase should begin to show over the coming weeks, as more cattle come closer to 30 months, and producers get anxious to move out before the 30 month point is reached.
Factories are not penalising for over 30 months animals presently, if there is only a few included in a load of cattle, but they reserve the right to penalise if supplies increase, which they should do within a month of so, when February 2000 born calves will have reached the 30 months point.
Cow prices have shown a slight recovery at the lower end of the price scale, and they are making 179 to 185 cents/kg (64 to 66p/lb). There has been a drop of nearly 1,000 cows per week in the supply, which still remains nearly 25% up on the same weeks in 2002.
In the markets, Britain has reported lower trading and easier prices for the past week, with the volume of beef on the market having increased. The trade in France has weakened with the warm weather and in Holland, trade has been described as sluggish, with demand also on the quiet side in Germany over the past week."

MSVC, with headquarters at Tramore Road, Cork, services over 500 independently-owned SuperValu and Centra supermarkets. The plant will include an on-site laboratory and training facilities and will be open to undergraduate training.
It was selected as the retailers' primary beef supplier on account of its guaranteed Irish supply and outstanding record in supply and processing, food safety and animal welfare.
A beef traceability scheme has also been developed by Kepak Group and MSVC that provides instant traceability on freshly cut beef, electronically at the butcher's counter.
In 2003, MSVC will record over €70 million retail sales of fresh Irish beef products, all processed in Watergrasshill facility. Kepak also supplies some of the company's lamb, through Watergrasshill and Hacketstown.
MSVC only buys 100% Irish beef and lamb, and is in the process of establishing exclusive supply partnerships with major Irish processors in all fresh food categories.
Managing director Michael Nason said the commitment to Irish produce has always been part of the Musgrave policy, although growing competition from imports has led to the group developing more market-focussed strategies with its supplier partners.
""We know that SuperValu and Centra shoppers prefer Irish products, and this has intensified following controversy over the quality of some imports, and also the pressure on Irish jobs.
Mr Nason said centralising SuperValu and Centra's meat supply will increase efficiency, allow complete traceability, and ensure consistent quality.
Price, promotional offers, availability and product range will also improve for consumers.
Kepak procures raw material from over 10,000 meat producers throughout Ireland and, at 250,000 cattle per annum, represents 15% of the total kill in the Republic. It supplies 9,000 tonnes of beef per year to MSVC."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10122589.html,2003-07-31 01:00:00,Arrival of February cattle hits prices,"It remains to be seen if the processors will buy cheaper supplies this week, following their reduction of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) in quoted prices in the south, where supplies of cattle have been more plentiful over the past week.
In effect, most factories have been paying at least 3 cent/kg (1p/lb) over the quoted prices for steers and heifers in recent weeks as confirmed by the official Department of Agriculture pay sheet returns but there are now strong signals that they are moving to pull back the cost of animals.
Export markets are not very exciting and the processors have been complaining that cattle were costing too much relative to these markets.
Across the south, there was uniformity in prices on Monday with quotes of 238 and back to 227 cents/kg (85p-81p/lb) for R/O grade steers and heifers, after a drop of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) on quoted prices for the previous week, and back by at least 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) on the price paid in June by most of the factories.
In the midlands and the south east, prices remained unchanged at 244 and back to 232 cents/kg (87p to 83p/lb) and further north, up to 250 cents/kg (89p/lb) is quoted for R3 steers.
Steer supplies were up 2,200 head for last week's kill at 17,643 head, making it the second consecutive week of increasing supply of steers at the factories.
Inevitably, prices came under pressure.
The seasonal increase in supply is coming at least a month earlier than usual because of the 30 month factor, and is much more pronounced in the south than the midlands or north.
The Cattle Movements Monitoring System shows that February registrations are up to three times that of January because of the calving pattern in the dairy herds and this should ensure a continual strengthening of supplies for August, as February 2001 born animals are slaughtered just ahead of the 30 months.
While there is presently no price penalty for the trickle of over 30 months cattle going through the factories and farmers are fearful that this policy may change, if the numbers increase there is a charge of €20/head for BSE testing, levied on the producer of over age animals.
Prices for cull cows have also stabilised, at 182 and back to 179 cents/kg (65p to 64p/lb) and supplies continue strong at nearly 20% ahead of corresponding weeks in 2002."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10056543.html,2003-07-31 01:00:00,Kepak's all-Irish beef deal,"MSVC said it chose Kepak to implement its policy of buying only 100% Irish beef and lamb, on account of the meat group's outstanding record in guaranteed Irish supply and processing, food safety, product innovation and animal welfare.
Kepak now becomes the source of MSVC's 21% share of the Irish beef retail market.
The Meath based company has 15% of the cattle kill in Ireland more than 250,000 animals per year including the KK Producer Cub and Certified Irish Angus Alliance.
The group is also one of Ireland's biggest lamb processors.
The MSVC deal is good news for more than 2,000 Bord Bia Quality Assured farms, which supply more than 35,000 prime beef animals into Kepak at Watergrasshill, Co Cork per day, producing 9,000 tonnes of beef worth €70m at retail level.
Although most of the beef for MSVC comes from Munster, some of the cattle carcases put through the integrated Watergrasshill plant and its unique Foodtrace system come from Kepak's plants at Clonee, Co Meath and Athleague, Co Roscommon. This €15m plant replaces the company's previous plant on the site, burned down two years ago.
It generates at least 250 jobs, 130 or which are already in place, with added security for employees, compared to much of the seasonal work in the beef industry, which has traditionally depended on unreliable export and intervention markets.
Kepak's home market breakthrough heralds in a unique meat traceability system jointly devised with MSVC and the EAN bar coding standards body, which will eventually enable the labelling of meats in the MSVC shops with farmers' names and addresses.
Already, in the initial stage of this Foodtrace system, if customers query the quality of any piece of meat, the Foodtrace number on the pack allows the retailer to track it back, through the beef factory and to the farm.
The group are first to perfect an electronic system which labels the primal cut after an animal is slaughtered and tracks it through the meat factory to the consumer pack or to the shop cash register from which the price label is generated for ""serve-over"" meats freshly cut by a butcher.
The system can equally be used for traceability of other meats, such as chicken or lamb.
In the trial stores, staff have welcomed the time saving from not having to hand-write prepack labels, or write out the ""whiteboard"" on which all butchers are required by EU legislation to identify where their retail meat comes from.
The EU requires all food and feed businesses to have a traceability and recall system in place by 2005. Foodtrace complies with current and impending EU legislation, and replaces the less reliable, manual ""whiteboard"".
EAN Ireland, which upholds bar coding standards, worked with MSVC and Kepak to put Foodtrace in place.
Together, they have perfected a system which provides all the relevant product information at the touch of a button, in the event of a food quality problem.
The new traceability system has got the blessing of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.
""This Information Technology solution means that any customer query as to the source of the beef and its movement through the food chain can instantly be checked,"" said Dr Wayne Anderson of the FSAI.
MSVC's Fresh Commodity Category Manager Denis Cronin says they will also use the Foodtrace system to reduce the variation in the eating quality of Irish beef.
MSVC Managing Director Michael Nason says the retail group's unique and exclusive arrangement with Kepak has very distinct advantages.
""Both companies are Irish privately owned.""
""We both have clear long term strategies for the beef category, based on fundamental consumer research. We simply make sure we talk to and listen to our customer and, most important, we act"", said Mr Nason. ""The overall objective is to support a long-term, sustainable beef business for both parties, which also supports the Irish economy and jobs"".
He revealed that MSVC will shortly release the results of independent tests carried out in University College Cork which showed eating quality, taste and tenderness of the group's beef were unsurpassed in the Irish market."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-10106372.html,2003-08-01 01:00:00,Future is not as bleak as it seems,"The transportation aspect of operations will be outsourced, which means that the jobs will still be there, but they will be managed by a specialised transport company, possibly set up by those currently employed by the co-op.
There have been suggestions that Jerry Henchy, the new chief executive of Dairygold, was painting the blackest picture possible in order to shock people into facing reality. That is a tactic adopted at the outset of making radical changes.
It helps to ensure that people do not panic when things appear to go wrong. Those people are then generally relieved if the worst does not occur.
Irish agriculture and food processing is undoubtedly in a state of flux. Last year, Dairygold's profits fell by 80% to just €4.8 million, on turnover of €950m.
In reality the company had a trading loss, because it actually made 6m profit from the sale of its valuable stake in IAWS.
Some insisted that selling off the company's valuables was not a remedy, because actual reform was needed. It was compared to taking aspirin when surgery was required.
This led to a revolt among the farmer-owners of Dairygold, and a motion of no confidence ended with the removal of nine of the ten-member board of the co-op.
In its annual report for 2002, Bord Bia indicated that there was a poor global demand for dairy products and that prices were historically low so those exports dropped by 16%.
But there were record sales in this country's exports of frozen and processed beef to Britain. Even though the volume of overall beef exports declined by 8%, the actual value rose to €1.2bn, up by 31%. Thus the overall picture has some distinctly positive aspects.
Kerry Group has already blazed a trail from a dairy co-op to a food ingredients producer on the international market with a proven track record. As a former senior executive with the successful Kerry company, Jerry Henchy has a vision of where he wants Dairygold to go. ""We want to move to milk processing, consumer food, UK division, agri and suburban superstores,"" he explained. ""That's the broad approach.""
With the expansion of the European Union, Irish farmers have to recognise that they no longer have the kind of influence which they enjoyed following our accession.
Our economic position may have been strengthened by participating in the euro, but our ability to influence the broad course of developments has been weakened by that participation, as well as by the CAP reviews which brought quotas, premia, and now decoupling and modulation.
Necessary changes are inevitably hardest for those most resistant to change. Nineteenth-century farming and business methods became obsolete during the last century, and just as surely the methods of the last century are going to become obsolete in this century."

Queues of more than 200 continuously wait to withdraw cash from the ATM machine at the course and there's nothing you cannot buy if you're willing to pay big.
If the money's not spent on essentials like a €7 beef roll a decent investment if you need sustenance after a night drinking outdoors in Shop Street then it's gambled.
Wads of cash are handed over to the bookies who nearly all drive to the course in very large cars, including many top of the range Mercedes.
The amounts spent in the fashion race are also in the flamboyant bracket, with some ladies flying to London and Paris to find the perfect quirky style for Ballybrit.
One gang that enjoys a gamble but still ends the week as winners is Fianna Fáil. The party departed Ballybrit last night with an estimated €150,000 in profit after a successful week of fundraising. Meals and a few drinks over at the FF tent set the party supporter back €380 on Wednesday and Thursday, but it's worth it.
After all you get to sit close to Bertie and he even makes a speech and will answer questions if you go over and have a chat with him.
You also get a bit of food, including salmon and baked sea bass, and the decent people at FF throw in some complimentary golf balls as well.
It might still seem a little expensive but then again Bertie is not known to field many questions or speak very much in the Dáil.
This of course all suggests the Government might work more effectively if the public was willing to give FF just a bit more money.
That's the key to Ballybrit, if you pay anything is possible, except maybe a reliable tip to clean out the bookies.
Around 280 people enjoyed the buzz at the FF tent again last evening but the price of a meal there fell to €225 yesterday.
It was probably still beyond the range of the penniless punters roaming around Galway after a difficult Thursday."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-10045106.html,2003-08-06 01:00:00,The realities the entire dairy sector must face,"It was quite extraordinary however that those on the phone whining about the coverage of the story by us were the farmers.
In particular, they had a gripe with the suggestion that Dairygold was paying more to farmers.
The implication was that farmers were getting higher prices than before for their milk and the second slur of what we wrote was that farmers are to blame for the job losses.
That was never even meant to be implied, let alone said openly.
The new young Turk at the helm in Dairygold, Jerry Henchy, has already spelt it out that the cost structure of the organisation was not sustainable.
Need farmers be reminded that last year the co-op sold over 6m shares in IAWS to shore up its performance.
Without that fire sale, Dairygold would have made several million losses.
It had to be borrowed because the price paid for milk, though lower than that paid in the previous year, could not be recovered in the markets due to huge pressure from New Zealand and other low cost producers. Those are some of the realities facing not just Dairygold but the entire dairy sector.
Farmers were given some of the blunt facts at the annual general meeting. Cheese sold in Britain last year fetched less than Dairygold paid farmers for it at the farm gate.
That’s the kind of reality that has caught up on the Irish dairy sector, not just Dairygold.
The bottom line is that cost cutting is essential.
That means fewer jobs and significantly fewer jobs for workers in Mitchelstown and Mallow, in particular, and in the entire catchment area where the country’s biggest dairy co-op has its base.
Dairygold wasn’t alone last year is selling off IAWs sharers. It looks as if a substantial portion of the sector was forced down the same road as the big co-ops moved to ensure some return to farmers.
That means fewer jobs and significantly fewer jobs for workers in Mitchelstown and Mallow, in particular, and in the entire catchment area where the country’s biggest dairy co-op has its base.
Dairygold wasn’t alone last year is selling off IAWs sharers. It looks as if a substantial portion of the sector was forced down the same road as the big co-ops moved to ensure some return to farmers.
It is projected that the number of dairy farmers will drop from the present level of 23,000 to half of that in another few years, because making a living from the land is no longer possible under the current arrangement.
If one looks back over the years, agriculture has been culled through a process of attrition that is continuing to impose massive change on Irish and European farming.
More than half the farmers of the country will be turned into gardeners.
The other part of that process is the threat to jobs at Dairygold.
Ever since Denis Lucey retired, speculation mounted that the person coming in to replace him would have a huge job of work to do to restore competitiveness.
For the group’s 3,300 workforce, where the axe will fall is still the unanswered question.
A few things have been established in the meantime. Transport is being privatised. CMP Dairies in Cork is not to be closed under the plans.
The fate of the four dairy plants are under a serious cloud with at least two, if not three, to get the chop.
Beef processing is for sale if the group can finds a buyer. It lost up to 18m in recent years, hardly a recommendation to any potential buyer but then beef processors are a breed apart and seem oblivious to the pressures they also face in the change sweeping global food markets.
Pig farming is going to go and the total job losses either through redundancies or jobs that are sold on with bits of the business will be at least 1,500.
Judging from the reaction to last week’s announcement, workers need not expect too much sympathy form the farmer shareholders as management slices through the inefficiencies with cold precision.
Sympathy for those less fortunate is not high on the agenda of farmer suppliers to Dairygold."

The trading picture has changed even more radically for beef finishers buying weanlings next spring.
""Farmers must realise that the Fischler Reform is no longer a set of proposals, they are now reality, and the biggest challenge between now and 2005 is to effect a smooth change over"", said Derek Deane, chairman, IFA National Livestock Committee last week.
He added, ""Farmers have to realise that payments will no longer be linked to production, and they should gear to produce what the market wants, and get the best price. Processors must bear in mind that there will be no reason for farmers to produce, unless there is a profit"".
Mr Deane said that the Fischler proposals are more important to Ireland than any other member state, and future market prices must be attractive enough for Irish farmers to produce.
""We have to get people thinking now on the implications of the change and we have to look at all of the mechanisms to smooth the change-over. Beef prices will have to rise, if production is to be maintained, because there will no longer be a necessity to produce to qualify for direct payments"", he said.
Putting current markets in perspective, he said, ""In 1986, I got £60 for a lamb and a workman earned £25/day. Yesterday, I got £60 for a lamb and a workman earns £80 a day"".
Eddie Punch, General Secretary, ICSA, said that most farmers were not yet conscious of the impact of the change and its immediate implications.
""I believe a lot of farmers buying calves now will have to apply for the single bull premium at the higher rate on these animals, instead of the 9 and 21 month premiums, and will have to defer castration. Bull calves registered since the beginning of May will not qualify for the 21 month premia before the CAP Mid Term Review change-over and, therefore, will not get extensification. It is unlikely that they will be slaughtered in time to get the slaughter premium"".
While sales of calves are light at this time of the year, the market changes will become more evident next spring in calf and weanling sales and the calf export trade."

Supplies cost slightly more at some factories, but a cross check on a range of factories shows variations in average prices from the previous week, were very slight. While the supply of bullocks increased by a further 1,700, the average paid for R3 bullocks remained rock steady.
The average price paid for R3 bullocks by factories in the AIBP, Dawn and Kepak groups was unchanged. The average for R3 bullocks across all factories was 86.5p/lb with three quarters of the processors paying an average of 86p/lb or better and seven factories paying an average of 87p/lb or higher. They were Carrigans, Exel, Liffey's, Newgrange, Slaney, Kepak at Clonee and AIBP at Clones. The average price paid for O3 bullocks was a strong 82.5p/lb.
Heifer prices continued slightly ahead of the bullocks at an average of just over 87p/lb for R3 grade with more than half those processing heifers paying the average or better. Carrigan's of Donegal and AIBP at Waterford paid an average of more than 90p/lb. Exel at Kilbeggan paid an average of over 89p/lb. The average for O3 heifers was 81.5p/lb - lower than the average for the same grade bullock by 1p/lb.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10097673.html,2003-08-07 01:00:00,Supply variation worth 12 cent/kg,"But there is more than a hint from the processors that prices are coming under pressure and they are giving no forward price commitments.
The general run of prices at the factories on Tuesday were 238 and back to 227 cents/kg (85p to 81p/lb) for R/O grade steers and heifers across the southern half of the country. As in previous weeks, supplies in the midlands are making 3 to 6 cents/kg (1p-2p/lb) more and in the north west, up to 250 cents/kg (89p/lb) continues on offer for R3 steers.
Due to the bank holiday on Monday, some of this week’s kill was bought forward at last week’s prices.
And with supplies increasing more in the south than up country, both Galtee Meats at Charleville and Dawn Meats at Midleton had almost their full requirements for the week by lunch time on Tuesday.
The supply situation was not quite as strong at Fair Oak, Clonmel or the Kepak factory at Watergrasshill and, moving up the country, supplies were lighter.
Although the pressure of the third census date, which has been set for July 20, is no longer a problem, producers are very conscious of the 30 month age factor.
It is affecting the market in the southern dairying counties, where February calvings are about three times the level of January.
February 2001 registered animals are reaching the 30 month mark in the coming days and weeks.
Presently, there is no difference in price for under or over 30 months animals, because the over-age cattle are no more than a trickle, but that state of affairs may not continue, if the numbers of older cattle increase.
There is, however, a penalty of €20/head on all over 30 month animals at the factories for obligatory BSE testing.
Trade for cows has eased slightly this week, with prices ranging from 179 back to 168 cents/kg (64p to 60p/lb), and supplies continuing strong with the weekly kill staying 15 or 20% ahead of the corresponding weeks in 2002.
In the marts, there is a very strong store trade, particularly for the quality animals.
Up to €450 over was paid this week at Kilmallock Mart for choice, single punched continental bullocks, and the best of the weanling bulls made up to €500 over €1/kg."

And ICMSA president Pat O'Rourke predicted that the country's suckler herd of 1.1 million cows will decline dramatically unless the income position of calf and weanling producers is protected.
But the excellence of the livestock at Tullamore left ICSA president John Deegan assured that the raw material is in place for progress.

Ironically, assembling the original version is relatively cheap.
Period rooms evolved gradually to answer the changing needs of the family. Your accumulated kitchen should have that same relaxed organic flavour, seeming to have evolved with the ages. This is not to take away from the appeal and efficiency of fitted units. Far from being a 1950s invention, fitted kitchen units were just as prevalent in great country homes of the 18th century as freestanding kitchen furniture.
Matching, fitted pieces staged around a kitchen create a keen sense of uniformity and can carry a number of discreetly integrated appliances.
If you want the best of both worlds, consider a terrace or two of high quality streamlined fitted units, interspersed with some unusual freestanding pieces. Don't be afraid to mix periods. If the quality and design is right, the furnishings will sit well together whatever their age.
Old style kitchens were often comprised of a variety of different cupboards (often prized elements from various eras), a free standing sink, a free standing cooker or stove, a scrubbed table as the essential work surface, and in many cases the king of kitchen furnishings, the dresser. Naked hardwood might feature in a grander kitchen which was comprised of a warren of rooms, pantries and washing areas for servants to carry out various tasks. A simpler home would tend toward painted pine. Many of us find it hard to fathom, but pine was almost universally painted in the 19th century. A bare pine kitchen is actually a modern development despite its supposedly ""rustic"" appeal and painting up a variety of pieces rather than vouching for naked timbers can provide a useful visual harmony.
The weight of furnishings in a vintage kitchen tends towards the ground. Where there is shelving, is tends to be open shelving, which is why metres of wall mounted units in a woody, Victorian kitchen can look somewhat incongruous. During the 19th century chinaware became more affordable, and was openly displayed, making dressers very popular. Glazed cabinets retain the airiness of open shelving, without the hassle of dusty, greasy dishes lingering on an open shelf.
Curtains in the place of blind doors are an almost extinct practice, but under a sink or over a set of crudely built, deep shelves, a machine washable curtain makes an attractive and economic choice.
Elements of character in your kitchen can demand more work. The pieces should be sturdy, worm-free and consider just how will you clean up the mess if you send a slop of beef gravy down that gorgeous burr walnut façade? Some freestanding pieces of furniture such as pantry cupboards are raised up on legs, a delightful look. However, be prepared to flail around under such items with the vacuum pipes on a regular basis. If you decide on say an old wooden filling cabinet as a pot cupboard (a classic cheat), and it abuts another elderly unit that's out of plumb, there will be a gap between them that can quickly start to fill with an avalanche of lost food and waste. A clever carpenter can address variations in worktop depth and even surface heights, but even slender vertical gaps between units are bad news. Incidentally, unless you crave an authentic dose of 19th century food poisoning, work surfaces must be durable and lend themselves to meticulous hygiene. Scuffed layers of lead based paint may look charming, but could prove lethal.
An old cupboard may have served any number of purposes in its former life, and the variety of sizes and shapes available in junk shops and auctions is endless. Wardrobes or linen presses can serve in a kitchen as a larder or anything you fancy. This is going to be an important working item in the busiest room in the house, so check your dimensions before grabbing a huge, unwieldy piece of furniture and keep your sentimentality under control with an eye to practicality.
Will the doors open without cracking passersby in a narrow kitchen space? Can you get even get your booty through the front door? Does it logically fit the space?
Old dressers are often too big for the dimensions of a modern kitchen, so expect to pay a premium for highly desirable compact pieces.
Corner cupboards and wardrobes are very useful in an awkward space, but check the cupboard forms a true angle, as some were custom built to fit an irregular wall. School cupboards and butcher's blocks are also very popular and retain their presence and usefulness in the most orderly kitchen."

Manager Michael Harty said any day that single punched stores are selling for over €300 with €/kg in August it is a good trade. Sores with both premia available made well over E400 in excess of E/kg.
A single punched Limousin 584 kgs sold for €940, two Charolais weighing 517 kgs made €850, and two Herefords weighing 520 kgs sold for €820. In the 400-500kg range the trade was similarly strong for the single punched. Three Charolais 447 kgs made €795, a lot of 10 Charolais 436 kgs sold for €770 and two Limousin 411kgs made €720 all making good prices for quality stock.
Beef heifers at Kilkenny made up to €230 over €/kg, butchers' heifers up to €220 over and the stores sold at up to €205 over. The bullock sale at Bandon Mart was bigger and trade was as good for all types and slightly better for some lots. The forward single punched store made up to €330 over and lighter lots up to €260 over. A lot of seven Charolais 417 kgs sold for €750. Clean ears bullocks sold for up to €430 and a smaller entry of heifers sold for up to €160 over for beef and up to €200 over for beef.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10059202.html,2003-08-19 01:00:00,Prices stable as producers firm,"Prices remained very firm at factories in the south yesterday apart from a slight weakening for the poorer quality stock but returns were reduced by 3c/kg (1p/lb) in the midlands, where supplies of cattle are now increasing.
The excellent weather for livestock is proving a factor in maintaining prices, with no pressure on producers to lighten stock. Harvesting has also been taking the attention of some farmers from the sale of cattle over the past two weeks.
Factories across the south were quoting 238c/kg (85p/lb) for Rs yesterday similar to last week but while 227c/kg (81p/lb) was still on offer at some factories for O grades, others had dropped to 224c/kg (80p/lb). In the midlands, prices were back 3c/kg to 229-241c/kg (82p-86p/lb), while some producers are reporting flat prices of 235-238c/kg (84-85p/lb) across the country for good stock.
In the northwest, higher prices are still being paid, with up to 250c/kg (89p/lb) being held out for by producers with good R grade bullocks.
The rate of increase in the supply of bullocks eased off a little last week, but the indications yesterday were that supplies have picked up again this week and factory quotas are being filled more easily.
Last week's bullock kill, at 19,703 head, was 2,200 head higher than the corresponding week last year, directly reflected in the overall kill of 34,089 head, compared to 32,327 in 2002.
Cow prices are slightly better at the lower end of the scale, at about 173-179c/kg (62p-64p/lb)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10111030.html,2003-08-21 01:00:00,Prices for cows and bullocks remain stable,"The average price paid for bullocks remained firm, while cow prices were also stable.
There was obviously an element of premium price young heifer beef in the kill much more pronounced at some factories than others which would have influenced the overall average price of 88p/lb for R3. The emphasis on quality young beef was underlined with a difference of 7p/lb opening up between R3 and O3 grades, the latter coming in at a weak average of 81p/lb. However, the number of factories that paid an average of more than 88p/lb for their kill of R3 animals reflected a buoyancy in the heifer trade.
AIBP at Waterford topped the league, paying an average of 99p/lb for R3 heifers. Meadow Meats paid an average of 93.6p/lb, Kepak at Clonee, and AIBP at Nenagh both over 91p/lb average; Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff over 89p/lb and Carrigans of Donegal and Dawn Meats at Midleton, both over 88p/lb.
In contrast, nearly two-thirds of the factories bought their supply of O3 heifers for an average of less than 81p/lb and four factories paid an average of less than 80p/lb.
Bullock prices were practically unchanged for R3 grade at 86p/lb average within half cent/kg of the previous week with the top average of 91p/lb paid by Carrigans. There were very few R3 bullocks bought for less than 85p/lb and half the factories paid 86p/lb or better. Carrigans, Liffey Meats, Dawn Meats, Waterford, Exel Meats, Newgrange Meats, Kepak at Clonee, and AIBP at Nenagh were all in the top seven-paying factories. The average for O3 bullocks was 82p/lb. Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare, paid the top price of 69p/lb for cows (R4L) with Liffey Meats paying the highest price for O and P grades at 68p/lb and 65p/lb.

Export subsidies directly damage farmers in developing countries by reducing the price they can get for their output. Farmers in west Africa, for example, have had to leave the land because they could not compete with subsidised beef exports from the EU.
Because of the damage they do to poor countries, EU export subsidies have been universally condemned by development organisations, international institutions, developing countries and very many independent experts. In relying so much on export subsidies Irish agriculture is doing direct damage to poor farmers in poor countries.
BEUC, the European consumers organisation, will be among many other groups at the WTO meeting in Cancun calling for a speedy end to EU export subsidies and other supports that damage the developing world.
Finally, it is also sad that Irish dairy products and beef have to be dumped on the world market with the help of export subsidies. In relying on them more than any other EU country, Ireland is producing more beef and dairy products that nobody wants to buy unless sold below cost.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10113456.html,2003-08-28 01:00:00,Fingers crossed for six more weeks,"There has been a slight strengthening in beef prices this week, particularly noticeable for the lower grades, with at least 227 cents/kg (81p/lb) being quoted for O grade at most of the factories.
The weekly steer kill is 25% higher than for the corresponding weeks in 2002 at over 20,000 head last week, and the factories are looking for what cattle they can get, reporting a “steady supply”, but not in excess of requirements.
More cattle are being marketed in August than in previous years, and cattle farmers are keeping their fingers crossed that the market stays steady over the next six weeks, through the seasonal supply peak.
Given the prices which store cattle cost earlier this year, they’ll need every cent which they can get to make any profit margin this year.
Across the south, factories quoted 238 to 227 cents/kg (85p-81p/lb) for R/O grades this week, an improvement of 3 cents/kg for O grades at some factories. In the midlands, prices held steady at 241 to 229 cents/kg (86p-82p/lb), and some stock in the Northern regions of the country continue to make close to 250 cents/kg (89p/lb) for good cattle, although the higher prices appeared to be a little harder to get this week.
Some factories are now reporting increased numbers of over 30 months cattle being offered for slaughter.
The obligatory BSE testing is costing €20/head with these animals, and a price cut of 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) is being applied where a large percentage of animals are overage. Prices are not being cut where there are only a few over 30 months animals in a load.
The factory kill last week increased by 2,500 head, to 36,505 head, of which steers accounted for 20,725 head, an increase of 1,000 head. The steer kill for the same week last year was 16,718 head.
Cow prices are continuing very firm, with improvements of up to 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) in the quotes for this week which range from 182 back to 173 cents/kg (65p to 62p/lb) Cow numbers have dropped under corresponding year earlier levels, a reverse of the trend over the past two months. The weekly kill has eased to 6,000 head."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10079981.html,2003-09-04 01:00:00,Slimmer pickings as steer prices fall,"A good percentage of the cattle slaughtered during the first two days of the week were purchased forward at last week’s prices, but the general trend of buying this week has been for a reduction of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb), indicating the first bite at the price as the sector head into the autumn peak.
Most of the factories across the south are quoting 235-224 cents/kg (84p-80p/lb) for R/O grades with 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) more on offer in the midlands and in the North West a bit extra for R3 steers, but not available for R4 grades.
Cattle supplies to the factories have continued to increase, with the current prices and the 30 month factor driving the trend, which pushed the kill last week to 38,359 head an increase of 1,800 on the previous week.
The steer kill last week increased by almost 3,000 head to 23,433 head falling fractionally short of the peak weekly kill of 2002 at 23,603 head in the week ending September 14, 2002.
There has been an increase in the number of animals over 30 months turning up at some factories in the south over the past two weeks, but the overall remains at no more than a trickle, confirming that most producers are moving out just ahead of the 30 months. That pattern tallies with the increase in supplies which has been experienced for August. The indications for the first week of September are that the pattern will intensify to reflect the animals born in the peak calving month of March being slaughtered just before they reach 30 months.
The impact of this is likely to result in more pressure on prices over the coming weeks with the likelihood that the peak weekly supply for the autumn will be experienced this month. Processors complain that cattle have been costing them too much, but given the prices which were paid for store cattle earlier this year, producers are making very little at current prices.
The trade for cows has weakened at some of the factories this week. Up to 182 cents/kg (65p/lb) is to be got for good cows, but more generally prices are ranging 173-0168 cents/kg (62p-60p/lb) a drop of 6 cents/kg (2p/lb). The weekly cow kill has moved slightly ahead of previous year levels."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10082454.html,2003-09-04 01:00:00,Prices’ soft landing continues,"Official pay sheet prices from the processors for last week show the gradual slight easing pattern of recent weeks continued right up to the weekend ahead of the heavier reductions in quoted prices which the processors announced last Monday.
The reduction in the average paid for R grade cattle last week was less than 0.5p/lb and it remains to be confirmed if the drop of more than double that level of cut, announced this week, will take full effect as the weekly supply of bullocks exceed the peak of autumn 2002.
The average for R3 bullocks slipped under 86p/lb last week. Nearly half the processors paid an average of better than 86p/lb. Carrigans of Donegal were the tops at 89.4p/lb. Meadow Meats, Rathdowney, Dawn Meats at Waterford, and Newgrange Meats at Navan all paid over 87p/lb average. Two factories paid an average of less than 85p/lb. The average for O3 bullocks was 81.7p/lb, prices ranging from 86.3p/lb to 80p/lb.
Heifer prices continued a lead of 1p/lb over the bullocks with an overall average of 86.7p/lb. AIBP, Clones paid an average 91.4p/lb - which probably included a mix of under 12 months’ heifers, for which a premium price was paid.
Kepak at Clonee recorded an average of over 90p/lb. Carrigans of Donegal, Meadow Meats at Rathdowney, AIBP plants at Nenagh and Waterford, and Liffey Meats, Ballyjamesduff all paid over the average.
AIBP at Clones were the strongest buyers for cull cows last week paying the highest average for both R and O grades at 69p/lb for R5 and 71p/lb for O5 grade.
Liffey Meats, Ballyjamesduff paid highest for P grade at 67.6p/lb average."

The reduction came with an increased kill at factories last week, to more than 40,000 head, with the steer kill increasing to more than 25,000, and exceeding the peak weekly kill of the 2002 autumn.
Across the south, most factories dropped the prices for under age animals to 232 and back to 218 cents/kg (83p-78p/lb) for R/O grades. There was a little more to be got for O grade in the midlands, and prices in the north west ranged up to 243 cents/kg (87p/lb) for R3, slipping back to 232 cents/kg (83p/lb) for R4, and sliding to 221 cents/kg (79p/lb) for O4, nearly on a par with southern prices at that point on the grading scale.
Supplies of cattle to the factories were reported to be very strong on Monday, with many farmers moving ahead of any further drop in price, which led to some factories being booked up for the week by Monday evening, claiming that demand is quiet on the markets for their beef.
The differential of 5p/lb appearing between R and O grades will impact heavily on suppliers in poorer grading regions, where up to two in every three animals are falling into the O grade category.
Producers of quality animals have long campaigned for a better profit margin for quality cattle, and processors are responding now.
Most farmers have been selling at under 30 months, resulting in only a trickle of over-age cattle in the kill.
Processors had no price penalty in place for the odd over age animal turning up in a load which must carry the BSE test cost of 20/head but they say they will introduce a price differential if they get more over 30 months cattle.
Cow prices remained unchanged this week. They are ranging from 182 back to 168 cents/kg (65p-62p/lb)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10122380.html,2003-09-11 01:00:00,WTO not a convincing farmer’s friend,"Now, in Mexico, what the World Trade Organisation seems to offer them is even harder times, so that small farmers in the Third World get a chance to eke a living out of the land.
Perhaps the soundbites from Cancun don't tell the full story, but it's hard for European farmers to swallow what's on offer the remote hope that farmers who can't even feed themselves at present will somehow rise up and become a trading force to be reckoned with, able to feed their own populations and even break into the world food markets.
In Brazil, these farmers don't even have land. They risk their lives trying to steal a few acres from the landlords who cut down the Amazon rain forests and employ them at such low wages that Brazil can export beef to Europe, pay duty on it, and still take market share from European farms.
In other countries, the peasants make their meagre wages labouring on coffee, cotton or tea ranches owned by multinational companies, or in multinational factory food operations which poison the environment. They are a long way from becoming viable farmers in their own right.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan says the farm products of poor countries are excluded from rich countries by protective tariffs and quotas, and heavily subsidised food products from the same rich countries push prices down in poor countries, where farmers are consequently put out of business.
He wants the chance for poor countries to trade their way out of poverty. Irish farmers wouldn't mind a similar deal, if there was any hope of them making enough money on farming alone to survive without subsidies.
Just surviving is a more pressing problem in the Third World. Mr Annan says the WTO must arrange access to cheap generic drugs for the millions suffering and dying in poor countries.
Perhaps he should concentrate on this, rather than hope to turn third world farmers into international traders overnight.
Here, the Irish Farmers Association has rightly pointed out that the EU cannot be asked to give away the food security for its 440m people, and depend on the vagaries of world markets, climates and conflicts, and multinational companies.
As it is, the EU is the only ""rich nation"" trying to help the Third World, by moving from big farms getting 70% of subsidies to rewarding small farmers who raise expensive, high-quality food that is rarely exported, thus doing no harm to the Third World.
In contrast, Americans boast that one out of every three acres is planted for export, and their industrial scale farms get 90% of their farm aid. Inexplicably, their WTO trade representative, has proposed cutting more than $8 billion of subsidies, but only if Europe makes deeper cuts.
The obvious explanation is that the $38m of political funding per year for President George Bush from America's industrial-scale farmers pulls more weight than starving Third World farmers.
The trade ministers who negotiate the WTO agreement probably have their own priorities, boosting the slowly recovering US and European economies and ending Japan's slump.
They want to increase personal incomes worldwide by up to $520 billion by the year 2015, through trade liberalisation; unfortunately there are much more powerful forces fighting for their space at this trough than small farmers, whether of the EU or the Third World."

Numbers of cattle were up at the marts yesterday with entries more likened to normal for early October than mid-September in a year of excellent weather.
A bigger entry of cattle at Athenry Mart yesterday, particularly in the bullock ring, met with a variable trade.
While prices were maintained for the quality continentals, plainer cattle were harder to sell. With a big increase in the number of Friesian type bullocks, prices for the forward double punched animals fell back to €/kg with the good Friesian making up to €100 over €/kg while the double punched continentals sold for up to €235 over.
Some of the plain single punched Friesian were bought for €20 over €/kg. Heifers were less affected and made up to €190 over for the choice continental.
A larger entry at Fermoy Mart met with a steady trade. Double punched continental bullocks making up to €155 over and up to €320 over, being paid for single punched.
There was a slight improvement in the trade for heifers at up to €155 over for butchers heifers.
There was a bigger entry of weanlings at Ennis Mart where the continental bulls sold from €330 to €370 over and up to €420 over €/kg for the tops.
There was a quieter trade for heifers at €70-€140 over €/kg.

“They must drive the change that is required by demanding that co-op boards and management work together to bring efficiencies beyond the boundaries of each co-op.
“The industry must strip costs to the minimum, cut out duplication and achieve economies of scale in milk collection, processing and marketing, as well as co-ordinating investment to generate higher market returns,” he said.
Major players in the industry attended the meeting at the invitation of Agriculture and Food Minister Joe Walsh, who presided.
Mr Dillon said without urgent action, up to 10,000 dairy farmers could be forced out of business as their incomes are squeezed by the effects of CAP reform. The IFA would not allow this to happen.
It was putting the industry on notice that farmers must get higher milk prices.
Macra na Feirme president Thomas Honner called on Mr Walsh to reduce expansion costs.
The IFA national council has, meanwhile, decided that full decoupling in sheep, beef and grain is the best option."

It was Albert Reynolds' testimony at the beef tribunal that brought down his first government in November 1992. Faced with what amounted to a perjury accusation, O'Malley had no real option but to bring down the Government. The same tribunal also played a major part in poisoning relations in the next Government as well.
Following the release of the beef tribunal report, Reynolds rushed into print claiming ""total vindication"", without giving his Labour colleagues a chance to digest the report. Trust between Reynolds and Dick Spring was so badly undermined that day that it was only a matter of time before another incident brought down the Government.
Charlie Haughey was forced to step down in early 1992 by the re-opening of the telephone tapping scandal, but this was just the last straw. He had to go because of a series of business scandals, in which the events leading to the Beef Tribunal played a major role.
Albert and Charlie were not the only Fianna Fáil leaders who got into cowboy trouble, however. Beef problems also hastened the departures of both Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch, and played no small part in undermining the ambitions of George Colley.
Lemass stepped down in 1966 during of a bitter dispute over beef prices with the National Farmers' Association (NFA), the forerunner of the IFA. His difficulties were exacerbated by the fact that his Minister for Agriculture was his son-in-law, Charles Haughey.
The EEC had closed its doors to Irish cattle that April and this was compounded by a dock strike in Britain, which meant that the main markets were closed to Irish beef 80% of which was for export. When the dock strike ended, Irish cattle were dumped on the British market and prices tumbled.
Haughey told farmers to hold on to their cattle to allow prices to rise, but Rickard Deasy, the president of the NFA, advised them to sell as prices were going to fall further. When RTÉ reported this, Haughey was indignant and he telephoned the news department.
""I felt compelled in the public interest to protest that the NFA statement should be carried immediately after mine,"" Haughey explained.
""I gave specific advice to farmers in reply to questions from deputies in the Dáil as the responsible minister, and I felt that to have my advice followed by contradiction from an organisation could only lead to confusion and damage the industry.""
They were an uppity crowd in RTÉ in those days, weren't they? Imagine having the nerve to contradict the advice of a minister! But when the little fella called, they got into a funk.
The item was dropped from further broadcasts. Questions were asked in the Dáil about this blatant piece of news management and Haughey came across in all of his arrogance as he argued that RTÉ was wrong to air advice that contradicted him.
""I think it was a very unwise thing to say the least of it, for Radio Telefís Éireann to follow that solemn advice of mine, given as Minister for Agriculture, with a contradiction by one organisation,"" he said.
This almost caused a strike at RTÉ. Little over a week later the NFA set out from various centres on a march to Dublin. Deasy walked 210 miles from Bantry. People joined the march on the way and some 30,000 farmers arrived in Merrion Square for a protest meeting on October 19, 1966.
This was the forerunner to the recent tractor cavalcade, but the ""poor farmers"" in 1966 walked to Dublin, while the latest crowd rode on expensive tractors demonstrating their poverty by exhibiting their wealth.
The 1966 protest was much more effective. After the rally in Merrion Square, nine of the leaders went to the Department of Agriculture to protest, but Haughey refused to meet them, so they camped outside on the steps, insisting that they would stay there for a month, if necessary, until the minister met them.
As this dispute got worse, Lemass announced that he was stepping down as Taoiseach. He was planning to go soon anyway, but the dispute forced his hand.
Thirteen years later, in December 1979, Jack Lynch also decided to go earlier than he had planned. He was essentially pushed by the so-called gang of five. One of them, Tom McEllistrim Jnr (whose father actually proposed Lynch for Taoiseach in 1966) was adamant that their real motive was not to oust Lynch, or even elect Haughey, but to prevent George Colley getting the job.
IN his budget earlier that year, Colley, as Minister for Finance, had tried to introduce a 2% levy on the earnings of farmers.
The levy was to apply not only to money paid for cattle but also milk, cereals and vegetables.
Joe Rea, the president of the IFA, denounced the proposal as ""absolutely outrageous"". Even though farmers were still being asked to pay less than half the rate of tax of the PAYE sector, he said that they would not pay the levy, because it took no account of the individual farmer's ability to pay. Poorer farmers would have to pay the same 2% levy as the rich.
It reads almost like the sounds now being made by Joe Higgins and the garbage gang.
Traditionally, richer farmers tended to support Fine Gael, which had antagonised its supporters by bringing in income tax for the wealthier farmers during the previous Government. Then Fianna Fáil irked its own supporters among the small farmers by trying to tax them.
Amid the ensuing uproar the Government backed down, which provoked even more outrage among PAYE taxpayers. They organised a series of protest marches around the country.
On March 11, 1979, some 50,000 people marched at a rally organised in Dublin by the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, and there were other marches in various urban centres.
Colley had antagonised the farmers by trying to introduce the levy, and the PAYE workers by dropping it.
Lynch wanted Colley as his successor, but the gang of five were determined to block him. It was in an attempt to prevent them from organising properly that Lynch allowed Colley and Martin O'Donoghue to persuade him to step down early and call a snap meeting to elect his successor with just two days' notice. But they got it wrong, because Haughey was already better organised. Truth was, they couldn't have organised a party in a brewery.
When the Goodman cowboys backed down this week, it was an indication that the centre of power has shifted in Irish politics. Larry's former mouthpiece in the Dáil, Liam Lawlor, no longer enjoys his former influence. Times have changed.
The way things are going, Lawlor and his old Dublin West constituency colleague, Joe Higgins, could be sharing a cell before long.
Wouldn't they be the odd couple!"

Enquiries to factories were lighter than normal yesterday, indicating that recovery in the supply is unlikely this week.
The result has been factories have held their prices for R grade at 229 cents/kg (82p/lb), with O grades being quoted at 218 cents/kg (78p/lb) an improvement of 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) at some factories and steady at last week prices for the remainder of the factories.
Supplies last week may have been affected in the southern half of the country by farmers taking a break at the Listowel Races.
This week’s supply was expected to be down because of the traditional pattern of farmers taking time out for the National Ploughing Championships which opens in Co Meath this morning.
Some procurement managers confirmed yesterday they will not pay over the quoted prices this week to get cattle, because demand is not hectic and expect supplies to increase next week.
There has been some increase in the number of overage cattle showing up at the factories, but so far suppliers are not being penalised other than for the cost of the BSE testing at 20/head.
Cow prices at the factories continue unchanged ranging 176-168 cents/kg (63p-60p/lb) with supplies continuing around 7,000 head per week."

The Egyptians still cannot afford to pay the full EU price for beef. leading Minister Walsh to seek extra EU subsidies.
Egypt was Ireland's largest market for beef in 1999, taking more than 150,000 tonnes, worth €254 million.
But Irish beef was included in a ban on European beef introduced by Egypt after the BSE crisis in 2000.
Egypt re-opened to Irish beef in October 2001. But trade in commercial volumes had been hampered by Egyptian rules on the type of eligible cuts, until last week's easing of these rules.
Mr Walsh told last Friday's Agricultural Science Association annual conference in Kilkenny he remains committed to rationalisation of the beef industry, and he hopes it will be done in a way that respects competition policy and improves competitiveness.
He praised the industry for moving to earlier finishing of cattle, in response to additional opportunities on the British market. But he expressed dissatisfaction with cattle price trends. ""Such market developments should be reflected back in producer prices, by way of rewarding the quality producer"".
""Not only should the pricing system reflect the needs of the market, particularly in terms of quality, it should also include a level of transparency and clarity that engenders the full confidence of the farmers who supply the primary product,"" he said."

R3 grade heifers prices resisted the drop with least effect keeping an average of 2p/lb over R3 bullocks, but a 7p/lb difference emerged between R and O grade heifers.
A difference of up to 10p/lb has opened up between the best and worst-paying factories for similar grade cattle.
However, some allowance must be made for premium-priced animals under 12 months beef and contract- produced animals in the returns from the top paying processors.
The factories paid an average of 82.4p/lb for R3 bullocks with individual factory averages ranging from 86.3p/lb to 80.4p/lb.
Carrigans of Donegal were the leaders on price, followed by Kepak at Watergrasshill, AIBP, Waterford, Slaney Meats, Meadow Meats and Liffey Meats.
Average prices paid at factories in the three major processing groups, AIBP, Dawn and Kepak were all lower than the previous week by between 1p/lb and 2p/lb.
The average paid for R3 heifers was 84p/lb. The highest factory average was 89p/lb at Liffey Meats.
The average for O3 heifers dropped to 77p/lb.
The average for cows was weaker by up to 3p/lb. Meadow Meats paying the highest average at 67p/lb for R5 grade and Fair Oak at Clonmel were highest on O and P grades paying an average of 66p/lb and 64p/lb respectively."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10120813.html,2003-10-02 01:00:00,A dispassionate view of farming,"Sixteen months on, his latest analysis of the outlook for agriculture is again worth consideration. Economists have been relatively silent on the CAP Reform, the greatest change facing the Irish agri-food sector for decades.
Like everyone else, they are waiting patiently for the full details. But Professor Matthews and his colleagues Ronnie O'Toole and Janine Jensen have had a preliminary look at the figures.
They predict that full decoupling would have a positive effect on the Irish economy, due to ""improved allocation of resources"". They say the effect would be even more positive, if the constraint that land and family agricultural labour must remain in agriculture were relaxed. Farmers who take pride in their work and their contribution to the economy may not be too pleased with such findings.
It's a typically dispassionate view of farming from , just what one would expect from its authors. Professor Matthews, who has been a trenchant opponent of the CAP. ""We are forcing farmers to produce at a loss in order to qualify for direct payments, a crazy and distorted waste of resources,"" he said 16 months ago.
He warned then that farmers were getting used to subsidisation, and eventually wouldn't be able to compete in real markets.
Direct payments regardless of quality were causing farmers to lose interest in quality production or in responding to consumer needs, he warned.
He went on to predict a version of the decoupling that is now on offer. ""After five 'extremely painful' years, the only limit to the expansion of Irish agriculture would be the ingenuity and skills of farmers,"" he said last June.
Now, with the Luxembourg agreement of last June in place, he does not see so much pain ahead for farmers; instead, he predicts income on cattle and sheep farms growing by 2.2% and 1% respectively, and falling by 2.7% on cereal farms, if there is full decoupling.
As cattle production falls, price would rise, partly as a result of improved efficiency, because farmers will no longer keep animals at a loss, in order to be eligible for livestock premia. The economists see high quality land released from the higher subsidised cattle and sheep sectors, into alternative uses, allowing the cereals sector to increase its usage of land and dairy farmers to relax stocking rates. They see cattle production falling 11%, cereals production increasing 15.9% and sheep production decreasing 2.3%.
Interestingly, they predict an increase in the price of beef for the home market of 7.4%, because of reduced supply of the domestically produced beef which Irish consumers strongly prefer. If so, butcher heifer production could become more lucrative.
They see imported beef playing a stronger role in processing. Although cattle production is predicted to decrease by 11%, output of processed beef would decrease by only 8.9%, due to increased usage of imported beef.
However, in food processing overall, which currently gets 50 to 60% of its inputs from Irish farms, CAP Reform is expected to have a 'significant' impact on output and employment. Another tip from the economists, which the Government will no doubt take on board, is that full decoupling knock 1.2% of total Irish greenhouse gas emissions.
The economists say partial decoupling would increase national greenhouse gas emissions yet another black mark against that outcome. But their figures would indicate grain incomes increasing 6%, with partial decoupling.
It's all just numbers to the economists, but our more progressive and commercial farmers will be doing their best to drive the industry forward, without the coupled payments that put nearly 14 million cattle and sheep in the fields of Ireland.
The economists' fears that farmers might forget how to compete in real markets are belied by the 92% of our top beef farmers who intend to maintain or increase stock numbers, according to a Teagasc survey.
Just 8% intend to reduce numbers, one-third intend to expand.
Perhaps the most encouraging finding is that a majority are conscious of the need to improve the quality of stock and finish beef animals at a younger age."

But its authors have estimated the long-term BSE bill at 92 billion, far more than is generally appreciated. Much of the cost will be carried by farmers, mostly in the form of a long term beef price decline of about 3% a year.The latest farmers affected are in Canada, where a single case in May 2003 is costing $11 million a day in lost exports.
“Though the epidemic is drawing to a close, the technical and economic impact will continue. Consumer confidence in the integrity of the food chain has been severely damaged. Government agencies and controls have been discredited”, said the authors of the report, who were also critical of farming methods and the meat industry.
They said there are three main unanswered BSE questions: what was its real origin, what is the future of the human disease CJD, and what to do with 16m tonnes of beef waste, formerly converted to meat and bone meal.
The verdict that the disease is fading away could further ease the health worries of beef importers like Egypt, who may be on the verge of re-opening their beef trade with Ireland, following their lifting of an import ban put in place due to BSE worries, and an increase in export refunds which enables Irish exporters to compete better in Egypt, our largest pre-BSE Third Country market.
“BSE has been a calamity for governments, for the meat trade, for farmers and most of all for 150 people who have died from the BSE linked variant Creutzfelt-Jakob Disease”, said Professor Cunningham, who headed the European Association for Animal Production investigation."

All males born since May 1st 2003 are ineligible for the 21-month premia. They will not be the required age for application before the end of the current scheme on December 31st 2004, prior to the change to the new direct payments coming into effect on January 1st 2005 following the CAP reform.
A less widely-known situation, however, is that any male animal born since the beginning of February 2003 will not qualify for the slaughter premia unless they forego the second SBP, worth almost double the slaughter premia.
To qualify for the slaughter premia, which is worth 80/head, it will be necessary to have the animal slaughtered before the end of 2004. But any animals slaughtered prior to the completion of the required two months retention, following application for the 21-month SBP, will lose the premia entitlement.
Therefore it will be necessary to make application for the second SBP in October to allow for the retention period and slaughter prior to the Christmas holidays at the meat factories. To be eligible to apply for the second SBP in early October 2004 the animal must have been born on or before early February 2003.
Many finishers appear to be unaware of this complexity."

As a result, the association has placed a series of public notices in the agricultural press to set out the full facts as to why the premium should be retained.
“There is significant merit in continuing with the slaughter premium as it will favour active producers to the tune of €126 million per annum and also cater for individuals who are expanding over time,” he said.
Mr O’Rourke said that the continuation of the premium will not involve any compliance costs or obligations on farmers and can be operated at minimum cost at factory level.
All bullocks, bulls, heifers and cows qualify for €80 at slaughter.
“Holding the slaughter premium will offset some of the €100 cut in calf prices and €300 cut in weanling and store prices due to the decoupling of the other beef premiums.
“The retention will also help maintain the value of cull cows from both the dairy and suckler herds.
“The operation of the slaughter premium also involves no red tape,” he said."

“Ireland has a long history of good trade relations with Libya, stretching as far back as the 1970s, when Libya imported over 150,000 live exports per annum from Irish farmers,” he said.
“Although this has fallen to roughly 60,000 heads per annum, the potential to expand our export capacity to Libya remains viable.”
Mr Timmins said Mr Walsh had announced recently that the conditions importing Irish beef into Egypt had been relaxed. It was now essential that this positive news was transformed into action on the ground.
“From 2005 onwards, Ireland's cattle prices will be at the mercy of the market, independent of the cattle premium payment,” Mr Timmins said.
“It is vital, therefore, that Ireland moves quickly to expand its meat export trade, if Irish beef producers are to survive long-term.
“In 1999, the Egyptian market imported over 150,000 tonnes of Irish beef worth almost 300m per annum and this important export outlet must be resumed and expanded upon.”"

The improvement in beef prices is also helping to drive the store prices, particularly for the forward quality animals which are capable of being finished to beef at under 30 months before the end of the year, with the expectation that prices for these animals will continue to harden, and the Christmas beef trade could be a paying target to pitch for with young animals this year.
Store bullocks were dearer by €20/head at Athenry Mart yesterday where numbers were up on last week, while Fermoy Mart with a large entry reported an excellent trade and the pattern was similar at Kanturk Mart.
Martin McNamara, Manager, Athenry Mart said that the trade was very strong for both the double punched, and the quality single punched bullocks yesterday.
“Double punched bullocks for further feeding are being much after and all double punched bullocks at to-days sale would have been making the equivalent of 85p-90p/lb deadweight,” he said.

They show that full decoupling, combined with some changes in agricultural trade policies under the WTO talks, would lead to a 10% increase in aggregate farm income in 2012 compared to the income level that would occur under current policies.
Beef and sheep production would generally decline as a result of a reduction in suckler cow and ewe numbers. However, following an initial price fall, beef and sheep prices would increase by 2012 to a higher level. Milk prices would fall as a result of the intervention price reduction agreed in the mid-term review and increased competition.
But this would be offset by the introduction of the dairy premium payment. The effect on cereals would not be significant.
Teagasc economist Trevor Donnellan said the analysis also showed that, as a result of full decoupling, emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture by 2010 would fall by 14% below the estimated 1990 level."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10103803.html,2003-10-16 01:00:00,Egyptian beef sales improve,"The upcoming Christmas demand is also expected to maintain trade over the next month or so, according to Bord Bia sources.
To date this year cattle supplies to export meat plants are 6% ahead of last year; prime cattle prices are running 3% lower.
Young bull throughput has been over 60% higher since the start of July, in response to increased year round demand from processors.
Exports of Irish beef are expected to rise nearly 8% this year; most of the growth to date has been evident in sales to Italy, expected to increase by 75% on year earlier levels, helped by increased supplies of under 12 month beef.
More than 60,000 cattle will be slaughtered under 12 months this year, as specialised beef production systems boost Irish beef exports to the Continental EU markets by more than 25%.
Grass-fed beef for the UK and Northern Europe, and cereal-fed beef for Italy and Spain are among the other specialised systems bringing Continental export success.
“The emergence of close relationships between producers and processors to meet the needs of specific market segments has been a key contributor to the achievement of this growth”, said Michael Duffy, Chief Executive, Bord Bia.
In 2003 it is estimated that over 200,000 cattle, or 15% of prime cattle supplies will be sourced directly from farm systems that produce beef to exact specification required by premium customers.
In 2002 CMMS data shows that 32,000 cattle were processed of age with about two thirds of these being heifers. Production for this market will double this year to over.
There is a significant price premium available for the young bulls included in this year’s 100% increase in slaughter cattle under 12 months, according to Bord Bia. But a rise in supply could reduce the premium; anyone considering finishing young bulls should ensure prior to feeding that they have an agreed outlet.
Welcoming formal relationships in production schemes between farmers and processors, Michael Duffy said they provide a solid basis for future growth and higher returns from the marketplace.
He said further significant growth to Continental markets is needed due to the prospective ending of the OTM Scheme in the UK."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10037875.html,2003-10-28 00:00:00,Consumers ‘hold key to future of farming’,"That’s the prediction of Minister Joe Walsh in the immediate aftermath of his decision to introduce full decoupling of all cattle, sheep and arable crops payments.
In a move that will radically change the face of Irish agriculture, the payments will be decoupled from production from January 2005 and replaced with a single annual farm cheque.
Mr Walsh said he took the decision now in order to enable Irish farmers to make clear plans for the future.
“While there are uncertainties in farming, one issue that we can all be sure of is the need for a continuing focus on competitiveness and efficiency,” he said.
“The decoupling of support from production will help create a market environment which will be more orientated towards consumers’ needs and should allow clear market signals on pricing and quality issues.
“For the future, incomes from farming will be determined by the market and the freedom provided by decoupling will enable farmers to engage in enterprises that will return the best margins from production.”
Mr Walsh said the analysis undertaken by FAPRI-Ireland showed that full decoupling should lead to the greatest improvement in aggregate farm incomes.
“I believe that our top dairy, beef, sheep and tillage farmers are among the best in Europe and we now have the opportunity to adapt production systems to real market needs rather than premia payments.
“In addition, the re-orientation of farmers away from the goal of maximising premia to that of obtaining the greatest market returns will, I believe, result in improved quality and will assist food processors in developing and supplying quality markets.
“There are also beneficial effects on the environment from the new system. The FAPRI analysis shows that full decoupling will have the greatest positive impact on the environment by the reduction in the contribution by agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions.
“For many this may seem like a peripheral consideration but it should be recognised that primary agriculture is more open to the influences of global warming and climate change than most other activities.”
Irish agriculture was entering a new and interesting phase.
He had been greatly encouraged by the positive attitude and by the determination to make the best of the new set of circumstances.
“We now have a reformed CAP which protects payments to Irish farmers and is based clearly on the principles of market orientation, sustainability and environmental awareness.”
Mr Walsh said naturally there were concerns. He respected those and would see to what extent he could take them into account.
“Up to now farmers were highly critical of the level of bureaucracy involved and the constraints on real farming. It was bewildering for an awful lot of farmers because the vast majority of them like to roll up their sleeves and go out on the farm.”
He believed farmers were going to embrace the opportunity of the freedom to farm for the market place. They would begin each year with a single farm payment cheque as a cushion.
Responding to ICMSA concerns about prices for calves and weanlings, he said the matter that affected the buoyancy of these more than anything else was the live trade. He intended to ensure a continued buoyant live trade, which had fluctuated over the years for different reasons.
To date this year, a total of 173,000 head of cattle have been exported live from Ireland, with 150,000 going to mainland Europe. Such a thriving trade was reflected in the marts and in the prices for calves and weanlings here. He believed it was the best way to keep up prices.
Regarding fears by meat processors that reduced output at farm level would lead to a drop in production and job losses, he said that in all probability there would be an increase in jobs.
“I say that because we have been supplying to a very great extent a commodity market up to now. With a scarcity in mainland Europe, there will be a greater opportunity to supply real market needs.
“And with the improvement in quality, I see no reason why there should not be an increase in value added and a greater journey along the value chain, which will mean more consumer cuts and more jobs.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10060728.html,2003-11-06 00:00:00,Over-age supply pressurises prices,"Prices for the younger stock were maintained or slightly improved this week, but the bigger issue for many suppliers became the on/off situation for slaughtering at the factories during the opening days of the week. No sooner had agreement been reached between the Department of Agriculture and the vets on arrangements for the remainder of the year, than a new issue arose over the transfer of responsibility to the factories for rostering of the vets, which was previously decided by the Department. A number of the factories did not slaughter on Monday or Tuesday while efforts continue to resolve the issue surrounding an unusual situation in which the vets (TVI’s) are paid by the Department of Agriculture, but rostered by the factories who point out that they are not the employers of the vets.
Back at the factories the quoted prices for under age cattle this week as in general 238-227 cents/kg (85p-81p/lb) which was an improvement of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) at some of the factories and maintaining last weeks prices at the others. Some individual deals are being negotiated with the factories for up to 241 cents/kg (86p/lb) for choice lot of young stock.
There is more variation in the prices on offer for the older animals with a widening of the margin under the price for young stock depending on the supply of older animals to the particular processors, and requirements to meet market demand.
Taking account of the four day week, due to the bank holiday on Monday, last week’s kill at the factories remained strong at 37,198 head, of which 19,588 head were bullocks.
The trade for cull cows continues strong at unchanged prices. Up to 181 cents/kg (65p/lb) is being quoted but more is being paid for good heavy carcasses."

It is difficult to measure the impact the disruption had on the beef trade last week. Throughput did not appear to have been affected, with a kill of more than 40,000 head, but whether or not prices would have strengthened more without the reduction in kill at some of the factories for most of the week remains a matter of opinion.
Quoted prices this week were largely unchanged at 238 and back to 227 cent/kg (85p to 81p/lb) for R and O grades under 30 months, effectively across the board.
Supplies of young cattle are continuing to tighten, as is to be expected for the remainder of the year. There were some variations in the level of supply from one region to another this week, but most factories appeared to be getting by, securing sufficient young stock, with a little more effort required by some processors, and a little more money on offer for quality lots.
There was a throughput of more than 20,000 bullocks last week, slightly higher than the same week last year. Older cattle are making up more of the current throughput. Better quality over 30 months with heavy carcasses are being bought at similar prices to younger stock. Others are being discounted by 1p or 2p/lb, depending on quality and processor’s requirements.
The trade for cull cows continues steady, with prices unchanged, at up to 182 cent/kg (65p/lb) being quoted, and the top quality cows making a bit more.
While peace has been restored on the veterinary inspection front, the vexed issue of grading at the factories after January 1 next remains a concern for producers and processors.
Expecting mechanical grading to be in place at the factories for January 1 is over-optimistic, and producers are determined that factories doing their own grading will not be accepted under any circumstances."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10051442.html,2003-11-19 00:00:00,Factories record highest throughput of cattle,"Official figures for last week show the throughput at 44,307 head an increase of 10% amounting to 4,000 head up on the previous week.
The bullock kill was only slightly increased and it will be interesting see what categories the increased stock came from when the breakdown becomes available later this week.
The highest weekly kill recorded in recent years was 47,676 head for week ending December 8, 2001.
Bookings were reported to be light at the factories for the first two days of this week and the industry will be monitoring to see if the increase was a once-off or the start of a longer run similar to 2001.
In the marts this week the trade is continuing strong for the quality forward stores in particular. Some very fancy prices continue to be paid for the quality heavy punched out cattle. It would be hard to better the €930 paid for two punched out Belgian Blues weighing 630kgs at Blessington, where a number of other lots of double punched sold at €200-€250 over €/kg.
Beef bullocks were up €30/head and the forward stores up €35/head in excellent trading at Blessington where beef heifers made up to €190 over and stores sold up to €200 over.
At Kilmallock the trade was steady at a smaller sale where good single punched Herefords made up to €300 over and store heifers up to €160 over.
Bullocks were dearer by €20/head at Athenry yesterday where the forward single punched made up to €380 over and the punched out bullocks up to €160 over. There was a very strong trade for the heavy heifers some selling for up to €250 over.
There was good bullock trade at Fermoy yesterday forward single punched selling up to €310 over.

Meanwhile, cartels were pushing up the price of consumer goods by 10%, he said.
The Competition Authority is responsible for ensuring consumers are not ripped off. It has the power to prosecute companies for anti-competitive practices if they are operating cartels and price fixing. The 2002 Competition Act gave the authority more powers to prosecute individuals for price-fixing and those found guilty can face up to five years in jail or fines of up to €4 million.
Mr Massey said, despite the extra powers, and receiving hundreds of complaints, the Competition Authority is only prosecuting a handful of companies and individuals.
Mr Massey’s comments come as the National Competitive Council revealed Ireland as the most expensive and least competitive country in Europe.
Mr Massey said more vigorous enforcement was needed to ensure people are jailed for operating cartels. “No one believed someone could be jailed for accepting a corrupt payment until George Redmond went to jail. We need a similar conviction to get the message across about price-fixing,” he said.
The main problem seemed to be the 20% turnover in staff in the authority, which slowed the processing of prosecutions, Mr Massey said.
“It would be better if the gardaí took over full responsibility for investigating criminal cartels, because they have the skills to bring prosecutions,” Mr Massey said.
In the US and Britain, the FBI and Serious Fraud Office, respectively, are involved in criminal prosecutions against those operating cartels. Up to 40 people are prosecuted every year in the US for anti-competitive practices. This year, the chairman of Sotheby’s auction house was one of those prosecuted. But the Competition Authority rejected the claim that the gardaí would do a better job at prosecuting criminal cartels and said their cartel division has been restructured since Mr Massey left three years ago.
The authority’s cartel division has two full-time gardaí working with it along with a number of case officers, who prepare prosecutions. This is modelled exactly on the US system, their spokesman said.
“Our division is headed up by an American, who worked for the Federal Trade Commission.
“In the US, the cartels division of the Justice department, along with seconded FBI members, bring prosecutions, ” the Competition Authority spokesman said.
So far, up to seven anti-competitive civil cases have been settled, including cases against insurance companies, Tesco, Glanbia and Sligo Dairies.
The authority has five prosecutions currently in the courts for alleged anti-competitive practices by the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Licensed Vintners, Calor Gas, a beef processing scheme and a group of grain growers. There are other cases pending that cannot be discussed for legal reasons, the authority spokesman said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10073589.html,2003-12-04 00:00:00,Factory beef prices up by 2p/lb,"A number of processors paid an average of more than 88p/lb for R grade bullocks with the best paying factories returning even more for heifers, as the build up to the filling of the Christmas orders got under way.
The overall average increase of 1p/lb for bullocks and more than 1.5p/lb for heifers masked the real change in prices for the under 30 months animals, because of the percentage of lower priced over age cattle in the kill 39,313 for the week bringing down the average. Prices did reach the target of 90p/lb average for R bullocks at Carrigans of Donegal Meats and up to 91p/lb for R heifers at Kepak, Clonee - the only processors paying at that level.
Prices averaged 87p/lb for R3 bullocks within the range of 90p/lb at the top to the lowest paying factory which averaged 85p/lb. Averages of 88p/lb or better were paid by Exel at Kilbeggan, Dawn Meats, Midleton, Slaney Meats, at Bunclody, and AIBP at Waterford.
The average paid for O3 bullocks was just under 83p/lb. The major beef processing groups all paid for supplies with some variations between factories within the groups. The average R3 bullock price rose by at least 2p/lb at AIBP factories at Waterford and Nenagh and slightly less at Clones and Cahir. R3 heifers averaged 87.6p/lb within the range of over 91p/lb at Kepak, Clonee to the lowest average of 84p/lb. Meadow Meats, Rathdowney, and Newgrange Meats, Navan paid over 89p/lb with several processors paying over 88p/lb. The average for O3 heifers was a shade under 83p/lb.
Cull cow prices continued strong. Meadow Meats paid the highest average for R grade at 70p/lb for R5. Fair Oak, Clonmel paid an average of over 68p/lb for O5 grade and Liffey Meats paid an average of 63p/lb for P+4H grade."

Key findings revealed that nine out of 10 shoppers claimed to be confident that meat bought in supermarkets and butchers is safe but also assumed that the meat they buy is of Irish origin.
Criteria used to judge the quality and safety of meat include where it was bought, its colour and appearance, best-before-date and price, followed by quality assurance label and country-of-origin (ranked 6th in order of priority).
Two-thirds of shoppers claimed country of origin information was helpful in assessing the safety of meat.
There was a clear preference (69%) for specific country of origin information on meat sold in retailers and butchers rather than non-EU denomination (6%).
Awareness of EU beef labelling legislation was low. The general public do not differentiate regarding the level of information on beef labels compared to labels for other categories of pre-packed meat.
There was also a clear preference (68%) for specific country of origin on menus in food service restaurants. However, the vast majority (80%) of consumers rarely or never inquire about the origin of meat when eating out.
Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh, who was presented with the research findings in Dublin yesterday, thanked chairperson Mairéad McGuinness and her panel on their work. He said the EU beef labelling regulations are being reviewed by the European Commission and the findings were accordingly timely.
Mr Walsh will forward the information, which covered in a comprehensive manner consumer attitudes to meat purchasing, to the European Commission.
He said he had already raised with the commission the question of extending the beef labelling regulations to the food service sector.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10033392.html,2003-12-11 00:00:00,Factories wind down activities,"Very strong prices paid for beef animals in some areas, of more than 90p/lb, were in contrast with downward pressure on returns to farmers in other areas early in the week.
Factories requiring larger numbers of under-age cattle paid well for them, with one large lot of mid-range animals making a handsome 92p/lb, while prices were pulled in other areas to 86p and back as far as 82p/lb for under 30 months R and O animals.
In general, 88p and back to 84p/lb for R and O grades was readily attainable, and a little more was negotiable with processors who required better quality stock.
But, overall, the factories were looking for smaller supplies this week, with a large proportion of their orders for Christmas already filled and more planning to fill their quota early this week.
As a result, some factories cut back to three days this week, and they plan to kill only two or three days next week before they close down for Christmas holidays.
Those supplying fresh into the supermarket trade will have a small kill in Christmas week, and will also operate for a day or two the following week to keep supplies running over the festive season.
Dramatic changes in prices are unlikely, because producers will be slow to sell for less than current rates, and quality stock should continue to return 88p to 90p/lb for the remainder of the season, with the prospect always that a bit of scarcity will push up prices a little.
Throughput last week increased to almost 41,000 head, an increase of 2,000 on the previous week. Almost all of that increase was accounted for in the steer kill, which was close to 2,000 head higher, at 17,537 head.
A good proportion of the steer kill is now comprised of over-age steers bought at prices close to those being paid for the younger stock.
Trade for cows also continues very strong, with up to 66p/lb being quoted and more being paid for heavy cows, which are in demand, and making over 69p/lb at higher paying factories.
The throughput has eased back slightly to around 9,000 head per week at the factories, similar to the corresponding weeks in 2002."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10126623.html,2003-12-12 00:00:00,Store cattle prices finish strongly,"The improvement of 10-20/head in store cattle prices earlier in the week was fully maintained at the sales. There was a big increase in bullocks on offer at Bandon, where the second-last cattle sale of 2003 was held. In firm trading, heavy punched out bullocks sold for up to 205 over /kg and the forward single punched made up to 315 over with lighter single punched topping at 300 over.
A lot of two single punched 495 kg Herefords sold for 805, five single punched Herefords weighing 457 kg also made 805 and nine Charolais scaling 396 kg sold for 700.
Heifers were not as plentiful as last week, but the prices were improved by 20/head. The beef and butchers heifers sold for up to 150 over and stores made up to 185 over.
There was an improvement of up to 15/head in medium weight single punched bullocks at Kilkenny Mart, where 925 head were on offer and store heifers were dearer by 10/head.
Demand was very strong for the heavy single punched bullocks.
Three Charolais 538 kgs sold for 950, four Limousin weighing 511 kgs sold for 900 and three Simmentals 516 kgs made 870.
Beef heifers sold for up to 255 over four Belgian Blues 500 kgs selling for 755 and a Simmental 576 kgs made 805.
There was 800 cattle on offer at Ennis Mart, where all types of cattle were dearer than last week. Probably the highest price in the country yesterday up to 300 over /kg was paid for the heavy punched out Continental bullocks."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10128379.html,2003-12-17 00:00:00,Live trade improvement continues,"Strong supplies of cattle and an increase of up to 20/head is setting the trend for a strong ending to the year's live trade. Some of the buying strength for stores is being driven by farmers, with tax years ending on December 31 building up stock numbers at the last opportunity before the end of the year.
Kilmallock Mart reported a strong trade with prices all-round improved by 10-E20/head with a good supply of cattle on offer and plenty of buyers. There was also a firm trade at Kanturk, where forward single punched bullocks sold for up to 320 over and lighter weights topping at 300 over. Up to 120 over was paid for beef heifers and stores sold at 80-100 over /kg. Across to the west, with prices of up to 425 over being paid for single punched bullocks, was a reflection of the strength of demand at Athenry Mart, where several lots of heavy bullocks topped 350 over /kg with one premia left. Top price went for a single punched Charolais 555 kgs sold for 980. Other strong prices for single punched included a Limousin 550 kgs selling for 920, a Charolais 500 kgs sold for 870 a blue Hereford 420kgs making 780 and two Limousin 452 kgs selling for 800.
There was an equally strong trade for beef heifers, with up to 240 over being paid for the tops a red Limousin weighing 475 kgs sold for 715. A Charolais weighing 470 kgs made 685 and a BB x Hereford 515 kgs sold for 725.
At Blessington, the heavy punched out bullocks made up to 230."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10092834.html,2003-12-18 00:00:00,Cattle kill 5.5% higher this year,"But, due to short supply, this has not affected prices, which remain firm, with up to 90p/lb available for very good quality stock, especially if a factory is under pressure to fill remaining orders.
However, in general, up to 89p/lb is attainable for R grade animals under 30 months, although 88p/lb is generally quoted by most factories for the week. Quotes for O grades range from 83 back to 86p/lb.
Producers who held on to cattle for the pre-Christmas trade this year gained a little, but there is some disappointment that the hoped for 90p/lb was not paid for significant volumes. Given the prices which were paid for stores in the autumn, profit margins have been tight.
Factory throughput last week was down by a few hundred to 40,600 head, which is close to the corresponding week in 2003.
The supply of bullocks at 15,748 was down by 1,600 head on the previous week and around 1,400 head back on the same week last year.
Supplies of over-age cattle are continuing to make up the numbers. While there is no rush of over 30 months animals, there has nevertheless been a steady flow over recent weeks, with prices continuing to track those of the young stock. Some of these over-age animals have been making prices on a par with the under-age animals if they are heavy enough and quality is adequate. The remainder are not far behind, at a discount of 1p or 2p/lb.
The year to date supply figures show factory throughput 5.5% higher than last year, consisting of a 7% higher bullock kill, and 2.6% more heifers slaughtered. Cull cow throughput is 3% higher.
The number of young bulls slaughtered is 12,000 higher than for 2002.
An additional 90,000 animals have been exported live this year, of which calves accounted for an increase of 44,000 and weanlings were up 30,000 head."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-10073194.html,2003-12-30 00:00:00,Agricultural income rises by 2.2% in 2003,"A Central Statistics Office (CSO) provisional estimate shows that agricultural income in 2003 increased by 2.2% on the previous year.
Cattle value output increased by 5.5% or €64m. This was largely due to an increase in slaughterings in 2003 over 2002.
The value of milk output also increased by 0.6% or €9m. There was an increase in the volume of milk production but a decrease in the milk price.
In the pig sector, the value of output decreased by 8.9% or €27m. A decrease in the pig price in 2003 of about 4.4% and a decrease in slaughterings in 2003 largely accounted for this decline.
The value of output in the sheep sector decreased by 6.0% or €12m, largely due to a 4.0% decline in slaughterings.
Cereals output value increased by 22.8% or €32m. An increase in volume of 7.0%, coupled with an increase in price of almost 15%, account for this increase.
The value of feeding stuffs decreased by 5.3% or €50m. However, the value of fertilisers increased by 8.1% or €28m, largely due to a 4.4% increase in the volume consumed.
Net subsidies decreased by 2.2% or €35m. In 2002, these represented 65.8% of operating surplus. In 2003, it is estimated that net subsidies represent 63.0% of operating surplus.
Economic analysis by Teagasc experts of the performance of farming in 2003 showed the extent of the mixed fortunes for those involved in the major enterprises. Liam Connolly said that while beef and tillage farmers experienced some upturn in margins, dairy, sheep and pig producers all suffered a drop.
Mr Connolly said trends for 2004 pointed to a small drop in incomes due to declining output and rising costs.
In the dairy sector, Billy Fingleton said further slippage in milk prices contributed to a decline of about 2% in margins from dairy farming in 2003.
This followed a drop of 20% in margins in 2002, he said, predicting that milk prices will fall by about 4% in 2004.
Mr Fingleton said while the introduction of EU compensatory payments will offset the price drop, a decline in calf prices combined with cost increases will result in continuing pressure on margins in dairy farming.
Liam Dunne said margins from beef increased by around 8% on average, due to a small reduction in costs and additional revenue from higher slaughterings and direct payments. The prospects for 2004 point to a drop in margins of around €100 per hectare (€40/acre).
Tillage farmers experienced a substantial improvement on the very poor performance in 2002.
Fiona Thorne said the margins for the two major cereal crops, spring barley and winter wheat, were up by 44% and 25% respectively on 2002.
Increased yields and prices resulted in an increase in margins from sugar beet while lower prices led to a drop in margins from potato growing.
“The indications for 2004 are for some drop in margins from grain growing. However, this will depend greatly on weather conditions in the major international grain growing regions. The margins from sugar beet and potatoes are forecast to increase, primarily due to increases in yields,” she said.
Teagasc chief adviser on pigs, Michael Martin, said the past year brought further difficulty for producers. Lower prices and increased cost resulted in a decline of around 5% in margins.
While overall prospects for pig prices in 2004 are reasonably good, escalating feed costs will severely curtail any increase in margins leading to a further difficult year.
Assessing the performance of the sheep sector, Mr Connolly said the 10-year cycle of decline in numbers was arrested in 2003 with a small increase in the national breeding flock.
Higher production costs and lower lamb prices led to a drop of around 5% in sheep margins last year. The prospects for 2004 are for a further decline in margins.
However, he pointed out that sheep return the second highest margin after dairying and are substantially ahead of margins from either beef or cereal growing."

Eight years ago, Mr Roche points out, there were only 4.2 million visitors to Ireland, compared to the seven million now arriving annually.
And, he says, the political entourage that will jet in and out of Ireland is sure to notice the increase in traffic on Irish roads with the number of new cars having risen by almost 20% from 1996 to 130,887 in 2002.
Irish workers’ weekly wages have also changed since 1996, when the average hourly wage for a skilled worker was 9.42, compared to 17.38 last year.
House prices have soared with the average price for a house in Dublin now almost 300,000, while a similar house outside Dublin costs almost 200,000. The 1996 average was 89,000 for Dublin and 74,000 outside Dublin.
Drinkers are having to dig deeper in their pockets to come up with the 3.90 for a pint of stout that would have only set them back around 2.80 eight years ago.
Mr Roche points out that news in 1996 was dominated by the BSE crisis in the beef industry with prices collapsing as consumer confidence hit rock bottom.
During the same year, the first step toward banning smoking in public places was taken when cinemas outlawed the habit.
In the US, Bill Clinton was re-elected president for a second term while his special envoy, Senator George Mitchell, chaired talks in the Northern Ireland peace process.
During the same year Teilifís na Gaeilge (now TG4) was launched while “Girl Power” took over the airways with “Wannabe” storming the charts - making the Spice Girls the biggest-selling artists of 1996.
It was the year that Ireland won the Eurovision yet again when Eimear Quinn struck the right note when she sang “The Voice”.
Mr Roche notes that 1996 was also the year RTÉ’s Fair City featured the first every gay kiss in Irish television history, as a more liberal Ireland continued to take shape.
It was the year that Michelle Smith became the golden girl of Irish sport with her Olympic win of three gold medals and one bronze. Her achievement was tarnished three years later when she was found to have tampered with a urine sample.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10035466.html,2004-01-01 00:00:00,Sell early to beat year end rush for the last premia,"Any animals approaching slaughter weight will be bundled out the door to qualify for the last of the slaughter premium towards the end of the year, even though sellers may lose out, if the factories respond with a price cut in the face of over-supply.
Live export market turbulence is on the cards, too, depending largely on what different decoupling options are chosen by the Member States which buy live cattle from Ireland. (France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy are almost certain to keep some cattle premia coupled.) For some member states, decoupling will make imported Irish cattle unattractive from New Year 2005.
So the final months will offer the last high-priced opportunity to send cattle to some destinations.
Another class of cattle hitting the autumn market in increasing numbers will be the culled suckler cow, before her price falls, when the Suckler Cow Premium disappears in the new year.
Liam Dunne of Teagasc warns cattle farmers to expect a complex 2004 market with unusual demand patterns, cattle price differentials and new trade trends for specific animal types.
In other words, more of the same for farmers who have been through the 1996 BSE scare, Agenda 2000, the one-month change in beef premium ages, the second BSE crisis in autumn 2000, the collapse of the Third Countries trade, foot and mouth in 2001, purchase for destruction schemes, competition from South America, the SBP overshoot, and the recent EU beef market recovery.
For the farmer looking to buy cattle this year, things will be just as topsy turvy.
In 2004, birth certs must be closely scrutinised. Animals would have to be born before May 2003 to be eligible for the last 21-month premium on offer. Animals would have to be born before June 2004 to be eligible for the nine month SBP.
Since the calves born in 2004 cannot collect the second steer premium, some of these may be entered for the higher value bull premium.
Overall, Liam Dunne predicts calf costs are likely to remain high in 2004, and they could even increase, as cattle farmers undertake a final numbers push to maximise their last year of premiums. The price of calves ineligible for the nine-month SBP may also be supported in 2004 by the veal market, since the supply of calves for veal in Holland and Italy will still be constrained by the premium system.
But overall, Liam Dunne says, this year could bring some of the lowest earnings since 1999 for the Irish cattle sector. So buying too dear, or selling too cheap, would make 2004 a disastrous year for a cattle farmer.
Assuming farmers don’t get the usual 80% advance pay-out of premia in the autumn of 2004, he says, there could be a reduction in annual premia revenue of 80/ha (because 40% won’t be paid before New Year, 2005). He predicts a reduction in the value of sales also, bringing total cattle earnings down 15%, compared to 2003.
He is taking into account concentrate feed costs increasing, due to extra feeding for earlier marketing of animals before year end and dearer feed ingredients after the drought in continental EU in 2003."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10124908.html,2004-01-01 00:00:00,"Bigger sales, lower prices","End of year figures are expected to show an increase of around 90,000 head in the overall national kill.
The average price paid for poorer grading heifers dropped by over 4% on 2002, with steer prices recording a drop of 2% for the year.
The steer kill for the year will show an increase of over 6% or around 55,000 head in a kill expected to be confirmed at 920,000 to 925,000 head for the year.
Young bull slaughter figures were 33% higher, from a low base of just more than 40,000 head in 2002.
There was only a slight increase in the number of heifers slaughtered, 2.6% higher than the previous year, with the cow kill showing an increase of 3%.
Beef prices through most of the year were disappointing to producers, having failed to reflect the improvement in the demand and in export markets. The average price paid for R3 steers was 231 cents/kg (82p/lb), a drop of 5 cents/kg (2p/lb) from the average for 2002, knocking off around 20/head in returns for finished animals, on top of which producers had to meet higher statutory charges at the factories, which further eroded their returns.
An increased emphasis on quality has resulted in a widening of the price margin between R and O grades. Weaker prices for the poorer grading steers resulted in a drop of 4%, with O3 grades averaging 220 cents/kg (78p/lb), a drop of 10 cents/kg (4p/lb) on the average for 2002.
The pattern was very similar in heifer prices for the year. The average price paid for R3 heifers at 234 cents/kg (83p/lb) was down by 5 cents/kg (2p/lb) on 2002, while O3 grade heifers were back by 10 cents/kg (4p/lb).
The strength of cow prices through the year has been confirmed; they improved by 3% to 4% on 2002.
Prices for O3 grade were 5 cents/kg (2p/lb) higher at 166 cents/kg (59p/lb), an increase of 3%, and O4 grade prices were 6 cents/kg higher at 173 cents/kg (62p/lb) an increase of 4%.
Live exports for the year increased by 72% to a total of just under 220,000 head which, although showing a huge recovery, remains substantially lower than the figures of the late nineties.
The biggest increase was in calf exports which grew by 45,000 to around two and a half times the level for 2002. Weanling exports showed an increase of 30,000 head."

The Mabton farm was the diseased cow’s final home and also had one of its calves.
Mad cow disease is a concern because humans can develop a brain-wasting illness, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, from consuming infected beef products. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said 153 people worldwide, most of them in Britain, had contracted the human form of the illness since the mid-1990s.
Another priority in the investigation is locating the source of infection. Canadian investigators are considering whether an Alberta rendering plant could have been the source of contaminated feed that infected the Washington cow and, perhaps, the Canadian cow.
Records indicate both cows were born in western Canada in the spring of 1997, a few months before the United States and Canada banned the practice of including parts of cattle and other cud-chewing animals in cattle feed. Genetic testing that would confirm the accuracy of the records is to take place.
Such a link could solve the mystery of how the first US case of the disease occurred. It would also go a long way toward calming the fears of some two dozen nations that have halted
2.5 billion in annual shipments of American beef, according to experts. The diagnosis of mad cow disease in an animal in rural Washington state last week sent cattle prices skidding by nearly 20% and forced the administration of George W Bush to ban the use of sick or crippled cattle in human food, a measure long opposed by the meat industry. Consumer groups and some Democrats have expressed scepticism about whether that and related regulatory changes go far enough.
US Agriculture Department investigators hope to complete DNA testing early next week to confirm their suspicions that the infected Holstein cow was born in Alberta, Canada, in April 1997. Canada reported its first case of mad cow disease earlier this year in a Black Angus cow, also from Alberta.
While the USDA investigation into the cause of the mad cow case continues, the Bush administration is trying to restore the confidence of international meat buyers.
American officials will fly to Mexico City next Tuesday to urge Mexico to reopen its border to American beef. Officials will discuss what the United States is doing to control the disease, said Javier Trujillo, head of the Mexican agriculture ministry’s animal health commission.
Earlier this week, an American trade delegation visited Tokyo and Seoul to urge both nations to allow beef exports to resume.
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the American Meat Institute want the White House to make resumption of beef exports a top trade priority.
Another problem for exporters is the fate of 44,000 tonnes of American beef, valued at 280 million, that was in transit to other countries at the time the first case of mad cow was discovered. All the meat is in limbo due to the trade bans."

The young stock were generally quoted at 90p/lb for R grade, but given the marts are making a slow return to trading and fewer producers than normal were offering cattle to the factories yesterday, processors paid over the quoted prices to entice out sufficient supplies.
A gap of up to 5p/lb has opened up between R and O grades with Os generally quoted at 87p-85p/lb.
There is, however, less certainty on the price going forward and some of the processors are very anxious to get prices back as quickly as possible, with hints that prices may be pulled during the second half of this week.
That will depend entirely on the supply situation freeing up, but there is a real danger to prices weakening if supplies increase because the export markets are at a low ebb.
Following strong trading in the weeks up to Christmas the processors are bracing themselves for somewhat leaner trading for the opening weeks of 2004. However, supplies of under 30 months cattle should remain very tight for some time during which the balance between supply and demand will have a big influence on price.
There were very few animals on offer at the marts which resumed business yesterday.
Prices showed very little change from before Christmas. Kilmallock Mart had an early finish with a very small entry in cattle and calves.
There were just over 100 calves on offer at Bandon mart for the opening sale of 2004 and prices were well-maintained."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10047212.html,2004-01-08 00:00:00,Calving pattern reflected in scarcity of younger cattle,"While most factories were anxious for cattle during the opening days, to replenish depleted stocks of beef, they didn’t need large supplies in the lull in the trade after Christmas.
The general price was 90p/lb for R grade, with a bit more being paid for quality stock, or where supplies were particularly tight.
But a margin of up to 5p/lb has opened up between R and O grades, as the latter was quoted back to 85p/lb this week at some of the factories. Prices for O grades ranged from 87p back to 85p/lb.
Under 30 months stock are scarce, which is in line with the calving pattern, and are likely to remain scarce for some time, which could be of benefit to sellers.
The slack demand for beef this week was matched by farmers not pushing to market cattle, with Christmas still very much in the air and producers not back to normal trading.
Some processors have been hinting that prices will come under pressure as soon as supplies increase.
Meanwhile, the acquisition by the Dawn Meats Group of Galtee Meats at Charleville has been completed, and trading under the new name of Charleville Foods got under way this week, adding to the spread and strength of the Dawn Group in the red meat business.
We wish them the best of luck with their acquisition.
The original deadline for the withdrawal of the Department of Agriculture from grading at the beef plants passed last week, with the status quo continuing, following the agreement of the Department to continue the grading operation for the first quarter of 2004, while final arrangements and assessments of mechanical grading are being completed.
There was very light activity in the marts for the opening days of this week, when the first of the sales resumed.
Prices were largely unchanged from pre-Christmas. The calf trade opened quite strong at Bandon on Monday with over 100 calves on offer and continental bulls selling for up to 410 per head.
A small entry of cattle at Kilmallock on Monday met with a firm trade.
Some marts are not reopening for at least a further week."

In the marts, the same trend was showing on Monday, with lamb prices improved by one of two euro per head, in response to strong demand.
As in the beef sector, the increase in price is largely influenced by the requirement to replenish stocks after Christmas, but the main concern of producers is that prices are unlikely to be maintained once stocks are built up and supplies increase.
The guessing game is whether prices hold to the end of this week, or could they last a further week?
The trade was described as good and steady at Fermoy Mart on Monday, where butchers’ lots sold from 26 to 34 over 1/kg, and factory buyers paid 18 to 26 over. There was a strong entry of over 1,500 head at Kilkenny, where butchers’ hoggets were dearer by up to 2 per head. Butcher’s lots made up to 33 over, and factory buyers paid up to 24 over.
There was also a good entry at Athenry, where prices were improved by up to 3/head. The butchers paid up to 35 over for the tops.
Some lambs on offer were on the heavy side, and 54 kg lambs were making as much as lambs scaling up to 60kg and over, for which demand was not as strong."

He was addressing Bord Bia’s first beef and lamb producers national conference in Tullamore, County Offaly, which discussed issues relating to the country’s €2 billion export trade in meat and livestock.
Mr Duffy said progress can best be achieved through producers and processors working in partnership to position products to greatest advantage in the marketplace. “Our focus in 2004 is to assist in the improvement of export performance in the beef and lamb sectors. This will be achieved by securing more markets, getting the best customers within these markets, and achieving the highest possible price.”
Agriculture and Food Minister Joe Walsh told the 300 producers present that beef exports were up 6% and live exports of 220,000 head were up almost 50% in 2003. A strong presence was maintained on traditional markets such as Britain, where record exports of 260,000 tonnes, were achieved. Continental Europe performed extremely well, taking 145,000 tonnes of Irish beef.
Sheepmeat demand in France, the main export market, was down, but exports to Britain and northern Europe increased. Consumption at home was strong and more than offset lower French demand.
Minister Walsh said a decision on a proposed new EU regulation on animal transport is expected to come up for decision during Ireland’s presidency.
It is in Ireland’s interests to implement EU rules to ensure animals are properly cared for during transport.
However, there are aspects of the current proposal which, if unaltered, will make it difficult for exporters to continue to do business economically.
IFA Livestock Committee chairman John Bryan agreed that the current animal transport proposals would wreck the live export trade. He said the minister must secure changes to the EU proposals on staging posts, stocking densities, travel and rest times during Ireland’s EU presidency."

The vibes from the market place and the processors are as mixed as the prices, varying by county and by factory, depending on the demand and supply.
But flat prices for R/O grades of at least 90p/lb on offer this week are a very good sign of the trade, demolishing the gap of up to 5p/lb which had opened up between R and O grades before Christmas. And prices for over 30 months cattle nearly matching those for younger cattle at several factories this week give cause for optimism.
There is no processor quoting less than 90p/lb for R grade this week, and it is harder for the factories to get decent cattle at that price than it was, even a week ago.
Prices for O graders are more varied, ranging from parity with the Rs to a low of 86p/lb.
Last week's steer kill was 15,745 head, slightly higher than the corresponding week in 2003, and the total kill for the week was 34,485 head.
The British market has been reluctant to take major supplies in recent weeks. Striploin has come under some pressure over the past week, and prices have eased because of competition from South American supplies.
Nevertheless, the trade for cow beef has strengthened further. Factories are quoting up to 68p/lb this week and some are paying over 70p/lb for the better quality cows."

Applying for a bull premia on these animals if they have not been castrated instead of the nine months will recover 60/head of the deficit with the payment of 210/head for the bull premia instead of 150/head on the SBP.
Returns from marts showing a difference of 60-100/head in the price for the weanling bulls born pre and post-May 1 last are in line with the official Department of Agriculture returns which show a drop of 60/head average across all beef breed weanlings between mid-November and mid-January.
At Ennis Mart this week - with 500 weanlings/ yearlings on offer prices for post May 1 born bulls ranged 270350 over /kg compared to 380-420-over paid for the earlier born animals.
While there is no breakdown by date of birth available from Kilmallock Mart the price range of 270-430 over for the continental-breed bulls was broadly similar.
Prices at Kanturk ranged 340-425 for the continental bulls.

The IGFA reported yields and volume of cereal production recovered in 2003 from the depressed levels of a year earlier.
However, they did not regain the levels which had been achieved in previous years. Quality was good and harvesting conditions were excellent. Autumn sowing conditions were also favourable.
The report recorded that market prices of grain and feed materials escalated to a level which could not have been predicted.
Drought conditions on the continent reduced the volume of grain production significantly.
Former Soviet Union states, which had exported large volumes of low- priced grain in the previous year, were not in the market.
With milk supply well above quota and pig numbers down, the IGFA said no increase in feed volumes is expected this season.
A reduction in dairy cow and beef cattle numbers under decoupling could lead to a substantial drop in the demand for animal compound feeds between now and 2012."

The margin of increase in heifer prices was 0.6p/lb more than the previous week, but sufficient to bring them to par with the bullocks.
Last week's farmer pay sheet returns from the factories maintained the record of consistent prices for stock which has ruled since the beginning of the year, the first time in several years that there has been no easing in beef prices over the opening six weeks of the year.
AIBP Group paid an average of 1.5p/lb more than the previous week for R3 bullocks, with the improvement across the six factories ranging from 2p/lb at Cahir to 1p/lb at Bandon and Nenagh. Dawn Group also paid an average of 1.5p/lb more for R3 bullocks, with supplies to Midleton costing an average of 2p/lb more and 1p/lb more at Waterford and Ballyhaunis. The average of 93.4p/lb paid at Midleton was almost 4.5p/lb over the quoted price for the week.
Average prices at the Kepak Group also improved by 1.5p/lb with Athleague showing the biggest increase at 2p/lb more. Almost 91p/lb average was paid for O3 bullocks. R3 heifers averaged 92.7p/lb with a top factory average of 95p/lb."

But they were finding that sourcing only what they needed to meet requirements was proving difficult for most because of the short supply, and more costly than had been budgeted for at all plants.
Quoted prices have become little more than a rough base guide to the actual prices which are being paid for cattle at this stage. Producers are reporting little difficulty in negotiating 93p-98p/lb flat for decent lots of cattle and the processors are complaining that they are coming under severe pressure with cattle costing on average 7p-8p/lb more than for the corresponding week in 2003.
But the producers are stressing that it is the first February trade in years that has returned any reasonable margin, and with the high cost of stores last autumn and increasing winter feed costs, they’d face heavy losses selling at last year’s beef prices.
Yesterday factories quoted 94p-92p/lb for Rs and 92p-90p/lb for Os, but realised that it was impossible to buy cattle at the lower end of the price range.
The overall kill at the factories last week fell a further 1,000 head to 31,500, down 4,500 on the same week last year.
The bullock kill last week was slightly higher than the previous week at 15,452 head, which placed it 3,300 head lower than the same week last year.
Cull cow prices have also rocketed this week with 76p/lb being quoted for good cows and up to 78p/lb paid by factories in recent weeks."

Brazil increased exports of fresh/chilled beef by 42% last year, selling 155,000 tonnes. The volume of processed beef sold was 15% higher at 211,000 tonnes. Frozen beef exports were up by 45% with total sales of 465,000 tonnes.
While the largest volume market for the fresh/chilled beef was Chile, up by 37%, exports to Britain increased by 65%, the second-largest market increase, exceeded marginally by the 69% increase in supplies to Lebanon. Sales of frozen beef to Britain increased by 46% to over 20,000 tonnes. The largest increase in sales was to Russia, with a more than doubling of exports to over 83,000 tonnes achieved during the year. Sales to Egypt were 61% higher. Sales to the Philippines, and Italy were also higher. The only market decline during the year was a 2% slide in sales into Holland.
The scale of beef production in Brazil and the low production cost base, which results in supplies coming on to the European markets at very competitive prices, remains a constant challenge to exporters trying to secure higher returns from the EU market.
Although total sales to Britain for the year were equivalent to only 6% of Irish production, the scale of increase, fresh and chilled up 65% and frozen increased by 46%, gives some cause some concern as well as their strong presence in the Russian market, which continued an important outlet for Irish supplies."

It could also raise up to €600m through a ""substantial"" secondary offering of shares from existing shareholders.
Earlier this week the last hurdle paving the way for the flotation consent of bondholders to resume dividend payments was cleared.
The quick flotation of Eircom comes as telecoms shares are back in favour with investors. The company says now is the ideal time for launching an initial public offering.
The company's major shareholders, Providence Equity Partners, Soros Private Equity and Tony O'Reilly the chairman are likely to sell their entire stake in the company. Eircom's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) will hold onto its 29% stake.
Eircom has appointed Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley have been appointed as joint bookrunners to the offer, but it is not expected to be heavily marketed to small investors who suffered losses the last time Eircom floated.
No firm date for the flotation was given yesterday but the company said it would happen in the first half of March. Analysts expect Eircom to be valued at around €3.5 billion.
The money raised from the listing will be used to pay down the company's debt, which stands at €2.1bn.
Eircom was bought by the Valentia consortium just over two years ago for €3bn after a lengthy bidding battle with the former Esat boss Denis O'Brien.
Announcing the flotation plans yesterday, Dr O'Reilly said the Valentia consortium has substantially completed its objective, which was to turn around the performance of the business.
""The company is now focused on its core business of fixed line telecommunications, it is more efficient and it is delivering a lower cost and higher quality service to its customers. As a result, Eircom can now be returned to the market as a plc with long-term institutional shareholders,"" he said. The company also released financial results for the nine months to end December 2003 yesterday.
They showed turnover of €1.22bn and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of goodwill (EBITDA) of €450m. The company did not provide pre-tax profit figures.
The company said it plans to reduce its workforce to 7,000 by 2008. It currently stands at 8,191. When the company was taken private it had over 10,000 employees.
As part of the initial public offering, Eircom's board will be beefed up and several new non-executive directors will be appointed.

Exports of 415,000 tonnes were 17% higher than the previous record in 2002. Overall, Ireland exported 550,000 tonnes in 2003 out of total production of 560,000 tonnes. This is the highest level of total exports since 1999, and 12% higher than 2002. Beef exports were worth €1.28bn last year.
Mr Walsh praised the industry’s efforts in broadening and expanding its market reach at EU retail level.
It signifies a huge shift in the market orientation of the industry, away from international commodity markets and into the higher-priced internal EU marketplace. He also praised An Bord Bia’s efforts in underpinning sales and marketing. Through the 1990s, the industry exported 50% of its products into non-EU markets. In 2003, this share dropped to just 17% while the EU share increased proportionately.
Mr Walsh said the increase in sales to Europe coincides with the emergence of an EU market deficit in beef for the first time in 25 years.
A strong recovery in consumption in continental Europe allied with falling production has led to an increasing demand for Irish beef in both Britain and the continent.
“The complete recovery in exports to continental EU markets, with sales of 150,000 tonnes, is the most important statement of the quality and safety of Irish beef and its broad appeal to EU consumers.
Mr Walsh said the delegation of Saudi Arabian officials who travel to Ireland next week will examine BSE and food safety measures. This visit follows from ongoing efforts being made to secure further Third Country markets for Irish beef."

There were some exceptions to the overall trend and 1p-3p/lb more was paid for cattle by some of the factories, with a top price of 98.5p/lb being paid for R3 grade bullocks. Cull cow prices continued very strong with a top price of almost 84p/lb being paid for good cows.
An increase of 2,200 head in the supply of bullocks to the factories could have been enough to relieve some of the pressure on the processors and reduce the necessity to pay higher prices to get enough stock to fill the orders.
AIBP Group paid an average of 0.8p/lb more for R3 bullocks, but this increase was unevenly spread across the six factories in the group. Prices at Cahir increased by over 3p/lb to an average of 96.8p/lb while the increase at most of the other plants in the group was marginal. The average at Dawn Group and Kepak was practically similar to the previous week.
Carrigans of Donegal paid the top price at 98.5p average, with AIBP at Cahir, Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff, and Moyvalley (Bergins) of Kildare all paying over 96p/lb average for R£ bullocks. A further 11 factories paid over 95p/lb average. The factories paid an average of 93p/lb for O3 bullocks.
The average for R3 heifers was similar to the previous week at just under 95p/lb.
Liffeys, Kepak at Clonee and Carrigans paid between 96.3p/lb and 98.2p/lb. Another 10 factories paid over 95p/lb average. The average for O3 heifers was 91.6p/lb an increase of 2 cents/kg (0.6p/lb)."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10099431.html,2004-03-06 00:00:00,EU imports of beef increase sharply in 2003,"In the July-December 2003 period which represented the first six months of the current GATT year which began on July, 2003 marked a doubling of beef imports paying full tariffs and duties when compared to the same period of the previous year.
Ireland imported an additional 14% of beef tonnage at full tariff and duty, while the biggest volume increases were in sales into Germany and The Netherlands.
Imports to Spain, France, Italy, and Britain also increased as an indication of the aggressive marketing of beef by non- EU producers and the competitive price at which the beef is coming to the market which rendered the duties and tariffs imposed by the EU on over-quota beef ineffective in controlling sales to the EU.
Total imports for the six months, paying full duties and levies, amounted to 42,000 tonnes compared to imports of 62,000 for the whole of the previous year.
Germany and The Netherlands increased their imports, paying full duty and tariffs around 5,000 tonnes each to over 9,000 and 10,000 tonnes respectively.
Spanish imports almost trebled on previous levels, though coming from a low base. Imports to Ireland increased by over 14% with 1,057 tonnes being bought despite duties and levies.
However Britain, an important market for Irish beef imported 70% more of the over-quota beef increasing volume to 8,600 tonnes. France imported an extra 43% to over 2,000 tonnes.
The threat of competition from very low-cost non-EU producers who can market increasing volumes of beef into EU outlets despite the barrier of levies and tariffs remain a concern for Irish producers."

“Until an agreement can be secured, the advice available to us is that it may be detrimental to Irish marketing if we insist on that position. We have established a sub-group of the main group to try to draft a conclusive recommendation, so we can hang a single flag for Ireland on all products leaving this country for sale on global markets,” he said.
Minister Treacy said he agreed with Deputy O’Keeffe’s remarks regarding Kerrygold, which is a major brand name for Ireland. It is a brand product and the green label gives it the Irish flavour without the distinctive label of Ireland as the country of origin.
“The Deputy also referred to the own-label situation. This is based on providing transparency and an assurance for the consumer from the multiples that the product being sold is from a clearly identified location. It is important and has worked well, and it is to be hoped that we can capitalise on it and develop it further in the future,” he said.
He could not understand why members of parliament or the farming organisations say agriculture is in decline. All over the world, the numbers involved in agriculture were fewer. This situation was not unique to Ireland. “If we want to live in utopia, put a steel wall around the country and say we will produce and consume our own, we will have a 90% surplus of agricultural produce in the country. That would be a crazy way to run this island. We need a situation where we have access to the European Union market.”
Mr Treacy said Fianna Fáil led this country into the Union in the 1970s, and negotiated from the 1960s through the 1970s to change everything.
“Prior to joining the European Union in 1973, we exported 75% of all our produce to Britain. Since then we have quadrupled our exports to Britain, but these now only form 24% of the total volume of our exports. This demonstrates the distance we have travelled, the production capacity we have achieved, the number of people involved in a productive capacity, the number of jobs created and the great opportunities in the industry”.
Minister Treacy said the Kerry Group is probably one of the leading food companies in the world on the global stage. Glanbia, Green Isle, Anglo Irish, Dawn and Baileys are companies which export and operate throughout the world.
“We should be proud of them and recognise that they have played a huge role and have been flagship companies for Ireland,” he said.
Minister Treacy said: “We live in a global marketplace. We open markets across Europe and the world and are part of a World Trade Organisation situation and must, therefore, accept that a certain amount of products will come into our country. I did some research into the reason other food products are imported here, whether beef, chicken or whatever. They come because we have a good economy and people want a choice.
“More particularly, they come because suppliers are able to get a guaranteed price on the product for a 12 month period and can do their planning and accounts, know their profits and conduct their business. We cannot get that on the market here. In our flexible market, when the price rises, the purchasers are charged a higher price, but when the price goes down, the purchasers are charged the same price.
“The people here involved in production, supply and procurement will have to look forward and give this same 12 month guarantee on prices. This is the only way forward.”
“We can never eliminate competition, because it is always good to have some. It would be a serious matter to be in a position where competition was eliminated. However, we must ensure that we work together to provide stability in the market, by giving continuity of price over a 12 month period, and taking the ups and downs and flexibilities of the market, to ensure trade and business can compete,” he said."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10099464.html,2004-03-11 00:00:00,'Country of origin key to food success',"COUNTRY of origin labelling is the secret to saving the Irish food industry and protecting farmers from exploitation. So declared former Food Minister Ned O'Keeffe, TD, in a wide ranging and controversial address to the Dail during a debate on Bord Bia, and on its proposed merger with Bord Glas.
He was reprimanded on two occasions by the Leas Ceann Comhairle, for holding up packets of Denny and Galtee rashers. Deputy O'Keeffe called for a national food agency, the appointment of a consumer, preferably a woman, as chairperson of Bord Bia, and he warned that the Rip Van Winkle attitude to agriculture in Ireland must change. He said the Bord Bia bill now going through the Oireachtas does not go anywhere near what is needed to develop, promote or market the Irish food industry.
""Why have we not had the foresight to incorporate all food agencies into one statutory body? I have a farm and a primary production site and am involved in all facets of farming, including dairy, beef and pigs, and I can never understand why there is such a lack of commitment on the part of people in agriculture and in Government to get our act together.""
Deputy O'Keeffe asked why is there no link with the Irish Dairy Board, headed by Noel Cawley, and referred to a recent article by the former IFA president Joe Rea in which he quoted the chief executive of Dairygold regarding the cheese market in Britain.
""He asked why we cannot all market under the umbrella of the Irish Dairy Board, rather than having other types of links. If we do not go down this route, we will only be dealing in half measures,"" said Deputy O'Keeffe.
Deputy O'Keeffe said Bord Bia has done a good job to date, in a very restrictive way. He complimented Michael Duffy as an outstanding chief executive and a great diplomat on behalf of Ireland for the Irish food industry across the world. He also praised the work of Aidan Cotter, director of operations.
""However, it is easy to promote when markets are good, as is the case in the beef market at present. It is progressing in terms of price and we will not have enough beef to supply the markets. Why could we not have found these markets three, four, five or six years ago, when the overall market was depressed?""
Deputy O'Keeffe said he has been arguing for some time about country of origin. A recent article in the Irish Farmers Journal referred to BSE in the US, Avian Flu in Thailand and the US and a refusal on the part of McDonalds, the hamburger chain, to use South American beef because of lack of traceability.
""McDonald's is one of the largest franchises in the world and it has refused to take Brazilian beef because of problems of traceability"".
""There is no point in telling me that the aforementioned countries have no statutory measures to protect their beef and chicken industries. ""In Brazil, the average salary received by a beef industry worker on the factory floor is e100 per month"".
""It is not so long ago since Dunnes Stores was boycotted for buying grapes from South Africa, where workers were treated so badly under the apartheid regime. However, we are eating beef in Ireland that was also produced by slave labour and nothing is being done about it. Traceability is very important.""
Referring to a reported row between the Department of Agriculture and Food and a Cork farmer regarding the Department's special investigation unit, he asked: why does the Department not investigate what is coming through our ports?
""Why does it not examine Thai chicken, Korean chicken and products from Indonesia and Brazil, and compare them with the produce of Irish farmers? Irish farmers are not doing what producers in these countries are doing and they are not using the same feedstuffs. We have learned a lesson from what happened regarding Far-Eastern chicken.
""Were it not for the Sunday Times, we would not know about the Kerry Group being hit by the ban on Thai chicken imports. It is the largest importer in the country, thus affecting Irish farmers. The Government will have to decide if it is supporting big business or our farmers.
""Telling me that the countries in question export to European and North American standards does not mean anything.
""In Ireland, the way we develop our business and production is enshrined in law, whereas that is not the case in the other countries.""
Deputy O'Keeffe said the Oireachtas, which makes the laws of the land, should ensure that the country of origin is specified on products.
""What is wrong with listing the country in which a product originated? The Irish consumer is being conned at an unprecedented rate. The Danes produce one million tonnes of pig meat in their slaughter houses. We slaughter pigs and produce 250,000 tonnes of meat.
""There are no significant imports of chicken into Denmark. They have about seven million people, their dairy quota is the equivalent of ours, but there are no significant imports into the country.""
""Denmark exports on a massive scale. It imports 40,000 tonnes of whole pig meat and about 20 tonnes of pig fat. I am a pig producer, and I know we produce 250,000 tonnes of pig meat and import over 50,000 tonnes.
""Will the Minister of State tell me how this can be justified? It is about time somebody did something about the problem.""
Holding up a packet of rashers, which, he said, was produced by Denny in Shillelagh, he said he would like to know the origin of this meat.
He said he understood the plant in Shillelagh is full of imported bacon products. Yet, the packaging referred to Bord Bia.
""I am paying a levy to Bord Bia. Am I paying it to import products? Farmers are on their knees and the Rip Van Winkle attitude to agriculture in Ireland must change,"" he said.
Deputy O'Keeffe said the own-label phenomenon is a new con job.""We now have many supermarket chains, including Lidl, Aldi and Tesco, all of which are looking for a market share. Wal-Mart is the largest in the world. It is about time the European Union had a directive pertaining to the own-label phenomenon.""
Deputy O'Keeffe said he could start up a consumer food business, get a grant from Enterprise Ireland and obtain all the foods from abroad, regardless of the existence of Irish farmers and producers. ""Every country has its own patriotic sentiments. We are importing while the Danes are exporting and therefore there is a problem. Irish farmers are paying Bord Bia levies. For what? It is about time the farmers and the IFA examined where our levies are going. I am a substantial payer of levies to Bord Bia. Let us be straight about the fact that this cannot continue. I am telling the truth about this.""
Stressing that the food industry is a significant one for the country, he asked for what are farmers paying statutory levies? Is it so that advantage can be taken of them? ""Farmers are being treated like peasants. I am a farmer and I know what is happening. What will happen in the future? We will have no sugar beet industry, no pig industry and no chicken industry this is nearly gone anyway and we will have a few ranch or dairy farmers. We are proud of this and boast about it in the Mid-Term Review. We think it is great that the country is regressing to the time of the Firbolg and Tuatha Dé Danann. It is about time someone stood up for Irish farmers and Irish agriculture.""
Deputy O'Keeffe said he was not finding fault with officials. Some of the finest officials in Ireland practically all of them worked in the Department of Agriculture and Food. He was very proud to work with them and they were as bright as one will find in any part of the land. The board of Bord Bia is predominantly represented by big business interests. It should have a consumer chairman, preferably a woman,"" he said.
Deputy O'Keeffe said the ex-Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food is on Bord Bia and on the board of Kerry Foods, and this unethical contradiction should be corrected.
""We are not protecting ourselves from the problem posed by the Pacific Rim. We do not need to import from those countries who do not have legislation to protect their industry.
""Can the Minister of State devote five minutes to explaining why we cannot have the country of origin marked on our products? Is it because Kepak wants to mix its beef with French or Scottish beef or Goodman wants to do something else? We have had enough of that.
""Let us put the country of origin on our products, and protect the farmer-producer and consumer. The country of origin is the secret to saving our food industry and protecting our farmers from exploitation.""
Deputy O'Keeffe produced another packet of rashers, which, he said, were Galtee and did not carry any reference to Bord Bia, because the company imports so much, scaling down the purchase of local pigs in favour of imports, even though it receives Enterprise Ireland grant aid.
""The Minister of State is in charge. Let him make a name for himself and be the Donogh O'Malley of agriculture by making an order tomorrow that the country of origin must be identified on the package, and forget about big business.""
Deputy O'Keeffe said he does not understand why an Irish Government, led by Fianna Fáil, would shy away from its responsibility to protect the consumer and the producer on such an important issue. ""I would also like to know why the Minister of State did not develop a national food agency, because he tells us we export 90% of our produce. There is no problem legislating to incorporate the private sector into a State sector,"" he said.
Deputy O'Keeffe said the Bord Bia Bill does not go the distance to solve the problems of the food industry. Farmers must produce food to compete with food coming into the country, where there is no legislation to protect them. Irish farmers are disciplined and there are no rogues among them. Their herds have a good disease-free status. Most diseases in the country come from imported stock. There is more supervision and argument with farmers at farm level than at the point of entry in our ports.
""I am told that one could bring an elephant into the country and he would not be seen until he put his head up somewhere, but if I had a bullock with no tag and he strayed, half of the Department's squad would come after him. That is the truth,"" he said."

For example, a 56-year-old driving a 2001 Toyota Avensis received a quote of €735 from Axa for comprehensive insurance. However, the quote was just €452 from Royal & Sun Alliance a 38% difference. For a 19-year-old student driving a 1999 Opel Corsa, the cost of insurance varied from €343 at Quinn Direct to €480 at Allianz.
A 27-year-old man from Sligo was quoted €1,559 from Allianz for insurance on his 1995 Volkswagen Golf, while Quinn Direct offered to insure him for just €945.
In some cases, the savings were even higher.
""Although the process does take a little time, It is clear from the survey that you can have more money in your pocket by taking a little time to look at all of your options. The difference between one quote and another can be very significant,"" IFSRA consumer director Mary O'Dea said yesterday.
But Michael Horan of the Irish Insurance Federation said the survey was good news for consumers as it showed premiums were falling.
On the wide disparity in prices, Mr Horan said each company would have a different level of claims and this was reflected in the prices quoted to motorists a higher number of claims to a particular insurer will result in higher premiums.
The warning on insurance prices came as Tánaiste Mary Harney announced a new initiative to end the ""horror stories of rip-off Ireland"" and beef up consumer rights.
Ms Harney has set up a strategy group to formulate a national policy to ensure consumers are aware of their rights. It will make recommendations on legislation and conduct surveys to see if people are getting a fair deal.
""Competition will only succeed with the co-operation of consumers. I want to encourage a culture where consumers are confident and insistent in demanding value and quality at all times,"" Ms Harney said."

The overall kill for the week was back by 300 head and bullocks dropped by 145 head. Week-on-week with 2003, bullocks are 3,000 head higher and the total kill is up 6,000 head. So far this year bullocks are down more than 7% and the total kill is down over 6%.
Yesterday the factories quoted 263-258 cents/kg (94p-92p/lb) for R's and 255-252 cents/kg (91p-90p/lb) for O's. A considerable percentage of the kill was being purchased at 92p-93p/lb for R's and it was harder to get over 94p/lb for quality cattle.
The increase in supplies to the factories - following a weekly increase of over 2,000 in the bullocks three weeks ago - appears to have eased with last week’s kill short of the previous week, helping to steady prices again. There is no indication of any downward trend in the prices being sustained because the processors need all the cattle they are getting to fill orders and hold their markets. Producers are holding out on price and the balance between demand and supply remains tight which is continuing to favour producers - as the processors complain about the margins in beef.
There is also a steady cow trade. Heavy cows are quoted at 213 cents/kg (76p/lb) - lighter animals at 2p/lb less - and some factories are paying up to 84p/lb for good heavy cows."

The average paid for R3 bullocks was 93.5p/lb down 0.6p/lb while O3 grade was back by the same margin to an average of 91p/lb.
AIBP Group paid an average of 93p/lb.
While the average paid at Waterford and Clones remained stable, the average paid at Bandon for R3 bullocks was 92p/lb, a drop of 1.3p/lb and at Rathkeale the average slipped under 92p/lb following a drop of 1.6p/lb on the previous week.
The price at Nenagh was just short of the national average for the week.
The average for R3 bullocks purchased by then Dawn Group was down 1p/lb at 92.8p/lb. Waterford dropped 1.6p/lb to 93p/lb with prices at Midleton and Cahir down by 0.5p/lb to 0.8p/lb.
The top price for R3 bullocks was 98.6p/lb at Carrigans of Donegal, with Liffey Meats and Bergins Moyvalley Meats paying 95p/lb average and AIBP (Clones), Kepak (Clonee) Kildare Chilling and Newgrange Meats among the tops at over 94p/lb. O3 bullocks averaged 91p/lb.
The national average for R3 heifers was 93.6p/lb. Eleven factories paid an average of 94p/lb or better with the top-paying Kepak at Clonee paying an average of 96.7p/lb which probably included some premium price young beef and Liffeys paying over 95p/lb.
Newgrange Meats, Meadow Meats, Jennings, Slaney Meats and Kildare Chilling all paid over 94p/lb average.
The average nationally for O3 heifers was 91p/lb.
Cull cow prices eased back slightly with a top price of 83p/lb at Liffey Meats, Ballyjamesduff for R5 grade, 82.5p/lb at Kepak (Clonee) for O5 grade and 80p/lb for P+4H grade at Liffeys.

""Given that EU farmers probably receive no more than 30% of the average consumer euro spent on food, a relatively large farm-level price reduction of 20% will result in only a 6% reduction in consumer food prices. Thereafter, consumer food prices will probably continue to increase as the marketing sector continues to add more services and as unit costs in that sector increase.""
Mr O'Connell's article predicts taxpayers will not benefit from further CAP reform as there is no planned reduction in the EU agricultural budget.
But changes under the CAP mid-term review will have major implications for farm structure, volume of farm output, agriculture exports and imports.
While stressing that projections must be treated with caution, he identifies the likely consequences for Irish agriculture as a reduction in the volume of beef and lamb output with increases in output of some other agricultural products.
Dairy product prices will decline, as will the incomes of dairy farmers and significant restructuring of dairy production is expected.
As to impact on the structure of dairy farming, Mr O'Connell draws on the work of IFA chief economist Con Lucey, who states that ""medium-sized dairy farmers, with a 45,000-gallon quota, will no longer be viable"".
Mr O'Connell concludes that EU farmers will, in the main, realise they are better off having their businesses directed by market forces rather than by politicians and bureaucrats.
""Ultimately, efficient and energetic farmers will be able to forge ahead. On-farm operational factors will be understandable because they are dictated by market forces rather than by political expediency.
""Farmers will be able to get back to applying science and knowledge to what they want to do that is, produce food and food raw materials,"" he states."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10060393.html,2004-03-24 00:00:00,Food outlook good after enlargement,"The Directorate-General for Agriculture report also said the prospects for EU cereals, meat and dairy were relatively positive.
Cereal markets would benefit from growth in exports and increased uses for cereals within the EU. This would be enough to absorb the increase in cereal production, which would otherwise have put pressure on prices.
The report also found the current situation in the beef market, where consumption is higher than domestic production, would continue at least until 2010. Other meat markets were expected to recover from their current difficulties, such as relatively high pig meat production and an outbreak of avian flu in the Netherlands, over the same timeframe. Beef consumption in the 15 existing member states had almost completely recovered from the market shock caused by the BSE or “mad cow” crisis.
The dairy sector would also improve gradually after what the report’s authors called “the current short-term imbalance“. Greater production and consumption of cheese, coupled with the lower availability of butter and skimmed milk powder, would be the main drivers behind this.
Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) would help improve the supply/demand balance in most agricultural markets, especially in cereals, rice, meat and dairy products, while overall income of the agricultural sector would not be affected too much by CAP changes."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10105164.html,2004-03-25 00:00:00,Spell of weaker prices only a blip,"Quotes from most of the processors were improved by 1 or 2p/lb on Monday, with the poorer grades showing the largest average increase, and a strong indication of more flat price purchasing.
The factories are quoting up to 95p/lb for good quality R grade animals and varying back to 93p/lb, which is an improvement of at least 1p/lb at all factories, and more at some of plants. The O grade stock are quoted at 92 and 91p/lb, an improvement of up to 2p/lb at some factories.
It has proved to be somewhat of a seller’s market this season, in sharp contrast to past years, and producers are now making a few bob of a profit margin on stock, which is very badly needed at farm level to restore some degree of confidence in spring finishing of beef.
While there has been much valuable work done by the processors in securing markets resulting in a good weekly demand for beef , the principal reason for the current positive run which is benefiting farmers is the shortage of stock for slaughter.
The recent increase in supplies, which led to easing prices over the past fortnight, was short lived.
Now, processors are complaining bitterly that they are suffering a squeeze on profit margins, and there are reports of some processors maintaining their operations out of beef reserves, to hold onto markets, rather than go into the cattle marketplace.
Throughput at the factories last week was 28,106 head, compared to 32,340 head for the previous week, but account must be taken of the shorter week due to St Patricks Day.
The steer kill was 15,296, down from 17,945 head the previous week.
There is a market for over 18,000 steers per week. It is not until supplies exceed that level that there is any threat to the price at the factories.
The odds appear to favour farmers for prices to hold firm for the remainder of the season, as any significant increase in supply appears unlikely.
The trade for cull cows continues firm. Up to 76p/lb is quoted for heavy cows and up to 83p/lb is being paid by the top factories, which is slightly down from the peak prices which had been paid in recent weeks."

The overall average paid by the processors for R3 beef animals last week was up almost 0.5p/lb as supplies slipped back for the second consecutive week increasing the pressure on the factories to get sufficient cattle to fill their orders.
The drop in supplies which led to the recovery in prices has dented any immediate prospects for the factories of cheaper cattle.
AIBP Group increased their prices for R3 bullocks by an average of 0.5p/lb with an improvement of 1.4p/lb recorded at the Rathkeale plant. Prices increased by an average of 0.7p/lb at the Dawn Meats Group and were unchanged at Kepak plants at Watergrasshill and Athleague.
The overall average paid for R3 bullocks and heifers was 94p/lb. Among those paying above the average were Liffey Meats, Ballyjamesduff, AIBP, Clones, Kildare Chilling, Kildare, Bergins Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare, Exel Meats, Kilbeggan and Dawn Meats at Waterford. The average for O3 bullocks was 91.4p/lb.
Against an overall average of 94p/lb for all factories, Carrigans paid a top price of almost 97p/lb for R3 heifers, followed by Meadow Meats, Rathdowney at 96p/lb, Liffeys of Ballyjamesduff at 95.4p/lb and Slaney Meats, Bunclody, AIBP, Clones, Bergins Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare and Jennings of Ballinrobe each paying an average of 94.6p/lb.

Bigger numbers of cattle were on offer at the marts yesterday and farmers were out in force to push prices to dizzy heights for the choice continental single punched bullocks on offer in the sales rings where the competition for the quality lots was hot.
The bullocks trade reached new heights at Bandon Mart when a lot of six choice Charolais bullocks weighing 532 kgs were bid to €1,040 before the fall of the hammer.
There was a good increase in the number of stock on offer yesterday with a very strong trade for heifers.
Apart from the choice lots prices were also strong for the plainer lots. A lot of seven single punched 376 kg Friesians made €740.
The forward single punched stores ranged €270 over e/kg to €508 over. Beef heifers made up to €180 over and stores sold up to €230 over.
There was 850 head on offer at Kilkenny up from 420 last week. Top price was paid for a lot of two single punched 575 kg Limousin which sold for €1,100 with forward single punched ranging €370-€525 over €/kg.
Single punched in the 400-500 kg range made up to €459 over and stores under 400 kg sold up to €415 over.
Heifer prices were improved by €10/head with beef and stores making up to 270 over.
Kilmallock Mart had one of the largest sales of cattle this week with 900 head on offer with single punched bullocks in the range 400-500 kgs selling for up to €440 over €/kg. Beef heifers made up to €240 and stores up to €220 over."

Up to €400 over €/kg was paid yesterday for heavy punched out bullocks and the fancy forward store bullocks with a premia were making €475 over to €550 over €/kg many of these animals now costing up to €1,000/head.
More cattle are on offer at all of the marts this week, but there are plenty of buyers for quality livestock and even the plainer cattle are making good prices with plenty of interest from those who are reluctant to pay the bigger money for the tops.
There was a big increase in the supply at Fermoy Mart yesterday where the trade for all types was described as ""excellent"" with prices all round improved on last week. Forward single punched stores sold for up to €430 over €/kg with plainer lots making back to €180 over and medium weights with a premia made €190-€435 over. The heifer trade was also very strong with butchers' heifers making €140-€230 over and stores making up to €245 over.
At Athenry Mart, up to €410 over was paid for good punched out bullocks a 580kg Charolais selling for €990 and a red Limousin 540kg making €935, while Friesian made around €200 over.

In its latest forecast for 2003 to 2010, the European Commission stated that beef consumption will exceed production in the EU for the first time in more than 20 years, and predicted a 7% rise in beef prices.
In the same report, the Commission said beef imports are projected to continue to increase, and the EU 15 will soon be importing slightly more beef than it exports.
It sounds like good news for European cattle farmers.
Or it could leave Europe's food industry baying for beef in 2005, leaving the political climate may be just right for the EU to lower trade barriers to solve its meat shortage, in the context of world trade talks, which are not likely to resume in earnest until 2005.
Already, Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler has said the EU is prepared to discuss the elimination of agricultural export subsidies on all farm products, in WTO talks.
But there's more good news; Over Thirty Months Cattle from the UK are not now expected to hit the market in 2004.
And Ireland is readier than many competitors to take advantage, with our cattle traceability apparently now the envy of other beef producing countries.
That's according to no less an authority than the US Government, impressed by Ireland's ability to rebound from the depths of the BSE crisis to regain markets, even though it is rated as a high risk origin.
The US agricultural attache here has reported back to Washington how our traceability has been instrumental in our regaining access to important international markets, temporarily closed due to fears of animal diseases, especially BSE.
Particularly impressive was Russia allowing in Irish beef while still maintaining a ban on meat or animals from other high BSE-risk countries.
They were reassured by our active animal identification and tracing system so the extra paperwork is paying off for farmers, in our computerised cattle movement monitoring system, operated in conjunction with manual and computerised recording systems from the farm through the slaughter plant.
As for live export prospects, the EU seems ready to negotiate away the refunds which make sales to non-EU destinations possible. And the future of live exports to other EU member states will not be clear until after the EU farm council meeting in Luxembourg on April 26.
The European Commission wants a maximum journey time of nine hours, followed by a 12-hour rest, before the journey can continue.
But the European Parliament wants a maximum journey time of eight hours, end of story, and have called for animals to be slaughtered as close to the point of origin as possible.
But EU farm ministers will ultimately decide the issue, and with at least six member states happy with the current rules and three seemingly neutral, there is a good chance of an outcome favourable to Irish exporters.
If all the prospects for 2004 come to fruition farmers will soon be seeing some cattle prices not heard of since the mid-90s.
But they will have to wait until well into 2005 for the WTO talks before they can hope for a longer term return to high cattle prices."

In another week of heated trade, prices on offer for beef increased by 3 to 6 cent/kg (1p to 2p/lb), and the price clock is ticking quickly towards delivering 100p/lb, with 277 cents/kg (99p/lb) quoted this week for U grade cattle, and some reports of close to that being secured for mixes of good quality U and R grade cattle.
Across the south, most of the factories quoted 263 and back to 258 cents/kg (94p to 92p/lb) for stock this week. Most of them were paying more than that to get the cattle; how much more depended on their necessity to get more cattle, and on supplies in their area.
In the east of the country, Slaney Meats quoted 277 cents/kg (99p/lb) for U grade, with 268 and back to 257 cents/kg (96p to 92p/lb) for R and O grades.
Excel at Kilbeggan, and the company’s other plant at Newgrange Meats, Navan were also offering 268 and back to 257 cents/kg (96p to 92p/lb) for R and O grades, as was Donegal Meats, where 277 cents/kg (99p/lb) was on offer for U grade.
The last time that cattle prices touched these levels was 1996 and, since then, the spring finishers have experienced some very lean years. But those who stuck with winter finishing are reaping decent margins this year.
The effect of the change about in supply and price has however begun to show on the factories, with the decision of Fair Oak to cease slaughtering at their Clonmel facility, because of the difficulty in getting cattle.
A spokesperson for the company said that it is intended to resume slaughtering there in mid-August. In the meantime, the company will continue to process beef at their Bagenalstown, Co Carlow facility to supply their contracts.
The company is honouring in full all payments owing to suppliers of stock and other services to the plant at Clonmel.
There is a lot of speculation within the industry that Fair Oak may not be the only factory to find it necessary to follow this course of action over the next few months. A number of processors are trimming their operations and workers are now being laid off in the processing industry, as profit margins continue to tighten.
The exit of Clonmel has reduced the capacity for cull cows, which continue to be quoted at 218 cents/kg (78p/lb) at Dawn."

But they will have to wait until well into 2005 for the WTO talks before they can hope for a longer term return to high cattle prices."

The improvement of 1p/lb was paid by most of the factories for cattle last week with an overall average increase of slightly less than 1p/lb recorded for R3 bullocks which averaged a shade under 95p/lb.
The improvement in prices paid for R3 heifers was slightly less with a top factory price of 98.3p/lb paid, while the national average was similar to the bullocks at just 95p/lb.
Cattle supplies for the week were 2,200 head lower than the corresponding week in 2003 of which bullocks accounted for 1,800 head of the drop.
As a result cattle supplies were more expensive. Although paying up to 1p/lb more for beef, averages paid for R3 bullocks by the three major processors, AIBP Group, Dawn Group and Kepak Group were at least 0.5p/lb under the national average for the week.
AIBP plant at Clones was the only one from that group to qualify among the seven highest-paying processing centres.
Carrigans of Donegal, Bergins Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare, Liffeys of Ballyjamesduff, Duffys of Gort, Exel at Kilbeggan and Kildare Chilling took the other top six places.
For R3 heifers, Carrigans paid an average of over 98p/lb, Kepak at Clonee paying 98p/lb and Meadow Meats, Rathdowney paying 96p/lb.
Dawn, Ballyhaunis, Liffey Meats, Ballyjames -duff, AIBP at Clones and Slaney Meats, Bunclody all paid over 95p/lb average.
Kepak at Clonee paid the highest price for cows at 84p/lb for O4H. Liffey Meats paid 82p/lb for R5 and 80p/lb for P+4H grades."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10086040.html,2004-04-02 01:00:00,Improvement in prices for heifers,"Prices for beef and store heifers dominated in the sales, where up to €300 over was paid for quality lots and supply fell short of demand at some centres. Among the highest prices recorded was €790 paid for a 492 kg Limousin at Kilkenny Mart, where in general the qualify beef ranged €250-€280 over E/kg and prices were improved by up to €10/head, with over 800 cattle on offer. Prices for butchers heifers were on par or slightly stronger with a top price of €775 paid for a 468 kg Limousin heifer. Another Limousin scaling 436 kgs sold for €725. Up to €250 over was paid for store heifers with prices ranging €170-€250 over €/kg.
At Bandon Mart, it was also the turn of the heifers to dominate with €230-€250 over a common price range. A 450 kgs Limousin sold for €700, a lot of five Angus heifers weighing 332 kgs sold for €540.
Heavy punched out bullocks were in keen demand at Bandon, where they fetched up to €320 over and at Kilkenny up to €278 over was paid for the punched out bullocks.
Forward store bullocks tended to be a little easier at all of the sales, with less heat in the trade and fewer of the very high prices of a week earlier recorded around the sales rings. In general, a steady trade at prices which eased back a little, with the tops making up to €470 over, which is still a strong price, but back by €20-€30/head.
Weanling prices in the west were unchanged. Weanling bulls, born before April 1 2003 sold for €300 to €500 over E/kg at Athenry Mart, where there was a bigger entry. Weanling bulls born post May 1 2003 made €250 to €455 over E/kg. Weanling heifers sold from €150 over to €215 over."

Bord Bia believes that the 3% deficit in production will attract an increase in beef imports from the competitively priced producer countries such as South America, particularly because EU intervention stocks of beef have been totally cleared.
The 2004 production level of 97% self-sufficiency contrasts with production of 108.5% of requirements in 2001 and surplus in all years for the previous decade.
Production in France, the largest producer of beef within the EU 15 is forecast to decline by 4% on 2003 levels, which were only marginally lower than 2002 levels. France is expected to be 96% self-sufficient.
Production in Germany is expected to decline by 3% on 2003 output, which was 7% lower than 2002. As a result of the continued decline in beef production in Germany, supplies available for export are expected to drop by 10% following a landslide of 37% in export sales last year.
Production in both the Netherlands and Spain is expected to increase. Production in the Netherlands is expected to increase by 3% and output in Spain is expected to grow by 2% in 2004. A marginal change upwards in consumption is predicted for both countries.
Production is expected to remain stable in Italy where consumption is likely to decline by 1%. Production in Britain is expected to increase 2%."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10125581.html,2004-04-10 01:00:00,Supplies of beef expected to rise,"In a detailed analysis of the production patterns in the accession countries, Bord Bia has calculated that the addition of the new countries will increase the dairy cow population by 25% while the beef cow herd will increase by less than 3%.
“Given declining cattle herds and the fact that the majority of cattle are dairy animals as opposed to specialist beef breeds, it is difficult for retailers to consistently source sufficient volumes of domestic beef.
Therefore, in the immediate future, an opportunity may exist for the EU-15 and Irish suppliers to satisfy this demand particularly during promotions periods,” says Bord Bia.
Of particular interest to Irish suppliers is the pattern of beef consumption in Eastern Europe where a preference is shown for forequarter beef, in contrast to Western Europe where the demand is strongest for hind quarters.
“Therefore Eastern Europe may prove to be a good market outlet for fore quarter exports, particularly at times of the year when the market demand for this product from our traditional export markets is weak” according to Bord Bia.
However, the price which beef commands on the market in these countries could be a problem for Irish exporters. The current price in Poland for R3 grade young bulls is equivalent to 136 cents/kg (48p/lb). In the Czech Republic the price is 201 cents/kg (72p/lb).
The Slovenia price, highlights its position above the norm of the accession States, recording an average price equivalent to 223 cents/kg (79p/lb) for R3 grade young bulls."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10060617.html,2004-04-14 01:00:00,Sales of fresh and frozen meat fall,"The latest Taylor Nelson Sofres Superpanel data for the three month period December-February has shown that housewives in Britain are spending more money on meat, but they have cut back on the volume of more expensive meats being purchased.
Bord Bia points out that a drop of four per cent in the purchased volume of fresh and frozen beef has been more than offset by a significant increase in the purchase of processed meats, beef burgers, chilled ready meats, pork and sausages.
Christmas purchases of beef were down on Christmas 2002 sales and retail sales in February were back by 7 per cent on the January sales. Sales of chilled ready beef meals were over 1 per cent higher and accounted for almost 15 per cent of the total volume market. Sales of frozen ready meals were slightly higher at over 6 per cent.
Grocery multiples increased their share of the beef market, selling almost 78 per cent of total sales. The volume of beef sold by butchers was slightly down at 14.5 per cent.
Price was also a factor in lambs sales. The volume of lamb sold declined by three per cent, while consumers spent four per cent more on purchases. There was very little change in the profile of lambs cuts purchased, with leg roasting joints continuing as the most popular choice of housewives.
Retail sales of pork declined by four per cent over the three months, while expenditure increased by five per cent. Sales of pork steaks, leg roasting joints and shoulder roasting joints were lower. Sales of bacon joints and sausages increased."

Analysts expect the company to report full-year profits in the region of £760 million (€1.1 billion) next month.
""Sales this quarter are clearly not good enough,"" said chief executive Roger Holmes. He said the group would take action to correct the poor figures by cutting prices for women's clothing to improve their appeal, as well as broadening product ranges and developing more attractive stores.
The group declined to comment on the performance of its Irish stores, but has signalled confidence in the Irish market with a €60 million investment programme over the last two years. M&S opened three food-only outlets last year, in Dublin's IFSC, Dun Laoghaire and Naas, Co Kildare. These brought the total number of M&S stores here to seven, with three clothing and food stores in Dublin and one on Cork's Patrick Street.
It will open two more clothing and food stores in Dublin's Blanchardstown and Dundrum over the next 12 months and is expected to open a second store in Cork or target other cities such as Limerick and Galway. M&S has a further seven stores in Northern Ireland and employs almost 1,500 people on each side of the border.
The company said it would cut prices by an average of 3.5% for its spring/summer women's clothing range. It will also bring in more items at the lower price ranges in a bid to boost sales volumes. Two new senior executives took up their positions in charge of general merchandise and retailing last week. M&S has also beefed up its buying team to counter negative perceptions of its clothing range.
Yesterday's announcement came as a disappointment to investors who had hoped to see the company continue the recovery started in 2002 after a prolonged lacklustre performance. ""We are at a different stage than where we were 18 months to two years ago, but our market and our customers move on and we need to improve more quickly in what we can offer them,"" said Mr Holmes. ""We still have more than one million customers coming through our stores each week but we need to do more to convert that customer traffic into sales.""
M&S shares closed down 4% at stg£2.64 in London yesterday."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10056621.html,2004-04-15 01:00:00,Steady lift in beef prices continues,"While prices for R3 bullocks reached a top factory average of 101p/lb at Donegal Meats, the major players are falling back in the price league, with the average paid by both AIBP Group and Dawn Group slipping below the national average for last week.
Farmer pay-sheet returns for last week show that the Clones plant which paid an average of almost 98p/lb for R3 bullocks was the only factory in the AIBP Group to pay above the national average of 96.2p/lb for this category.
In the Dawn Meats Group, the Ballaghadereen plant which paid an average of 96.5p/lb was the only Dawn unit to pay over national average.
The Kepak Group paid the national average over their three factories, with Clonee paying slightly higher and prices at Watergrasshill and Athleague just under national average.
Those paying over 97p/lb average (incl VAT) were Carrigans, Liffey Meats, AIBP (Clones), Newgrange, Exel and Duffy's. The average for O3 bullocks was a shade under 94p/lb.
Prices for R3 heifers were almost similar to the bullocks at 96.1p/lb average. There was a top factory average of almost 99p/lb paid by Kepak at Clonee, with over 97p/lb at Liffeys, AIBP (Clones) and Exel. The average for O3 heifers was almost 93p/lb.
A new peak for cull cow prices was set at Liffey's of Ballyjamesduff, where an average of 86p/lb was paid for R4L grade and Kepak at Clonee paid the highest average for O grade at 83p/lb for O3. Liffey's were also the tops for Ps, paying an average of 81p/lb for P+4L. Strong prices were also paid for good cows at Kildare Chilling and Dawn Meats, Ballyhaunis last week."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10030618.html,2004-04-15 01:00:00,Weanling to beef losses of up to €341 per head,"The first detailed analysis of the impact of decoupling for weanling to beef production has looked at profitability on 15 working cattle farms which purchase 700 weanling bullocks and finish them to beef.
In this Teagasc assessment, it was found that on the best run farms with the most efficient production and best buying in prices, there was a profit margin of €93 per head before premia entitlements were added in.
But on some farms, there was a loss of €341 per head, which included the cost of feed and interest payments, but without allowing for fixed costs and overheads.
The purchase cost of the weanlings ranged from €183 to €239 per 100kg, and the selling price varied from €136 to €145 per 100 kg (liveweight).
Bernard Smyth, Chief Beef Adviser, Teagasc, Grange, who carried out the study, found that there was a difference of up to €180/head in the purchase cost of the weanlings in the autumn of 2001.
The range of selling prices was only e61/head, but there was also considerable variation in on-farm performance, which had a major determining effect on the overall profitability outcome.
A significant finding was that only the best performing farmers made a profit without the help of premia payments, when they sold cattle in spring and early summer of 2003.
It was found that weight gain of 0.78kg per day was required to achieve a profit.
On many farms with the level of profitability uncovered in this survey, farmers will be unlikely to continue to subsidise their high cost of producing beef, when direct payments are no longer linked to cattle."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10065192.html,2004-04-22 01:00:00,It’s the road for small farms,"Yes, farmers’ markets are being put forward as a pathway to conserve smaller scale family farming and help prevent rural depopulation in Ireland. And remarkably, this local food movement is growing, despite almost no support from policymakers.
With eyes fixed on world markets for our beef and dairy products, and with record beef exports to the EU to celebrate, local farmers’ markets are far from the minds of many.
But at Teagasc’s Rural Development Conference 2004, researchers Caroline Crowley and David Meredith put forward strong arguments supporting back-to-basics measures to save our small farmers.
Farms under 20 ha (50 acres) are decreasing in number by 3.3% per annum, while the number of our larger farms stabilises.
Farming has become more competitive, has been forced to do so by the “agri-food industrial complex” which rules on the markets where Irish farm produce must ultimately find a buyer.
Only large farms can survive hotter competition, in the long run.
Smaller farms are hanging on, some of them “below the economic threshold deemed to be economically viable, at which farmers and farm families make the decision to leave the land” according to researchers.
They are kept in place by measures such as REPS which, the researchers say, is delivered within the context of an ever-changing political environment and is thus vulnerable to withdrawal.
They also raise the threat posed by inflation eating into payments from REPS and other such schemes.
But it’s the orientation of agricultural production towards the global food economy that they see posing the main threat to Ireland’s smaller family farms, which are simply unable to compete at the same level as large-scale, intensive and industrial-style farming.
The writing must on the wall for smaller farms, when cash costs of beef production in Ireland are more than three and a half times Argentinean levels, and Irish sheepmeat production costs are more than three times those of New Zealand.
Direct EU payments have kept the wolf from the door but, next January, decoupled payments will become exposed to budgetary pressures due to EU enlargement.
Still, money will have to be found as long as maintaining smaller and well-managed family farms remains an objective in the European Model of Agriculture.
And Teagasc researchers came up with four alternative and viable self-help business strategies available to the smaller Irish family farm.
One of these is well established in Ireland - combining part-time farming with off-farm jobs. By 2002, farm holders and/or their spouses on an estimated 48% of farms had an off-farm job and almost 60% of farm household income came from off-farm sources. But this strategy depends on the geographical availability of appropriate off-farm jobs.
A second alternative is agricultural production combined with a non-farming enterprise on the farm, such as farmhouse accommodation. However, this strategy can demand capital investment beyond the means of farmers.
A third alternative is market-based and ecologically sound production as in chemical-free or organic agriculture. In Ireland, the market for organic food is e25 million per year and growing at 25% per annum. But only 30% of that demand is satisfied with Irish grown produce. Between 1998 and 2000, only 12% more Irish land was devoted to organic farming, compared to a 67% increase in the EU generally - an impressive increase, in the context of overall decline in EU agriculture.
Unfortunately, the same stumbling blocks of economies of scale and cost-price squeeze that threaten all small farmers will also arise in the organic system.
Which brings the researchers back to farmers’ markets. They are growing in popularity because they strengthen consumer-farmer linkages, through small-scale, diverse and ecologically-sound farming, while showcasing local fresh food, and earning the support of a growing grassroots movement seeking to develop sustainable agriculture and to shorten the food supply chain.
No-one expects farmers’ markets to supplant the global food economy, but they can profitably co-exist with it, and fulfil specific consumer needs, while strengthening the entire rural economy, both inside and outside the farm gate."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10093523.html,2004-04-22 01:00:00,Beef prices continue upward spiral,"Almost two-thirds of the factories paid an average of 97p/lb or better for R3 bullocks for last week’s kill, an improvement of 1p/lb, as the rate of increase in prices accelerated, driven by scarce supplies and strong demand.
Of the major processing chains, AIBP and Kepak paid an average of 1p/lb more for R3 bullocks, and Dawn Group paid just short of 1p/lb more than the previous week. most of the factories within each of the groups have now slipped to the lower half of the league on price with AIBP and Dawn Groups paying less than the national average.
Carrigans of Donegal led the field on price for R3 bullocks paying an average of 102p/lb, followed by Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff, AIBP at Clones and Kepak at Clonee, paying an average of 99p/lb, Bergins of Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare at 98p/lb a shade ahead of Exel Meats at Kilbeggan and the sister plant, Newgrange Meats, Navan. The top price for O3 bullocks was 97p/lb at Duffy’s of Gort against a national average of 95p/lb.
Carrigans and Kepak at Clonee paid 100p/lb for R3 heifers, ahead of AIBP at Clones, and Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff paying an average of over 98p/lb followed by Bergins, Jennings and Dawn at Ballaghadereen between 97.9 and 97.6p/lb.
Cull cow prices have also pushed to record levels at over 85p/lb for the top cows last week. Kepak at Clonee led the trade for cows paying an average of 85.1p/lb for R4H and 84.5p/lb for O4H. The top price for P grade was 82.3p/lb for P+4L at Liffey Meats, Ballyjamesduff."

“This wider grading interpretation will reduce the margin of error and allow a pricing structure which rewards better cattle within grades.”
Meanwhile, withdrawal of Department of Agriculture cattle carcass classification officers has been postponed to August 1.
But mechanical carcass grading will be put in place as expected during the summer, said Agriculture and Food Minister Joe Walsh when he welcomed industry wide agreement on the part of beef processors last week to proceed with the purchase and installation of machines."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10120851.html,2004-04-23 01:00:00,Strong beef prices pushing demand,"There was a bigger entry of more than 800 head at Kilkenny where prices for all types of stock were improved by at least €10/head with punched out bullocks over 500 kgs meeting with a buoyant market at up to €400 over €/kg. The single punched bullocks over 500 kgs sold from €350 over to €500 over and those in the 400-500 kg range sold for up to €515 over €/kg. The heavy heifers were also an excellent trade. Beef heifers made up to €330 over and up to €320 over was paid for stores.
At Bandon Mart bullocks and heifers continued to command top prices at yesterday's sale. The forward bullocks with a premia sold at €300-€440 over with lighter single premia store peaking at €430 over.
A lot of six single punched Charolais bullocks at 369 kgs sold for €810, with customers prepared to pay for quality. In contrast a lot of four Friesian type single punched bullocks scaling 343 sold at €550, which confirmed the margin to be gain for the better grading stock.
The trade for heifers was described as ""probably as good as it has ever been with a large supply of customers"" who paid €170-€200 over €/kg for the beef and butchers heifers and €180-€260 over for stores.
Across in the west there was a good entry of weanlings on offer at Athenry Mart where demand has reduced the effect on price of the bulls born before and after May Day 2003 the younger animals not qualifying for the second SBP. A Limousin weanling bull born after May 1 2003, scaling 440 kgs sold for €1,000 showed no effect of discounting for the loss of premia. These weanlings made €300-€560 over €/kg Weanling heifers sold at €200-€285 over €/kg."

The export trade for calves was also hit with a drop of 22 per cent for the quarter. Exports were particularly slow for the first two months of the year with a slight pick up in demand as prices eased during the second half of March.
Overall live exports to EU countries were down by 38 per cent on the same period in 2003, while trade to non EU countries was down by 84 per cent, with some weekly sales in 2003 larger than the total for the first three months in 2004.
Total live cattle exports for the first quarter of the year amounted to 29,196 compared to 51,587 in 2003 and 120,796 for the same period in 2000, one of the strong years for live exports of cattle.
Weanlings and young stores accounted for 5,814 this year, against 13,288 last year. First quarter exports for the same category in 2000 was 47,232. Calf exports were down to 12,003 this year, against 15,350 last year and 42,344 in 2000.
Bord Bia says that Holland was the principal continental EU destination for Irish live cattle this year accounting for almost one third of total exports. Exports to Spain in particular were well down because of the competitiveness of alternative suppliers compared to Ireland. Exports to the Lebanon were down by nearly 80 per cent with competitors from other EU countries and South America taking up the market.
Calf and store cattle prices have been particularly high in Ireland since the beginning of the year mirroring beef prices which hit a ten year high."

It is now over a decade since the beef prices were at their present level and store cattle particularly the punched-out and forward single punched animals are at their highest ever.
Producers selling stores are presently doing very well, but it is hard to see much scope left for the finishers of these high-priced animals to make a reasonable margin, unless there is a further significant increase in beef prices over the next two months.
A double punched 590kg Charolais bullock sold for a whopping €1,100 at Athenry Mart yesterday, where another lot of two punched-out Charolais weighing 630kg also sold for €1,100. Mart manager Martin McNamara described it as a ""super cattle trade with double punched bullocks improved by €30/head and an exceptionally strong trade for the single punched bullocks up €20/head"".
Punched-out bullocks sold for up to €430 over at Blessington Mart where up to €540 over was paid for the forward single punched bullocks. Up to €320 over was paid for forward heifers. There was an excellent trade for bullocks at Fermoy Mart where prices were marginally higher than last week."

Bank of Scotland (Ireland) chief executive Mark Duffy said the bank had always intended to expand into retail banking ""when the conditions were right"". He said the bank's application to become a member of the Irish money transmission system, coupled with a new industry code of practice to make it easier for customers to move between banks, meant these conditions had now been achieved.
Forty of the new jobs will come from the transfer of the call centre that handles the bank's Irish direct mortgage business from Edinburgh to Dublin.
That operation accounts for over €2 billion in mortgage lending. Bank of Scotland (Ireland) executive director Harry Slowey, who will head up the bank's Irish retail arm, said the move would improve service levels and cut the turnaround time between submitting a mortgage application and drawing down funds.
Mr Slowey said the changes reflected the bank's transition from being a niche player to mainstream lender in Ireland. He added that the move would allow it to offer further mortgage products, including those aimed at first time buyers and the buy-to-let market, as well as fixed-rate and interest-only mortgages.
So far, the bank has concentrated on homeowners who are trading up and looking for relatively low loans in relation to the value of their properties.
Mr Slowey said he expected the bank to lend around €800 million in this year and win a 7% market share. ""A target of 15% market share in the coming years is on the cards, given our move to being a more mainstream contender with a wider distribution base,"" he added.
The bank will also offer credit cards and deposit accounts to the retail market. Mr Slowey said the bank had already attracted €5 billion in deposits from its business customers but would build on this with a targeted marketing campaign and attractive interest rates. He added that Irish consumers could look forward to ""price led"" credit card products over the next three to six months.
This move that is expected to radically shake up the credit card market and offer lending rates significantly below those available from existing card providers.
Bank of Scotland's Irish business banking operation recorded pre-tax profits of €157 million last year, a 36% increase on 2002. It claims a 19.6% share of the business banking market, with a loan book of over €8 billion.
The bank employs 700 people in Ireland and plans to overtake Bank of Ireland as number two business bank during 2004. It has offices in Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, with a flagship building planned for Dublin's St Stephen's Green."

The central and eastern European countries joining the Union specialise in cereals, pork and poultry.
Beef production declined substantially after 1989, when the fall of communism removed consumer subsidies and raised food prices.
Most of the region’s beef comes from dairy breeds, and it is difficult for retailers to consistently source sufficient volumes of quality beef.
In several countries, cattle improvement is hindered by live exports to the EU 15 of the better young stock. Several countries also have carcase exports to the EU 15, but Bord Bia already envisages promising export prospects for Irish beef in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Beef processors here will welcome the relatively strong demand for forequarter cuts in Eastern Europe, particularly at those times of the year when demand for this product in our traditional export markets is weak.
But as income levels rise in the new EU members, consumers are expected to switch from their traditional forequarter beef to higher value hindquarter cuts.
In the longer run, strong beef exporters like Ireland can look forward to the new Europeans catching up with the EU 15’s average beef consumption of 19 kg per head.
That would represent nearly a four fold increase in beef eating for many of the 74 million people joining the EU. If the average per person beef consumption in the 10 new EU countries increased by only 1kg per head, additional imports of about 75,000 tonnes would be needed.
This opens the door for Irish and other EU 15 suppliers, particularly during promotional periods when the Western European supermarket chains which have moved into Eastern Europe will require large volumes.
The door is open for Irish exporters who have already built up a good relationship with these retailers in the UK and Continental Europe.
It will be quite some time before cattle farmers in the new member states can build up their own beef herds, with direct premium payments from Brussels decoupled. Instead, beef will come predominantly from dairy breeds.
There will be demand for Irish beef in the East, but at what price? Now, Polish farmers get only €1.36/kg of deadweight for an R3 grade young bull. Irish farmers get nearly two times that price.
In the Czech Republic, the price is €2.01/kg.
Slovenian farmers get €2.23/kg; but the Slovenes are by far the best performing cattle farmers of the new member states, the only ones to maintain cattle numbers over the last decade, helped by the country’s high beef consumption levels and an up-to-date policy of testing all animals over 30 months for BSE since 2001.
Slovenian farmers provide 2,000 to 4,000 tonnes of beef per annum for export, and they import nearly 1,000 tonnes per annum equivalent of live cattle to stock their farms.
Further south, we already send about 2.9m of Irish beef annually to the new Mediterranean member states, Cyprus and Malta.
That market should remain open, as there is little or no specialised beef production in either of these important tourist destinations."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10065251.html,2004-05-13 01:00:00,Export refunds plan angers leaders,"But Agriculture and Food Minister Joe Walsh welcomed the move to kick-start the world trade talks which broke down in Cancun last September and have since been in abeyance. Rejecting suggestions that the goalposts were being moved, he said: “What we have here is a move towards facilitating a trade agreement. It is conditional on parallel moves from the other side. In my view, it remains within the Doha mandate.”
Donal Cashman, president of ICOS, the co-ops umbrella body, claimed that the offer to the WTO countries refers to potentially very damaging concessions in the EU position. “Any reference to the elimination of export refunds is unacceptable and is a potential ‘sell out’ on Irish and EU agriculture. If refunds are eliminated it is highly likely to force another reform of the milk sector including further price cuts.
“Such a reform would go beyond the Luxembourg Agreement, which was agreed on the basis that it would provide the necessary milk reforms that would cater for the next WTO agreement,” he said. Mr Cashman said it is essential that the Agriculture Council, which met in Killarney this week, sets out clear instructions for the Commission to stay within the Luxembourg CAP Agreement as well as within the EU January 2003 offer to the WTO, which specifies limited reductions in the expenditure on export refunds but not their elimination.
On market access, Mr Cashman said it is essential the EU January 2003 offer to the WTO is also adhered to, ensuring that sensitive dairy and beef tariff protection is maintained at appropriate levels. Mr Cashman said he would be raising the ICOS concerns with Minister Joe Walsh, who, as the Agriculture Council president, must ensure that the Commission stays within the Luxembourg Agreement and the January 2003 EU offer to the WTO.
IFA president John Dillon said the EU Commission has a duty to manage the European milk market in a manner that supports farm incomes.
“It is unacceptable that the Commission is already cutting market supports in advance of the peak milk production months in Ireland and in advance of the introduction of the dairy direct payment.
“The signal from EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler that the EU is prepared to phase out export refunds, if the US and other countries do likewise, is a particular threat to Ireland’s beef and dairy industries because of our high dependence on export markets,” he said.
ICMSA president Pat O’Rourke said he was shocked and dismayed at the EU move and urged Minister Walsh to remind the Commissioner that any reduction in export refunds clearly exceeds the mandate given to the Commission by the Council of Ministers.
president Malcolm Thompson called on Minister Walsh to use his influence to strengthen the EU hand against further WTO concessions."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-10084613.html,2004-05-15 01:00:00,Rumsfeld’s fatal flaws coming home to roost,"History is not without its little ironies.
Now Secretary of Defence, Rumsfeld is under assault from the left and right and may find his long career prematurely ended because of his insufficient interest in the reconstruction effort in Iraq.
What is notable about the past few weeks is the exposure of fault-lines within the Republican Party on the inextricably linked issues of the Iraq War and Rumsfeld’s performance as Secretary of Defence. President George W Bush may support Rumsfeld but this obscures a complicated picture. Abu Ghraib may be the trigger but the concern goes deeper to Rumsfeld’s management style, failure to anticipate resistance in post war Iraq, failure to find weapons of mass destruction, and above all his apparent determination to do everything “on the cheap” with insufficient troops.
According to the columnist and leading conservative Bob Novak, ordinary Republicans “are distraught about the US adventure in Iraq. They ask questions. Who is responsible for the false forecast of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that was the immediate cause for war? Are we really intent on planting democracy throughout the Arab world? These skeptics are not about to vote for John Kerry for president, but they are very unhappy”.
Novak later wrote, “the clear consensus (of Republicans) was that Rumsfeld had to go”.
George Will, another conservative, was also scathing saying that “this administration cannot be trusted to govern if it cannot be counted on to think and, having thought, to have second thoughts”.
The message is simple: what’s happening is not working; it’s not changing either and it should.
Even neo-conservatives, the intellectual architects of the war, have turned on Rumsfeld, who they once idolised. Their beef is more personal.
Rumsfeld’s incompetence has upset their plan to bring democracy to the Middle East. Writing in Washington’s leading neo-conservative magazine “The Weekly Standard” Robert Kagan and Bill Kristol said that: “Rumsfeld famously talks about preparing for the ‘unknown unknowns’. Yet the crisis was hardly unforeseeable. He failed to put in place in Iraq a force big enough to handle the challenges. That is a significant failure, and we do not yet know the price that will be paid for it.”
Even before Abu Ghraib they wanted Rumsfeld out.
Now, in the aftermath of Abu Ghraib Rumsfeld does not have many friends.
He may have equipped himself well in front of Congress, and Republicans may believe the abuses were the work of rogue soldiers but they still ask why there were only 450 untrained reservists to guard 7,000 prisoners. How could the US be so unprepared?
This gets to a criticism commonly directed at Rumsfeld: he is stubborn, refuses to countenance information that goes against what he wants to hear, and will not change his policy as circumstances change.
Even as evidence mounted that he might be wrong he failed to change course, describing looting and disorder in the war’s aftermath as normal with the phrase “freedom’s untidy”.
This kill the messenger way of operating appears to have destroyed the ability of the policy process to adapt to change on the ground.
However, these flaws have not always been flaws. Rumsfeld was thought to be close to being fired in the weeks up to September 11, 2001. In his eight months as Secretary of Defence in the Bush administration, he had launched a bureaucratic war with all four services of the uniformed military, the US Congress, and the State Department. His time seemed to be limited. The changed landscape following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington played to his strengths and probably saved his job.
During the Afghanistan war, his abrupt manner and no nonsense attitude won him many admirers.
One can trace Rumsfeld’s destructive tendencies back further to his first stint as Defence Secretary in the Ford administration. Henry Kissinger, then Secretary of State, described him as the most ruthless man he knew, after Rumsfeld sabotaged Kissinger’s arms control agreement with the Soviet Union.
He later called Rumsfeld a “skilled full-time politician-bureaucrat in whom ambition, ability and substance fuse seamlessly”.
However, his traits are coming back to haunt him.
If Rumsfeld has lost the rank and file support, what’s keeping him in office? The answer probably lies in politics.
If Bush gets rid of Rumsfeld he will have to choose a new defence secretary. It will not be deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz because, as the intellectual godfather of the war, he is even more tainted than his boss. So, if Rumsfeld goes, there will be protracted confirmation hearings during the summer that will amount to a post mortem on the post-war plan to date. It would be tantamount to an admission of failure, which could be disastrous for Bush’s re-election campaign.
This is the choice that Bush faces: how to balance the benefits of replacing Rumsfeld with the political costs that may follow. One way has been mentioned: maybe he will swap jobs with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice."

Because of the greater demand of household spend on food, relative to the EU-15, due to the low level of income, the cost of beef is significant in securing increased sales.
While the household spend on food by the EU-15 is 16%, the range varies from 39% in Lithuania to 22% in Slovenia. While the price gap between the cost of beef in the EU-15 and the new member states has narrowed, a significant price difference remains.
Bord Bia says quality difference may offset the price difference to some extent, this will be more evident in milk and sugar where quota constraints will also apply. There are some limiting factors however, in the pace at which production is expected to increase in the new member states.
The EU Commission estimates the new member states will increase the projected EU levels of production and consumption by 10%.
The building up of the beef herd in the new member states is expected to remain limited as the decoupled nature of direct payments will leave beef production predominantly linked to milk production.
Commission forecasts put total EU-25 beef production at eight million tonnes by 2010. Overall the beef markets are expected to remain relatively stable until 2010.
Production is predicted to remain constant while consumption is expected to decline by half a million tonnes. Irish prime beef prices to producers are 40% higher than the Czech Republic and more than double prices in Poland."

It is interesting to compare yesterday’s prices with those of the same mart sales a year ago. Prices for the quality continental single punched bullocks over 450 kgs at Kilkenny Mart yesterday were €160/head higher than the same day in 2003 and good heifers sold for €100/head more. At Bandon, the single punched forward continental bullocks made €100/head more than the corresponding sale last year and the best of the heifers made up to €120/head more than 2003. Beef prices at the factories for the remainder of the year will certainly require to remain well ahead of last year if most of these animals are to leave a margin. An extra 10p/lb at the factories next autumn will fall far short of recouping the margins over 2003 prices paid for store cattle.
Numbers of cattle on offer also remain high for the eve of June with a slight increase in both bullocks and heifers at Bandon Mart. The trade for bullocks was as good as it’s ever been with some of the double punched making up to €300 over €/kg and the only easing in prices evident for the poorer lighter animals.
Forward single punched bullocks sold for up to €445 over and heifers made up to €300 over. At Kilkenny, heavy single punched were dearer by €10/head “with prices of more than €500 over a regular feature.” Up to €425 over €/kg was paid for punched out bullocks."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10084228.html,2004-06-08 01:00:00,Beef prices likely to remain firm,"As slaughtering resumes following the holiday week-end, supplies remain tight. With reasonable demand for beef continuing, the processors will remain under pressure this week to further increase prices by some margin to secure sufficient cattle to fill orders.
With up to two-thirds of the factories now paying an average of 100p/lb for R grade bullocks and heifers, there is some resistance from processors to allowing prices to go much above that. However, supply and demand continue to dictate the trade and short of an increase in the supply of stock, the hard sell by producers with finished cattle has continued to force the price gradually upwards.
Due to the Bank Holiday yesterday, the official kill figures for last week were not available last night. However, they were not expected to show any significant increase for the week and factories were active late last week sourcing cattle for the early days of this week.
The margin between R and O grades has narrowed in recent weeks to 2p/lb and there are increasing indications of more flat pricing deals.
Supplies are beginning to come off the grass, but they are still limited and likely to remain so for at least a further week.
The lamb trade has continued to suffer from downward pressure on price to producers. Prices weakened towards the end of last week and when the factories re-open this morning, it is expected that there will be fewer than normal quoting for lamb and prices will be further reduced. The processors are expected to quote a base price of 386 cent/kg (138p/lb) a further drop of 14 cent/kg (5p/lb) from the base prices at the beginning of last week. Base prices at the factories have now dropped by 73 cent/kg (26p/lb) over the past four weeks."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10125826.html,2004-06-10 01:00:00,Bullocks fetch 100p/lb at factories,"Scarce supplies and a hard sell by producers is maintaining the upward trend, which has turned out a record year for finishers. Processors who tried to hold prices at under 100p/lb for R grade have failed in their bid to control the upward price spiral, which will be stalled only by a considerable increase in supplies of cattle off the grass.
The national average for R3 bullocks and heifers across all factories for last week was 100.5p/lb and 100.7p/lb, respectively, according to the factory farmer pay sheet returns, showing an average increase of up to 1p/lb over the previous week, while up to 2p/lb of an increase was recorded in some categories of O grade. The average paid by AIBP Group for R3 bullocks exceeded 100p/lb for the first time this season following an average increase of 1p/lb. Factories at Clones, Cahir and Nenagh paid over 100p/lb average with prices averaging just under 100p/lb average for R3 bullocks at Waterford, Bandon and Rathkeale.
Dawn Group also paid an average of 100p/lb an improvement of 0.5p/lb with over 100p/lb average being paid at Midleton, Rathdowney and Ballaghadereen. Kepak paid an average of 101p/lb at the three factories. Overall, 10 factories paid an average of 101p/lb or over and a further eight factories paid 100p/lb or better. The price band has also narrowed ranging from a top of 102p/lb at Exel, at Kilbeggan to the lowest factory average of 98p/lb.
Cull cow prices were maintained at a peak of over 89p/lb being paid for R5 grade at AIBP, Clones."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10101670.html,2004-06-10 01:00:00,Up to €425 for continental bull calves,"While the rate of weekly price increase has slowed, producers of good quality stock are still holding out for that little more each week before deciding to part with their animals, and this hard sell has maintained the consistent improvement which has been the pattern of trade since early spring.
Most of the factories across the south and midlands continue to quote just shy of 100p/lb for R grade animals this week, at 99p or 98p/lb.
But high percentage of the R grade animals purchased by the factories over the past two weeks have cost them 100p/lb, on average.
The margin between quotes for R and O grade cattle has also narrowed considerably, down to 2p/lb at many of the factories and, on the ground, a significant volume of stock is being sold at flat rate prices, particularly if they are good quality cattle in larger numbers.
The supply of cattle has continued to tighten with the last of the shed cattle moved out and supplies off grass light as yet. However, early holidays at some of the factories should help to ease some of the pressure on processors allowing them to breath a sigh of relief after a season which they will remember for a long time for the wrong reasons from their perspective.
Meanwhile, with a hard sell of scarce cattle supplies by farmers, factories will not be allowed to pull back on prices for some time yet.
The first of the cattle have started to come off the grass, but the numbers are still very light and unlikely to increase sufficiently to provide much relief to the factories for another fortnight.
Cattle on grass are thriving well in the good weather, and will probably be moved out very quickly to benefit from the higher prices once they become fit.
The trade in the marts has continued to replicate the buoyancy in the factories. Plainer lots eased back slightly over the past week, but better quality cattle have continued to command up to €500 over for single punched forward bullocks and the tops of the store heifers are making over €300 with €1/kg.
Calf prices were improved by up to €40 per head at Kilmallock Mart on Monday, where the continental bulls sold for up to €425 per head and continental bull calves made up to €445 per head on Monday at Bandon.
It should be remembered that calves with registered birth dates after May 31, 2004 are not eligible for any premia payments, but this has not factored into the prices yet."

But the scarcity has delivered higher prices to producers with the factories paying 14% more for bullocks last month than for the corresponding period last year.
The total kill was down by 19,000 head, representing a fall of just over 7%. The largest percentage decline was in heifers, down by 12% to a total kill of 24,000 for the month. Bullock supplies were back by 5.5% with a throughput of 57,762 head.
But the tighter supply situation has delivered a significant improvement in returns to producers, with the average price paid for bullocks showing an increase of around 34 cent/kg (12p/lb) which has yielded around €120/head more for producers who retained finished cattle for sale during May.
Tight margins for producers in previous seasons resulted in fewer animals being finished over the winter/spring season, leading to the shortage of supply and the higher prices for producers since the beginning of the year.
Supplies of cattle finished off grass should be ready for slaughter in the next week or two.
An increase in cattle supplies could bring the first easing back in prices at the factories.
Producers will be trying to maintain the tight balance between supply and demand while anxious to take advantage of the current high returns.
The summer drop in demand for beef, and the holiday season for the factories will also impact on the trade with lower demand for livestock at the plants."

""The dumping of chemical sludge with this process is also a menace to the environment"", said the IRHA.
But Lorcan McCabe, Chairperson of the ICMSA Farm Services and Environment Committee described the request as completely excessive and clearly unacceptable. ""What is needed in this situation is enforcement of the law"", he said.
""Green diesel is for farm use only. Any problems described by the IRHA do not arise as a result of farm diesel, but rather as a result of blatant law breaking by unscrupulous rogue hauliers. If the law was enforced and these hauliers required to abide by the law of the land, then there would not be any problem."" He called on lobby groups to work together to convince the Government to reduce duty on fuel.
Meanwhile, the hauliers have targeted the Government's huge duty haul, pointing out that the cost of taking a consignment of fresh Irish beef to Rome includes tax of €477. And the total annual tax yield from a 40 tonne articulated truck is €24, 809 of duty on diesel and €2,100 for road tax.
A 10-truck operation with annual sales of €1 million must contribute €269,090 to the exchequer before the operator can earn some money.
In a statement to the Dáil Committee for Enterprise and Small Business, the IRHA said, ""Many of your colleagues used to speak of the problem of 'peripherality' of being an 'island off an island.' Keeping this economy competitive is a difficult job in terms of logistics. The road transport industry in Ireland has done an admirable job in this regard. All this has been achieved with absolutely no state aid, grants or subventions of any kind.""
The IRHA statement also pointed out that the EU pays many farmers to leave 5% of their farmland set-aside.
""If Brazil can grow sugar cane to reduce its reliance on imported fuel through a methanol programme, surely the EU can grow oil seed rape or sugar beet on this under-utilised resource"", said the hauliers. But they see the main measures needed to end their fuel cost crisis as an end-user rebate for licensed hauliers who have tax clearance certificates, and a European initiative to purchase oil in euros rather than dollars.
IFA Industrial Committee Chairman, Tom Dunne, also rejected calls from the IRHA to abolish green diesel.
He said this would penalise law abiding farmers, whereas the real targets are unscrupulous hauliers and criminal elements engaged in the illegal washing of marked diesel.
""This latest call by hauliers is part of their continuing campaign to put farmers off the road, and prevent them from legitimately delivering their produce to market using their own machinery"", he alleged.
IFA has sought an urgent meeting with the Hauliers' Association to voice objections to their campaign against farming.
Silage contractors are also reacting to fuel price hikes, by looking for an extra €10 per acre from farmers, says ICSA rural development chairman John Heney.
""I have every sympathy with the contractor, but the blunt fact is that grass silage is at increasing risk of becoming uncompetitive. This is a critical problem for Irish cattle farmers who rely so much on grass silage"".
""I am also concerned at the effect on all rural dwellers who have no other option than their car.""
""Rural dwellers do not have the option of public transport and it seems that rural life is rapidly becoming a luxury that few can afford."""

Factories requiring reasonable supplies of cattle to fill orders are finding it extremely difficult to source enough cattle these weeks, which is leaving cattle farmers in a position to bargain for a strong price before deciding to sell.
The best quote for the week was from Donegal Meats, at 286 cents/kg (102p/lb) for R3 steers, falling back to 277 cents/kg (97p/lb) for R4 grade, while 280 cents/kg (100p/lb) was quoted by Excel at Kilbeggan for R grade.
The other factories were mostly quoting 99p or 98p/lb for Rs. Quotes for O grades are ranging from 98p back to 96p/lb.
There is however a considerable number of flat price deals being negotiated for quality cattle, and in particular for larger numbers of mainly R grade animals.
While there has been a fall off in demand for beef, as is normal for the summer season and in particular when the weather is warm and households change their eating habits, the available supply is very tight, and demand is exceeding supply.
The throughput at the factories last week at 22,583 head was 7,000 head less than the corresponding week last year, and last week’s supply of steers at 9,008 head was down 5,000 on the same week in 2003, which tells its own story of the balance of supply and demand.
On the positive side, the lower supply has continued to deliver 14p to 16p/lb more for beef this month than similar cattle returned in June 2003, which is a sizeable gain. However, the high price for beef is having a big influence on the prices which store animals are making at the mart sales, and sellers of beef are finding they have to pass on most of the gain to the producers of stores when they buy replacements.
It is very hard to make any sense of current store prices, unless autumn beef prices are going to top the current trade, which would be a real turn around for the cards. Cull cow prices are remaining very firm, with up to 235 cent/kg (84p/lb) being quoted for good cows and more being paid by some of the factories."

He said producer prices are at a six-year high and there is strong demand for Irish beef in the important retail markets in Britain and continental Europe.
Mr Walsh said markets across the EU are stable and, following the complete clear out of intervention beef stocks, there is a great opportunity for Irish beef exports in the expanded EU consumer market.
Ireland exported a record 415,000 tonnes of beef to EU markets in 2003, a 17% increase on a previous record level set in 2002.
Overall, Ireland exported 500,000 tonnes last year, valued at around €1.3 billion, out of total production of 560,000 tonnes.
Mr Walsh said the complete recovery in exports to continental EU markets, with sales of 150,000 tonnes, is the most important statement of the quality and safety of Irish beef and its broad appeal to EU consumers.

After four weeks of falling prices for lambs, daily gains which have been achieved through the week, received a boost at the factories yesterday when prices recorded the largest daily gain for several weeks by up to 11 cents/kg (4p/lb).
Base prices at the factories yesterday ranged 414-406 cents/kg (148p-145p/lb) with bonus payments bringing the price for U grade and continentals up to 420 cents/kg (150p/lb) at Hacketstown.
In the marts the trade improved by €2/head at Bandon Mart where lambs sold at €32-€37 over €/kg.
The demand for lamb on the domestic market continues strong as Bord Bia is promoting Irish lamb in France, but lamb has to cope with strong competition in France.
In the cattle sales the first signs of a weakening in the very strong prices being paid for store bullocks emerged at sales at Kilkenny and Bandon yesterday. There was a big increase in the number of bullocks on offer at Bandon Mart where prices were easier for the lighter stores in particular. Double-punched bullocks continued to sell well at €220-€420 over €/kg.
There were 470 head on offer at Kilkenny where all bullocks were back by €10-€15/head while beef and butcher's heifers were dearer by €10/head. The tops of the forward single- punched bullocks continued to make up to €500 over €/kg. A top of €370 over was paid for beef heifers 516 kg Charolais selling for €885."

Analysis carried out by Bord Bia shows the average price for an R3 male animal in Poland has increased by almost 49% since the beginning of this year, with 30% of that having been gained over the first six weeks of EU membership.
The Polish price for R3 male animals has now increased to 71% of the Irish price with producers being paid 193 cents/kg (69p/lb) an increase of 64 cents/kg (23p/lb) since the beginning of the year.
In the Czech Republic the improvement in prices has not been as pronounced.
The average price for R3 male cattle has increased by 11% since the start of the year, bringing the producer price to 216 cents/kg (77p/lb) with six per cent of the increase having come since May 1.
R3 male beef prices are now at 80% of the Irish average with the gain since the beginning of the year 21 cents/kg (7p/lb).
Data is not available in Hungary for the period prior to accession. Since joining the EU on May 1 prices have increased by eight per cent to 200 cents/kg (71p/lb) which represents 73% of the Irish price.
Over the medium term, the EU Commission are forecasting that beef self-sufficiency within the new region will continue to decline and should present some opportunities for Irish exports as prices come closer to merging."

These prices are indicative of the continued strength of the market for beef, and the effect which the scarcity in supplies is having on returns to producers with 105p/lb being exceeded at Carrigans of Donegal Meats for R3 bullocks last week.
The processors maintain that the prices peaked for the season last week, and with an increase in supply this week the pressure for the higher prices has eased, but it remains to be seen if they have been successful in their attempt to halt the upward spiral.
An average of 102.6p/lb paid for R3 bullocks last week was slightly increased as was the average for O3 grade at 100.6p/lb. One third of the factories paid over 103p/lb average for R3 bullocks for last weeks kill.
AIBP Group paid an average of 102p/lb, paying a factory average of 103.5p/lb at Clones and 103p/lb at Waterford, 102p/lb at Bandon and Cahir and 101p/lb at Nenagh and 100p/lb at Rathkeale. Dawn Group averaged 101.7p/lb, ranging from 102p/lb at Waterford and Ballyhaunis to 101p/lb at Midleton and Rathdowney.
Heifer prices mirrored the bullocks with the average for R3 of 102.8p/lb varying from 105p/lb at Carrigans to the lowest factory average of 101p/lb. Prices for O3 averaged 99.6p/lb.
It was another very strong week for cull cows with Bergins Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare paying an average of 90.3p/lb for R5 grade, Kepak at Clonee averaging 88p/lb for O3."

Bull calves, with birth registered dates from June 1, 2004, carry no entitlement to premia and with the first of these now arriving in the mart sales, buyers are beginning to factor in part of the loss of the premia.
The first indications on price have shown a drop of €50 to €70/head in the value of the bull calves with post June 1 registered birth dates when compared to those being sold in the marts this week with birth dates of pre-May 31.
While the numbers of calves on offer in marts at this time of the year are low, farmers will be watching with immense interest the development of the new pattern of price over the coming weeks as a barometer of the impact on returns for breeders which the single payment regime will have.
The full picture is unlikely to become evident before March-April 2005 when annual calf sales are at their peak and purchasers are making their calculations on the new basis when it comes to buying in calves for beef production.
Meantime, the level of registrations for births of calves, received at the CMMS centre have rocketed for the final two weeks of the old regime - the last two weeks of May 2004. Applications received for birth registrations over the two week period have shown an increase of almost 50% on the same period last year, increasing from 32,000 head in 2003 to 47,000 head this year.
It is likely the disparity in the registrations will be investigated by officials."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-10120803.html,2004-07-08 01:00:00,Factories paying less to beef producers,"Pay-sheet returns from the factories for last week show that the average paid for bullocks and heifers was cut by 1p-2p/lb with reductions across the country and throughout the range of cattle slaughtered at the plants.
An increase of 25% in the supply of bullocks last week eased some of the pressure on the processors, allowing for the cut in prices, which the processors had been awaiting the opportunity to introduce for some time.
The average price for R3 bullocks was down by 1p/lb to 101.5p/lb with the average paid for O3 bullocks slipping by almost 2p/lb to 99p/lb. At the top end of the scale, Carrigans of Donegal Meats paid over 105p/lb average for R3 bullocks, with Duffys of Gort and Jennings of Ballinrobe paying over 103p/lb average and Liffey Meats, Ballyjamesduff, AIBP at Clones, Exel, at Kilbeggan, Dawn Meats at Ballaghadereen and Ashbourne Meats at Roscrea all paying 102p/lb average or better. AIBP Group factories were back by 1p/lb at an average of 101p/lb and Dawn Meats Group dropped by the same amount to an average of just short of 101p/lb, with Kepak Group dropping over 1p/lb to just under 101p/lb average.
The average for R3 heifers was back by almost 2p/lb at 101p/lb and the average for O3 heifers dropped to slightly over 98p/lb. Kepak at Clonee were the best for R3 heifers at an average of 104p/lb, followed by Carrigans and Jennings at 103p/lb, Duffys of Gort and Exel Meats at over 102p/lb.
The cut in prices for cull cows was also affected with a top price of 88p/lb at Liffeys of Ballyjamesduff for R5, while Kepak at Clonee paid 87.6p/lb average for O5 cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10098882.html,2004-07-08 01:00:00,Less grass means more cattle on market,"Some of the factories had reduced their quotes by as much as 2p/lb by mid-week, as supply continued to strengthen, heralding the end of the upward trend throughout this year.
Although an easing in price is seasonal for July, the prices are this year coming back from their highest level in almost a decade and a half, following the record run since the beginning of the year pushed by weak supplies of cattle to meet a reasonably strong demand from markets.
Up to 100p/lb was quoted for R grade stock this week in the midlands and northern regions, with the top quotes at 98p/lb in the east, and with some of the southern factories on holidays and others refraining from quoting during the early days of the week. Prices for O grade are 96p or 95p/lb.
Cow prices have also come back by as much as 2p/lb for the second consecutive week. They are being quoted at 76p/lb for heavy carcasses and back to 74p/lb for lighter animals.
A number of factors are combining to bring about the change in the prices for beef this week.
The supply of cattle coming off the grass normally increases from early July onwards to benefit from the (usually) higher prices prevailing at that time of the year.
In addition to the urge to sell while prices are high this year, a shortage of grass, following the prolonged dry period, is now forcing some producers to sell and has resulted in an increase in unfinished cattle to the factories over the past two weeks, during which some very low fat score cattle have been slaughtered.
There was a 25% increase in the supply of bullocks to the factories last week, at 13,228 head, and the level of enquiries and bookings to the factories on Monday and Tuesday suggest a further increase for this week.
Phone lines to the livestock offices at the factories were at their busiest on Monday for a long time, with the factories finding at last finding it easier to buy cattle.
Bullock supplies are now near to normal for this time of the year, following a long lean period for the factories which has been confirmed in the official kill figures at 12% less than 2003, for the year to the end of June.
Heifer supplies are down by 9%, while young bulls increased by 23,000, at 50,312 head.
In Northern Ireland, the bullock supply to the meat plants is up by 2%, while heifer numbers are 5% lower."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10068440.html,2004-07-09 01:00:00,Double punched trade stays strong,"Quality double punched bullocks continued a strong trade, but prices for plainer lots of punched out bullocks were lower, following the trend at the factories with lower prices for the past week.
In contrast, the entry of cattle at Bandon Mart yesterday was up on last week, with a steady overall trade. Double punched bullocks made €175-€280 over €/kg while single punched sold from €255 over to €370 over. In the heifer section, two 395kg Simmentals sold for €665, and another lot of two Simmentals weighing 350kgs made €620. Three Charolais, which averaged 288kgs, sold for €520.
There was an entry of €570 head on offer at Kilkenny Mart yesterday where prices for cattle were lower by €10-€20/head. Good prices were paid for heavy double punched bullocks. A 664kgs Charolais sold for €975 and a 640kg Simmantal made €955. In the single punched section, up to €400 over €/kg continued to be paid for forward quality lots, with plainer lots selling back to €270 over, and animals under 400kgs selling back to €230 over.
Beef heifers made up to €235 over and the trade for stores pushed prices for the tops to €295 over.
At Ennis Mart, the tops of the continental double punched made up to €400 over, with more average lots selling back to €175 over.
Heavy single punched trade improved with choice lots making up to €500 over and plainer lots selling back to €270 over. Heavy heifers made up to €300 over and light stores sold back to €186 over.
Numbers at Athenry Mart were back, especially in the calf section."

Kepak at Watergrasshill, Slaney Meats, Bunclody and sister factories, Exel Meats at Kilbeggan and Newgrange Meats, Navan all quoted 98p/lb for R grade on Monday and were offering 94p/lb for O grade animals, with everyone signing the same tune, that prices have peaked for the year, after a record six month run which was unequalled since the early nineties.
There is however no rush of supplies to the factories, and there will be no immediate major change in the prices, but the factories are more likely to edge prices back very gradually and slowly over the coming weeks, as the supply continues to build up and the trade moves towards the autumn.
While up to 100p/lb was still being quoted for R3 bullocks at Donegal Meats this week - and 97p/lb for R4 - most of the processors across the south, in the east and midlands were quoting R grade bullocks at 98p/lb and marking down the O grade animals to 94p/lb.
There was a bit of resistance from farmers to the prices on Monday, but there was not much scope for shopping around on price and the supplies moved more easily, at or close to the quoted prices, as the week went on.
Overall supplies to the factories last week increased to 29,129 head, of which bullocks accounted for 13,691 head, showing a further slight increase on the previous week. The weekly intake is now coming close to parity with the corresponding weeks in 2003.
The biggest price change this week was for cull cows, with up to 4p/lb knocked off, to bring base prices back to a 70 to 72p/lb range. They have dropped as much as 14p/lb within a month and, like the bullocks, come to the end of a very strong run of cull cow prices for the year to date.
Weekly supplies of cull cows to the factories are down on last year, and overall supplies for the year to date are more than 8% less than for the same period in 2003."

There was no offering of beef bullocks at Kilkenny Mart yesterday, where the entry dropped to 410 head. Forward double-punched bullocks dropped to range €144 to €192 over €/kg. All cattle were back at least €10/head with plain cattle showing a drop of €20-€30/head. The quality forward single-punched bullocks maintained their price best with up to €416 over €/kg being paid - four 504 kg Charolais sold at €920 - with most of the good single-punched in the 500 kg range selling €350-€400 over. Beef heifers ranged €170-€270 over with a good trade for the quality stores which ranged €130-€285 over.
Numbers of cattle on offer at Bandon Mart were similar to last week, with trade generally holding up well, particularly for the good cattle. Double-punched bullocks ranged €150-€295 over - a 585kg Limousin sold for €880 - while the single punched ranged €240-€400 over and a small offering of bullocks with clean ears (obviously still eligible for both premia in 2004) made up to €500 over.
The heavy heifers made €200-€280 over and light heifers sold at €160-€200 over. Some of the best prices this week for double-punched were paid at Kilmallock Mart, where they sold for up to €360 over and at Athenry Mart, where they sold for up to €345 over - both sales before the latest drop in beef prices at the factories. At Cahir Mart, they ranged €90-€130 over, making from €175 over to €245 over at Kanturk Mart and ranging up to €260 over at Fermoy."

R3 heifer prices dropped by over 2p/lb at the top of the trade, but the national average was down slightly less than the bullocks. Returns show the average paid for R3 bullocks fell to 98.6p/lb, with individual averages ranging from 102.6p/lb at Carrigans of Donegal Meats to under 97p/lb.

Breeders selling calves within a few weeks of birth are currently suffering a knock averaging €100-€125/head on the bull calves.
Calf numbers are at their lowest at this time of the season and it remains to be seen how the trade will react in the peak off season in March-April 2005 and what adjustment will be made for the effect of the loss of premiums on a headage basis after the change over to the Single EU Payment System from January 1, 2005.
At Bandon Mart this week, Friesian bull calves born before June 1, 2004, ranged €180-€305/head, with the later-born calves selling at €75-€175/head. Early-born Angus and Hereford bull calves made €200-€350/head, while the later born sold at €125-€225/head. In the continentals, the pre-June 1 born calves made €290-€380, with the post- June 1 born calves selling at €150-€250/head.
At Skibbereen Mart the May-born Friesian bull calves made €150-€225 with June-born calves selling at €85-€125/head. Early-born Hereford bulls fetched €220-€325 with the later-born selling at €145-€200/head.
At Kilmallock Mart there was a gap of €100-€125 between the pre-June born and the post-June 1- born bull calves.
At Kanturk Mart Friesian bulls were €130-€380/ head. Hereford bulls sold at €200-€515 and Continental bulls made €300-€500/head. The loss of the 9-month Special Beef Premium is €150/ head with extensification, if applicable, worth a further €80/head."

Producers were paid an average of 270.4 cents/kg (96.6p/lb) inclusive of VAT for R3 bullocks and heifers, compared to 242 cents/kg (86.5p/lb) for the same period in 2003.
During the period January to June 2004 the Irish bullock prices reached 97% of the EU average for R3 male cattle prices - the highest ever - compared to 86% over the same period last year.
Cull cow prices reached a new record following an increase of 22% in the average for O3 grade cows to 214 cents/kg (76.4p/lb) inclusive of VAT after the absence of intervention beef supplies across the EU combined with lower cow supplies led to a solid manufacturing demand for cow beef over the period.
Overall cattle supplies to the export plants were down 7%, with bullock supplies 12% lower and supplies of heifers were 9% lower. Bord Bia points out that the drop in both bullocks and heifers reflected the strong live trade in 2002, younger marketing of cattle in 2003 and less pressure on producers to sell.
Supplies of young bulls were 84% higher for the first half of the year due to increased producer interest in young bull beef and the fall off in live cattle exports to the Lebanon.
Throughput of cows was down by 8%.
The figures confirm a gradual continued decline in supplies with total throughput from January to June 2004 at 754,000 head compared to 975,000 head during the first six months of 1999."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10060282.html,2004-07-29 01:00:00,Poorer grades hit by lower prices,"The poorer quality, O3 grade bullocks, dropped to an average of less than 94p/lb, according to the farmer paysheet returns for the week, while the average price paid by the processors for O3 grade heifers fell to 93p/lb.
A widening of the margin between prices paid for R and O grade cattle has added to the sharper fall in prices for poorer quality carcasses.
Producers took 1p/lb less for R grade cattle last week as the downward slide continued at double the rate at which it increased earlier.
The gain over more than three months has now been wiped off beef prices, with the average paid for R3 bullocks and heifers last week equivalent to that of the week beginning April 19 last.
Carrigans of Donegal were the only factory paying an average of more than 100p/lb for R3 bullocks last week. At 102p/lb they were clear leaders over Duffys of Gort at 99.6p/lb and AIBP at Clones paying an average of 99p/lb. Kildare Chilling, Dawn Meats at Waterford, Excel Meats at Kilbeggan and Bergins Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare, average 98p/lb or fractionally higher, against an overall average of 97.5p/lb for all factories, 1p/lb lower than the previous week. The average paid for O3 bullocks at a shade under 94p/lb was 2p/lb down.
Two factories continued to pay average over 100p/lb for R3 heifers, Kepak at Clonee paying an average of 102.8p/lb and Carrigans averaging 100.8p/lb. A further seven factories paid 98p/lb or better. The overall average was a shade under 98p/lb. The national average for 03 heifers was 93p/lb.
Cow prices have dropped by up to 9p/lb. Liffey Meats paid the highest average at 81.7p/lb for R4H."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10102150.html,2004-08-05 01:00:00,New graders least of sellers’ worries,"Early on Tuesday, most farmers were reasonably happy with the grading results, as factory personnel moved in to take over the job previously done by Department of Agriculture Classification Officers, who are now only monitoring the operation.
Farmers were more worried by the further reduction in quoted prices this week, amounting to at least 1p/lb less for beef and in some cases up to 2p/lb being pared off last week’s prices, which the factories now find easier to get away with the supply of cattle having increased.
Up to 100p/lb was still on offer for U grade stock in the midland and northern regions of the country, while prices slipped to 98p/lb in the south and the east. Quotes for R grade animals are mostly 95p/lb with a minority of processors pulling back to 94p/lb and, in general, 90p/lb offered for O grade.
Due to the holiday week-end, official figures for last week’s kill at the factories was not available as we went to press, but all of the reports from the industry indicated that supplies are continuing to increase, and factories are unlikely to have any worries in that regard for the balance of the year.
The kill for the final four months of the year is expected to be strong, driven by the last chance to get the €80 per head slaughter premium, before it is phased out on December 31 to make way for the single payment regime.
A further widening of the price difference between grades is now emerging, and could prove costly in reduced returns, for cattle farmers in the south in particular. The price gap between R and O grade animals has increased to 5p/lb and, given the supply pattern of a high percentage of O grade animals being produced from mainly dairy herds in the south, farmers there could be hit hard if it is persisted with.
All factories have increased the price gap to 4p/lb between R and O grades this week, and some have widened it to 5p/lb, and the gap between U and P grades ranges from 100p/lb to 85p/lb."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10086206.html,2004-08-06 01:00:00,Prices hold firm for quality animals,"There is now a clear difference of €80-€150/head between the prices being paid for pre-June 1 born bull calves and those born after June 1 which have no premia entitlement, as the countdown to the changeover to the single payment on January 1 gets underway.
Farmers buying stores which will not finish until 2005 are beginning to show more consciousness of the increased emphasis which will be placed on quality for returns, rather than based on premia entitlements as heretofore.
The result is showing in a widening of the price range for stores as prices hold firm for the quality animals and finishers commence to do their calculations and discount the poorer quality animals unlikely to make a U grade or good R grade in the factories next year.
The effect is shown in the early weanling sales for animals which at most carry one premia and will sell on a market where quality will dictate the return to a greater extent than for more than a decade.
Athenry Mart manager Martin McNamara said: “a big difference is appearing between the quality lots and the poor quality stock.” There was a smaller entry at Athenry Mart yesterday, with the tops of the continental bulls making up to €440 over €/kg while poorer quality sold back to €175 over. A Friesian bull weighing 330 kgs selling at €475 and a Charolais bull scaling 330 kgs making €770 shows a €300/head difference in favour of quality and the poor prices which are beginning to emerge for the poorer grading Friesian."

The show cost over €400,000 to stage, had a record 8,000 plus entries, a 3% increase on last year, and a prize fund of €138,000 for 900 classes and 40 national titles.
Cattle entries alone exceeded 1,500 and there were 1,000 horses in showing and jumping.
The 300 trade stands had €30 million of exhibits ranging from heavy machinery to agri-products, crafts and wholesome food.
Some of the finest beef and dairy animals in Ireland were on view at the event which combined Tullamore Show and the AIB national livestock show.
The show was meticulously organised by an executive committee of thirty-five people headed by Michael Fox, Freda Kinnarney, secretary and Christy Maye, PRO.
Sean MacConnell, the Irish Times agriculture correspondent, who officially opened the showpiece, said the voluntary effort involved was enormous.
Michael Dowling, Head of Agri-business strategy with AIB, said the bank is confident about the future of agriculture and the rural economy.
Farm leaders used the show to speak about the issues of the day with John Dillon (IFA) warning meat factories to stop “the downward charge” on cattle prices and Malcolm Thompson (ICSA) suggesting that farmers and consumers alike would benefit from Ireland becoming a GM free island.
Politicians mingling with the crowds included Minister of State Tom Parlon, new MEP Mairead McGuinness and Olywn Enright.
Meanwhile, the Dublin Horse Show ended on a high note at the RDS last evening after a five day feast of superb jumping, the showing of some quality young horses, large crowds and brisk business for the 300 trade exhibitors.
Ireland’s victory in the Samsung Super League Nations Cup (Aga Khan Trophy) was the highlight of a marvellous first show for new RDS chief executive Michael Duffy, who was clearly delighted with the outcome.
A spokesman for the RDS said the attendances over the five days of the event were very satisfactory.
Some sales of horses and ponies were also reported to have been negotiated at the show, which had 1,400 entries competing for €510,000 in prizemoney and 90 cups."

Mr MacManus, who runs the high-profile King Sitric specialist fish restaurant in Howth, Co Dublin, said: ""There are hundreds of thousands of people eating out every day here in Ireland but all we hear about is the very small minority who have had a recent bad experience.
""Nobody seems willing to stand up and defend the vast majority who have enjoyed their night out or their simple lunch.""
He warned headlines such as ""rip-off Ireland"" may highlight some unscrupulous players in the market but appear to paint all restaurants in the same light. He said such publicity could prove damaging to tourism by putting visitors off from travelling here.
Over 300 restaurants are to now take part in a nationwide ""value menu"" scheme, launched yesterday by Tourism Minister John O'Donoghue.
Now in its second year, the guide features restaurants offering lunch and dinner menus in three price ranges up to €15, €25 and €35.
Six major wine distributors have agreed to reduce their trade price across a range of wines to allow the restaurants and hotels in the scheme to pass the saving directly to the customer.
The participating establishments will offer their value wines in three price ranges up to €15, €20 and €25.
""There has been much debate in recent times about prices and value for money at all levels throughout Ireland, including the hospitality industry,"" said Mr O'Donoghue. ""Some of the criticism is justified but much of it is not. We've heard a lot too about international price comparisons with the cost of eating out in Ireland. Some of these comparisons are fair but many are unfair.
""Ireland is not a cheap holiday destination or indeed a cheap location to do business. But when we get it right, Ireland can and does offer value for money and that is what today is really about.""
The minister said the value menu was targeting not only visitors from overseas but also domestic customers.
Irish Hotels Federation president Richard Bourke insisted Irish hospitality was a match for anyone in terms of quality and value for money. But it was disappointing that unfair price comparisons were made between Ireland and other holiday destinations.
The minimum wage here was three times higher than in Spain, where you can buy beef 30% cheaper. Spain has no excise duty while our VAT rates were among the highest in the EU.

It is hard to be sure where the boost to the trade is coming from, because the steadier trade for beef is not a guarantee of prices beyond the end of the month holding up at present levels, unless cattle are in short supply, and all the money appears to be on a heavy kill for the remainder of the year as producers avail of every last euro from the premia before December 31.
Nevertheless, the word from the marts yesterday had a common ring of “excellent trade” and “improved prices,” with gains of up to €40/head from last week showing in the sales rings.
The forward single punched bullocks sold for up to €465 over €/kg at Athenry Mart yesterday, where two 560kg Charolais were knocked down for €1,025, a Limousin weighing 540kgs made €1,000 and a 665kg Charolais sold for €1,080. Up to €355 over €/kg was paid for punched out heavy bullocks at the sale with a 625kg Limousin making €980 and a 565kg Charolais selling for €890, while in the lighter weights a 350kg Limousin, double punched, sold for €660.
The bullock trade was just as strong at Fermoy Mart yesterday, where €400 over €/kg was paid for forward single punched bullocks.
The punched out bullocks sold for up to €230 over.
Up to €240 over was paid for butchers heifers and stores sold at €120-€180 over.
Up to €415 over €/kg was paid for 400-500kg single punched bullocks at Kilmallock Mart, where bullock prices were up €30/head, and the heavy double punched bullocks made up to €360 over. Heavy heifers made €120-€230 over and stores up to €220 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10124192.html,2004-08-12 01:00:00,Second jobs for farmers shows the perilous state of agriculture,"It’s an indictment of the erosion of viability in the industry which not many years ago was the backbone of the economy of this country.
Farming continues to be a major export earner for the state, a vital production sector keeping tens of thousands employed in processing, marketing, manufacture and the supply of farm inputs, and services. But four out of every five farm families no longer depend on it solely for their livelihood.
Their income, from sources outside of farming, has been masking the erosion of farm incomes, over the past decade in particular.
Income from off the farms has offset the two way trend of rising production costs and falling farm product prices.
Even milk production, which continues to be the brightest spark in farming, must now get by on a milk price less than that of 10 years ago. Farmers in other enterprises are faring even worse.
The independent state advisory service’s income figures from their Farm Management Survey also show that direct EU payments now represent 121% of income on sheep farms and 178% of income on beef farms. Amazingly, for the ‘average’ farm, production costs must be about 50% higher than sales in cattle farming and about 25% higher than sales on sheep farms.
Only a small percentage of full-time farmers seem to earn a reasonable income. They are almost entirely dairy farmers.
Though 80% of farmers continue to be primarily identified as farmers, they no longer depend on it exclusively for their livelihood.
Yet there are those who say that farming is a viable industry and they fail to understand why most young people reared on the land are turning their back to it. It is time for a wake-up call to the realities within farming."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10046849.html,2004-08-12 01:00:00,National Show of excellence points way,"Excellence was what the show was all about, said Michael Dowling, head of agri-strategy with AIB, the show's title sponsor.
""As a showcase for product, it has a greater role to play than ever in finding the way forward for Irish livestock farming"", he said.
The country's top breeders put on an impressive display of beef cattle, but farmers' representatives at the show warned that beef farming is under threat. IFA president John Dillon said the new reality of decoupling is that farmers will cut back their herds unless beef processors pay a viable price. He urged farmers to be very strong in cattle price dealings with factories. Demand full value, be very clear on the price agreed, and always insist on payment on the day, he advised.
Sean MacConnell, Irish Times agriculture correspondent, officially opened the show, which attracted more than 8,000 entries for 900 classes, and cost over e400,000 to stage. A total of 1,500 cattle and over 1,000 horses entries were received.
An estimated 35,000 people supported the event. For the organisers, headed by Michael Fox, chairman, the wet weather was a disappointment, but they welcomed a clearance after Fr Seamus Donegan and Rev Leslie Crampton prayed during the official opening ceremony at noon for better weather.
The organisers admitted that they had tempted fate by including a wellie throwing competition for the first time.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10046849.html,2004-08-12 01:00:00,National Show of excellence points way,"Excellence was what the show was all about, said Michael Dowling, head of agri-strategy with AIB, the show's title sponsor.
""As a showcase for product, it has a greater role to play than ever in finding the way forward for Irish livestock farming"", he said.
The country's top breeders put on an impressive display of beef cattle, but farmers' representatives at the show warned that beef farming is under threat. IFA president John Dillon said the new reality of decoupling is that farmers will cut back their herds unless beef processors pay a viable price. He urged farmers to be very strong in cattle price dealings with factories. Demand full value, be very clear on the price agreed, and always insist on payment on the day, he advised.
Sean MacConnell, Irish Times agriculture correspondent, officially opened the show, which attracted more than 8,000 entries for 900 classes, and cost over e400,000 to stage. A total of 1,500 cattle and over 1,000 horses entries were received.
An estimated 35,000 people supported the event. For the organisers, headed by Michael Fox, chairman, the wet weather was a disappointment, but they welcomed a clearance after Fr Seamus Donegan and Rev Leslie Crampton prayed during the official opening ceremony at noon for better weather.
The organisers admitted that they had tempted fate by including a wellie throwing competition for the first time.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10124915.html,2004-08-13 01:00:00,Farmers adjust weanling prices,"For the first time in the weanling trade, some of the male animals being offered at this year’s sales will carry no entitlement to Special Beef Premia, and all other male weanlings will be curtailed to about 50% of previous years’ entitlements, and any weanling, male or female which will not be slaughtered before the end of December will forgo the Slaughter Premia.
The first indications of the adjustments which producers are making for the loss of up to €540 in premia and extensification entitlements in the life of male animals emerged at marts this week, but it will be at least another month before the market settles to provide a clearer picture of the losses weanling producers are facing.
There was a larger offering of weanlings at Ennis Mart this week where 500 head were on offer and prices were being adjusted according to the status of the animals.
Good Continental breed bulls, with entitlement to the 9 month premia before the end of the year ranged from €320 over €/kg to €360 over. Continental bulls - with the first premia drawn and no further entitlement to premia - sold from €200 over €/kg to €280 over. A lot of two punched out Belgian Blue’s 310 kgs sold for €572, a Charolais 320 kgs made €550 and a lot of three Charolais 414 kgs sold for €702.
There was very little change in weanling heifer prices from last year - heifers are losing a lifetime entitlement of €80/head in Slaughter Premia - with prices ranging €180 over €/kg to €200 over, but this could not be taken as setting the autumn trade as a number of shippers were competing with farmers at the sale."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10078841.html,2004-08-19 01:00:00,Looks like 90 to 94p base for August,"Processors generally had either settled on, or were edging towards paying 263 and back to 252 cents/kg (94p to 90p/lb) for R and O grades, likely to hold at least until the end of August.
The factories which paid at that level last week are unchanged this week, and a few others have slipped back to this level, by losing 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) off last week’s quotes, as 94p to 90p/lb becomes established as the price plateau for the moment.
There is a possibility that some factories may shave a further 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) off the price for R grade animals in the meantime, narrowing the price margin between R and O grades to 9 cents/kg (3p/lb). But the breaching of 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) for O grade animals is unlikely to happen before September.
Rumblings by farming leaders over the sharp decline in prices of the past month, and the comparison of returns to cattle farmers versus those in the UK, helped to make the processors a bit more cautious about inflicting further price cuts too quickly.
The benchmark of 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) for O grade animals is a bit like the highest jump on the course; they are all a bit nervous of breaching it, and being penalised for upsetting the boat. The factories are not looking forward to any disruption to the trade right now, because they need a steady supply of cattle. A supply famine now and a glut later in the year is not the ideal recipe for in handling the kill. Neither do farmers want disruption to the trade at this time of the year, so each side is maintaining a healthy respect for the other and they are all playing ball, at least until the end of the month.
There is up to 274 cents/kg (98p/lb) to be got this week for U grade animals, but these prices are slipping and some are back to 269 cents/kg (96p/lb).
Overall supplies are continuing very strong in the south, but they have settled into a steady flow in the rest of the country.
The cull cow trade has steadied, with prices being maintained at 202 to 190 cents/kg (72 to 68p/lb), with supplies having gone ahead of the corresponding weeks in 2003, at over 6,000/head per week now going through the factories. The cow kill for the year remains 7% down on the same period last year."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10064389.html,2004-08-20 01:00:00,Farm leader’s warning to factories,"Amid producer fears of more cuts in factory prices, IFA Munster Vice-President Donal Kelly has threatened ’strong action’ by farmers against the first factory to bring the price under 90p/lb, “because it will not be accepted by producers who have already suffered from severe cuts in price”.
He said there was no justification to lower prices and any attempt to do so would see farmers protesting to protect incomes, “with over €70/ head being wiped off cattle prices over the past month” and returns to producers trailing prices in the North and Britain for similar type cattle.
He said the factories had not explained a difference of 15p/lb in the price paid for similar grade cattle by processors in this country and the price received by producers in Britain, where most Irish beef is sold.
“Farmers’ incomes are being wiped out because of the cuts in prices at the factories. Farmers will act against the first factory that brings the price for O grade cattle under 90p/lb. That is the lowest farmers can take, a lot less than their counterparts in Britain receive,” he said.
Mr Kelly said prices being paid for cull cows have been reduced by up to 17p/lb in the last month and factories are making a killing with the low prices.
The price drop represented up to €150/head in cow prices.
There is concern among beef producers that factory prices will be cut again soon as supply to factories increases to autumn peak levels."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10050933.html,2004-08-24 01:00:00,Farmers to protest outside factory,"Farmers will protest outside the Kepak factory at Athleague, Co Roscommon, this afternoon in what could be the first shot in a bitter autumn battle by producers against the processors, claiming that any further lowering of prices is unjustified.
Several factories did not quote for cattle yesterday as they tested the temperament of producers for acceptance of a further lowering of prices.
Dawn Meats at Midleton quoted prices unchanged from last week at 94p-90p/lb for R/O grades for yesterday’s kill without commitment to maintain the price through the week.

Several factories did not quote for cattle yesterday as they tested the temperament of producers for acceptance of a further lowering of prices.
Dawn Meats at Midleton quoted prices unchanged from last week at 94p-90p/lb for R/O grades for yesterday’s kill without commitment to maintain the price through the week. Exel Meats at Kilbeggan and sister factory Newgrange Meats, at Navan quoted 93p-90p/lb for R/O grades with up to 96p/lb for Us.

Brian McMahon, Cooraclare, Co Clare, showed the champion of the show, and the 210 kg Belgian Blue heifer sold for €930 with Belgian Blue heifers dominating the top of the trade. A lot of two Belgian Blue heifers weighing 325kgs sold for €875, while the general run of heifer prices ranged €200 to €250 over for the top with plainer and lighter heifers selling from €140 over €/kg to €180 over.
The improved breeding in the suckler herds was reflected in the excellent quality of the weanlings on offer at the show and sale, which was described as “excellent.” There was a big number of heavy weanling bulls on offer with bulls in the range 380kgs to 500kgs, which met with a brisk trade at up to €500 over €/kg. The tops of the medium and lightweights made €380 over to €450 over with some average lots back to €330 to €350 over.
At the sales of adult cattle, heifers were an excellent trade at Fermoy, while the trade for bullocks was steady. Punched out bullocks sold for up to €275 over €/kg, forward stores making €200-€340 over and bulls with clean ears selling for up to €400 over. The strong trade for butchers heifers pushed prices up to €350 over €/kg - Charolais heifer weighing 505kgs selling for €855 - with more general prices ranging from €200 to €280 over.
At Kanturk Mart the forward single punched sold for up to €350 over with lighter weights making up to €310 over. Bullocks with clean ears made up to €420 over. Beef heifers made up to €265 over."

“However, there is an active campaign against calf and weanling producers by certain parts of other organisations who claim to represent these farmers. It is with reluctance that I highlight this fact”. He said ICMSA is not prepared to see a large transfer of income from calf and weanling farmers to other farmers.
“I believe also that the reluctance to deal with this problem may be the growing anti-dairy farmer view in other organisations”.
ICMSA predicted that calf prices will fall by up to €150 per head, with the Fischler CAP reform and decoupling, and weanling prices will be reduced by at least €200 per head. This was borne out already this year, with June-born calves becoming the first in 12 years which will not qualify for any beef premium, and farmers have seen their prices fall by as much as €175, compared to calves born in May.
As a result, bull calf prices now are between €80 and €200 behind 2003. “The Department can no longer ignore this major problem”, said Mr O’Rourke.
“EU Council regulations provide a broad legal framework for Ireland to implement ICMSA’s proposals to address the shortfall suffered by calf and weanling producers”, said the ICMSA president earlier this year after he led a delegation to meet officials of the European Commission.
“Ireland does not even have to seek the permission of the Commission in this regard.”"

The rest of the industry waited and watched over the four days of the protest, and with the ‘dogs in the street’ knowing that the factories were anxious to drop the O grade price under 90p/lb, must have greeted the outcome with disappointment. It would be foolhardy confidence for the producers to think, even for a moment, that the price issue has been resolved, and the unusually quiet tone of the industry this week, is merely a time for stopping and pondering on the next move.
It would be a risky bet to wager that the farmers will not be back on the protest line before the season is through. Cattle supplies have increased considerably over the past few weeks with throughput now topping 35,000 head per week of which steers account for over 20,000 head, which is broadly similar to the same time last year.
The factories were displaying less interest in the larger supplies this week, while the throughput of cattle continued strong. While it is difficult to gauge accurately what is being paid, in the silence of the factories, the feeling is that 263/260 cents/kg (94p-93p/lb) for R grade animals and 252 cents/kg (90plb) for O grade cattle with around 265 cents/kg (95p/lb) being paid for U grade animals.
The factories are conscious that the pay sheet returns to farmers for this week are going to be monitored closely and the urge to drop prices is being measured by each of the factories against the risk of their premises being the next target of a lightening protest which could disrupt operations - something they don’t want.
Either way there are interesting times ahead guaranteed, with the normal seasonal high throughput of cattle likely to be boosted this autumn by the incentive to producers to sell before the end of the year to secure the €80/head slaughter premia, which is till on target to end on December 31 making way for the change over the single payment which becomes effective the following day."

The decision, which will allow EU exports to Russia of live animals and animal products to continue from October 1 without disruption, was welcomed yesterday by Meat Industry Ireland (MII) and the Irish Farmers Association (IFA). MII spokesman Cormac Healy said the loss or even disruption to trade with the Russian market would have been a catastrophe for the beef sector.
Russia remains the only international market for Irish beef outside the EU. But prices there have fallen by as much as $400 per tonne due to increased volumes of South American beef entering the market.
Mr Healy cautioned that the fall in the Russian market price, coupled with the weakening returns for steak cuts in the EU market, have reduced the overall value of the carcase in recent weeks.
IFA livestock chairman John Bryan said the announcement was an important breakthrough for the beef sector. Ireland exported about 80,000 tonnes of beef to Russia last year. Russia, which blocked all meat exports on June 1 but later lifted this ban until October 1 to allow discussions to take place, will now implement a set of uniform veterinary certificates.
These will be annually reviewed taking into account the development of the animal disease situation in the EU and new scientific data. In addition, Russia has accepted the principle of “regionalisation,” so that an animal disease outbreak in a part of a member state will not block exports from the whole of that country nor from the rest of the EU.
EU Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner David Byrne said the way is now clear for uninterrupted trade in legitimate and safe food products from the EU to Russia."

These were the first in a series of meetings with the main British supermarkets as part of its long-term beef strategy.
ICSA said it told the British supermarket meat bosses that the whole production environment for beef production will change dramatically post-decoupling.
Farmers will only produce for a profit. The retailers will need to pay a higher price in order to secure supplies.
Ray Dunne, ICSA policy officer, said the meetings were very worthwhile.
“ICSA pointed out that Irish farmers are not making profits at the current price. While R grade steers are making €2.95/kg in Britain, the same animals in Ireland are making €2.63/kg.
“This is despite the fact that we were informed that Irish and British beef is retailing at the same price in British supermarkets. ICSA wants to see the gap narrowing between Irish and British farmer prices.”
The ICSA said that Tesco senior meat buying manager Alex Brown explained that Tesco beef sales are currently growing 20% year on year.
Irish beef continues to be popular alongside British meat and customers continue to buy it in significant volumes.
But Mr Dunne said the fact that only 20% of Irish meat exported to Britain is sold through supermarkets means that there is an opportunity to add value to the other 40%."

This is the single biggest reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) since the MacSharry reforms in the 1980s.
Long term, the pessimistic view is that Franz Fischler has written a retirement package for Europe’s farmers who will be out-produced in many areas of agriculture by the rest of the world where market forces will dictate price.
A statement from the Department of Agriculture and Food said more than 122,000 farmers would get notification this week of payment which would total 1.322 billion each year.
On average, Irish farmers will be paid 10,000 each, based on what they were paid in 2000, 2001 and 2002 by the EU. The first of the Single Payments will be made in December next year.
However the average payment is no real measure of who wins and loses.
It has been speculated that beef baron Larry Goodman will be a huge beneficiary as will Dawn Meats, both being major producers of beef cattle in their own right.
Up to 30,000 farmers have not been sent the department’s letter. Some are tied up in appeals about their payments over the previous three years, while others are new entrants to farming or have inherited farms.
A low-cost telephone help line has been set up to answer farmers’ queries.
The Department of Agriculture and Food will also have information booths at its stand at the National Ploughing Championships at the end of the month near Tullow in Co Carlow.
For farmers, the single payment system is radical in a number of ways.
In the past many were forced to produce simply to reap the benefits of the various schemes meaning Europe was continuing to produce more than was required.
The Single Payment system is designed to get rid of the bureaucracy and to gear production to the market.
The latter aim is the most radical in its implications and could reduce the number of full time farmers dramatically. Whatever the final outcome, this move by Fischler and the EU is set to forge even greater change across the whole of European agriculture.
As it stands, up to 60% of all farmers are classified as part time.
Viewed in a positive way, the shift in emphasis means producers can now gear their production to meet the markets and not the EU.
For many with no one to inherit the farm it will allow them to scale down their involvement and live without too much effort into their old age.
However the shift to market driven demand opens up the prospect of ranch farming where the declining interest in agriculture will allow big production units to emerge as the most progressive farmers snap up land that becomes available over time.
A word of warning however: This single payment system is set to run until 2013.
Now that the EU has expanded to 25 member states added costs have come into play, putting greater funding pressures on the entire system. With the German economy under pressure and the additional funding burden it is far from certain the Germans, in particular, will agree to fund it for the full term.
Ireland was in a minority in opting for the full decoupling option. It protects farmers from changes that will undoubtedly be forced on the EU as the world moves to freer less subsidised markets. Also, this payment is not indexed linked so that by the end of the eight year period its value to recipients could be significantly eroded.
Depending on circumstances this shift paves the way for a totally market focused system of agriculture."

The Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association says beef processors are currently deliberately backing up intake of cattle which they know will go over 30 months of age in the next few weeks.
This worked well for them in September and October of 2003, when prices weakened due to 33% of the total steer kill being over 30 months of age (43% of all cattle reach 30 months of age in these months).
ICSA wants farmers to respond by holding back cattle over 30 months of age, to create a scarcity.
ICSA also alleges that beef processors are not reflecting the superior value of R grade cattle over O grade in their prices.
The gap should be at least 8p/lb, says ICSA; in France, it is 14p/lb.
Meanwhile, IFA says that Superquinn’s “reckless move” to sell vegetables below the cost of production will lead to large scale instability and losses for 200 vegetable producers, and could lead to a price war that could bankrupt farmers.
Dairy farmers said recently that co-ops should not base their milk price decisions solely on the Irish Dairy Board Skim Milk Powder and butter index.
Far from being an accurate market guide, it is about 0.5 cent per litre (in terms of milk price) behind the full Irish dairy product mix, according to IFA.
It’s bad enough that Irish farmers depend on unreliable markets like Russia, threatening to close its €1.3 billion per year meat trade with the EU at the end of this month, unless it reaches a food safety certification agreement with Brussels.

He said an increase in producer prices will best be achieved through expanding partnerships between farmers and meat processors. These partnerships would lead to more market-oriented production and improved marketing efficiency.
Mr Smyth told the national open day at the Teagasc Beef Research Centre at Grange, Co Meath, yesterday, that farmers who cannot generate a worthwhile margin, excluding the new single farm payment, will find the payment being used to cover production costs and will have no future in beef farming.
“While the single farm payment will be a vital component of farm income, particularly in the medium term, its value will be eroded over time and beef farming must stand on its own feet if farmers are to make a viable income,” he said.
He said almost half of beef monitor farms, which are used to promote new technology, achieved margins of over €600 per hectare in 2003.
“Only a minority of these farmers are making a profit level over and above their total receipts from the various EU premia. Increasing the number of farmers making a real profit from beef is the major challenge facing all sectors of the industry,” he said."

Producers cannot recall when - if ever - the margin between prime beef and cull cow beef narrowed to 7p-10p/lb as beef producers’ anger increases following an accelerated drop in bullock and heifer prices of more than 1p/lb for last week’s kill.

IFA deputy president Ruaidhri Deasy said there is anger among cattle farmers at the way the meat factories have cut cattle prices.
“Farmers have decided to take action and next Monday will be a full day of protest on cattle prices at every meat plant in the country,” he said.
Mr Deasy said the factories have pulled cattle prices by a massive 34c/kg (12p/lb) or €112 per head since July. With decoupling, farmers are not prepared to allow the factories take their premium payments.
IFA Livestock Committee chairman John Bryan said the latest price cuts are a clear move to widen their margin. Cattle prices in the British market, which will take up to 250,000t of Irish beef this year, are strong.
There was a strong call at the Abbeyleix meeting that farmers should not be selling under-finished cattle to factories, considering the strong trade in the marts.
However, Cormac Healy, of Meat Industry Ireland, representing processors, said it is essential every effort is made to ensure the orderly marketing of finished cattle. The sharp rise in finished cattle numbers coincides with a period of unexpectedly poor demand for beef.
“While the short-term prognosis is for a continued difficult market environment, the outlook for next spring is more encouraging,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10072042.html,2004-09-23 01:00:00,Moving cattle the priority this week,"Heavy rainfall had reduced grass quality, and pushed farmers to lighten stock levels on the land.
This has taken precedent over price through the early days of this week, with very little, if any, resistance to a further cut of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) in beef cattle prices this week.
Factories reported that their requirements for the week were booked-in early on Monday.
Some farmers were looking to book in their cattle as far forward as the early days of October.
Not surprisingly, factory procurement staff were describing as “crazy” the near frenzy by farmers to sell, regardless of price, as three factors - weather and ground conditions, falling prices and cattle going over 30 months - combined to create a “must sell” approach by farmers.
Needless to say, the factories were keeping their silence on quoting for cattle.
“There is no point in quoting, because we are full for the week”, said one spokesperson.
On the ground, the word was that most of the cattle were being bought at 255 and back to 243 cents/kg (91p-87p/lb) for R and O grades under 30 months which, on average, is 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) behind last week’s prices, and well under the target base price of 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) set by farmers during their protest in Athleague last month.
At this week’s meetings of beef producers (including tonight’s Auburn Lodge Hotel, Ennis meeting), IFA members will be calling on their leaders intervene in the free-fall of cattle prices, as export factory intake approaches the seasonal peak.
There has been a slight easing of factory prices for cull cows this week, with from 190 to 202 cents/kg (72p-68p/lb) believed to be on offer, revealing a remarkably narrow margin between cow beef and prime steer beef prices."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10124283.html,2004-09-23 01:00:00,New production era set to ring the changes,"The ending of the production-linked EU support scheme for farming will bring about one of the biggest changes for farming and agri-business in the history of this country.
A new era of production solely reliant for profit on the return from the market place will dawn on January 1, 2005. Already there has been a price drop for male calves born after May 31 last, the first male animals for nearly a decade and a half without EU support linked to them.
The price adjustment for older livestock has yet to kick into place.
But come it will, when the reality of the purchase price being a major factor in profit sinks in. It will probably take at least a year for the full impact to be felt.
The predicted drop of 15 to 20% in livestock numbers will have an impact beyond the farm.
A drop of up to 4,000 head of cattle for slaughter per week on average over the year, and fewer animals going through mart sales, will have economic implications for the operation of marts and factories.
Livestock haulage contractors, suppliers of animal treatments and remedies, veterinary practices and all associated input suppliers will see a proportionate drop in turnover. Animal feed compounders will have fewer mouths to fill.
Cattle farmers are most likely to reduce fertiliser applications. There will be less silage needed, with a knock-on effect for silage contractors, oil companies, machinery suppliers, and the sale of silage additives and enhancers. Beef export volumes could drop, causing a knock-on effect on the balance of payments.
Add in the likely changes in production on sheep farms, and an expected drop in tillage, and the repercussions keep spreading out.
All farmers will try to select more accurately which enterprise and what scale of operation will provides a reasonable return for their labour. There will no longer be a compelling reason nor any incentive to engage in anything other than that which pays back a profit."

Producers cannot recall when - if ever - the margin between prime beef and cull cow beef narrowed to 7p-10p/lb as beef producers’ anger increases following an accelerated drop in bullock and heifer prices of more than 1p/lb for last week’s kill. The average paid by the Dawn Group and the Kepak Group was down 1.3p/lb on the previous week at 91.7p/lb and 91.8p/lb, respectively. Prices for the AIBP Group were 0.8p/lb lower at an average of 92.3p/lb.
One-third of the factories paid less than 92p/lb average for R3 grade bullocks. Carrigans of Donegal paid the highest price at an average of 95.4p/lb, with AIBP at Clones, Cahir and Nenagh, Kepak at Clonee, Exel Meats at Kilbeggan and Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff all paying average between 92.4p/lb and 92.7p/lb. The average for O3 bullocks fell under 88p/lb. Average heifer prices mirrored the bullocks with a national average of just over 92p/lb being paid for R3 animals, but a number of plants paid over 93p/lb, including Kepak, at Clonee, paying an average 98.3p/lb."

The livestock producers decided to take action at a meeting in Abbeyleix last week, after voicing anger at the way the meat factories had cut cattle prices.
However, Meat Industry Ireland (MII), representing the processors, said markets for Irish beef have weakened and this has resulted in a significant fall in the value of the carcass.
IFA deputy president
Ruaidhrí Deasy said the meat industry needs to abandon its cut price
strategy and realise that farmers cannot continue to produce beef at a loss under the new decoupling policy.
The severe price cuts of 115 per head by the factories in recent weeks had wiped out any possibility of profit from cattle farming this autumn.
It had seriously damaged relations between the beef factories and their farmer suppliers, he said.
IFA livestock committee chairman John Bryan said Irish beef is now being sold in European markets and Irish farmers are entitled to European prices. Ireland is now close to the bottom of the EU beef price league, he said.
MII spokesman Cormac Healy said the outlook for next spring is more encouraging. “The market is expected to be in better shape and this should reflect improved price levels. Against this background, the orderly marketing of cattle this autumn is clearly advisable.”
Mr Healy said increased offerings of lower priced South American beef on both the EU and Russian markets are among the key factors in the weakening returns.
Russia remains the only international market which is open and purchasing Irish beef.
Mr Healy said that since July returns from the marketplace for the overall carcase have fallen by 13%, on average, and continue to fall."

It is very important to keep in mind that the second SBP - at 21 months - cannot be applied for on any bullock born after April 30, 2003 before the end of the scheme. A clean ears bullock born from May 1, 2003 to May 30, 2004 is only eligible for one Beef Premia. If as in the case of most weanlings, he has not been castrated, it is more beneficial to apply for the bull premia which is worth €60/head more than the nine months SBP.
Male calves born from June 1, 2004 are not eligible for any premia payments. Prices for calves born since the cut-off date for the premia have shown a drop of €80-€150/head, with some continental calves showing a drop of up to €200/head.
In the marts demand has continued very strong this week for punched out bullocks, despite the lower prices being paid for beef in the factories. Double punched bullocks made up to €235 over €/kg at Fermoy Mart yesterday. They were a little easier, at up to €160 over being paid, at Kanturk Mart. Athenry Mart had the highest price of the day with €300 over for heavy continental punched out bullocks. This price was topped at Kilmallock on Monday where €330 over was paid for the tops of the bullocks without a premia, while Dungarvan recorded €230 over €/kg."

Now, strong cattle supplies are cutting the profit out of farmers’ pockets, as prices slump.
While farmers formed picket lines outside factories yet again this week, the Irish Cattle and Sheepfarmers Association was offering their ‘solution’, in the form of a Beef Strategy Board.
According to ICSA President Malcolm Thompson, the new board would involve all players in the production, processing and selling of beef, and would “review and revise strategy on an ongoing basis”, so as to “overcome the nonsense of regular and repeated beef crisis”.
Brilliant idea! Why did nobody ever think of it before? It would make life so much better for cattle farmers and, in Thompson’s words, enable them “to operate a modern business”, which is what beef farming should be all about in these time of cutting costs and increasing efficiency at every level.
What the ICSA leader is suggesting makes perfect sense. We need a properly structured industry for one of the country’s major indigenous exports.
However, if Malcolm had looked back on the history of beef farming and processing, he would realise how many times the same idea was proposed, discussed, partially agreed to in principle, but never came within a near miss of getting over the final hurdle of being implemented. He said it all, but those farmers with a lifetime of struggling in beef production were hearing nothing new when he summed up, “Current beef prices are deplorable and farmers need a long term strategy that will overcome the nonsense of regular and repeated beef crisis. Not enough is being done to ensure that we have adequate and suitable markets for beef.”
It is ridiculous that factories are unable to move beef, at a time when the supply is coming towards its peak. Bord Bia needs to re-examine its strategy, in conjunction with producers and processors, with an eye on the realities facing us in the new era of decoupling."

The top price for cows was 8p/lb under the national average paid for R3 heifers at 91p/lb.
For the same week in 2003 there was a difference of 17p/lb between the top price paid for R grade cows and the national average for R3 grade heifers - more than double the present margin - and while suppliers of cull cows are not going to complain about the higher price, finishers of beef heifers and bullocks are baffled as to why beef prices are being slashed.
There was a further drop of 1p/lb for bullocks and heifers last week, maintaining the consistent weekly downward slide.
The national average for R3 bullocks fell to 91p/lb. Carrigans paid the top price at an average of 94p/lb, well ahead of the next highest, AIBP at Nenagh, at 91.8p/lb, and a further 16 factories, paying between 91p/lb and 91.5p/lb.
The national average for O3 bullocks fell to 86.6p/lb with less than a third of the factories paying 87p/lb.
Heifer prices were marginally higher than the bullocks, with an average of 91.3p/lb for R3.
The highest average was 96p/lb at Kepak, Clonee, where the kill include premium price contract supplies which boosted the average.
Meadow Meats paid an average of 93p/lb.
Kepak at Clonee were also the best for O grade cows at 76p/lb for O4L."

The move is part of an overall restructuring by the company with services between England and France being the hardest hit.
P&O said it hopes to have the programme largely in place by the middle of next year, but the proposals are subject to consultation with employees.
Some 85% of the 47,922 head of live cattle exports to continental Europe so far this year were carried by P&O on the Rosslare-Cherbourgh route.
IFA Livestock Committee chairman John Bryan said it was essential that Irish livestock farmers continue to have ferry access to the EU single market.
The live export trade out of Ireland is extremely important in terms of price competition and market outlets for the €1.5 billion beef sector.
It is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government to guarantee ferry access to the EU single market for Irish livestock farmers and live cattle exports.
Mr Bryan said the live export trade involves the export of over 200,000 head of livestock to markets such as Spain, Italy, Holland and France. The live trade is highly regulated, with veterinary inspections and extremely high standards of animal welfare.
He said he was aware of a number of companies who were actively examining the purchase of the Rosslare-Cherbourgh route from P&O, all of whom had expressed a commitment to the live export trade.
ICMSA president Pat O’Rourke said the decision of P&O to exit the Rosslare service to continental Europe and to transfer the MV Diplomat to another route will once again totally disrupt live exports from Ireland to the continent. This issue reverts, once again, to the Government and must be the first item on the new minister’s priorities.
“I will be seeking an urgent meeting with the minister as it is vital that there is no break in the supply of cattle and that markets so hard won are kept for Irish cattle exporters,” he said.
Mr O’Rourke said the importance of the live trade cannot be overestimated and must be addressed once and for all by the Government.
“A reliable and comprehensive sea freight from Ireland to continental EU is a fundamental part of national infrastructure,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10113431.html,2004-09-30 01:00:00,Must avoid peak season stalemate,"There was no slaughtering on Monday, as angry farmers maintained a 24 hour protest at the country’s beef factories. While most of the factories resumed slaughtering on Tuesday, nearly all maintained their silence on quoting for cattle. Meanwhile, their agents were offering producers 1 or 2p per lb less than last week.
There were the first hints of a stand-off developing between producers and processors. Processors were indicating a lack of interest in cattle supplies for the week and some were putting out the word that they were reducing their killing days, while producers said it was not economic to supply cattle at the prices being offered.
Neither side can afford stalemate in the throughput of cattle at the peak of the season, but the differences over pricing have become bitter.
While factory agents offered farmers 252 and back to 241 cents/kg (90p-86p/lb) for R and O grade animals (some offered 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) less for R grade, some were 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) lower for O grade), Meat Industry Ireland, which represents most of the processors, defended the processors’ lower cattle prices.
Cormac Healy of MDI said that difficulties have arisen due to the sharp rise in cattle supplies, coinciding with unexpected poor demand for beef, with more low priced South American beef on both the EU and Russian markets also undermining the price.
The absence of traditional third country market outlets to absorb the extra cattle slaughterings and relieve pressure on the internal EU market was also having a major impact at this time of the year, with Russia the only international market which is open and purchasing beef.
Producers are however pointing out that a significant percentage of beef exports are now going into the UK, where the supermarket prices are strong.
They argue that processors have not provided a satisfactory explanation for the cattle price slump.
Although prices in Britain have also been falling in recent weeks, the price for R3 bullocks in Britain last week was the equivalent of 101.5p/lb, while Irish producers were being paid around 90p/lb, amounting to a difference of e110 per head, on average.
The one steady element in the cattle trade continues to be the demand and prices available for cull cows. They continue to sell for up to 207 cents/kg (74p/lb) at the top of the market, with supplies back around 12% from last year."

Bullock supplies were 16,790 head compared to 24,740 head the previous week. Lower throughput did not ease the pace of price reduction, which was maintained, with a further 1p/lb knocked off the average paid for R3 bullocks and heifers. The average paid by individual factories dropped by up to 2p/lb.
Overall factories paid an average of just under 90p/lb for R3 bullocks. Apart from Carrigans paying an average of 92p/lb and an average of 91p/lb at Kepak, at Watergrasshill, another 10 factories paid 90p/lb, and a further 10 paid between 89.5p/lb and 90p/lb.
The average for O3 bullocks was 85p/lb with a few factories paying over 86p/lb. Heifer prices were slightly stronger than the bullocks with a national average of 90.4p/lb for R3 grade.
There was a strong 96p/lb average paid at Kepak, at Clonee, but much of that would have gone on the premium for contract cattle, with AIBP at Bandon and Nenagh paying just over 92p/lb. There was an average of 85p/lb paid for O3 heifers - Kepak at Clonee paying the highest average at 90p/lb - with one factory paying an average of just over 80p/lb.
Prices for cull cows eased slightly. Ashbourne Meats, Roscrea paid an average of 81p/lb for R4H grade and Kepak, Clonee paid 77p/lb average for O4L and 75.6p/lb average for P+4L grade."

Prices in both countries have shown a similar downward trend for September, but British suppliers continued to receive 12p/lb more for cattle then their Irish counterparts in 2004, compared to a difference of 9p/lb between the price paid in both countries for September 2003.
Prices in both markets have been falling at a rate of around 1p/lb/week, but the reduction in the British price continues to come off a higher base. For the week ending September 27 2004, beef producers in Britain were paid 103p/lb for R3 bullocks compared to just over 91p/lb paid by Irish processors for the same grade animals.
The wider difference between Irish and British prices reduced during August, but has remained constant through September with the trend in both countries closely tracking each other.
With nearly half of Irish beef exports being sold into the British market - a high percentage going directly to the supermarket trade - producers are feeling the effect of the lower prices in Ireland and questioning the price advantage for Irish processors, which has increased by one-third compared to Autumn 2003."

Most of the processors maintained that they were “getting plenty of cattle” at the lower price of 87p-82p/lb for R/O grades, a drop of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) for underage cattle. More factories are penalising producers for cattle over 30 months with a cut of 3-9 cents/kg (1p-3p/lb).
There was an increase in enquiries to the factories yesterday after two weeks during which it appeared that the supply of young stock was easing back.
While producers were more vocal in their most stringent criticism of the processors for the further “unjustified cut” in prices, from reports around the country it appeared that more cattle are on the move this week.
The supply situation appeared to be uniformly strong across the country and yesterday evening some producers were being told by factories that they were booked up for the week and they would only talk prices to them when they can take the cattle.
Farmer anger was noticeably intensified with claims that the latest cut was the last straw. But the increase in supplies available left the factories in a strong position to impose the further cut.
As one large supplier put it “we have to take our beating from the factories now, because cattle have to be moved off the land, but the producers are being fleeced and the factories better recognise that their short-term exploitation is killing any incentive left for beef farmers and they will have their day post decoupling""."

That’s from our pages in the first week of January, 2004, when we reported Liam Dunne of Teagasc’s predictions.
The slump still came as a shock for the Irish Cattle and Sheepfarmers Association, which asked new Minister, Mary Coughlan, to convene an immediate beef crisis meeting, and called for a Beef Strategy Board.
It seems to have been less of a surprise for the IFA, but deputy president Ruaidhrí Deasy still said the price cuts wiped out any possibility of cattle farming profits this autumn, and seriously damaged relations between factories and farmers.
Anyone could have told them that the autumn price slump would be worse than ever this year, because of the ending of the slaughter premium.
Earlier in the year was when farmer organisations should have been talking and planning and advising how to get around an expected cattle supply bottleneck this autumn and winter.
Cattle farmers have walked right into this bottleneck, selling fewer cattle before September, and then sending enormous numbers of unfinished cattle to the factories in October.
As a result, the market for the final quarter is being flooded with about 30,000 more cattle for slaughter than last year.
Only very innocent farmer organisations would be surprised to see prices falling in that scenario.
ICOS is the only farmers group coming out with constructive advice to farmers on how to adjust their cattle sales, telling them there is no profit in aiming to collect a slaughter premium by sending unfinished cattle to the factory, when a combination of low factory prices and deductions and levies, will cost more than the value of that premium.
Meanwhile, there’s a scarcity of unfinished stock in their marts to satisfy very strong demand for forward stores for finishing with one premium left, and also for punched out cattle.
The co-op marts advise farmers to check their stocking densities carefully and sell on any animals with one premium left which they themselves may not be able to claim, to mart buyers with premium capacity left, who are prepared to bid strongly for them.
This would bring some kind of order to the way farmers sell cattle, and would serve them much better in the long run, than having to camp outside factory gates whenever prices fall.
Ultimately, all farmers can control is the cattle supply.
It’s no use for farmers to simply bluster that factories are abusing dominant positions by driving down prices without justification. Factories shout back that low priced South American beef has helped to drive down returns from the beef marketplace 13% since July.
What farmers should be listening to is market advice from experts like Liam Dunne.
He also pointed out more than nine months ago that culled suckler cows would hit the autumn 2004 market in increasing numbers, before their price falls when the Suckler Cow Premium disappears in the New Year.
Suckler farmers have to be ready for that, and may have to consider delaying the sale of such cows until the New Year (although the slaughter premium is worth five cent per kg more for cows than for steers).
They must also beware of autumn live export market turbulence, which Liam Dunne predicted, due to the different decoupling options chosen by the member states which buy live cattle from Ireland. For some member states, decoupling will make imported Irish cattle unattractive from New Year, 2005, and these final months of 2004 offer the last high-priced opportunity to export weanlings."

The co-op marts advise farmers to check their stocking densities carefully and sell on any animals with one premium left which they themselves may not be able to claim, to mart buyers with premium capacity left, who are prepared to bid strongly for them.
This would bring some kind of order to the way farmers sell cattle, and would serve them much better in the long run, than having to camp outside factory gates whenever prices fall.
Ultimately, all farmers can control is the cattle supply.
It’s no use for farmers to simply bluster that factories are abusing dominant positions by driving down prices without justification. Factories shout back that low priced South American beef has helped to drive down returns from the beef marketplace 13% since July.
What farmers should be listening to is market advice from experts like Liam Dunne.
He also pointed out more than nine months ago that culled suckler cows would hit the autumn 2004 market in increasing numbers, before their price falls when the Suckler Cow Premium disappears in the New Year.
Suckler farmers have to be ready for that, and may have to consider delaying the sale of such cows until the New Year (although the slaughter premium is worth five cent per kg more for cows than for steers).
They must also beware of autumn live export market turbulence, which Liam Dunne predicted, due to the different decoupling options chosen by the member states which buy live cattle from Ireland. For some member states, decoupling will make imported Irish cattle unattractive from New Year, 2005, and these final months of 2004 offer the last high-priced opportunity to export weanlings."

Weanling bulls being purchased are worth around €300/head less in premia entitlements than the same animal purchased in autumn 2003. The 2004 crop of weanling heifers will earn €80/head less in premia than those a year earlier.
Teagasc warned farmers at the recent National Ploughing Championships on the maximum economic price which could be paid for weanlings this year, to leave a margin with the projected price for beef in 2005.
Currently prices being paid for weanling bulls/ bullocks are significantly higher than the maximum suggested by Teagasc.
Farmers purchasing weanlings should be conscious of the major changes taking effect under the EU Single Payment from January 1 2005, when all headage based premia will cease.
Comparison of prices with 2003 show that weanling bulls ranged from €280 to €555 over €/kg at Ennis Mart, one of the largest centres for weanling sales, where almost 1,600 head were on offer. For the same week last year prices at the mart ranged from €320 to €450 over for weanling bulls.
At Dungarvan prices this week were similar to last year, ranging to €400 over for the bulls. At Kanturk Mart the bulls ranged €280 to €365 over compared to €320 to €390 over last year. At Kilmallock the weanling bulls ranged €295 to €410 over this week and the same week last year sold at €280-€440 over."

The conferences will advise farmers on maximising income from beef and will also feature expert information from Bord Bia and leading beef processors on market outlets and on short and medium-term prospects for Irish beef exports.
Bernard Smyth, chief drystock adviser with Teagasc, said beef farmers who apply the best production technology and deliver a product for the high-priced consumer markets can look forward to increased incomes after the implementation of the new EU policy.
Mr Smyth said 50% of Irish beef exports are now going to the British market with a further 30% going to continental EU markets.
“We must increase the proportion of beef being exported to the higher priced continental market if profitability at farm level is to improve. The views of Bord Bia and beef processors on how this can be achieved will be worth hearing,” he said.
The conferences will also look at the important production challenges facing beef producers over the coming winter, with guidelines from Teagasc specialists on profitable feeding strategies.
Each conference will start at 8pm except for the opening one on October 26 at the Court Hotel, Tullamore, which will begin at 8.30pm.
Dates and venues for the others are: October 27, Riverside Hotel, Enniscorthy and Teagasc Resource Centre, Athenry; October 28, Anner Hotel, Thurles; November 1, Ardboyne Hotel, Navan, November 2, Hibernian Hotel, Mallow and November 3, Holiday Inn, Letterkenny."

As regards beef, she said prices have been satisfactory in 2004 with R3 steer prices 11% higher compared with the same period last year.
Beef prices are currently showing the usual seasonal decline and the downward pressure on price is also in part due to poor returns from Russia, where prices have dropped significantly, and to a weakness in the British market.
In recent years, the focus has switched to the higher value EU market where returns are forecast to improve in the longer term as the effects of decoupling across the EU take effect.
Ms Coughlan said that given the growth in intra Community sales, Ireland is now well placed to consolidate its EU market position and to move further up the value chain. This is particularly so given the emergence of an EU market deficit in beef for the first time in 25 years.
“Russia remains the key third country market for Irish beef and I was pleased last week to announce the re-opening of the Algerian market, traditionally an important market for Irish beef. This will provide a welcome additional outlet for Irish beef, particularly in the autumn period”, she said."

It also informed the European Commission.
It is understood the probe is focusing on breaches involving the specification of beef from male animals as lower priced meat from cows. Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan, speaking with Irish agricultural journalists in Paris yesterday, said during the past number of years there had been a huge change in the attitude within the farming community and in the processing industry.
People could rest assured the department’s control mechanisms would be stringently enforced.
“For the better good of the economy and for the industry, we have to have a watertight situation,” she said. Ms Coughlan said the incident was very disappointing.
The department was quickly involved in the case and it’s before gardaí."

However, that will be based on the balance of supply and demand.
The trade for punched out bullocks was steady at Bandon Mart yesterday and improved at sales at Kilkenny, Blessington and Ennis Marts with up to €480 over €/kg being paid at Ennis for heavy quality continentals.
There were over 1,400 head on offer at Kilkenny Mart where the trade was strong for all quality bullocks and double punched bullocks showed an improvement of up to €15/head. Some of the top lots of punched out bullocks sold for up to €300 over €/kg.
Numbers on offer at Bandon were similar to last week with “plenty of demand” for double punched bullocks at prices up to €220 over €/kg. A lot of two Simmentals weighing 435kg sold for €655.
At Blessington Mart the punched out bullocks over 600kg sold for up to €270 over with a complete clearance of cattle on offer.
The highest prices of the day for the punched out bullocks was set at Ennis Mart, where an exceptional price of €480 over was paid for a Limousin scaling 742kg made €1,220 which will require a substantial increase in beef prices to pay his way through the factory system - unless the animal picks up a few Fat Stock Show prizes on the way. The choice ‘Limo’ was not the only one to make a strong price at the sale. A Limousin weighing 594kg sold for €1,050 and a Belgian Blue X weighing 702kg sold for €1,070."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10111633.html,2004-10-23 01:00:00,British beef and lamb sales rise,"The latest Taylor Nelson Sofres Superpanel data announced by Bord Bia show consumers spent 5% more on purchases of beef and 8% more on purchases of lamb in the year to the middle of September, during which they purchased slightly more in meat in volume terms.
The data shows that the volume of fresh and frozen beef and lamb purchased was 1% higher than for the previous 12 months. The expenditure was up 5%, reflecting the higher prices paid for beef and lamb during the year.
According to the Taylor Nelson Sofres survey sales of fresh and frozen beef, now represent 47% of beef sales in Britain. The volume of beef burger and grills sold during the year are estimated to represent 24% of total beef purchases, which means that the combined chilled and frozen beef, beef burgers and grills now represent 71% of beef sales.
Beef-based fresh and frozen ready meals and the more high-processed products such as pies and pasties accounted for the balance of 29% of sales. The volume of beef-based chilled ready meals rose by 14% over the year.
Retail sales of fresh and frozen lamb increased by 3% in volume over the year, with consumers spending 8% more on their purchases.
Most noticeable has been the increase in the purchase of leg steaks and chops which were significantly higher than year-earlier levels. Within the fresh and frozen lamb sales, legs of lambs now account for 31% of purchases followed by chops at 19% and shoulder of lamb at 16%.
Sales of fresh and frozen pork dropped by 0.5%, while consumers spent 6% more on their purchases. Bacon sales increased by 3% and the spend was up by 5%."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10037657.html,2004-10-26 01:00:00,Beef prices expected to increase,"More factories are likely to resume quoting for cattle today as supplies of underage cattle begin to tighten.
The expectation is that prices will show an improvement of 3-6 cent/kg (1p-2p/lb) for cattle under 30 months, but penalties averaging 6 cent/kg (2p/lb) will be more strictly imposed on overage cattle in lots where they represent more than a minority.
The change of trend will be welcomed by producers, who have taken a hammering on prices over the past two months, particularly for the poorer grading animals. A gradual improvement in the prices for under 30 months cattle is a realistic expectation over the coming weeks as supplies available to the factories continue to tighten and processing for the Christmas trade gets underway.
The last of the April 2002 born calves planned to be sold under 30 months will be gone through the system by the weekend. The total number of calves registered in May 2002 was 250,000, comprising 128,000 males and 122,000 females, compared to total births for March 2002 or 531,000, which is an indication of the relative supply of animals coming up to 30 months during November.
However, the slaughter premium ends on December 31. It is likely that some of the January and February 2003 born males will be sold in November and December as they come out of retention on the 21-month SBP. There were 79,000 male calves registered for January 2003 and a further 192,000 in February. A percentage of these offered for slaughter could have a bearing on easing the normal end of year scarcity of young cattle and temper the increase."

This explanation was accepted last week by the Limerick IFA Executive. The two senior officers told the Executive meeting they booked the hotel in good faith, having been assured by the proprietor of his support for Irish food. Donal Kelly explained the hotel had been purchased some weeks previously by local farmers who are members of IFA, who assured him the hotel was signing up to the Féile Bia scheme.
Ruaidhri Deasy said that he supported the decision to hold the meeting there because of the promise to join the Féile Bia scheme. “I would do the same again in the morning if we were to get another hotel to sign up”, he said.
But Limerick IFA officer Mary Ita Keane told the meeting the hotel was not yet registered under the scheme. She said an application had been received by Bord Bia from the hotel for registration, but certification of the food supply sources was not yet complete.
Eddie Scanlan, a member of the IFA National Livestock Committee, said, “Beef producers are on their knees, and fighting for a price for cattle, and this organisation cannot be seen to promote anything other than the use of Irish produced food”.
Limerick IFA Chairman, Michael O’Flynn, closed the discussion, saying, “It is over now and that is the end of the matter, but under no circumstances should it ever happen again.”"

Some prices paid for O3 bullocks and heifers were stronger than the previous week.
At the upper end of the scale, Carrigans of Donegal continued to lead the field for R3 bullocks paying an average of 91p/lb. Jennings of Ballinrobe averaged 89.6p/lb, with Slaney Meats, Bunclody, Dawn Meats at Midleton, and Kepak at Watergrasshill each paying a shade under 88p/lb factory average. AIBP Group, Dawn Group and Kepak Group paid averages of 86.6p/lb, 86.3p/lb and 86.2p/lb respectively - unchanged.Prices paid for O3 bullocks averaged just over 82p/lb. Jennings of Ballinrobe were well ahead at an average of almost 89p/lb and Carrigans were also strong at 87p/lb.
Heifer prices have gone slightly ahead of the bullocks, indicating tighter supplies. Kepak at Clonee paid an average of 92.6p/lb for R3 heifers, but allowance should be made for the mix of premium price contract heifers in the kill. Carrigans, Dawn Meats at Waterford, and Jennings were all on averages of 89p/lb. In all 13 factories paid averages of 88p/lb or better.
Prices for O3 heifers averaged just under 82p/lb.
The best price was paid at Jennings where they averaged 88p/lb well ahead of the nearest rivals, Kepak plants at Watergrasshill and Clonee both of which paid an average of 84p/lb
Prices for good cull cows are continuing strong. Ashbourne Meats, Roscrea paid an average of 76p/lb for R4L cows."

Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan earlier welcomed the prospect of Ireland being among the first European Union countries to classify beef carcases by mechanical means.
She said this will not only enhance the supply chain but it will also provide wider benefits to the industry as Ireland consolidates its position as a supplier of top quality beef to the consumer markets of the EU.
The installation of mechanical grading machines, which is supported by a grant scheme from the Department of Agriculture and Food, was welcomed by Meat Industry Ireland.
Both the Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission approved of the new technology which brings objectivity and consistency to carcase grading throughout the country and will enable a more quality driven payments system for cattle. This is in line with statements from Agriculture ministers, farm leaders, and Task Force reports, which argued that a more differentiated pricing structure was fundamental to the future development of the industry.
Michael Barry of Meat Industry Ireland, said the ongoing monitoring of all machines by E and V Technology and the Department of Agriculture and Food will continue, ensuring that the highest standards are achieved."

The boom in production has resulted in a 25% increase being recorded for the April-June quarter compared with the same period last year.
The average price of steer beef in Brazil for the year to September was 105 cents/kg (37p/lb) compared to the weighted average EU price for male beef of 267 cents/kg (95p/lb) which means that Brazilian beef is produced for around 40% of the EU price.
Brazilian exports of fresh/chilled and frozen beef has increased sharply for each of the first six months of this year with the exception of February.
The challenge in the British market has been added to by the closure of the Russian market to Brazilian beef following the confirmation of a case of FMD last month.
This loss of market is expected to lead to more concentrated focus by Brazil on Egypt, Chile, Holland, Italy and Britain."

“Farmers have been concerned that if they were to apply for the bull premium, they would be paid bull price at slaughter,” said the ICMSA’s beef and cattle committee chairman, Mr John O’Leary.
A large number of animals will qualify for the bull premium this year, and the ICMSA has urged the Department to monitor factories closely to ensure fair treatment.
“Confusion can be avoided, and the animal correctly classified as a steer, if the animal is castrated as soon as possible after the retention period,” said Mr O’Leary."

A double punched red Limousin weighing 738 kgs sold for €1,250, a whopping €512 over €/kg - but the highest margin over €/kg was €600 when a single punched 540 kgs Belgian Blue x bullock sold for €1,140.
These animals may be bought for showing at fat stock shows/sales coming up, but the overall trend of the trade was not far behind.
A 774 kg punched out Charolais made €1,210 and a 670 kgs Limousin sold for €1,150. In the single punched bullocks €1,100 was paid for two 597 kgs Limousin; two 525 kgs Charolais made €1,000, and a lot of three Charolais weighing 490 kgs made €925. The heifer trade was equally strong with the tops making €480 over €/kg and prices scaling back to €120 over.
At Bandon Mart, punched out bullocks made up to €220 over and those with a premia sold for up to €320 over. The heifer trade was similar to last week with good heifers making up to €200 over.

There was a noticeable increase in the availability of cattle to the factories in all areas of the country this week and some of the factories have eased O grade prices back by 3 cents/kg (1p/lb), and further widened the price gap between R and O grades.
It has been more difficult to get 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) for R grade animals in the lower half of the country this week, but 249 cents/kg (89p/lb) is available.
The general run of prices being offered to producers has been 246 cents/kg (88p/lb) for R grade stock.
Move above the midlands and there is 90p/lb to be got, with up to 260 cents/kg (93p/lb) quoted for R3 in the north west of the country, while prices for R4 in the north west remain at 252 cents/kg (90p/lb).
Prices on offer for O grades have slipped a little, and are ranging from 85p back to 83p/lb, with a gap of up to 20 cents/kg (7p/lb) now opening up between R and O grade animals at some of the factories.
That can be penal for suppliers of the poorer grading animals, and beef animals coming from the dairying areas, which usually have more difficulty in getting into the better grading categories.
The increase in cattle supply this week has certainly put the brakes on further increases in prices at least for the moment, and given that there are not too many weeks left in the year, the end of year prices are very unlikely to reach anything close to some of the earlier predictions.
The increase in stock is not unexpected.
As we previously indicated, the release of January 2003 born animals from 21 month SBP retention was expected to result in more of these animals selling by the middle of this month, a pattern which is likely to continue over the coming weeks, as more of these early 2003 born animals complete retention and are slaughtered to take advantage of the e80/head Slaughter Premium, which ends on December 31.
There is a strong trade for cull cows, with up to 207 cents/kg (74p/lb) being quoted for the quality heavy cows. Pay sheet returns show that factory averages of up to 77p/lb has been paid in recent weeks for cull cows at Newgrange Meats, Navan and up to 75p/lb was paid at Kepak, Clonee.

Punched out bullocks were a flying trade with up to €442 over €/kg being paid for the tops of the continentals at Ennis, up to €340 over at Kilkenny and up to €310 over at Bandon.
This week’s announcement that the final Census Date for 2004 was Sunday November 7th, removed the last remaining restriction on stocking levels not only for this year, but for the foreseeable future.
The impact was significant at yesterday’s sales, with an open expression of farmer confidence in the beef trade into 2005, as they turned out in greater numbers and in strong buying form.
Bandon Mart saw a big improvement in the bullock trade where punched out bullocks in particular were in much demand and in some cases were up €30-€40/head on last week.
The tops of the double punched sold for up to €310 over €/kg, while heavy stores with a punch made up to €340 over. Continental heifers made up to €220 over and Hereford/AA heifers sold at €150-€200 over.
At Kilkenny Mart a similar bigger attendance of farmer buyers and improved prices pushed the double punched bullocks to €340 over, with the heavy single punched selling at €200-€350 over and 400-500 kg single punched making up to €400 over. Beef heifers were also an excellent trade at up to €300 over and ranging from €220 over."

Davy said AIB’s 22.5% stake in American regional bank M&T was worth only slightly more in euro terms than it had been two years ago, even though M&T’s share price had risen 44% in the intervening period. The dollar had collapsed by 36% against the euro over the same timeframe.
But AIB shareholders were fortunate to escape the full effects of the slide, according to Davy, thanks to the bank’s decision to reduce its exposure to America in recent years. AIB did this by taking some of its payment in cash when it sold its troubled Allfirst subsidiary, the home of the Rusnak rogue trading fiasco that cost AIB $690 million, to M&T, as well as beefing up its businesses elsewhere. Earnings from America accounted for 13% of AIB’s pre-tax profits in the first half of 2004, but this figure was as high as 30% in the late 1990s.
Davy said it was likely AIB’s hand would soon be forced in respect of its US interests, as M&T was expected to make an acquisition in the near future and would need to seek fresh funding at that stage. AIB would then need to decide whether to sell up or inject more of its own money into M&T to prevent its stake being diluted below 22.5%.
M&T, which has branches in New York, Pennsylvania and other states in the northeastern corner of the US, has a reputation for making significant acquisitions at 18-month intervals, but two years have elapsed since its last big deal, the takeover of Allfirst.
A sale of the M&T stake would generate a profit of more than €500m, the bulk of which would be used to fund a share buyback programme. This would be expected to provide a further boost to the AIB share price. The bank would also benefit from a recent change to Irish tax law that would exempt it from a €100m Capital Gains Tax bill on the sale."

For far too long the better quality cattle have been subsidising the cattle of poorer confirmation.
The new pricing grid will send out a strong message to all beef producers that quality pays."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10112179.html,2004-12-09 00:00:00,81p/lb for R grade in new price grid,"Prices for the poorer grading animals have been worst hit by the new price structure, falling 6 to 9 cents/kg (2p to 3p/lb).
The R4L grade has been set as the base for the new price system, with prices moving up or down on either side for both conformation and fat scores.
Overall, most factories have reduced prices by at least 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) for under-age cattle.
Some have cut over-age stock even more.
Most of the factories were offering 241 cents/kg (86p/lb) for R4L animals this week, with R3 grade worth an additional 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) under the new price grid, while R4H grades were being penalised by 6 cents/kg (2p/lb).
A minority of factories were working off a base of 243 cents/kg (87p/lb).
But there was very little scope for bargaining with the processors, because of the strong supply of cattle available.
Prices for O4L were set at 12 cents/kg (4p/lb) less than for R4L, resulting in 229 cents/kg (82p/lb) in general, although some factories were quoting 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) less than that, offering producers 81p/lb for R grade animals, covering both R3 and R4 grades.
Producers who held on to cattle in the hope of higher prices for the Christmas trade are now losing up to €70 per head off the peak autumn prices, instead of making the gain they had hoped for.
Price is all about supply and demand, and bullock supplies to factories for the last week of November were almost 4,000 head higher than for the corresponding week in 2003. The supply dropped by 1,400 head last week to 17,830 head, which is still very strong for this time of the year, and ahead of the same week last year by a narrow margin. On the demand side, requirements for the factories’ Christmas orders will be filled by this week-end.
Producers selling this week have lost the benefit of the slaughter premium, and would be better off holding cattle back until January."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10095184.html,2004-12-09 00:00:00,Commitment but lots to do,"But much more will be needed than the few taxation concessions he went on to describe.
And in three weeks time, farmers will be poorly prepared when they face reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the decoupling of farm supports from production, and the Nitrates Directive. As Minister Cowen pointed out, there’s also the recently agreed WTO framework agreement to contend with.
Principal among the daunting prospects ahead is the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, Brussels’ attempt to make European agriculture more competitive and economically viable.
Irish farmers are not well placed to thrive in a more competitive arena.
Our beef and sheep farms are largely unviable, unless farmers make the irrational choice to subsidise their production out of their Single Farm Payment cheques.
They haven’t a hope, if the WTO framework agreement which Minister Cowen referred to results in a flood of imports of South American beef or New Zealand lamb - both produced at one third of the Irish cost.
In Irish dairying, long-run competitiveness requires a quota of 80,000 to 100,000 gallons, an impossible target for most Irish farmers, because of our inflexible milk quota system.
In general, Irish farms are just too small to cover costs of production and leave viable income.
It’s no wonder that economists are predicting fewer full time farmers, resources and labour moving from farming to the other buoyant sectors of the economy, and food processing and farm input industries shrinking.
Perhaps the government will welcome migration of labour from farming to other sectors, to man Minister Cowen’s predicted national return towards a sustainable level of annual economic growth.
That, and agri-food sector shrinkage, will be the outcome, unless the Government does much more than the Budget measures announced, which are no more than a start on the road to the viable farming sector the Finance Minister envisages.
The small size of our farms is the key issue to be addressed to underpin the competitiveness of commercial agriculture, but Minister Cowen’s special stamp duty concession to make consolidation of fragmented farms less expensive is only a trifling measure in the context of small farm size.
The announced income averaging for taxation was no more than could be expected.
Without it, the Government would be raiding the extra EU money farmers may get in 2005, due to balancing premium payments from 2004 and the first Single Farm Payment coming in the same year.
There’s an improved capital allowance in the Budget for expenditure on farm pollution control; hopefully that is the forerunner to the 60% grant rate for essential pollution control recommended by Nitrates Directive “honest broker” Denis Brosnan.
The flat rate VAT refund increase does no more than compensate unregistered farmers for higher VAT charges on their farm input purchases.
And it was no more than young, trained farmers deserved, to have the special 100% stock relief left in place for a further two years. Similarly, it would be a harsh government indeed that would pull away the 25% relief for all other farmers (which has been extended for a further two years) at this time of need.
Admittedly, with uncharted territory ahead for Irish farmers, it is hard to know how the Government can best attempt to improve farm viability.
Land may become very cheap to rent, making farming expansion to a viable scale possible here, even as EU farm product prices approach world prices in the decade ahead.
But this Government had made the future even more murky, with cutbacks at the worst possible time in Teagasc’s research work.
Just when new ideas are needed to find viable areas of production for Ireland’s small to medium farms, it is essential that the State maintain and enhance its commitment to research, training, education and advice.
Instead, there have been cutbacks, even though Government spending on agri-research has generated returns better than any other public investments in Ireland over the years.
The budget did a little, and left an awful lot undone, as far as farming and food are concerned."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10065890.html,2004-12-11 00:00:00,"Price of fixed mindset must change, ICSA president urges Irish farmers","Malcolm Thompson told the ICSA agm in Tullamore that he meant decommissioning the mindset whereby the price of a pound of beef or lamb did not matter since the subsidy made up the difference.
These “mindsets” include the obsession of farmers with production, even if unviable , the consumers’ notion that all beef is the same, and the erroneous view that farmers deserve huge and unjust penalties has led to increasing levels of red tape.
“Consumers, retailers and processors were being subsidised without realising it Farmers forgot about business management and became subsidy junkies, intent on maximising and manipulating premia.
“Somewhere along the way, the economics of production got lost and pricing became secondary to premia“, he said.
Referring to the meat processors, Mr Thompson said it was time for them to realise the game of exploitation was over.
“They’ll need de-commissioning for slow learners“, he said, stressing there can be no future for farmers or processors at a base price of 87p for underage and 83p for overage cattle.
Warning that farmers will have options from next year, he believed they would look seriously at cutting production until beef prices rose substantially.
Unless 2005 brought a substantial and sustained price rise, he was certain the ICSA would urge all farmers to cut production by at least 10%, through planting the worst 10% of the farm, cutting back on stock numbers, or joining REPs.
Mr Thompson said beef farmers cannot be expected to cross subsidise the co-ops and plcs when they decide to pay a disgracefully low price for milk.
Dairy farmers can no longer accept a low milk price simply because they are paid “over the odds” for the dairy by-product - the Holstein bull calf.
“Yet we can’t have the beef of high quality suckler animals cross subsidising the beef of a Holstein steer either. This has been going on for too long“, the ICSA president said.
In future, he stressed the key objectives were profitability without the need to depend on the single entitlement, protection of the suckler herd and a realistic price for beef and lamb that reflected the cost of production.
The key objectives must also include the marketing of Irish farm produce in Europe at a premium price and safeguarding farmers from excess bureaucracy and unfair penalties."

Most of the factories have also moved to quoting producers only in cents/kg.

Most farmers are tending to adopt a wait-and-see approach.
Most have decided to concentrate on establishing their entitlements in 2005, few have decided on radical change, but all are utterly frustrated and annoyed at the current last kick in the teeth that is being delivered on today's beef price.
In 1988, farmers got £1.18 for beef, and it didn't matter what age the beast was; today the price is 83p for the over 30 month R4L animal.
While premia are used to discredit that comparison, in two weeks' time that comparison will once again become entirely valid.
""We can't have the beef of high quality suckler animals cross subsidising the beef of a Holstein steer"", he told ICSA members (who include half of all suckler farmers with more than 40 cows).
""Let's not forget that in a de-coupled environment, the dairy cow will earn €1,250 before the value of the calf is taken into account. As I said, I would prefer if that dairy cow could earn even more from her milk. But, and this is the big but, the suckler cow is now earning absolutely nothing except the value of her calf, and that calf may well die of scour or pneumonia.""
""The suckler calf has to be worth substantially more than the dairy store, if there are to be any suckler farmers left in a few years"", said Mr Thompson.
On marketing, he said consumers across Europe must perceive Irish beef as a different product to untraceable Brazilian beef, and Ireland should develop its green image by adopting a GM free island strategy."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10081798.html,2004-12-16 00:00:00,First of decoupled beef prices,"Along the way, its marketing arms did well to increase its share of exports to Europe from as low as 40% in the 1990s to 83% last year.
Now, within five months, the beef industry here been very busy on the cattle front, introducing mechanical grading of carcases, and a new cattle payment grid. It’s no accident that the industry’s cattle procurement divisions have been galvanised into action with decoupling in sight.
Processors fear that decoupling could squeeze them out of the quality beef markets, unless they strengthen their position and take steps to ensure a supply of quality Irish cattle.
Things haven’t worked out as bad as they looked early on, with only France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Austria leaving the slaughter premium partly coupled. So there’s less fear of an €80 per head premium advantage pulling the best finishing cattle out of Ireland.
However, full decoupling here is predicted to hit the cattle supply to processors fairly hard, due to a marked decline in the national suckler herd.
Processors reckon a 15% cut in suckler numbers could leave them struggling to fill orders and compete for the higher priced quality beef markets.
Meanwhile, with no slaughter premium (which was originally introduced to reduce over-supply of cattle in the autumn), farmers are free to revert to low cost grass based rearing, and end up selling more cattle in the autumn, even if that inevitably depresses autumn cattle prices.
That poses more than one problem for processors.
They have enough processing over-capacity to cope with extra autumn cattle, but will have huge carrying costs for nearly empty factories at the other end of the year.
Beef quality will suffer too, with cattle reared according to the weather and the season, rather than to produce high quality carcases. And there will probably a trend away from continental breeds, towards the early maturing, hardier breeds better suited to outdoor finishing.
We are now seeing the industry’s attempt to ensure that sufficient supplies of better quality cattle will be available to service their premium priced markets.
Cheaply produced beef from grass in the decoupled era may suit farmers, but is unlikely to be suitable for exporters’ best priced sales outlets.
Mutually acceptable partnership type deals have to be set up with farmers prepared to produce quality cattle.
First, to get these long suffering quality cattle producers back on-side, after years of flat rate pricing and narrow price ranges from run of the mill to premium cattle, mechanical grading of carcases and a new cattle payment grid were pre-requisites.
For them, the news of 24c/kg (8.6p/lb) more for U cattle than O cattle is somewhat encouraging.
However, after years of disappoint prices for prime cattle, they won’t be swallowing the new pricing system as evidence of guaranteed high prices ahead.
The new price grid was introduced out of the blue, by word of mouth as far as farmers are concerned, and they wouldn’t be surprised to see it disappearing just as fast, if it suits processors to pull it, depending on the cattle supply trend.
And there’s always the South American beef, which can be sold into Europe profitably, even after absorbing the full trade tariffs, putting a cap on prices at the farm gate in Ireland.
There’s also the return to lower cost grass beef for the decoupling era, with autumn gluts likely to drag back-end prices down.
Producers of U cattle got 88 to 93p this week; processors will have to do better than that to keep in the business.
Otherwise, quality cattle producers will see the new price grid as just another gimmick to dress up the same old system."

At this week’s Situation and Outlook in Agriculture Conference in Dublin, Liam Dunne of Teagasc’s Rural Economy Research Centre advised farmers regarding to avoid inflating cattle prices by spending the money on stores in the autumn, or on imprudent capital investments which would increase their farming costs, and which are unlikely to be sustained by cattle margins in the future.
He forecast beef and cattle prices remaining stable in 2005, despite the strong euro and the reintroduction of” over 30 month beef” on the UK market. Calf and concentrate feed costs are likely to be lower, he said."

The findings show that there were winners and losers on the new grid system of payment, which did not operate uniformly across the country.
Meanwhile the average paid for R3 bullocks and heifers last week by the factories was unchanged from the previous week as the price fall bottomed out for the year with the reduction in supplies halting any further decline in return to producers.
The new pricing system, fixes the base price on R4/R4L grades, setting out clear differentials in the payment, plus and minus the base for conformation and fat scores above or below the base line. However the pay sheet returns show a low level of adherence to the system and huge variations between factories.
Under the new system the difference in price between R3 and O4H was set at 24 cent/kg. The price range varied between 8 cent/kg and 24 cent/kg at the individual factories.
The set difference in price between U3 and O4H grades is 36 cent/kg. The difference at the factories varied between 13 cent/kg and 40 cent/kg. In both examples examined the price difference was less than the set level in three quarters of the factories analysed.

An average price increase for cattle of 10% was offset by fewer slaughterings and live exports, resulting in sales increasing by 4.9% or €61m.
Sheep prices fell, but slaughterings increased, resulting in the value of output increasing by 6.6% or €13m.
Cereals production increased, but the price fell 11%, resulting in the value of output falling by 7.9%, or €13m.
The CSO estimated that energy costs on farms increased by 7.6% or €17m Updated figures for 2004 will be published in February 2005. Meanwhile, IFA president John Dillon said the advance CSO estimate showed some improvements in farming in 2004, bearing in mind that there was an 80% advance payment of suckler cow and special beef premiums in 2003, but this reverted to 60% this year.
“The improvement in cattle prices by almost 10% is the single most important positive factor in 2004”, he said.
The main black-spots in 2004 were the very low prices for cereals, down by 11%, low potato prices, and higher prices for feedstuffs and energy."

Many of our larger, intensive farmers will benefit from the inflow of East European workers, according to the Cork based consultant.
“The availability of well paid jobs as a result of the Celtic Tiger has attracted labour away from farming, which has been identified as a significant obstacle to progress in the post subsidy era. The availability of suitable labour from within the EU may prove to be an essential component in re-energising agriculture to respond to the challenge of greater market opportunity.”
Mr Fitzsimons said REPS 3 is an opportunity to increase farm income by up to €8,550, equivalent to an extra 20,000 gallons of milk, 20 hectares of grain, 10 hectares of sugar beet, 30 suckler cows or 20 hectares of forestry. Uptake has been slower than anticipated, partly due to farmers opting to finish out five year REPS 2 plans before joining REPS 3. In many cases, REPS 2 land leases have not been renewed for five years, due to Single Payment uncertainties. Some farmers perceive the cost of extra compliance for REPS 3 as unjustifiable.
However, Mr Fitzsimons anticipates that REPS 3 participation will increase substantially, when farmers come to terms with the Single Farm Payment. “In the context of Cross Compliance and the Nitrates Directive, it is difficult to see how REPS should not prove attractive to most farmers,” he said.
“There is much debate about what the post-Fischler Ireland will look like. There is broad agreement however that many commercial farms will increase substantially in size. At the same time, vast areas of the countryside will be owned and farmed by people who have made a life style choice to live in the country side, but who do not expect to derive their principal income from farming.”
“I predict that two distinct groups of farmers will develop, a highly commercial efficient dairy, beef, and tillage farmer who will need cutting edge support on technical and financial aspects, and the second main grouping will comprise a larger number of part-time farmers who will require a socio-economic agri-environmental advisory service. It is vital that state funding continues to finance such support services, but I believe that the time has come to look at broadening the base to include private service providers. The REPS Scheme has proven that private consultants can deliver as effective a service as their state sponsored counterparts and are ready, willing and able to fill an expanded role.”

But the top price of the week must have been the lot of three Charolais punched out bullocks, weighing 698 kgs, which sold for €1,190 at Ennis Mart on Thursday. They were an excellent price at the sale where the general run for the tops of the continental punched out bullocks ranged €300-€350 over €/kg.
There was an offering of 800 cattle for the sale, with a very strong trade for the single punched bullocks which were improved by at least €20/head. Prices ranged €300-€455 over €/kg. A 396 kg Limousin heifer made a choice price when sold for €730. Price ranged €120-€230 over €/kg.
Bandon Mart held the last cattle sale for the year, with punched out bullocks making up to €320 over in trade. The heavy stores with a premia made €220-€340 over e/kg and up to €350 over was paid for the lighter stores with a premia still available. Up to €220 over was paid for Continental heifers. Hereford and AA heifers ranged €110-€140 over €/kg.
There was almost 800 head of cattle on offer at Kilkenny. Trade was firm all round. Double punched bullocks made €190-€300 over €/kg and the forward bullocks with a premia made up to €420 over scaling back to €300 over. Medium weight single punched sold for up to €410 over and the light cattle under 400 kgs with a premia made up to €390 over.
There was a strong trade for heifers, the best of the continental beef heifers making €220 over. Butcher’s heifers ranged €170-€230 over. Stores made €160-€210 over."

Mr Bourke said comparing the cost of a cappuccino in the five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin with a Costa Del Sol cafe did not fool anyone.
A better comparison would be The Merrion and the George V in Paris, he told the Cork Chamber of Commerce business breakfast briefing, organised in association with the Irish Examiner.
""The next time I hear mineral water prices in hotels and restaurants being compared to supermarket prices, I'm going to suggest that the purchaser looks for a table and chair in the supermarket, table service, stay an hour, and see if that changes the price.
""We don't sell mineral water - we sell the experience, the ambience, the comfort, and all it takes to put that together; and we make no apology for charging for that,"" he said.
However, on the positive side, Mr Bourke said: ""We don't hear about our accommodation charges, which probably means we are too inexpensive.""
Mr Bourke challenged the ""rip-off critics"" to disclose why Irish beef is up to 30% cheaper in Spain and France than in Ireland; or why insurance costs in Ireland are 30%-40% higher than in Britain and more than double the EU; or why Ireland has the highest VAT rates in the EU - double or more than double competing countries like France, Spain and Portugal; or why business tourists are not allowed to claim VAT as a business input, as they are in most competing countries.
The Irish Hotels Federation, in its pre-budget submission, asked Finance Minister Brian Cowen to deal with the VAT issue among other things.
""We proved to his officials that giving the VAT as a reclaimable cost input would be at worst revenue neutral and would probably generate tax revenue for the Exchequer and jobs for our sector.
""We are awaiting his response in the framing of the Finance Bill. It will be an indication of how seriously our industry is being taken at Government level,"" he said."

This will demand that each farmer must examine the actual profitability of each enterprise in its own right.
Urging each farmer to examine where costs can be cut, he said it may be that some farmers will have to cut back production to reduce costs, but this might not necessarily be a bad thing.
Other farmers, particularly older people, may welcome the opportunity to do less, especially if help is scarce.
Mr Thompson said these factors should be carefully noted by meat processors and retailers alike. Farmers are no longer going to produce to lose money.
“Beef and lamb prices will have to increase to reflect this new reality. Otherwise, beef factories in Ireland will have less and less cattle and sheep to process,” he said.
Pointing out that the ICSA had successfully delivered on decoupling, he said it had long recognised that the old premia system was damaging to farmers’ interests and had simply become a guarantee of cheap cattle to processors and retailers.
“From now on, farmers will have the freedom to choose which enterprise they operate and whether or not to produce.
“These are important freedoms which will allow the farmer to cut back where prices are too low to cover costs and which will help avoid farmers being at the mercy of beef processors, year in year out.”
Mr Thompson said that the other advantage of the new system will be the reduction in red tape levels, which had become an unbearable waste of time."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10061592.html,2004-12-30 00:00:00,"Change to dominate farming, says Coughlan","SINCE being appointed the country’s first woman Minister for Agriculture and Food three months ago, Mary Coughlan has talked with a lot of people in the industry.
She has noted in the process that the word arising most often is “change”, a theme that will dominate much of what will happen in farming and the food sector over the next few years.
Change has certainly been to the fore in the year now ending. The historic expansion of the European Union added about 75 million consumers to an internal market that now caters for 450 million.
The implementation of the outcome of the mid term review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), with a mandate to make European agriculture more competitive and economically viable, also began in earnest.
Agreement on a framework for a new round of WTO reforms, which has been a long time coming, made clear yet again the need for a competitive and market orientated agri-sector.
Ms Coughlan, whose department will have a total gross expenditure in 2005 of about €3.3 billion from State and EU coffers, recently reflected on the challenges she faces in keynote speeches.
She noted that the agriculture sector and rural society in Ireland has in past decades seen, accommodated and managed enormous changes.
“One thing is clear above all else from our collective experiences - we must continue to adapt and be willing to make necessary adjustments,” she said.
Ms Coughlan succeeded Joe Walsh in the country’s oldest Government department shortly after the most radical reform of the CAP reforms was agreed.
It involves severing the link between subsidies and production, the introduction of a new EU single farm payment based on historical reference, and opens up an exciting and challenging new era for farmers.
Ms Coughlan said the over-riding objective of producing what the market wants and will pay for will be restored as the central theme for producers.
They will no longer have their initiative and energies diverted into concerns about retention periods, census dates and other scheme requirements.
“While the market will take centre stage, farmers will also be required to accommodate concerns in relation to animal welfare and the environment and I am confident they will do so.”
Ms Coughlan said that in a variety of ways she thinks that what lies ahead will allow many in the sector to show their full potential and allow Ireland to prove just how good its producers, processors, innovators and marketers can be.
Looking back on 2004, she said dairy markets have been relatively positive.
Prices and demand on the EU and international markets have been strong.
Fears of a negative impact on prices on foot of EU expansion have been unfounded - product prices in the new member states have been steadily climbing to EU levels.
“Similarly, the mid term review changes on July 1 last had a limited impact.
“I was very pleased to note that the transition to the new market environment has been much smoother than predicted in many circles.
“While the outlook for the coming months remains positive, the reality is that in the new policy framework, market forces will have a much bigger influence on the price paid for milk.
“While EU market management measures will remain an influence, we must accept going forward an intensified focus on market force dynamics.
“This means that we must critically examine all aspects of economic, efficient and competitive production and processing within the dairy sector,” she said. Turning to the beef sector, Minister Coughlan said she believes full decoupling will be of great benefit to Irish agriculture and will underpin the development of a sustainable, market-oriented agri-food sector.
Quality production is the key to increasing Ireland’s share of the premium market for beef, particularly in the key European markets.
Ms Coughlan said that as Ireland moves forward to a more direct market-oriented beef sector, it is important to encourage the production of the type and quality of animals required by the markets.
“It is equally important that farmers should get a fair return for high quality production,” she said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10071161.html,2005-01-05 00:00:00,Further CAP price reductions ‘unacceptable’,"THE decoupling of EU direct payments to farmers is the single biggest change in agricultural policy since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, according to Con Lucey, the respected chief economist of the Irish Farmers Association.
He said it was a new situation and it was difficult to predict the reaction of farmers. Clearly, they will have more choices both with regard to the products they produce and the level of production.
“Farmers will be able to make decisions based on the economics of production, and no longer driven by the particular regulatory requirements of the existing coupled payments system, such as premium quotas, census dates and extensification requirements,” he said. Mr Lucey says the new decoupled environment will require the IFA to refocus on particular objectives.
“Firstly, the level of the product price will have a new importance.
“The linking of price to quality is important, so that there is a clear signal from the market to farmers.
“The market of the future is going to be the EU market, because it is already decided in the WTO that export refunds will be phased out during the next trade round,” he said.
Mr Lucey said there was a major challenge for the IFA’s main commodity committees to negotiate with the processors price and marketing agreements, which will be vital for the future of both farmers and processors.
For example, farmers finishing cattle over the winter will need a level of advance guarantee on spring beef prices. Grain growers planting winter wheat will need a level of price guarantee for the harvest.
In the dairy sector, the 2003 CAP reform decisions involve a cut of over 22% in EU price supports between 2004 and 2007.
The challenge for the IFA and the dairy industry is to ensure that producer prices do not reflect this reduction, based on a combination of relatively strong commodity prices, an increasing share of high value products in the mix, and savings in assembly, processing and marketing costs.
Secondly, in the case of farm inputs and services, Mr Lucey said the prices charged must be reassessed in the context of decoupling. In the current coupled payment situation, input and service suppliers had a captive market.
In the new situation, the IFA has a key role to play in ensuring lower production costs, for example by promoting greater use of generic agri-chemical products, and by increasing the market power of farmers through purchasing groups and info technology.
Thirdly, it is anticipated that different categories of farmers will respond in different ways to decoupling. Some farmers with limited scale may decide that off-farm employment provides the best return.
Some elderly farmers may opt for retirement or semi-retirement. Most commercial farmers are likely to continue in commercial farming, but will require increased scale, some capital investment, greater efficiency, and lifelong learning to remain competitive. Apart from the changeover to the single payment, there are some other major items on IFA’s agenda for 2005. These include the review of the agricultural rural development schemes in Brussels and the detailed WTO negotiations.
Mr Lucey said the review of the agricultural rural development schemes (disadvantaged areas scheme, REPS, forestry, early retirement, and on-farm investment) will be taking place in the first half of 2005. This review is within the wider framework of the negotiations on a new EU budget for the years 2007 to 2013, which may be quite difficult. There are some very negative proposals on the table from the commission, particularly with the criteria to be used in the future to have areas classified as disadvantaged, and also as regards support for forestry.
A related problem is that none of the country is likely to qualify as ‘Objective 1’ after 2006.
The implication is that after 2006 a greater proportion of the cost of these schemes will have to be borne by the Exchequer, and a lower proportion by the EU budget.
The IFA’s bottom line is that the EU has reformed the CAP twice in recent years in preparation for WTO - Agenda 2000 and Luxembourg 2003 - and whatever cuts on import tariffs are agreed, they must not result in further cuts to CAP prices and supports."

“Put the past behind us. Short-term advantage for factory or farmer is a road to nowhere. Both sides have a huge investment in the beef industry. We are both up against strong international competition,” he said.
Mr Dillon said that with IFA Livestock Committee chairman John Bryan, he was offering the beef trade to take the first step towards building a viable and sustainable industry for farmers and processors.
The IFA leader told the meeting that farmers need government measures to build capacity and be viable for the future.
He said the principal challenge for farmers, IFA, food processors and the Government is to ensure there is a strong viable full-time farming sector going forward.
Mr Dillon urged the Taoiseach to engage with the IFA in developing a programme to achieve farm viability and called for the removal of stamp duty and capital gains tax, where the sale or purchase of land is essential for farm viability.
He said farming with decoupled payments is the greatest change for agriculture in over 30 years. Decoupled payments are there for a very specific reason - to pay for the restrictions and higher standards imposed on European farmers.
Mr Dillon said the message from the annual general meeting was that full-time farming must be profitable, product prices must return a viable margin for efficient farmers and full-time farmers need a sufficient margin to develop, invest and expand.
Warning that the EU’s sugar reform proposals would wipe out the industry here, he urged the Government and EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy to defend Ireland’s vital interests in the negotiations."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/yourview/arid-10104462.html,2005-01-10 00:00:00,We may pay a high price for Iraq,"The Iraq war was not accidental, but was both unlawful and reckless. So far the international media has only attempted to put estimated dollar costs on the war in so far as it impinged on the economies of the perpetrator countries, mainly the US, Britain, Australia, Spain, Italy, and those others listed as the 'coalition of the willing'.
Some of these coalition members, notably Ireland, may even have managed, so far, to make a small profit out of this war. Others such as Spain and Australia had hoped also to cash in on their complicity, but suffered serious losses in the bombings in Madrid and Bali.
The day of reckoning for the Iraq war of 2003 may be many years, even decades, from now. Ireland supplied beef to feed the Iraqi army during the Iran/Iraq war in the 1980s. It was never paid for this and the Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, decided to write off well over €100 million of this bill in 2003.
Libyan involvement in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 106 in 1988 over Lockerbie led to an agreement on compensation in 2003 of about $10m for each of the 270 victims.
The cost of the compensation package for the Iraq war will be many times the Libyan figure. The number of fatal victims in the war has already exceeded 100,000, and the number of injured may be as high as one million Iraqis.
If calculated at $10 million per victim, then the compensation or reparations due to the victims in Iraq would amount to $10 billion.
This does not include structural damage or damage to infrastructure and the Iraqi economy, which is likely to exceed the financial cost of the human losses; neither does it include deaths and illnesses due indirectly to the war.
About 40 countries were involved in the 'coalition of the willing'. The question of proportionality will arise. Apportioning blame on a percentage basis would give approximate calculations of responsibility and liability as follows:
US 70%, based on leadership, troop deployment and military hardware.
Britain 10%, based on its direct military involvement.
Other troop-contributing countries 12% to be divided proportionately between them on the basis of their level of military involvement.
Group of countries that provided logistic support, including landing and overflight facilities 8%.
Within this last group Ireland has been one of the most complicit due to the fact that approximately 70% of all US troops involved in the Iraq war passed through Shannon airport.
If Ireland's share of financial responsibility for reparations to Iraq were to be calculated at a modest 0.5%, this could amount to something like $100 billion dollars. Killing people unlawfully and destroying their towns is an expensive business, and a bad business.
While no money can compensate for the loss of human life, all countries involved in this unlawful war should be forced to pay reparations.
Happy New Year? Not in Iraq for many years to come.

competition is intense and supplies of low-priced product from South America are a growing feature.
Mr Cotter was addressing beef and lamb producers at a Bord Bia national conference in Tullamore, Co Offaly, which discussed various issues relating to the sector.
The conference heard that Ireland will have to find new EU and international markets for around 70,000 tonnes of beef expected to be displaced from British retail shelves from the middle of this year.
It follows a recent British Government announcement that it intends to phase out a ban on meat from cattle over thirty months entering the food chain and replace it with a robust testing system for BSE. This will release additional beef on to the market.
Mr Cotter said Bord Bia will continue to intensify promotional campaigns, focusing in particular on assisting the industry to reposition more Irish product from Britain to the continental EU markets.
He said the industry has made significant progress over the last three years, increasing the share of its beef exports sold in Europe from 55% to 90%.
Last year, Irish male cattle prices increased as a percentage of the EU average from 88% to 94%, the best commercial performance since pre-BSE market conditions in 1995.
The challenge in the post-decoupling era is to continue to build on this performance,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10064834.html,2005-01-12 00:00:00,"Exports rise to E7.17bn, says Bord Bia","It was the first time that the figure, which accounts for over 55% of exports from indigenous Irish companies, had exceeded the 7bn mark, according to the board’s annual review.
In addition to the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and sterling, the industry had to face a more competitive trading environment shaped by retailer consolidation, retail food price deflation and product competition, according to the review. The most significant growth sectors in 2004 in terms of value of exports were prepared foods, dairy products and ingredients and beef, with the sterling and euro currency areas accounting for over two-thirds of exports.
Taking into account the movement of the euro against the dollar and sterling, Bord Bia said underlying growth in Irish exports in 2004 was 5%.
Bord Bia chief executive Aidan Cotter said Irish companies adapted to the challenges in export markets last year and delivered growth.
“The increase in exports is testament to the ability of Irish companies to innovate and create new products to meet consumer and retailer demand,” he said.
Mr Cotter said with CAP reform increasing the focus on the marketplace from 2005, the Irish food industry is facing into a defining period in its development.
Bord Bia’s review showed that meat and livestock made up the largest single sector at E2.19bn last year. Beef (+8%) and sheepmeat (+14%) offset declines in livestock (-21%). Outlook for beef in 2005 is broadly positive with a widening EU beef deficit of approximately 350,000 tonnes.
Pigmeat exports increased in 2004 by 6% to E265 million. Exports of prepared foods rose by 9% to a total value of E1.59bn.
Dairy products and ingredients exports experienced a 6% rise to almost E1.86bn.
Exports of beverages fell by 10% in 2004 to E965m.
Horticulture exports fell by 12% to E186m."

He said farmers need price increases to 3/kg (107p/lb) for winter beef and 2.66/kg (95p/lb) for beef off grass.
He proposed a “partnership of equals” between beef factories and farmers. “Put the past behind us. Short-term advantage for factory or farmer is a road to nowhere.”
“Both sides have a huge investment in the beef industry. We are both up against strong international competition.”
“Today I am offering the beef trade to take the first step towards building a viable and sustainable industry for farmers and processors.”
He said 2005 will be a defining year for the future tonnage of grain produced in Ireland. “New structures and relationships will have to be put in place to maintain current levels of output and secure the viability of the native industry. The IFA Grain Committee will be approaching the industry immediately to commence this process.”
Mr Dillon said modulation funds must be targeted to improve cattle, grain and sheep farming, and a resolution must be found to potato growers’ difficulties in stacking their Single Farm Payment entitlements.
He accused dairies of being hell bent on damaging the liquid milk market, after Kerry’s price cuts of 12c/gallon, l Connacht Gold cutting prices, and Glanbia, the biggest player, trying to cut 10c/gal. “To be blunt, these demands are coming from a very inefficient sector. There are 24 bottling plants in the country doing what three or four could do, at a much lower cost, without losing valuable brands,” said Mr Dillon.
“There is 11m of farmers’ income at stake here. And where would the money go, if the dairies got their way? It would be given away to the supermarkets and used to shore up the profits of inefficient dairies. In 12 months, they would be back for more. I am telling the dairies today, as long as they have no strategy to get efficient and deal with cheap imports, IFA will fiercely resist any price cuts.”"

Suppliers of U3 animals were receiving 298 cent/kg (over 106p/lb) while O4 animals were discounted to 268 cent/kg (95p/lb) in accordance with the new grid scale of payment.
Some producers reported getting 280 cent/kg (100p/lb) flat price for numbers of mostly R grade cattle. But some factories were quoting a base price of 278 cent/kg (99p/lb) and others were claiming that they were getting supplies of cattle at that price and were not being put under pressure to pay more.
Most of the processors were keen to buy on the grid price scale and were insisting they were adhering rigidly to the scale prices as per the new grid, which is heavily penalising the poorer grading stock.
Total supplies for last week amounted to 17,017 head - which was about 50% of the supply for the same week in 2004. Bullock supplies last week came to 7,033, a big increase on the intake of 1,653 head the previous week, but still well down on the 15,756 head which they took in on the corresponding week in 2004.
A further rise in the supply will ease the pressure on the processors and slow further improvements in the weeks ahead, if the numbers continue to come freely enough to satisfy demand to meet order for markets which are not over-exciting."

The businesslike way to deal with that was illustrated last week, when Greencore started weaning itself off the EU sugar industry’s heavy subsidisation, by announcing the closure in March of its Carlow factory.
The cattle farmers who will get a lot of the more substantial SFP cheques must be equally ruthless; there can be no justification for using the SFP as a consolation “top-up” on low cattle prices. Nor must they see decoupled payments as making up the gap between the production cost and the sale price for cattle.
Within months, cattle farmers are likely to see that they are just as vulnerable as the sugar industry to the removal of subsidies. They have been told the SFP will be in place to 2013, but they should be prepared to see it suffer the same fate as Agenda 2000, which came under pressure within three years, and was scrapped entirely in five years.
Within weeks or months, we will find out how EU leaders view the SFP - whether as a temporary weaning-off payment, or a longer term subsidy. It will be in the spotlight between now and June, during discussion on the EU budget for 2007 to 2013 which will set the six big net contributors (UK, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Austria and France), who want to cut the budget, against other member states.
Depending on who wins that argument, there might not be enough money to pay the SFP, six months before the first cheques go out.
If so, the EU will have to increase its take out of the SFP, on top of the modulation levy, in order to pay for the sugar market reform, and taking in Romanian and Bulgarian farms.
That’s why the SFP cannot be relied on by farmers in the same way as the premia cheques which went straight into their farm accounts and made them look more respectable.
The European Commission seems to want farmers to view the SFP as a capital fund, from which to draw down investment to make farms more cost effective and competitive, so they can survive without it, or any other direct aid, after 2013. Also, SFP will be needed in part to keep farms in good agricultural and environmental condition and for cross-compliance, new legal requirements which carry yet to be determined costs.
Another reason it cannot be relied on for day-to-day farming is that it is not index linked, and is vulnerable to inflation.
Some farmers across Europe have already reacted to the SFP and decoupling by “mothballing” their businesses.
A number of intensive dairy bull finishers in the UK have suspended activity, until there’s a significant rise in the price of finished animals.
Hopefully, it won’t come to that in Ireland. Nevertheless, that’s an example of the kind of business-like approach which farmers here should adopt too.
Livestock premium balancing cheques now being paid will help many Irish farmers get through 2005, financially.
However, after that, farmers will have to go 12 months without any premia payments, between SFP cheques (which will only be paid in full if there are no cross-compliance problems).
Farmers should think long and hard about how they will manage that. Mothballing the farm businesses is one of the options; it’s easier to get through a year without premia, if there’s no expenditure on seed, fertiliser, sprays, animal medicines or feed.

The board has announced the election of John O'Brien, Nenagh, as the first chairman. The position is to rotate between the three areas. Nenagh Co-op Mart manager Matt Malone has been appointed chief executive. Matt is brother of John Malone, who recently retired as Department of Agriculture secretary general.
Following an independent assessment, the shareholding in the new society is giving Nenagh 80.16%, Birr 15.49% and Roscrea 4.35%. The new co-op will have a two tiered structure, including three advisory committees representing the three mart areas and a board of twelve elected members.
The sharp increase in beef prices at the factories over the past week was confirmed in the farmer pay sheet returns, which showed improvements of up to 16 cents/kg (5p/lb), with the larger increase for the poorer grades.
The factories paid an average of 276c/kg (8.7p/lb) for R4L bullocks, with a top price of 284c/kg (101.6p/lb) factory average at Donegal Meats. The national average paid for O4L bullocks was 267c/kg (95p/lb), an improvement of 16c/kg on the previous week.
Heifer prices edged ahead of the bullocks, with a national average of 277c/kg (99p/lb) paid for R4L grade and a top price of 288c/kg (103p/lb) paid at Kepak, Clonee, which probably included premium priced contract supplies in the mix. The national average for O4L heifers was 267c/kg (95p/lb)."

Strong farmer demand in a tight supply situation is pushing prices which are showing little or no change from the same week last year for store animals, despite the removal of direct payments from animals purchased in 2005.
There were still a few heavy bullocks with a premia available on offer at Bandon yesterday where they made €270-€350 over €/kg. The general run for the heavy bullocks was €200-€310 over which was almost identical to the run of prices for the same day at Bandon last year. Store heifers made €150-€190 over at yesterday’s sale.
At Kilkenny where there was an entry of 460 head for yesterday’s sale the bullocks over 600kg made €300-€390 over on the back of expectation of a strong beef price for cattle finishing in late Spring-early summer. Bullocks in the 400-500kg range made €280-€340 over with the plainer lots under 400kg dropping back to €180 over.
These prices show very little change from the same day last year at Kilkenny where the best of the 400-500kg bullocks made up to €356 over and the lighter animals peaked at €312 over. Yesterday a lot of three 517kg Simmentals made €820 and a lot of four Belgian Blues weighing 563kg sold for €850. A Charolais scaling 456kg sold for €790 and three Limousin weighing 384kg sold for €700. Beef heifers made €250-€350 over and stores sold at €150-€230 over.
Numbers on offer were similar to last week at Ennis."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10034824.html,2005-01-29 00:00:00,Beef breed bull calves in demand,"Department of Agriculture prices show that beef breed calves are selling at prices similar to the same week last year, despite the change in direct payments effective from January 1 last.
The average for beef breed bull calves at the department reference marts at Bandon and Blessington this week was €295/head and for the same week last year the average was €297/head. In contrast to the beef breeds, dairy breed bull calves - which would largely comprise Friesian - are down by 30%, underlining the weakening of interest in the poor grading animals for beef. The average paid for the beef breed bull calves this week was €124/head. For the same week last year, they averaged €171/head. There was 155 head on offer at Bandon Mart this week, similar to the previous week. The continental breed calves were a very good trade, with some examples showing a considerable improvement on the previous sale. Friesian bulls are continuing to sell at unchanged prices which remain lower than last year, but the Friesian heifer is in demand.
The continental bulls ranged €300-€470/head which was almost on line with the same sale in 2004 when the prices ranged €300-€480/head. Prices for the continental heifers were improved on 2004 levels by 30-40%. This week they ranged €200-€300/head. At the same sale last year they sold at €144-€266/head.
Friesian bulls are cheaper by 10-20% with prices down by up to €50/head. Prices for Friesian heifers are easier by €50-€55/head when compared with 2004. As the supply increases, a clearer picture of the trend forward should emerge."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10049240.html,2005-02-16 00:00:00,Store prices top 2004 levels at mart,"With the choice forward continental bullocks selling for up to €450 over €/kg finishers are now paying up to €100/head more than for similar animals with a single punch bought at the same sale centres on the corresponding day in 2004.
At the level of yesterday’s trade there was little between the prices being paid for the fancy lots and that which the tops of the clean ears animals sold for at the mid-February sales last year.
Store producers had feared a drop in price this year following the removal of the premia incentive for purchasers - worth €310/head in SBP, extensification and slaughter payments on animals with a single premia left and up to €540/head on clean ears animals - which had boosted prices at the marts in the past.
Based on current prices for stores, finishers will require factory beef prices in the range 320-336 cents/kg (115p-120p/lb) to achieve a reasonable margin.
The prospects are for a strong beef trade until and into early June, but prospects for the autumn trade do not support the current cost of stores, without being subsidised from the single payment entitlement."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10039704.html,2005-02-17 00:00:00,Supply tightening boosts beef price,"For the first time in 2005 more than 105p/lb was paid for R grade bullocks and heifers and in excess of 103p/lb was paid for O grade animals at the highest-paying factory in the country, following the uniform increase average 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) over the previous week.
The highest factory average for R grade bullocks was 295 cents/kg (105.5p/lb) at Donegal Meat Processors. The national factory average was 287 cents/kg (102.5p/lb. Exel Meats at Kilbeggan, Newgrange Meats, Navan, Bergins of Kildare, Kepak at Athleague and Watergrasshill and Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff all paid factory averages between 103.1p/lb and 103.9p/lb. The overall average for O4L bullocks was just under 100p/lb with a top price of 103.6p/lb at Donegal.
Heifer prices were broadly similar to the bullocks at a top factory average price for R4L of 105.3p/lb and national average of just under 103p/lb. Kepak at Clonee were the leaders followed by Donegal at an average of 104.6p/lb. The average for O4L was 99.5p/lb.
Kildare Chilling paid an average of almost 251 cents/kg (90p/lb) for R4 cows, with strong prices of 87p/lb for O4 and 84p/lb for P+4 at Exel Meats at Kilbeggan as demand for cows continues to strengthen and prices continue to harden."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10118479.html,2005-02-17 00:00:00,Supply shrinks due to retention for last of SBP,"A base price of 286 cents/kg (102p/lb) became the norm at most factories on Monday, and while some top-up on quoted prices was paid on Monday, processors put up greater resistance to paying higher prices as the week progressed. In the deep south, cattle supplies were stronger, and sufficient cattle were being purchased by some factories off a base closer to 280 cents/kg (100p/lb), with the IMA grid scale operating above or below the R4L grade.
Supply became the price determining factor, with plants operating a price base of 282 cents/kg (101p/lb) in the east, while the standard was more likely 286 cents/kg (102p/lb) further north.
Exel at Kilbeggan and its sister plant, Newgrange Meats at Navan quoted 286 to 280 cents/kg (102 to 100p/lb) for R and O grade animals, provided that they were not seriously over-fat, while Donegal Meats operated off a base of 283 cents/kg (101p/lb), pricing other grades as per the grid scale.
It remains to be seen if they paid stronger prices to get cattle, as they had been doing in recent weeks, with factory averages for R4L of up to 104p/lb in the pay sheet returns compiled by the Department of Agriculture.
Tighter cattle supply to factories over the past 10 days may be due to farmers awaiting completion of the SBP retention period for end of December applications, and to some farmers holding cattle in expectation of higher prices. But holding cattle now could lead to stronger supplies in March, undermining March prices, which could fall, if cattle supply exceeds beef requirements.
On the other hand, it will be very difficult to bring prices back by any worthwhile amount, but tighter application of the grid scale could be used to cut prices for poorer grading animals. The prices on offer for the cull cows remain very strong with quotes of up to 235 cents/kg (84p/lb) and up to 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) being paid for good quality cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10081760.html,2005-03-01 00:00:00,Frozen beef market to be reopened,"Ms Coughlan said this development, which follows the reopening of the Algerian market in October 2004 for fresh and chilled Irish beef, is a further strong signal of international confidence in Irish beef.
Ireland exported some 70,000 tonnes of beef to Algeria from 1995 to the suspension of exports in 2000.
Following the reopening of the market in October it is reported that a steady trade has resumed in fresh product.
Ms Coughlan said the potential for export of frozen products will help traders to compete with other suppliers of frozen product to the Algerian market. “Ireland’s wide-ranging controls in the cattle and beef sector and our international food safety reputation were instrumental in achieving this further breakthrough.
“The agreement reached with the Algerian authorities was a further positive step towards the consolidation of important Third Country markets for Irish beef,” she said.
Ms Coughlan said a very substantial shift in beef exports to the higher priced EU market in recent years has been very welcome.
The availability of non-EU international markets, however, represents an extremely important outlet in which Ireland has a long and established record of consistent supply.
Meantime, the ICSA has urged the minister to set up an ongoing meat forum to facilitate co-operation between farmers and processors in the development of markets for beef and lamb."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10067751.html,2005-03-01 00:00:00,Price of beef continues to increase,"Quality R grade animals are commanding 294 cent/kg (105p/lb) and in some cases a shade more is being paid, while producers with mixed lots of good R/O animals are negotiating deals for flat prices of 103p/lb where supplies are in strong demand.
Most of the factories quoted 286 cent/kg (102p/lb) as a base prices for R4L animals yesterday, which under the grid scale would return 292 cent/kg (104p/lb) for R3 and 304 cent/kg (108p/lb) for U3 grade. But there is very little strict application of the grid scale showing in the prices, with continuing resistance from producers to the complexity of the grid and multiplicity of prices under the system.
Bonus payments for quality assured beef where applicable are payable on top of these rates, eg at Slaney Meats, Bunclody it is worth 11 cent/kg (4p/lb). The discounting of animals over 30 months has eased from 6 cent/kg (2p/lb) to 3 cent/kg (1p/lb) and many producers are negotiating deals without penalty for over age animals where supplies are continuing tight.
Cattle supplies have increased to parity with the same weeks last year at 15,000-16,000 bullocks a week going through the plants, amounting to about half of the total kill. The supply has remained steady for the past two weeks. While there is still some pressure on the processors to keep the intake up to that level, there is less anxiety showing by the factories to get supplies higher and there is less willingness to pay more to secure additional cattle over precise requirements to fill orders on hand.
In Britain, the price of striploin, topside and silverside has eased."

Beef heifers made up to €380 over and stores sold for up to €295 over €/kg. Beef bullocks were improved by €40/head, stores were up €30-€40/head with heifers showing an improvement of €30/head at an outstanding sale.
Blessington Mart yesterday recorded some of the highest prices paid for cattle in 2005.
At Ennis - where yesterday was fat-stock show day - store prices were up €30/head with bullocks making up to €650 over and a top price of €2,000 paid for an 838kg Belgian Blue heifer.
While the tight supply of finished cattle which should ensure the strong beef price holding to mid-summer is fuelling the demand and price for stores planned for finishing by mid-June, prices paid at Blessington exceeded all expectations.
There were over 1,000 cattle at Kilkenny Mart and store heifers improved by up to €10/head. A 658kg Charolais bullock fetched €1,110 and a lot of four Charolais weighing 644kg sold for €1,050.
There was also a bigger sale at Bandon Mart yesterday, where the trade for bullocks was maintained, heifer prices improved and dry cows also traded well.
The heavy store bullocks made €240 to €350 over €/kg and the lighter stores trade at €200 to €310 over with Friesians ranging €160 to €210 over. The best of the continental heifers made €285 over and the general run for Angus and Herefords was €220 to €250 over."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10047518.html,2005-03-08 00:00:00,Marginal increase in cattle supply,"There was no change in the officially quoted prices at the factories yesterday, but coming under pressure is the margin of top-up on the quoted rates paid in recent weeks, which producers are finding more difficult to retain this week.
Factories are quoting 286 cents/kg (102p/lb) for R/R4L grade animals, similar to the past few weeks, but it is more difficult to get the 105p/lb, which was paid in recent weeks for stock as the margin between quotes and prices paid widened further each week. Prices for O grade are quoted at 280 cents/kg (100p/lb), with the wide margin over that harder to retain.
While prices being paid for cattle continued to strengthen weekly over the past month, the quoted prices remained static. With all of the increase since early February coming through the directly negotiated top-up, it is easier for the factories to reduce the cost of beef by clawing back on the (negotiable) top-up than reducing quotes.
They were beginning to feel the market over-heating and are expected to move quickly to reduce their costs if the increase in supply is maintained, which could see a more stable period of prices closer to current quotes - in effect, a lowering of return to producers.
The scale of supply over the next six weeks will be a critical factor in determining price.
Cattle on which the Special Beef Premia was applied for at the end of December are out of retention and beginning to move as producers take advantage of the strong prices. These animals are expected to continue to add to the supply over the coming weeks, which will help reduce pressure on the processors."

Prices have eased between €50/head and €170/head, according to the sales figures from the marts for trading this week, while the official Department of Agriculture figures compiled at three representative marts in the country are showing a drop of about €65 per 100kg in prices, compared to the same time last year.
Holding up best are the continental breed beef animals, the best of which are showing only a marginal drop in price, with demand holding strong and plenty of competition for available supplies at all of the sales.
The quality Hereford and Angus males are also holding a firm trade, but prices have eased back 5-10% on 2004.
The biggest price impact within the beef breeds is being experienced by the plainer animals, some of which are estimated to be back by up to €150-€170/head on last year’s prices and, in exceptional cases, these are showing a decline of €200/head.
Substantially cheaper also are the dairy breed bulls, particularly in the intensive dairying areas of the country, where a high percentage of them are bred from sires with very strong dairy merit and weak on beefing qualities.
At the lower end of the scale, some of these animals are suffering badly from the support of the premia and edging towards €1/kg.
Figures show that beef breed bull weanlings under 300 kg average €2/kg and dairy breed bull weanlings of the same weight range average €1.50/kg, both back up to €60/100kg on the same weeks in 2004."

The biggest price impact within the beef breeds is being experienced by the plainer animals, some of which are estimated to be back by up to €150-€170/head on last year’s prices and, in exceptional cases, these are showing a decline of €200/head.
Substantially cheaper also are the dairy breed bulls, particularly in the intensive dairying areas of the country, where a high percentage of them are bred from sires with very strong dairy merit and weak on beefing qualities.
At the lower end of the scale, some of these animals are suffering badly from the support of the premia and edging towards €1/kg.
Figures show that beef breed bull weanlings under 300 kg average €2/kg and dairy breed bull weanlings of the same weight range average €1.50/kg, both back up to €60/100kg on the same weeks in 2004."

The other main banks are likely to follow, but only because of severe pressure and a worsening security situation, reflected by last Monday’s “tiger kidnapping”.
Dublin security guard Paul Richardson was forced to drive his security van to a gang of raiders who were holding his wife and two children hostage. The gang got away with 2m.
“The banks have been brought kicking and screaming to make this decision,” said one security source.
“The banks are so competitive and want to extract every single euro for their shareholders, that they didn’t want to spend money to alter security systems.”
The source criticised the “ponderous” decision-making process between the banks.
This is despite regular meetings set up last October between the Irish Bankers Federation, the gardaí and the security companies, in order to improve security.
The banks came under serious pressure last year to alter security following a significant upsurge in cash in transit robberies.
By the end of the first quarter of last year, there were 23 such robberies compared to 15 the previous year.
Halfway through the year, the figure stood at 38 compared to 33 and by year’s end there had been 62 such heists, compared to 54 in 2003.
The two main security companies, Securicor and Brinks, were heavily hit by the armed raids, with worsening morale among staff.
Brinks workers took industrial action, which almost brought the company to its knees. “The banks had been used to playing the security companies off against each other over the years, to get the lowest price,” said one source.
“It was only when people started getting shot that the banks suddenly realised it could impact on them and their customers.”
Senior gardaí in charge of escorts also put serious pressure on the banks to change the delivery system.
AIB is the first bank to move. Serviced by both Securicor and Brinks, AIB was the bank worst-hit last year by the robberies.
Securicor is understood to have won the contract. AIB is adopting an end to end system call “fluidity,” expected to be in place by early to mid-summer.
Under the system, the cash is preloaded into secure cassettes, which are held in vaults in delivery vans. On reaching an ATM staff lift the cassette out and slot it straight into the ATM.
“The cash can’t be accessed in between. If it is hampered with, dye covers the cash,” said a source.
Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will follow and are in the process of tendering for contracts. An AIB spokesman said they did not comment on security matters."

She said she is committed to further easing the conditions of entry to the Egyptian market so that shipments in commercial quantities can continue this year.
She has already secured the agreement of EU Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel to the retention of the special export refund for Egypt.
ICMSA president Pat O’Rourke said every effort must now be made towards a restoration of Ireland’s beef and live trade to Egypt to the kind of levels achieved ten years ago.
He said that Ireland can provide Egyptian customers with the assurances necessary to ensure that this very valuable trade is resumed.
The Egyptian market was worth €150 million to the Irish beef sector in 1999, taking over 110,000 tonnes. The live export trade - at its peak in 1994 - took 255,000 head of cattle from Ireland. This trade ceased in 1997.
Mr O’Rourke said a reopening of these markets would represent a very considerable benefit to Irish farmers.
“In particular, ICMSA believes that the live export trade for cattle could play a hugely important role in supporting beef prices during the autumn period,” he added."

The national average for R4L bullocks last week was 292 cent/kg (104.4p/lb) with the average paid for R4L heifers almost identical, while the average for O4L bullocks and heifers was 101.7p/lb for bullocks and 101.4p/lb for heifers.
Donegal Meats Products paid an average of over 106p/lb for R4L bullocks with AIBP at Clones; Exel at Kilbeggan; Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare; Euro Farm Foods at Duleek and Kepak at Clonee all paying between 105.1p/lb and 105p/lb average. At AIBP Group, R4L bullocks cost an average of almost 1p/lb less at Waterford and 0.5p/lb less at Nenagh.
Prices were steady at Bandon (102.7p/lb); Rathkeale (104.3p/lb) and Cahir (103.2p/lb). At the Dawn Group, the average was slightly weaker at Rathdowney (103.6p/lb) and unchanged at Waterford and Charleville.
The highest factory average for O4L bullocks was 104p/lb at Jennings of Ballinrobe.
Kepak at Clonee paid over 107p/lb average for R4L heifers and Donegal Meats Products paid an average of 105.8p/lb. Dawn Meats, Ballaghadereen; Exel; Kilbeggan; Jennings of Ballinrobe; Meadow Meats, Rathdowney, and Kildare Chilling each paid an average of 105.2p/lb. The top price for O4L heifers was 105p/lb at Jennings. Euro Farm Foods at Duleek set a record for cows when they paid an average of almost 97p/lb for R3 grade."

Except for the plainer type of cattle there is no indication of an easing in the market to take account of the loss of the premia payments and producers of store animals must be feeling relieved that their fear of a drop in the price of store cattle this Spring has not materialised.
Up to €450 over €/kg was paid for forward store bullocks - over 500kg - at Blessington yesterday where the store bullocks were up €20/head and heifers showed an improvement of up to €30/head, making up to €320 over €/kg for animals over 400kg with plenty of demand for a larger entry.
There was a substantial increase in cattle on offer at Bandon Mart where the trade for bullocks was excellent, with heavy bullocks making up to €350 over and lighter lots ranging €220-€400 over €/kg, but interest in heifers was quieter than last week with prices topping at €250 over. Hereford and Angus heifers ranged €150-€210 over.
There was almost 1,300 head on offer at Kilkenny yesterday with the sale showing an all-round improvement of €10/head. The heavy bullocks made up to €440 over with bullocks in the 400-500kg range selling at €300-€390 over. A lot of four Charolais (574kg) sold for €1,015, a lot of three Charolais (525kg) made €955, and a Simmental (796kg) made a handsome €1,285 in the beef section.
Up to €420 over was paid for beef heifers."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10094353.html,2005-04-07 01:00:00,Shortage of beef animals underpins prices,"Although the supply of bullocks to the factories last week was up 500 head on the previous week - at 15,774 head - throughput was down 1,000 head on the same week last year, and aided by good export demand for beef for restocking post-Easter led to a tight supply situation at the processors to the benefit of producers.
The group average for R4L bullocks at AIBP was up 0.5p/lb with individual factory averages showing a gain of 1p/lb at Nenagh - where an average of 105p/lb was paid - and at Bandon - average 103.6p/lb - and slightly less at Cahir where the average was a whisker under 104p/lb.
Gains were also achieved at Dawn Meats where the group average increased by 0.5p/lb, with the average at Meadow Meats, Rathdowney, up by 0.8p/lb at 104.4p/lb, and Waterford (105p/lb) and Midleton (104p/lb) higher by over 0.5p/lb.
The national average for R4L bullocks was 104.5p/lb with a top price of 106.7p/lb paid by Donegal Meat Products and Exel at Kilbeggan, Newgrange at Navan, Euro Foods at Duleek, and AIBP at Clones, all paying averages just under 106p/lb. The national average for O4L was 102p/lb.
Heifer prices edged slightly ahead of the bullocks with a national average of 105p/lb for R4L. Kepak at Clonee were tops at an average of 107.7p/lb with Donegal Meats and Dawn at Ballaghadereen paying over 106p/lb average. The average for O4L heifers was just under 102p/lb. The cull cow prices were well back on the record 97p/lb peak of previous weeks at a top price of 91p/lb average for R4 at Liffeys of Ballyjames-duff and O4 at Euro Farm Foods at Duleek. The best factory average for P grade was 87p/lb at Euro Farm Foods with Exel Meats and Liffeys paying just a shade less."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10129285.html,2005-04-07 01:00:00,Producers still hold cattle trade aces,"Generally, the base line quote for beef has remained at 286 cent/kg (102p/lb), with a few factories having adjusted quoted prices downwards to 283 and back to 277 cent/kg (101p-99p/lb) for R4L grade. However, all factories are finding it impossible to buy cattle at these prices, and most producers are getting close to 291 cent/kg (104p/lb), and there is still a bit of 291 to 294 cent/kg (104p or 105p) being paid at the top end of the market, particularly for good quality cattle, or where the supply remains very tight.
The significant feature of the prices being paid is that the price variation between grades exists only in name, and aherence to the Meat Industry Ireland price grid is indiscernible in the pay sheets from the factories.
This pricing system was never accepted by producers, who currently hold the aces, in the form of under-supply of cattle, leaving them in a strong position to reject use of the price grid.
Some factories which had adhered closely to the grid pricing range have been jolted off track in recent weeks.
It would be folly however to think that the price grid has gone away.
It will certainly come back into play when supplies build up, and could inflict suffering on producers next autumn, when the factories will hold the aces.
Following on from the recent dip in supplies of cattle to the factories, partly due to shorter working weeks, numbers are now on the increase. The bullock kill last week was up 1,500 head, at 16,774 head, out of a total kill of 31,228 head, and supplies are holding up this week.
On the market side, the post-Easter trade is quiet. In Britain, the market was quieter over the past week, but prices are just holding.
France is reported to be relatively quiet, Italy slightly improved, the trade disappointing in the Netherlands and steady in Germany.
The trade for cull cows continues to be a flyer, with the best of the heavy R grade cows making up to 268 cent/kg (96p/lb) and a top of 252 cent/kg (90p/lb) being achieved for heavy O grade carcasses.
The high prices have brought out more cows in recent weeks, with supplies now on a par with the same weeks last year, although year to date throughput remains 13% down on 2004."

First quarter 2005 results for bullocks compared to the same period in 2004 show a drop in R Grade from 48.6% of the kill to 43.5% with a corresponding increase in the scale of O Grade animals up from 38% of the kill to over 42%. The average weight of bullocks increased from 329kg to 347kg.
There was also an increase in P Grade animals from 5.9% to 6.6%.
There was also a similar deterioration in the grading returns for heifers during the first quarter of this year. The percentage of R Grade heifers in the kill dropped from 61.4% to 58.5%, while O Grades increased from 28% to 30.5% and P Grade animals was up from 1.7% to 1.9%. Carcase weights also increased for the heifers from an average of 269kg to over 284kg.
In real terms over 10% more bullocks failed to make R Grade and there was a slightly lower slippage of heifers into the lower grade. The increase in O and P Grade animals has meant lower returns to producers and if the new grid system had been rigidly adhered to would have resulted in a significant reduction in prices paid. The ICSA estimated that the drop in grades has cost producers €500,000 for the three months.
The results have also brought renewed calls for a review of the calibration of the mechanical graders at the factories by the Department of Agriculture in line with commitments given on monitoring when they were introduced."

Bord Bia says that production of beef and veal within the EU increased by 1% last year, but the projections for 2005 are for a reduction of 2.5%. Production in Germany is expected to fall by nearly 7%. Britain is expected to be down by over 3% - if the over 30 months ban is not lifted during the final quarter of the year - and lower production is also forecast for Italy, France, Spain, Holland and Ireland. Portugal is the only country in which an increase in production is expected. After showing increases in 2003 and 2004, consumption of beef within the EU is expected to stabilise at its current level, which is about 90,000 tonnes higher than pre-BSE levels, which leaves EU self-sufficiency in beef at 95%.
The increase in the beef deficit is being largely filled from South America, which supplied 86% of the deficit in 2004 with a sizeable percentage of the exports into the EU paying full duty.
It remains a serious concern for producers within the EU that imports from South America are taking up an increasing share of the market, with supplies selling very competitively after paying full EU duty, which is set to maintain pressure on prices for beef produced within the EU.
Exports of beef from the EU have lost 60% of the trade they had seven years ago. Of beef exports in 2004, Russia accounted for 56% of purchases and Lebanon a further 12%."

R4L heifer prices peaked at over 108p/lb partly due to premium beef in the kill while the national average was 105.6p/lb. Cow prices eased slightly to a top of 93.6p/lb for R4.
Bullock prices being paid in the south of the country continue to trail the prices being secured in the midlands and northern regions with only one factory in the south of the country in the top dozen factories for R4L bullocks last week, with some of the southern based plants buying R4L bullocks at an average of just over 103p/lb.
The leaderboard was dominated by Donegal Meats paying an average of 107.7p/lb, AIBP at Clones and Kepak at Clonee paying 106.5p/lb, Newgrange Meats on an average of 106.3p/lb, Euro Farm Foods at Duleek and Exel at Kilbeggan on 106.1p/lb.
The average for O4L bullocks was 102p/lb. - unchanged from the previous week.
Kepak at Clonee paid the top price of 108.5p/lb for R4L heifers last week, but the kill included some stock from the contract club producers at a premium to the base price. Donegal Meats paid 107.7p/lb and just under 107p/lb average were Jennings of Ballinrobe, Liffeys of Ballyjamesduff and AIBP at Clones. AIBP at Nenagh and Exel at Kilbeggan paid an average of 106.2p/lb. The national average for O4L heifers was 102.7p/lb.
The factory kill last week was slightly down at a total of 28,870 head, of which bullocks accounted for 15,244 head, compared to 15,686 head in the kill of the previous week."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10035996.html,2005-04-22 01:00:00,Trade for store cattle quiet,"Prices for all type of stores were back by up to €20/head with plain animals showing a slightly higher drop in weaker demand with fewer farmers and stud farm agents buying cattle.
But there were few bargains going at the sales with the quality cattle in particular continuing to sell for up to €500 over €/kg for forward bullocks and up to €360 paid for the tops of the heavy heifers.
There was a bigger sale of bullocks at Bandon Mart, where prices were maintained close to last week with heavy bullocks ranging €250-€370 over, while lighter lots sold back to €220 over and Friesians selling back to €100 over.
The heifer trade was a little quieter, except for the exceptional lots. The best of the continental heifers ranged up to €340 over - Angus and Hereford ranging €130-€210 over.
There were fewer farmers and stud farm buyers at Ennis where quality bullocks were maintained at last week prices, but plainer cattle were back up to €15/head.
Nevertheless some exceptional prices were paid for bullocks. Top of the sale was a 620kg Limousin sold for €1,400 and a Charolais weighing 654kg sold for €1,280 and a Belgian Blue weighing 630kg which sold for €1,160. More general prices for bullocks ranged €220 over to €450 over €/kg. Heifer prices ranged €200-€380 over.
There were over 1,400 head on offer at Kilkenny where all cattle were back up to €20/head. Heavy bullocks ranged €280-€480 over, medium weights ranged €280-€430 over. Beef heifers made €250-€350 over and store heifers made €200-€320 over €/kg. There was a good trade at Blessington. Heavy bullocks made up to €450 over and beef heifers up to €360 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10031476.html,2005-04-28 01:00:00,Supply keeps beef prices steady,"Resistance by producers to accepting any cut in the prices on offer at the factories, together with the tight balance between supply and demand, has ensured the base is maintained on cattle prices, with the trade going through a very stable period. Most of the factories are paying up to 294 cents/kg (105p/lb) in the upper region of the country, while prices in some areas of the south are at least 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) less on average at individual factories where supplies of cattle are more plentiful.
The weekly kill is now around on par with the corresponding weeks last year - and holding steady at that level in recent weeks - while for the year to date there is a substantial deficit on the same period in 2004. Figures for the first quarter show that cattle supplies to the factories declined by 70,000 head, with the supply of bullocks down by 36,000 head and heifers back by 25,000 head.
The intake of cull cows was down by 12,000 head while the supply of young bulls showed an increase. Given that there was a carry over of stock from the final quarter of last year into 2005, and the kill to date at the factories, the assumption that the stock levels on farms is higher than last year is reasonable, but opinion is divided as to whether the higher numbers are made up of cattle likely to go on to the grass for a few months or finished cattle for sale over the next month.
In the marts calf prices were back at some of the sales this week, while others reported a stronger trade at improved prices. There were fewer farmers in attendance at Bandon on Monday where the 950 calves on offer met a quieter trade.
At Kilmallock Mart on Monday there was a firmer calf trade with prices improved by €20-€30/head. Prices for plain stores eased a little at some of the sales over the past week, but the quality animals continued to make very strong prices ranging €350-€500 over e/kg for the medium weight continental bullocks which are making at least as much as this time last year and in some cases a bit more.
The continental store heifers are making €200-€360 over €/kg. At Dungarvan Mart on Monday there was an improved trade for all types of cattle with numbers on offers beginning to ease off, while Kilmallock had a bigger sale of cattle with a firm trade all round."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10089720.html,2005-04-28 01:00:00,Average prices remain stable at marts,"On a regional basis stronger prices continued to be achieved in the upper half of the country with a difference of 3-6c/kg (1p-2p/lb) in the returns being achieved for similar grade animals - a price difference which has also remained stable over the past two weeks.
A slight tightening in the supply of bullocks to the factories last week helped to underpin the prices. Processors are reluctant to concede higher prices and producers resist any cut.
The average for R4L bullocks was 105p/lb for last week with similar grade heifers making an average of 105.6p/lb. Donegal Meats paid the highest factory average for bullocks at 107.7p/lb, followed by Euro Farm Foods, Newgrange Meats, Jennings, and AIBP (Clones) all paying between 106p/lb and 106.5p/lb.
With the exception of the factory at Clones, all AIBP centres paid averages less than the national average (105p/lb) with the lowest price in the group a shade under 104p/lb average for R4L bullocks at Bandon.
Dawn Group and Kepak Group both paid averages of just under 105p/lb. The national average for O4L bullocks was 102.4p/lb.
Heifer prices were largely similar to the bullocks at a national average of 105.6p/lb for R4L, but the bonus for premium price stock at Kepak, Clonee pushed the average for the factory to 109p/lb.
Cow prices showed gains of a few cent with a top price of 95p/lb for R4H grade at Euro Farm Foods, Duleek. Dan Meats, Ballyhaunis paid 91p/lb for O5 and Dawn and Euro were neck in neck at the top for P grade at an average of 89p/lb for P+4."

As a result, the latest phase of homes at this development come to market with 1,800 and 1,900 sq ft of usable living space; it is another reason to celebrate the scrapping of the house-buyers grant, which arbitrarily capped many Irish homes at about 1,300 sq ft.
These homes come up for sale with price tags of €270,000 to €290,000, depending on locations and options are corner, semi detached and some are mid-terrace, and the price per square foot works out at about €150 - compared to around €190 psf for smaller 1,100 sq ft semis selling locally for €240/€255,000, says Michael O’Donovan of Sherry FitzGerald O’Donovan.

It sold for $24,675 €19,200 at an auction featuring dozens of items salvaged from the doomed luxury liner in Massachusetts.
Ms Keane had emigrated to Pennsylvania and was returning to the US on the Titanic's maiden voyage after a four-month visit to see her mother in Castle Connell, Co Limerick.
The watch had been given to her as a good luck gift but was damaged as her lifeboat passed under the ship's pump discharge.

No other information was available about Ms Keane. The items belonged to a British private collector and both buyer and seller wished to remain anonymous.

He said: “Milk prices have dropped from 105.2p per gallon in 1995 to 95.3p in 2004. Input costs have all increased over the same period. The wages for hired labour have increased by more than 60% over the same period.
“The other main enterprise on Clare farms, beef production, has also taken a price drop of 16% over the same period, while expenses continue to rise. Fewer and fewer farmers are now staying on full time”, he said.
“In the news recently, Gama workers’ rate of pay, coupled with their 80 hour week on the Ennis by-pass, was seen by society as exploitation. Compare this to the figures from Teagasc and the Central Statistics Office, which show average farm family income for full-time farmers at E19,200, the average industrial wage at E28,300, and the average public service earnings at E41,000.
“Farmers work long hours, it’s a seven-day week job, but we are told they are content with their lifestyle, when compared to urban counterparts. So it is acceptable to exploit one sector of society, the sector that provides us with cheap quality food.”
He predicted a bleak future for farming in Co Clare if the present trend in farm incomes continues.
He said, “Minimum wages will not encourage any young farmer into farming. If farming as an occupation is to continue, it has to compete favourably with other career choices for young people. Society has a choice, are we as farmers going to be included in Ireland’s upward income movement? As food producers and caretakers of our environment, we believe we are just as important to Irish society as any other sector, and this should be reflected in the way we are remunerated for our endeavours.”
Warnings of the demise of dairy farming are significant in Co Clare, where more than 60% of the farms are under 30 hectares, and milk production has traditionally been relied upon to provide a reasonable income."

Liquid milk producers too have been forced to battle for their income. Beet growers have only recently ended a stand-off with the Sugar Company. In each enterprise farmers were asked to accept less pay for more work.
They were reluctantly forced into conflict situations with processors, their partners in the business, with whom there should be a healthy working relationship, in a perfect world.
For most of the commodities they produce, farmers are struggling to get the prices they were paid several years ago.
For manufacturing milk they are being paid 10% less than they were a decade ago.
Those who process farm produce have seen their incomes increase considerably, to compensate them for cost of living increases. The cost of living increased at the same rate for farm families but their incomes have fallen. Over the past 10 years, the slump in ""real income"" from farming has been masked by the extent to which farmers and their wives availed of off-farm income opportunity. Now three out of every four farmers have another source of income, which is usually increasing while the farming income continues to decline. And every few months, farmers have to go into battle with the processors to preserve incomes which are mostly only a fraction of the average public service wage."

While the quality medium weight bullocks and heifers are showing a drop of 10-30/head, plainer cattle and particularly those with poorer grading potential have slipped 50-70/head over the past 10 days.
The trend in cattle numbers at the marts varied, but the common factor was a tougher trade and lower prices.
There was a big increase in the numbers on offer at Bandon mart, where trade, with the exception of cull cows, was quieter for all types and bullocks making more than 300 over /kg were the exception. The heavy bullocks ranged 180-270 over, while lighter bullocks made up to 305 over and back to 90 over for Friesian type. The trade for heifers was noticeably quieter with just a couple of lots making up to 330 over and Hereford/Angus ranging 100-160 over.
There was a smaller sale of 510 head at Kilkenny, where prices for quality held up reasonably well, but plainer lots were back. Up to 420 over was paid for the heavy bullocks, with 400-500kg stores ranging 200-330 over. The trade for heifers was firm with beef heifers making 200-260 over and butchers heifers ranging 200-290 over while stores made 150-300 over.
There was 650 head on offer at Blessington, where prices for store bullocks were back, although quality continued to sell well at up to 420 over for heavy bullocks.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10044080.html,2005-05-12 01:00:00,Summer price trend established,"There is however a regional difference of up to 9 cents/kg (3p/lb), with cattle farmers in the northern half benefiting from the higher prices which are generally offered by the factories there.
One of the reasons for the difference is that the supply of cattle continues to be stronger in the south.
Also, because more beef animals in the south come from the dairy herds, they do not grade as well as the cattle throughput at factories in the northern half of the country. The top price for R grade animals this week is expected to continue at slightly over 296 cents/kg (106p/lb) which will be paid in the northern region, where most of the R grade animals will range from 294 to 296 cents/kg (105p to 106p/lb).
The price range changes gradually to the south, where quotes vary from 288 to 291 cents/kg (103p-104p/lb. Prices on offer for O grade cattle are ranging from 283 to -288 cents/kg (101p-103p/lb).
It is the third consecutive week for stable prices at the factories, and that looks like being the case towards the end of the month, although cattle booking reports from the factories point towards an increase in supply.
To date in 2005, the supply has been trailing 2004 by 15% for steers and 18% for heifers. There appears to be an increasing acceptance by the processors that farmers are not going to sell for less than the current prices, and a parallel understanding by the farmers that they are not going to get more out of the factories, presently at least. The deficit in supply year to date, relative to 2004, would suggest that more farmers have been targeting their cattle marketing at the May-June period, when prices peaked in 2004.
Unless there is a sharp drop off in supply is unlikely that farmers will get a price boost in May, and the current supply-demand balance is likely to continue to determine prices into early June.
It is a safe bet that any price improvement for the remainder of the summer trade will not be as dramatic as in 2004, and any increase achieved this year could be small."

Currently import tariffs are set in euros or dollars. For example, the EU import tariff for boneless forequarters of beef is €2.21/kg.
In future, this will be expressed as a percentage of the product price, and will then be slotted into a new formula (yet to be negotiated) to determine the level of cuts.
Part of the dispute in recent weeks revolved around what price level to use for each product line.
The EU had wanted a higher price, so that the percentage of tariff was actually lower and therefore had to be cut less.
Other countries, for example Brazil and Australia, had called for a lower set of prices.
The deal reached in Paris this week was a compromise between the two.
The next step will be for the WTO to issue a new draft paper outlining a formula for cutting the new ad valorem tariffs, as well as export subsidies and domestic farm supports.
This will be presented to trade ministers in China in July and is intended to form the basis of a final deal targeted for the meeting of all 147 WTO members in Hong Kong in December.

Prices for weanling bulls are also showing decline with the dairy breed bulls showing the biggest slip compared to last year.
Official figures on average prices being paid in this country, which have been supplied to the EU by the Department of Agriculture, show both dairy and beef calf prices are down by 28% on the corresponding week last year. According to the Department of Agriculture, beef breed bull calves cost an average of €234/head over the past week compared to €324/head the same week in 2004.
Dairy breed bull calves averaged €141/head compared to €95/head last year.
However a sample of prices from some of the principal sale centres for calves, indicate the good continental bull is retaining more than 90% of the 2004 price. The top continental bull calves are making 91% of last year’s price at Bandon and 92% at Kilmallock - two of the largest weekly sales of calves. Hereford bull calves are back about 10% at Bandon and slightly more at Kilmallock. Even the best of the Friesian bulls are the worst hit with prices at Bandon down 28% on last year and back almost 20% at Kilmallock.
In the weanling trade, the national average shows beef breed bulls have retained 86% of their 2004 price while the dairy breed animals have slipped to 72% of last year’s level."

But any restriction on the lowering of prices to the consumer will be more difficult to justify in the current environment.
Farming leaders have a difficult task ahead in establishing a sufficiently strong case for the retention of the order in its present format.
Over the years, the percentage of retail price which has been distributed beyond the farm gate has doubled for many farm products. The result has been that very little, if any, of the increase paid by the consumer has made its way back tofarmer producers of the raw material. There are some farm products for which today’s return to the farmers is less than it was a decade ago, although the consumer pays considerably more.
Farmers are rightly terrified that the lifting of the restriction on below-cost selling will result in a price war at retail level for market share, the effect of which will not be carried by either the retailers or the middle men, but paid for by farmer producers and thereby further lowering their returns.
There would be no justice if this was allowed to happen. But the farmers’ fears are justified from their experiences of who paid the real price for the supermarket battles on shelf prices in the past. Farmers also feel restricted in their ability to organise peaceful protest because of the powers of the Competition Authority. There is also the fear of a repetition of the costly court experience arising from the conflict with the beef factories. But the feeling on the ground is that they have had enough.
There is no crying wolf. These are real issues of challenge to farm incomes. Farmers will be driven to whatever measures are necessary to retain what they have, at least, and they will be looking for some form of protection from paying for a price war if the Groceries Order is lifted."

Quality store bullocks gained 20-30/head at Ennis Mart yesterday, with an improvement of E10/head at Kilkenny and maintained a good trade at Bandon and Blessington, all of which saw a drop in the numbers on offer.
The best of the heavy continental bullocks were an excellent trade at Ennis mart where up to E595 over /kg was paid for the tops. A Belgian Blue weighing 720kg sold for E1,315 and another at 722kg made E1,295. A 684kg Limousin x sold for E1,152 and a Charolais 674kg made E1,100. The heavy quality heifers made up to E370 over with plainer lots selling back to E170 over.
The cull cows ranged in price from E150 under /kg to E200 over weathering the worst of the drop in factory prices.
At Bandon Mart the heavy bullocks ranged E220-E340 over with the lighter stores making E170-360 and Friesians selling back to E70 over. There was no change in the heifer trade with the best of the continentals making up to E270 over /kg and Hereford and Angus ranging E90-E150 over.
There were over E500 head on offer at Kilkenny where the quality forward store bullocks were an improved trade at E290-E360 over and the medium weight were back 10/head on last week. They ranged E210-E360 over. There was strong demand for the beef heifers which made up to E400 over and back to E270 over.

They launched Terracelt, which aims to provide farmers, rural businesses and the general public with a host of services on a single site.
A joint project between the FUW and the ICSA, it has received a grant in excess of €500,000 from the EU’s Interreg fund.
Malcolm Thompson said www.terracelt.com will be the first internet stop for anyone wanting information on agriculture and rural issues.
“Terracelt will be the gateway to all things rural in Ireland and Wales. It will be a showcase for producers and will provide a wealth of information for the general public. With an increasingly urbanised society, it is important that the public understands and appreciates the role played by farmers in food production and the protection of the environment,” said Thompson.
Gareth Vaughan said members have come forward with a number of ideas in recent years about ways to improve farm incomes by diversifying and adding value to the food they produce.
“Members of several committees also made comments that the traditional relationship between farmers, shops and the consumer were changing.
“Consumers are becoming more sophisticated, not only demanding better quality but also greater traceability. They want to know exactly where their food has come from and under what conditions animals are kept.
“Some farmers have already seized the opportunities that new technology offers, by selling food direct to consumers via the internet.
“But, as internet use continues to grow, we believe the opportunity exists for very many more farmers to develop their businesses and add value to their produce in this way,” he said.
The Terracelt site will include video case studies of farmers who have successfully diversified in a variety of ways.
The hope is that other farmers will gain inspiration, and also diversify to improve farm incomes. Both presidents paid tribute to the EU Interreg fund, because the grant had enabled the brainchild of the ICSA and the FUW to become a reality.
Work on the site is already under way, and the finished project will be unveiled at the Royal Welsh Show in Wales during July, and at the National Ploughing Championships at Mogeely in East Cork at the end of September.
The site will include a market section, where farmers can sell their produce, such as lamb and beef, direct to the consumer over the net.
Farmers will also be able to sell goods and services, such as livestock, feed and machinery to their colleagues in the rural community. Video interviews with farmers who have successfully diversified their business will be featured. These will focus on the positive aspects of the business, and also highlight some of the pitfalls to be avoided by those who want to follow the same path.
Farmers who want to diversify will be able to access information and forms enabling them to apply for grant aid, where available.
Farm holidays will be promoted, as well as other tourism ventures undertaken by farmers, who will also be able to compare the prices they would get for their animals in Wales and Ireland.
A section will be devoted to employment opportunities, both permanent and seasonal, on both sides of the Irish Sea.
There will be an eating-out guide, featuring restaurants, cafes, hotels and pubs that serve Welsh and Irish produce.
A virtual farm computer game will be designed primarily to appeal to the younger generation.
There will also be a campaigns section, where matters of concern to farmers and the public can be discussed.
An extensive marketing campaign will be organised to coincide with the Terracelt site going on line later this summer.
Michelle Hurd, project manager with Tinopolis, the site developers, said Terracelt needs to be a true representation of the farming communities of Ireland and Wales. But at the same time it must reach out to the average consumer, to encourage them to use the facilities these farming enterprises offer.
“It is a demanding challenge that has been set to the designers involved, as we need to create a web portal which appeals and works for both target audiences.”
The name Terracelt is derived from terra - the Latin name for earth or land - and celt, an abbreviation of Celtic.
“Being a trilingual site - using English, Welsh and Irish - it was felt a name was needed that could be readily understood by people of all languages, and Terracelt fitted the bill,” said Gareth Vaughan.
Malcolm Thompson said: “This is a site that is rooted in the Celtic lands of Ireland and Wales, and has a logo that is both stylish and modern, reflecting contemporary life in both countries.”
The site logo incorporates abstract symbols of both countries. The ‘T’ includes an extended, highly stylised Welsh dragon wing, while the ‘C’ embraces an Irish shamrock.
It was flashed onto the big screens in the Millennium Stadium at last week’s reception, along with the logos of the ICSA and the FUW.
The farmers followed in illustrious footsteps, with the same screens hailing the British and Irish Lions and Argentina’s exciting draw previous night, before the former headed on their rugby tour to New Zealand."

Lamb imports from Ireland increased from 31,000 tonnes in 2003 to 33,000 tonnes in 2004. This accounts for over 60% of total Irish exports.

Meanwhile, the French market for Irish beef has progressed significantly this year and Bord Bia will intensify its promotional drive over the coming months. Due to a growing supply deficit, French beef imports increased by 20% on year previous levels with 24,000 tonnes sourced from Ireland.
Since autumn 2004, a number of French retail groups are beginning to list Irish beef, most notably in the recent contract signing between Liffey Meats and Intermarche.
This marked the first ever supply of a wholly Irish produced branded beef product to the retail shelf in France. Bord Bia is working with these groups to facilitate the increased distribution of Irish beef.
For the first two months of 2005, Irish beef exports to France at 5,000 tonnes have increased significantly. It is anticipated that Irish beef will grow its market share in 2005 to 28,000 tonnes."

Prices have been holding best in the east and north west. In the east, 292 cents/kg (104p/lb) is being quoted for R grade animals, with 280 cents/kg (100p/lb) on offer for O grade animals. In the midlands, the R and O grade mix is being quoted at 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) less, with farmers being offered 289 and back to 277 cents/kg.
For the lowest prices on offer this week, head south, where the quoted prices have been dropped to 286 and back as far as 274 (102p to -98p/lb) for R and O grade cattle.
The kill is still comprising largely of yard cattle, with some stock added off the grass. The larger finishing units, which held back supplies in the expectation of being paid a premium for beef at this point of the year - as in 2004 - are now off loading, and the extent of supply available to the factories is undermining prices.
However, all the signs that a repeat of the May and June 2004 scarcity of beef cattle was unlikely had been visible for some time, with the kill down 10 to 12% for the year to date, as more finishers targeted a later selling date.
The one certainty in the beef trade materialised - that the likelihood of the trade following the same pattern for two consecutive years is rare.
While prices for beef animals are coming under some pressure, prices on offer for cull cows are suffering the biggest blow, with further reductions inflicted by the factories this week.
The base line prices are back to 212 cents/kg (78p/lb) this week.
Higher prices are still being paid for the heavy quality carcasses, but the shine has gone off the trade, after an exceptionally high priced year to date. Supplies of cows to the factories have continued strong in recent weeks, with stronger prices encouraging a throughput 25% up on the same period last year."

Up to June, calf prices here averaged only €144 per head. In the first week of June, Irish beef calves averaged €220 and dairy calves averaged €158.
With demand for calves growing across Europe over recent years, boosted mainly by growth in the Dutch veal industry, exports in early June totalled more than 2,000 per week, compared to less than 1,700 a year ago.
In May, the average Irish calf price of €144 compared with €294 in France, €131 in Germany, €133 in Denmark, and €187 in the Netherlands.
The main destinations for Irish calves this year are the Netherlands, taking about 75%, and Spain, taking 25%.
Due to lower availability of strong calves, Spanish importers have turned to lighter and younger calves for their feedlots.
In the Netherlands, the number of veal calves finished has increased by more than 27% since 1990, while the country’s dairy herd declines, resulting in growing demand for live calf imports.
In 2004, the Netherlands imported 650,000 live calves."

The pressure on price came as the intake of bullocks exceeded the same week last year by more than 2,800 head at 11,847 head compared to 9,008 for the corresponding week in 2004. Factory averages for R4L bullocks varied between 106.8p/lb at Euro Farm Foods, Duleek, Co Meath, and at Donegal Meats and 102.3p/lb (all VAT inclusive) at AIBP at Cahir, Co Tipperary. There was no R4L bullock price reported for AIBP at Bandon, but the average paid for R3 bullocks was 101p/lb. In all, just over one in three of the factories paid an average of 105p/lb or better.
AIBP at Nenagh and Liffey Meats at Ballyjamesduff paid averages of 105.5p/lb, AIBP at Clones paying 105.4p/lb and Dawn Meats, Ballaghadereen, and Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare, on 105.2p/lb.
The average for O4L bullocks slipped to just over 101p/lb with a top price of 104p/lb at Jennings of Ballinrobe.
Prices for R4L heifers were broadly similar to the bullocks - 104.9p/lb. The average for O4L heifers was 101.5p/lb.
The drop in cull cow prices was reflected across the board. Euro Farm Foods continued to pay the highest price at an average of 92p/lb for R4 grade and over 86p/lb for O5 - Liffey Meats paying an average of over 85p/lb for P+4 grade. O grade dropped to an average of 77p/lb at some of the processors and P grade to an average of 70p/lb."

There was also an improved trade for heifers with the best continentals making up to €330 over. Hereford and Angus heifers ranged €150 to €230 over.
There was over 500 head on offer at Kilkenny where the bullocks in the 400 kg range were improved by up to €15/head, but the trade for heifers was easier by €10/head. Up to €400 over was paid for the heavy bullocks, forward stores making €290 to €370 over in general with a strong price of €990 paid for three 516 kg Charolais and 400 to 500 kg stores selling at €250 to €400.

“You just cannot take €95m out of the pockets of beef farmers without major repercussions on the rural economy,” he said.
Mr Naughten said 29,000 beef farmers will see their incomes reduced by up to 50% by the overshoot penalty. When costs such as bank interest rates and conacre are taken into account, many of these farmers will be left in the red with the banks.
“This penalty is completely unfair when you consider over 14,500 of the affected farmers have not increased the number of animals submitted for the premium,” he said.
IFA president John Dillon told the Committee that Minister Mary Coughlan and the Government must secure a solution to the cutbacks which would result in producers facing an average penalty of €3,925.
IFA Livestock chairman John Bryan said individual farmers are facing cuts ranging from €53 to €78 per animal, in many cases more than the net margin per animal. Some producers are facing real financial hardship as a result of these cuts.
As well as lobbying all TDs and Senators, he said the IFA will also discuss the issue with the EU Farm Commissioner Marian Fischer Boel when she visits Ireland next week."

Up to 289 cent/kg (103p/lb) was being quoted for R grade cattle at the factories yesterday, but a more general price ranged 286-280 cent/kg (102p-100p/lb) most of the prices having dropped three cent/kg (1p/lb). Prices offered for O grades are ranging 280-274c/kg (100p-98p/lb) although up to 286c/kg (102p/lb) is being secured in deals with some of the factories.
Prices are being undermined by the strong supplies. The margin of intake over 2004 has now risen to more than 5,000 head per week, the result of too many finishers holding back cattle targeting a June sale to get higher prices, which has weakened the ability of producers to resist the early cuts.
The number of yard cattle available to the factories has risen and is damaging to the trade in the south where a phasing of acceptance of cattle from large suppliers has been triggered.

It is believed the ending of the cattle census has resulted in animals being retained longer on farms into heavier weights, but the processors are now saying the carcasses over 400kgs are not meeting with favour at the retail level in the super chains.
“The prime cuts coming off the very heavy continental animals are too large for the standard meat trays for the supermarket pre-packed consumer packs of beef and the supermarkets don’t want them,” one procurement manager explained.
Some of the processors are finding the marketing of these animals more of a problem than others, dependent on their particular market outlets, but all processors are agreed the mean carcass weight has increased, with the rise more noticeable over the past month.
Official figures for the national kill for the first quarter of the year showed that the average carcass weight for bullocks increased to 346kgs - up from 328kgs for the same period in 2004 - an increase of 5.4%. The national carcass weight average for heifers increased by 5.5% from 269kgs to 284kgs.
Figures for the second quarter are expected to show a bigger increase in average weights when they become available next month.
The factories are urging producers to market bullocks before they become overweight."

Irish prices to producers, which so far this year have closely marked prices in the North and Britain, have slipped to between 10c/kg (4p/lb) and 20c/kg (8p/lb) under the going returns in the North and Britain, as Irish finishers take their lowest year to date return for cattle.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10087893.html,2005-06-28 01:00:00,Meat and milk intake to increase annually,"Delegates were told that consumption in the developing world will increase by 3% per year between now and 2020. In contrast, annual consumption of meat and milk in developed nations will grow at less than 1% in the same period.
Christopher Delgado, of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, said the explosion in consumption in the developing world is being driven by billions of people diversifying primarily starch-based diets into small amounts of milk and meat.
“By 2020, annual demand for meat in developing countries will be over 70 million tonnes higher than today and annual demand for milk will be more than 150 million tonnes higher,” he said.
Mr Delgado said while the growth in consumption will be spread throughout the developing world, China, India and Brazil, because of their size, will continue to increase their dominance of world food markets for livestock products.
“In 2020, China will account for one-third of world meat consumption while India will consume 20% of the world’s milk and milk products.
Mr Delgado said an additional 60 million steers will be required by 2020 to meet the increased demand for beef in developing countries. Increased demand for mutton will require an additional 200 million sheep while 30 million more dairy cows will be needed to satisfy the extra demand for milk and milk products.
He said that meat and milk production increases in developing countries will largely match the big consumption increases. However, he projected that meat exports from Latin America to Asia will soar.
Mr Delgado said world production of cereals is projected to increase by 300 million tonnes.
Developing countries will continue to be massive importers of cereals for animal feed and will have a net import requirement of 200 million tonnes per year by 2020.
He predicted that world prices for feed grains in 2020 will be at the same level, in real terms, as the average of recent years. Meat prices will fall by around 3% and milk prices will fall by 8%.
Mr Delgado stressed that the price falls would be substantially higher without the ‘livestock revolution’.

As for land prices, Brazil is one of the few countries with its own word for the grabbing of land by fraud and violence, the “grilagem” which has enabled the “grileiros”, the loggers, ranchers and businessmen backed by private militias and gunmen, to get nearly half of the country’s land into the hands of just 1% of the population.
They will be the new competitors for Irish farmers, in our economy with a €7.65 per hour minimum wage, and an average farmland price of €18,442 per hectare, one of the highest in Europe. Irish farmers are still making money from farming, as more and more non-EU agricultural produce is allowed in, thanks to the Common Agricultural Policy, which costs Brussels about €45 billion per year, or 40% of the EU budget.
If the EU doesn’t pay to keep people on the land national governments would have to do it, or else abandon farmers who cannot compete with competitors in less developed economies, who are mostly unfettered by environmental and other laws.
Developed countries spend a total of about €215 billion per year to provide some economic certainty for their farmers, and ensure domestic production of some agricultural goods.
However, in the same week that the sugar industry is mothballed by Brussels, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair wants to dip into the Common Agricultural Policy in return for ending the UK’s 21 year old EU “reduced EU membership fee” rebate.
At present the European Commission has tried to revive the EU budget negotiations which Blair vetoes by putting a 4% cut in all those CAP cheques from Brussels on the table.
That would come on top of the 8% cuts agreed as part of the new Single Payment system of getting financial support from Brussels to farmers.
Meanwhile, Irish dairy farmers have seen their milk prices cut by 40% since 2001, as Brussels pulls back their share of CAP support, leaving farmers here with the same milk price they got in 1988.
Cattle farmers are making small profits from the marketplace, because EU consumers are eating 380,000 tonnes more beef than can be produced in the EU. But about three quarters of their income comes in the threatened Single Payment cheque from the EU, rather than the beef factory.
Farmers are suffering as Brussels brings the EU in line with World Trade Organisation rules on fair world trade in farm products, tries to make the EU farm and food industries more competitive, and absorbs farmers in the new member countries.
Unfortunately, the high costs of doing farm business in Ireland leave farmers here in a particularly vulnerable position.
Farmers in Sweden, for example, can buy up farmland for about one-sixth of the Irish price, and thus expand production, to become more competitive.
Farmers here can’t do that, but are still suffering EU cutbacks. They could do a “state of the nation” appraisal of their worrying situation, from Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan.
She was all positive recently in highlighting agri-food’s 9% of gross domestic product and employment, and more than 8% of exports.
She also pointed out that an annual cheque from the EU for €1.6 billion makes up 74% of the Irish farmer’s wages.
Can Irish farmers continue to depend on that cheque?
Should they take advantage of one of the highest farmland prices in the EU, which prevents farm expansion here, by selling out, or borrowing against this grossly inflated asset, and investing outside of farming?
As soon as the EU budget negotiation and sugar reform dust settles, Minister Coughlan must spell out how farmers can best continue their contribution to their economy."

Numbers of cattle on offer were broadly similar to last week, but there was certainly less optimism about the future of the trade among the buyers at the ring sides as prices experienced the largest single day decline in several months.
Numbers of cattle on offer at Bandon mart were similar to last week. The exception of the day prices held reasonably on par with last week except for the plain cattle which were easier. The heavy store bullocks ranged €190 to €350 over, the lighter lots making €160 - €300 over and Friesians ranging €100 - €170 over. There was a good trade for heifers at prices ranging up to €55 over for the quality heavy heifers.
There was over 700 head on offer at Kilkenny Mart where beef bullocks were back by up to €35/head and stores lost up to €20/head. The heavy beef bullocks ranged up to €300 over for top quality. Forward stores maintained prices better, selling at €240 - €390 over - a lot of 10 477kg Charolais sold for €865 and a lot of six Charolais weighing 469kg made €825 and a Limousin 460kg sold for €790. Beef heifers made up to €340 over and stores up to €220 over.
All bullock prices were back at Ennis Mart where there was a bigger sale this week. Prices for beef and forward cattle dropped by up to €35/head, with the lighter stores not feeling the effect of the downward pressure as much. The trade for heifers was slightly easier than last week with the tops making up to €330 over.
At Blessington Mart prices for bullocks and heifers were all back by up to €30/head."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10046148.html,2005-07-12 01:00:00,Sharp fall in beef prices,"At its peak it appeared that prices at the factories were falling by the hour as panic set in among suppliers who were experiencing difficulty in getting cattle booked into the factories and some described it as a collapse of the trade.
Most of the factories opened trading yesterday with offers of 271-257 cents/kg (97p-92p/lb), for R/O grade animals, a drop of up to 12 cents/kg (4p/lb) on week earlier quotes. But so strong was the supply of stock, relative to reduced intake requirements, that some factories were buying cattle for today's kill at a further reduction of 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) in the afternoon, paying 266-252 cents/kg (95p-90p/lb) and were refusing to underpin the price forward.
For producers it was a disastrous day, with up to 18 cents/kg (6p/lb) being wiped off prices the worst ever reduction in beef prices in a single day.
The strong supply of cattle over recent weeks and a weakening in beef export markets has fuelled the collapse in prices. Panic by producers to sell, fearful of further reduction has added to the downturn when more orderly marketing would have served interests better.
Although prices have slipped, proBritain are receiving 5p-8p/lb more than Irish producers, who are now faced with a difficult task to secure recovery.
Cull cow prices have eased slightly this week. Supplies continue plentiful and base prices are ranging 190-196 cents/kg (68p-70p/lb) but there is up to 15p/lb more to be got for the good heavy cows.

The IFA livestock leader warned factories the cuts could have serious consequences for production trends as the new decoupling era nears.
Mr Bryan said there is a responsibility on all the decisionmakers in the beef sector to stabilise cattle prices.
He said this includes factories, the Minister for Agriculture, the EU Commission and farmers.
“There is a major responsibility on the factories to stabilise beef prices at this time,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10107169.html,2005-07-15 01:00:00,Store trade under pressure,"Following the pressure on beef prices, the trade for store cattle is also experiencing the worst week's trading in a long time as cautious buyers revised downwards the maximum they were prepared to pay for cattle.
Lower prices are being reported for all types of cattle, with up to 70/head of a reduction for plainer cattle, which have been the worst effected as poor quality Friesians dropped close to 1/kg and in a change to the regular pattern some lots went home unsold yesterday.
There was a tougher trade at Bandon, Kilkenny and Ennis Marts where the trend was the same with lower prices all round as buyers confidence has been shaken by the sharp downturn in beef prices.
There was a slightly larger sale of cattle at Bandon where there was an easier trade. The best of the continental bullocks made up to E300 over, but prices such as E900 for a 645kg Charolais or E765 for a lot of two Charolais weighing 500kg more typical of the top of the sale.
There were some quality heifers on offer which sold well at prices up to E217 over four Charolais weighing 493kgs made E710.
There was a smaller sale at Mountrath with more farmers concentrating on farm work in the good weather. Prices were back by up to E50/head with the quality continental bullocks making up to E320 over and stores topping at E270 over. Heifers ranged E120 to E250 over.
At Cahir Mart there was a quieter all round trade. Forward and medium weigh bullocks ranged E130 E260 over and heavy heifers made E120 E185 over.

Racetrack officials beamed at a boost in numbers about 30,000, definitely up on Monday last year and politicians were happy to be anywhere but the Dáil.
All present and accounted for were the old reliables, Sports Minister John O'Donoghue, former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds (his 38th time out), and a gaggle of Fine Gaelers, seeking out a Burlington Bertie (to the uninitiated a bet of 100/30), roughly the type of odds useless to a party with no hope of winning the next election.
Bertie himself was spotted about town and should grace Ballybrit today.
Rumour has it he's under pressure to boost the profile of the Ballybrit Suite, in the face of a rival Fianna Fáil grassroots gig in the Radisson.
For those who subscribe to the Scrooge complex and still have their Confirmation money, I may have found the ligger's loophole to the Galway Races. It would appear if you drive to the grounds (even earlier than the bird who catches the worm) you may find yourself trackside for the sum of €2. This is because 20 entry tickets are not checked at the entry to the car park. Bear in mind this will only get your car close to the rails and not into any of the carnival craziness on the right side of the tracks.
Ballybrit is for punters with a penchant for parting with cash, of which festival organisers seem well aware.
Prices are up on last year, 50 cent extra for the highly sought-after hot beef rolls, up from €7 in 2004, race cards up from €2 to €3 and other subtle little earners for those shrewd enough to set up their stall.
Hoteliers are similarly in clover, with John Concannon, chief executive of Ireland West Tourism quoting slim odds on finding any accommodation Galway-side of Lough Rea.
Amid all the money and madness, however, there was one sobering moment yesterday. When jockey John Allen rode out on Blue Corrig in the third race, a black armband darkening his yellow sleeve, the hurly burly became a hush.
A murmur of ""Dick Forristal's horse"" swept around the grounds and for a couple of minutes the crowd remembered the man who was brutally slain at his home last week.
Afterwards, trainer Joseph Crowley, a lifelong friend of the murdered man, could not hide his emotion when the horse came third.
""It was entered in the race so we decided to run tonight. He ran well but it was just too much to hope that he would win,"" he said.
He may not have won, but his presence was an appropriate tribute to the man who devoted his time to producing fine horses."

South American beef is widely blamed for the unprecedented summer beef price slump hitting farmers in Ireland and the UK. But the UK’s leading meat processor has downplayed its role.
Anglo Beef Producers, the UK subsidiary of Larry Goodman’s Irish Food Processors trading company, says ABP is packing some South American beef, but only a small proportion of the firm’s throughput, going mainly to the food service sector.
Instead, said managing director Richard Cracknell, the big feature of the UK beef market now is far more fat cattle coming forward than last year, because farmers no longer need to retain cattle to claim a 21-month premium.
“We killed 3,000 more cattle in June than the same month last year, an increase of 13%”, he revealed."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10030770.html,2005-08-03 01:00:00,Improved trade at mart bucks trend,"Dungarvan Mart manager Ger Flynn said the trade was much improved with a bigger sale of cattle this week, showing recovery in some of the drop in recent weeks. At the upper end of the market bullocks and heifers were showing an improvement of €40-€50/head.
While it is hard to identify a margin in animals costing over €300 with €/kg with the trend in the beef trade, there was a solid sector of mainly farmer buyers in the mart for these animals showing confidence in the trade for the remainder of the year.
The heavy quality bullocks made up to €300 over €/kg with a good run of cattle making €250-€300 over. Medium- weight bullocks in the range 400kg-500kg were not as strong in price or demand and ranged €70 over to €240 over. Heavy-quality heifers made up to €250 over while the light stores sold at €100-€180 over €/kg.
The trade at Kilmallock Mart - where numbers on offer were back on recent weeks - was described by manager Kevin Leahy as steady. He felt some farmers are holding back cattle, resulting in a smaller entry than expected for this week.
Medium-weight store bullocks were a little dearer at Kanturk Mart yesterday where they made up to €225 over and the lighter bullocks ranged €100-€220 over. Beef heifers made €120-€160 over and stores sold at €100-€140 over.
Trade at Fermoy Mart yesterday was described as steady, with 600 head on offer, and prices for beef peaking at €150 over, and medium-weight stores ranging €70-€225. Butchers’ heifers made up to €175 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10031655.html,2005-08-03 01:00:00,Farmers finding it harder to make a living,"It has been known for some time that significant amounts of beef, chicken and pork are being imported.
The booming catering trade is a huge buyer and meat processors are also in on the act as price pressure continues to erode margins.
To that extent it is becoming increasingly difficult for farmers to hold the line and sustain their livelihood in agriculture.
That’s not new either. Just how far things have moved on are highlighted by agriculture’s share of GDP, which is less than 5% at this stage, down from 24% in 1960.
Last year’s Central Statistics Office figures disclosed that one-third of the beef eaten here was imported. The suspicion is that most of it came from South America, with Brazil accounting for a major portion of the 30,0000 tonnes.
Even allowing for EU tariffs, it was still competitive for importers to buy the product and sell to the Irish consumer.
More worrying is further evidence that beef imports are continuing to grow.
For the record, just short of 19,000 tonnes of imported beef was consumed in Ireland in 2003. This shot up to 30,000 tonnes last year.
The suggestions are we will consume even more foreign beef and there seems to be precious little Agriculture Minister Mary Coughlan or anybody else can do about it.
Farmers are being hard hit by all of this.
The minister has promised to introduce clearer labelling demands for the hotel and catering sector in September. But the impact of that move is questionable, given the ceaseless push by the consumer for a better deal.
In the past, the firmly-held view was that most people, irrespective of nationality, preferred to eat the beef produced in their own countries. That view does not stand up to scrutiny any longer.
With the huge increase in eating out and so many people eating their main meal in the middle of the day, simply getting food into themselves seems to be their main concern. The quality and price of what’s served is the most important factor in our cash-rich, time-poor societies.
With Brazil and other South American countries able to produce beef at much lower prices, there is an inevitability that countries with more hostile climates will feel the pinch.
Ironically, it is said that the changes to the sugar regime taking place in Europe will benefit Brazil, which has the capacity to grow sugar at costs significantly below competitors anywhere in the world, including Africa, where producers had been hoping to gain some benefit from the EU reforms.
Where will it all end? Increasingly Irish agriculture has become a shadow of what it was. It has to be a matter of regret that much of the gains post-EU entry were driven by subsidies that ultimately created a false sense of security about European agriculture.
Demands by the IFA that subsidies be maintained to key export countries, such as Russia, are understandable in the current climate, where farmers took a 30% per kilogram hit on the price of beef last week alone.
Cattle prices across Europe are under pressure and both the producers and processors here are crying foul.
However, they are not a united front and the IFA has accused the major retailers and processors of double standards.
Livestock chairman of the IFA John Bryan said the same processors and retailers were importing large amounts of South American beef, which was not up to the same standard as that produced in the EU.
There was a time when food production was straightforward. But food has become political for a variety of reasons. The EU politicised the issue long before now, through the massive subsidy regime that has gone way beyond its own sell-by date."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10040143.html,2005-08-04 01:00:00,Chilling beef news from Brazil,"She may have been thinking of beef, one of Ireland’s main agricultural exports, but now increasingly likely to come into Europe from Brazil, which can export as much in two months as Ireland can in 12 months.
“Globalisation is with us and seems to be moving forwards with unstoppable momentum”, said Ms Fischer-Boel - chilling words for Irish cattle farmers, as beef supplies from more than 5,000 miles away drive down prices on the EU market.
She has also said EU farmers’ production choices should be directed by what the market wants rather than by subsidies.
The market wants more and more Brazilian beef, coming in cheaper than Irish product, even after paying EU duties.
This year’s figures show some of Ireland’s best beef customers turning to South American beef - a 190% increase in exports to Russia, up 48% in the UK and up 45% in Italy.
Egypt, once an Irish customer, now takes 17,920 tons of Brazilian beef per month.
The Netherlands is another big buyer.
There’s plenty more beef in Brazil.
Now declared free of foot and mouth disease due to vaccination, the state of Acre in the north of Brazil has just joined 15 other states internationally approved for beef exports.
Acre has two million cattle, and will produce 300,000 slaughter animals this year.
And with the EU a net beef importer since 2003, there is huge demand here for Acre’s “green” beef, from grazed, unconfined cattle (or so the Brazilians say).
Imports are good business for Germany, for example, where about 30% of beef processing plants have been operating at only 80% of their capacity, because of the EU’s falling beef supply.
Imports will be even better business in 2007, when decoupling will have been implemented by all member states, and the full effect of the Single Payment on EU cattle production kicks in.
Financial necessity has driven EU processors to find cheaper beef supplies - even if they come from unreliable sources.
During 2004 there were two outbreaks of foot and mouth in Brazil, one of which led their primary beef customer, Russia, to ban most imports.
In 2002, Argentina left its EU beef customers high and dry, when one of the most devastating financial crises in history triggered economic chaos.
Brazil’s economic history, too, has been characterised by booms and busts. Its currency recently slumped 4.34% in a week, due to a political corruption scandal which famously involved a member of President da Silva’s administration trying to board a plane with $100,000 hidden in his underpants.
Da Silva’s political future, and the three-year economic recovery he has led, are uncertain, after 46 politicians and aides were found to have received $12 million in bribes.
Already, Brazilian beef exporters have said they will have to reduce sales due to their deteriorating exchange rate.
However, the country’s good balance of payments, low inflation and booming exports, have reassured the world markets, which are betting on the weakened government being able to sustain its successful economic policies.
The question for Agriculture Commissioner Fischer-Boel is whether Brazil can maintain the safe and reliable supply of food which she says is as important now as it was when the Common Agricultural Policy was drawn up after World War Two.
If Brazilian beef imports continue at their current rate there will be few EU cattle farmers left to pick up the slack if Brazilian beef dries up without warning due to another South American cattle disease or economic shock."

He said farmers must be supported in maximising their production from grass with systems that allow them to graze late into the autumn and early winter, and early in the spring, reducing the amount of manure storage they need."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-10030736.html,2005-08-05 01:00:00,"Dillon: average farm income just €6,000 without EU","The average payment is €10,000. President John Dillon spoke after figures released under the Freedom of Information Act showed Larry Goodman’s company, Irish Agricultural Development, will get a total of €508,390 in Common Agricultural Policy payments.
Mr Dillon, speaking at a lunch on the fringes of the Fáilte Ireland Dublin Horse Show, said he did not wish to comment on any individual payment.
“There will be always be winners in any scheme but on average the payments going to farmers are around €10,000. The average income of farmers is around €16,000.
“If you take the payments away from farmers, you are down to €6,000 average income. That’s the way we look at it,” he said.
Four of the top 20 recipients have objected to having their names and details of the amounts received being listed. They now have two weeks to appeal to the Information Commissioner.
The IFA supported a €300,000 payment ceiling during the CAP reform negotiations, but it was rejected by the British who want to review the whole CAP budget.
Describing beef imports as frightening, Mr Dillon said there was a 60% increase last year, or one-third of Ireland’s domestic market.
Labour spokesperson on agriculture and food, Mary Upton, said figures showing beef baron Larry Goodman receives €10,000 per week in farm subsidies will anger both consumers and farm families. “The role of CAP should not be to feather-bed Mr Goodman or other millionaires, but to support the maximum number of farm families on the land and ensure that farmers get a fair return for their endeavours,” she said.
Mr Dillon said farmers selling cattle in the last month have had painful experiences of the market damage from increased volumes of low priced South American beef.
Imports from Brazil and Argentina have the potential to wipe out the €1.5 billion Irish beef industry. Cattle prices have been cut by 45c/kg, or €150 per head since June, wiping out any possibility of profit from summer grazing.
He also claimed consumers are being misled because of the lack of transparent and effective labelling. He called on Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan to deliver on her vow to introduce labelling in the early autumn.
He also accused British retailers and processors of double standards saying they demanded high standards from EU producers, but imported beef from South America, where there were serious consumer issues.
Mr Dillon said the EU Commission’s proposals for the sugar industry would leave it uneconomic to grow sugar beet in this country. He called on Minister Coughlan to continue to resist the proposals."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10065225.html,2005-08-06 01:00:00,Finished cattle supplies to drop 8%,"Figures from the Cattle Movement Monitoring System (CMMS) for 2004 show the number of male animals in the 12-24 month category at the end of 2004 was 74,000 head lower than a year earlier. The number of heifers in the same age category was up 4,200.
The intake of bullocks at the beef factories to date is down 8% - a drop of 36,000. Based on CMMS figures for the national herd a continuation of the same pattern is being predicted to the end of the year, which would result in a drop of 38,000 head in bullock supplies for the balance of the year.
While the downturn in supply would normally contribute to stronger demand and firmer prices to suppliers, the effect this year may be less obvious if the current difficulties in the demand for beef continues through autumn with large supplies of Irish beef destined for British and continental EU markets being displaced by imports from South America.
Those monitoring the beef export trade will be closely watching the outcome of the UK Food Standards Agency Meeting on August 15 which could determine an outline date for the lifting of the ban on over 30 months animals in Britain. The meeting will consider the findings of the Independent Advisory Group, EU Food and Veterinary Office and the feedback from public meetings. All elements of a testing regime for OTM animals will also be discussed.
If the findings of the Food Standards Agency is positive towards a lifting of the ban - and introduction of testing for OTM animals as in this country - the matter will come before the ministers next month."

The reason for the slump is that the EU is being flooded with South American imports, with EU approval. Worse still is the fact that the EU Commission seems willing to offer ongoing and limitless concessions on farm products to gain concessions of its own for goods and services into South America.
The consequences of a continuation of this policy need to be spelled out.
Irish beef is superior to its South American counterparts by way of safety, traceability and quality. But on price Irish farmers cannot and will not attempt to compete.
The consequence of weanling producers getting a roasting this autumn will lead to a cull of suckler cows, which in turn will fuel the panic of oversupply.
If the suckler cow cull begins in earnest, it will take on a life of its own and become irreversible.
The sacrifice of the Irish sugar industry is well underway and the demolition of the cattle industry is in the pipeline, with the obvious knock-on effect on cereals.
In the long term, we can look forward to an Irish countryside which will become an unproductive wilderness and a Europe that will lose the ability to feed itself. So it’s not just European farmers but also the European public who need to ask the question: for who and for what?
But all is not yet lost. Agriculture Minister Mary Coughlan stamped her foot recently and shouted stop to the EU Commission. Her next step should be to wake up her own Government colleagues to the implications of where we are heading, and to ensure that the Taoiseach makes sure the interests of Irish farmers are not sacrificed at the WTO by the EU negotiators.
The bottom line is that if weanling prices cannot be maintained at last year’s prices or better, then ICSA will not be encouraging suckler farmers to stay at an unprofitable enterprise.
The loss of our sugar beet industry is a terrible indictment of the EU, a similar outcome for the beef industry would be a scandal.

The panic selling by producers continued after a further cut of 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) by the processors brought the general run of prices for R/O grade stock to 246-235 c/kg (88p-84p/lb) although some factories were quoting O grade animals down to 232 c/kg (83p/lb) and maintaining the supply had not been effected.
The level of bookings at the factories is showing no sign of any resistance from producers who have been shocked into selling, regardless of price, as they watched the value of their stock decline by the week. On the positive side, there is now emerging consensus in the trade that the price crash is close to bottoming out. A further reduction next week cannot be ruled out, but that could set the base for a more stable trade.
Although producers are now suffering serious losses, securing a lift in price will be very difficult, with market difficulties and a steady supply of cattle almost guaranteed over the coming weeks, as more cattle are moved ahead of reaching 30 months and taking a further cut of 6-9 c/kg (2p-3p/lb) and rejection by some of the factories.
Weekly bullock intake at the factories has now dropped 2,000-2,500 head under the same time last year which should lead to good demand but this has been undermined by the cut back in slaughter at processors.
Cull cow prices are steady this week. Base prices are up to 191 c/kg (68p/lb).
The quality heavy cows are making up to 28 c/kg (10p/lb) more at the top factories.

The key players here are Kerry Group, IAWS, Fyffes, Greencore, Glanbia. All of the above have serious involvement in Britain and the US as well as the home market.
Some like Kerry and IAWS have significant involvement in mainland Europe as well.
What is becoming increasingly clear is that meals cooked in the home are on the way down, and more and more people want food on the go or the ready to cook options that are becoming an increasing feature of urban supermarkets.
Two years ago you would be hard put to find roast beef with vegetables on the supermarket shelves that require no more than a flick of the switch on the micro wave to have it ready for immediate consumption.
But that is no longer so. How the key players tap into those markets here and in Britain will determine their growth prospects over the next few years.
In that context IAWS is rated best in terms of earnings outlook for the next few years given its positions in Britain, the US, Canada and Ireland.
In those markets its food to go and finger food options as well as its par baked and artisan breads all support the growing needs of consumers negotiating very busy lifestyles.
While there is a strong emphasis now in healthier foods the report, by Liam Igoe of Goodbody Stockbrokers, says the faster pace of life means the burger and chips option and other less healthy but convenient options look like they won’t be wiped out soon.
Kerry, which has such a commanding position in core areas like food ingredients and convenience foods, including chilled and frozen foods, has underlying growth of 7% per annum without executing any further major acquisitions.
If it makes another big purchase in the meantime then the group’s outlook will grow accordingly.
Kerry’s trouble is that finding major takeover targets to drive its earnings growth by high double digit figures is not easy anymore.
For starters, the group has been responsible for a number of major deals in its own right, while competitors have been snapping up potential targets that would have interested Kerry.
Price has been an issue and the group has always been highly disciplined in terms of what it has been prepared to shell out.
That being the case earnings growth from Kerry will remain solid, but not at the high double digit level that used to be the case for so many years.
Overall the report finds that without any major takeover the outlook generally for the Irish food sector remains pretty secure.
While the focus of the food review was to assess the future outlook of the publicly quoted food groups, it also highlighted the grip of the big multiples on the Irish food sector.
This year their market share of the grocery market will raise to 83% from 82% last year.
Within that line-up is Tesco, which is threatening to takeover the Irish retail sector where its stake continues to grow. At the end of 2004 its stake in the Irish market was 24.9% and that will have gone up to 25.9% by the end of this year.
Dunnes is continuing to hold its own against the British retailer and its share of 22% will be 22.3% by the end of this year.
If the symbol groups are thrown in, the chain stores control 90% of the Irish retail grocery sector.
In that context Igoe forecasts significant change in Britain, where the independent retail sector has held its own compared to the changes we have seen here.
If the multiples take a firmer grip then that shift in the balance of power will put increasing pressure on Irish food suppliers including Kerry, Glanbia, Greencore and IAWS, who are all very active in Britain."

“Farmers are extremely angry with the factories over the ongoing price cuts and the way they are using cheap Brazilian imports to undermine our valuable markets,” he said.
Mr Bryan said this latest price cut by the factories was avoidable and it was beyond time that stability was restored to the trade.
He said price cuts of this magnitude have already wiped out any possibility of a margin on grazing cattle this summer.
Pointing out that excessive factory price cuts are eroding the value of the farmers’ single farm payment, he said this has serious consequences for the entire beef production sector in Ireland.
Meanwhile, the ICMSA Beef and Cattle committee chairperson John O’Leary has called for fresh energy to be brought to bear on the problems of access to markets for Irish beef.
He said new and co-ordinated efforts are required to put a greater focus on the re-opening of markets closed to Irish beef. “The facts are that farmers are currently being forced to sell cattle at uneconomic prices, a situation that is simply unsustainable,” he said.
Mr O’Leary said immediate action required to address the situation must include the full restoration of the export refund cut as well as a major initiative to re-open markets."

What’s most insidious about this recommendation is the claim that it would be of major benefit to the consumer.
In the context of modern economies, the consumer has been elevated to a status that is totally unreal.
It’s quite extraordinary. Everything is attributed to the consumer, who in reality is as anonymous as the jar of coffee or the pack of kitchen rolls sitting on the supermarket shelf.
If the marketers are to be believed, the consumer has more power than the president of the United States. No mere president, in fact; the consumer is king in modern day marketing-speak.
That’s the new mantra. Its true purpose is to further the interests of the big multiples, whose grip on the British and Irish grocery markets is pervasive.
We are in fact following the pattern begun in the US, taken up in Britain and more recently here, that idolises big shopping centres and multiple stores.
In Ireland, Tesco is now the dominant supermarket chain and its grip on the Irish economy is increasing.
Not that there is anything wrong with Tesco. This is not a debate about Tesco or Dunnes Stores or any other particular store.
We capped the size of stores in Ireland to prevent big chains sucking the lifeblood out of local communities, which has happened in Britain to a very serious degree. The British have fallen in love with their out-of-town shopping centres.
The Dundrum Shopping Centre in Dublin, said to be Europe’s largest, is from this shopper’s point of view pug ugly. It’s heartless, soulless and has very little to do with giving the consumer what he or she wants. The car park is good though, I’ll grant it that much.
Overall, it’s an abomination in the middle of what was one of the capital’s nicer suburbs.
It’s a step backwards, but the consumer is happy about it and the consumer is king.
The consumer, however, cannot be let off the hook on this. The consumer is no king in a modern market economy, but rather a puppet whose strings are yanked by the latest marketing ploy or brand and who dictates very little.
A classic case, going back 20 years, was the emergence of the deep freezer. People went mad buying up beef and lamb to store away for the rainy day.
This was supposed to be the ultimate in convenience as well as a huge money saving device. It was a clear case of the consumer being led by the nose.
You won’t find too many cabinet freezers in modern homes today, packed with meat that may or may not be eaten.
In the end this is about what kind of society and economy we want. Tesco is on the march. It got around the planning laws by adapting its strategy and introducing smaller stores.
Now the Competition Authority has decreed it in the best interests of the consumer that we lift the ban on below-cost selling.
For the record, the €500 a year additional cost to the average shopper allegedly caused by the ban works out at €10 per week. It’s about the price of two pints in a trendy pub!
The impact on the consumer, if that is who the key focus is on, is miniscule.
However, the broader aspect of this debate has much bigger implications for the way Ireland as an economy and society is headed.
The big chains now have 80% of the total Irish grocery market.
Lifting the ban on below-cost selling will help them tighten their grip. This is not about the consumer, but try telling that to the Competition Authority."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/yourview/arid-10094737.html,2005-08-15 01:00:00,Why we are failing to feed Europe,"Beef imports, we have been told, are wreaking havoc with Irish efforts to maintain a hold on domestic and foreign markets. This is true.
The farm organisations appear paralysed. The sounds of wailing and gnashing of teeth fill the press.
This problem we have every year is down to the simple fact that, as a nation, we don't have any marketing strategy for holding markets once we get in.
The promotion of beef is no longer an option. Bord Bia needs to evolve into a proper marketing/branding company. It is a malaise from the old days of easy EU money that has led Bord Bia to believe it has no responsibility other than to do the best it can. Its best isn't good enough.
It was very easy to 'promote' beef into any country if you had a bag full of export refunds going with it.
In the real world, post-decoupling, someone is going to have to explain to me, after all the money that was spent on promotion, why Ireland still can't retain market share properly.
When will the penny drop? We need proper market research, proper consumer analysis, proper food science and a marketing strategy that makes Irish food both recognisable and desirable to the consumer.
Tap water in this country, where it rains every other day, is of a good quality, yet bottled water is a multimillion-euro business. The customer is buying an idea, not necessarily a product. It is that type of science and marketing that needs to be applied to the beef trade.
Irish farmers and farm organisations have watched motionless as the volumes of imported food have risen. As farmers, through our own inaction, we have allowed foreign foodstuffs gain acceptance with the Irish public to such a degree that the only factor in the purchase of food is price.
This is our fault, and the fault of our leaders. While we have been talking the issue of food imports to death, the South Americans in particular have been getting on with the job of feeding Europe.
Our only response to date not yet implemented is labelling, which won't solve the problem. But it will further help the consumer to target cheaper food by country of origin. Remember in real markets such as the UK, it is brand recognition, not country of origin, that sells product.
It will not be easy for a minister for agriculture to question the status of imported food if native producers don't agitate. Likewise at the WTO.
Should farmers agitate it would make quarantining of foreign beef on the grounds of suspected hormones and flawed traceability an acceptable political tool. The message it would send across Europe, I believe, would be very powerful.
Defence of farming values, traditions and economy begins at home. A small thing could tip the balance back in favour of European taxpayers, consumers and farmers at WTO.
I do not envy Mary Coughlan's job of trying to deliver a result for Ireland at WTO. Without political agitation on food and farm economy issues at home, she may very well be asked, ""who do you represent and why are you here?""

While the apparent bottoming out of the price fall will be welcomed by suppliers to the factories, the return at present prices will result in serious losses for producers, who face a very difficult challenge in trying to bring about a recovery in the price.
The factories are quoting 246-232c/kg (88p-83p/lb) for R/O grade animals under 30 months with 252c/kg (90p/lb) going for underage U grade stock. As the prices settle, producers are counting the cost of an unprecedented drop of 50c/kg (18p/lb) since mid-May, equating to more than €170/head in the value of finished cattle at the factories. Most of the factories are discounting over 30-months animals by 6-9c/kg (2p-3p/lb) eroding returns by a further €20-€30/head with February 2003-born animals reaching 30 months currently.
Cattle supplies have slipped under the corresponding weeks for last year. Good harvesting weather which is likely to keep farmers busy on the land over the next few weeks, could affect lower intakes of cattle at the factories, but is unlikely to result in pressure for a price improvement, because of poor market demand. That is unless there is either a significant improvement in the markets or substantial fall-off in supply.

Coupled with the losses from the special beef overshoot, this is causing severe financial hardship for many farms.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10080688.html,2005-08-18 01:00:00,Brazil beef not only factor in cattle price slump,"Exporters here depend heavily on the UK, which took 264,000 of the 493,000 tonnes exported from Ireland in 2004 (the continental EU took 174,000 tonnes and international markets took 55,000 tonnes).
With Ireland exporting about 88% of its beef, developments in the UK market are crucial and have a big bearing on the beef cattle price cut of E150 per head since June.
But trade statistics from the UK reveal important factors other than the beef imports from Brazil which are IFA’s main target.
Supermarkets in the UK say they are feeling the effects of a reduction in consumer spending. This effect may be greater in beef purchases due to relatively poor summer weather, which may have hit demand for steaks and barbecues.
These developments on the demand side may be much more significant than Brazilian beef, because trade statistics indicate that total beef and veal imports to the UK actually fell, quite significantly, in the first five months of 2005, from 114,000 tonnes in 2004 to just over 97,000 tonnes this year.
Ireland continued to be the major source of imports, but sent 14,000 tonnes less than in the first five months of last year.
Imports from Brazil rose by more than 3,000 tonnes, to 15,660 tonnes, while imports from Poland shot up, from a mere 230 tonnes to more than 2,000 tonnes. Ironically, Irish farmers may be among the EU-15 farmland investors who have flocked into Poland, and whose beef may now competing against Irish beef in the UK. Beef exports from Poland could increase, as low labour and farmland costs, and low taxes and great potential for improved productivity attract more and more foreign direct investment."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10063651.html,2005-08-18 01:00:00,Beef import ban unrealistic,"In EU Agriculture Commissioner Fischer Boel’s home country, they have found that nine out of 10 Danes suffering from multi-antibiotic resistant bacterial infections got them from foreign meat.
The institute’s researchers said bacteria levels could be up to seven times more resistant to antibiotics than those found in Danish meat products.
Here, Irish farmers fear that their export markets will be taken by competitors from outside the EU, who can produce at lower cost by not observing strict EU hygiene standards.
Denmark has a similar problem, observing stricter regulations about the use of antibiotics in food production than most other countries, but over-run by foreign meat imports which scientists have now linked to bacterial infections, which were fatal in some cases.
These findings on the Agriculture Commissioner’s doorstep could lead to a clampdown on imports from outside the EU.
However, Irish cattle farmers shouldn’t hold out false hopes for a ceiling on South American beef imports into the EU.
Instead, they should concentrate on becoming more competitive, and making the most of an expected 10-year period of EU beef scarcity.
The view from Brussels is that the EU beef industry remains highly protected, by significant import barriers.
Most of the Brazilian beef that comes in is “out-of-quota”, with exporters paying a levy of more than 3,000 per tonne, plus a 12% tariff, before it can land in the EU.
But production costs are so low in Brazil that they can afford the levies, and the specific farm and feedlot regulations, abattoir regulations and government controlled recording systems demanded by the EU, and still make a profit, even though it’s mostly high value cuts which are sent to Europe, and buyers must be found for the rest of the carcase.
These factors, and any further clampdowns by the EU authorities to improve the safety of imported meats, will limit the growth of Brazilian imports.
And animal health issues, political developments or currency exchange fluctuations could quickly cut off South American supplies at any time, and leave the EU very short of beef.
If the EU puts further obstacles in the path of South American and other non-EU beef exporters, consumers in Europe may have to do without beef, or may turn their back on it, if a shortage drives up prices.
EU farmers can supply only 95% of the EU’s requirements, and that figure may shrink due to a number of factors. Some EU cattle farmers cannot survive the removal of 1.07 per kg of carcass beef produced in the EU, which they were paid in the form of cattle premia. It will still be paid as a Single Payment, but cattle farming without it will be uneconomical for many.
The more than 60% of the EU-25 beef production which comes from the dairy herd continues to shrink, due to rising dairy cow yields.
Over the next 10 years EU beef production is predicted to fall by 0.3% to 2% per year, perhaps reducing supply by 1m tonnes per year.
Production may concentrate in areas like Ireland, if farmers here can fully exploit our natural advantages, and our exporters can position their produce strategically against imported beef.
That should be the target, rather than getting over-excited about Brazilian beef. If Irish farmers don’t do it, the new Central European member states are ready to come to the rescue of an EU beef industry which is running out of material.
Farmers here should note the emergence of Poland as a beef producer. While Brazil sent 3,000 extra tons of beef to the UK in the first six months of 2005, Poland sent 2,000 tonnes.
In the long term, the big threat to Ireland’s beef industry could come in trucks from the east, not ships from the west."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10073084.html,2005-08-19 01:00:00,Prices for quality cattle pick up,"Prices for the quality bullocks were improved by up to €20/head on last week, but the plain Friesian stores are continuing a difficult trade at poor prices. Quality heifers were improved by up to €15/head at yesterday’s sales.
The number of cattle on offer was slightly lower than last week with some farmers taking a holiday break and harvesting taking the attention of others away from the cattle trade.
At Bandon Mart it was reckoned that the bullock trade “was a good deal better” than last week with some lots showing an improvement of €20/head. Heifers were in scarce supply and sold at prices unchanged from last week.
Prices for the heavy bullocks ranged €150 over to €250 over, with the general range of stores making €170 over to €290 over for quality while Friesian lots ranged €70 over to €140 over.
Two 560 kg Simmental bullocks sold for €785, two 510 kg Charolais sold for €750, eight Friesians weighing 434 kg made €555, and a lot of nine Charolais scaling 366 kg sold for €645.
The best of the continental heifers made up to €180 over €/kg, while Hereford and Angus made €70-€120 over. A Charolais weighing 480 kg sold for €660. Two Belgian Blues weighing 465 kg made €630, and a Hereford weighing 510 kg sold for €610.
The trade was firm at Kilkenny Mart for all types of bullocks, where over 400 head were on offer, with prices improved by up to €15/head for a nice selection of heifers on offer. Beef bullocks ranged €180 over to €260 over, forward stores making up to €310 over and light stores ranging €160 over to €280 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10103777.html,2005-08-23 01:00:00,Improvement in cull cow prices,"This is the third consecutive week of improvement in cull cow prices with a base price of up to 207 cent/kg (74p/lb) quoted for heavy cows and up to 28 cent/kg (10p/lb) more being paid by some of the top paying factories for quality heavy cows grading R as the lift in the trade for cow beef continues. The supply of cull cows to the factories is around 7,000 head per week, more than 10% down on the same time last year.
Although there were fewer enquiries to the factories yesterday from cattle farmers and the processors prepared for a lighter kill for the week, there was a reluctance by the processors to increase prices to get additional cattle, believing that supplies will increase over the coming weeks as more cattle come close to 30 months.
Most of the factories are quoting 246 cent/kg (88p/lb) for R grade animals - unchanged from last week - while the general quote for O grade animals is 235 cent/kg (84p/lb) an increase of three cent/kg (1p/lb) on the price offered last week.
Although the intake of bullocks has increased, the supply is now 3,500 head per week lower than the same time last year and all of the indications for this week are that the supply will tighten further. The processors hold out that the fall off in supply is temporary, and are resisting pressure to increase prices to get more cattle.
The British price for R3 bullocks has improved to around 252 cent/kg (90p/lb), which is marginally higher than the Irish price and lower than the British price of mid-July."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10035800.html,2005-08-25 01:00:00,Decline in beef prices bottoms out,"The average for R4L bullocks slipped by 2c/kg for last week’s kill, while the average price paid for similar grade heifers saw a drop of 1c/kg.
Poorer grading animals fared even better with O4L bullocks fractionally lower - after losing 1c/kg - and the average for same grade heifers improving by 2c/kg.
R4L bullocks averaged 88.7p/lb and heifers 89p/lb. Average for O4L bullocks was 84.3p/lb and heifers 84.5p/lb.
Bullock supplies were back almost 1,000 head on the previous week at 14,646 head, more than 5,500 head lower than the same week last year.
Prices for cull cows continue to improved with O and P grades increasing by 6c/kg (2p/lb) at the upper end of the market.
As the price collapse of June and July bottoms out, producers are regaining confidence, easing back on panic selling, and the trade is set for a period of stability.
Lower supplies of cattle have been putting some pressure on processors this week, but they are yielding very little on price to get extra cattle.
The most noticeable benefit to producers has been the lifting by the processors of penalties for animals over 30 months.
Prices at AIBP Bandon and Clones were up 0.5p/lb, but down 1p/lb in Cahir. Dawn Group paid an average of 0.5p/lb less at 88.4p/lb and Kepak Group was back 1p/lb at 89p/lb.
Euro Farm Foods at Duleek paid an average of 81p/lb for R4 cows, Newgrange Meats at nearby Navan paying the highest price for O/P grades at 78p/lb for O5 and over 76p/lb for P+4L."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10059238.html,2005-08-25 01:00:00,Cull cows brightest spot in the trade,"The general quote from the processors for R grade steers and heifers is 246 cents/kg (88p/lb), which is unchanged for the third consecutive week. Most of the factories quoted 235 cents/kg (84p/lb) for O grade stock, which was generally paid last week also, but represents an improvement of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) from last week's quoted prices.
The brightest spot in the trade continues to be the recovery in cull cow prices, improved a further 6 to 9 cents/kg (2 or 3p/lb), with base prices being offered to suppliers of range up to 207 cents/kg (74p/lb) for the heavy carcasses.
The better quality heavy cows are making 25 to 28 cents/kg (9 or 10p/lb) more at the top paying factories in the country.
The panic selling of cattle by farmers has ended, and supplies are reported to be tighter at all the factories this week.
But processors are strongly resisting any demands for worthwhile improvement in beef cattle prices; they maintain any fall off in supply is only temporary, before the autumn trade gets into full swing.
Markets for beef are generally quiet, which reduces pressure on the factories to secure strong supplies of cattle in the short term.
But they have more or less wiped of the price penalties for over-age cattle.
However, this reprieve for over 30 months cattle is unlikely to be more than temporary, with the over age factor becoming a bigger issue as the trade moves into September, and the higher numbers of March 2003 born animals emerge.
Although the steer intake at the factories has increased in recent weeks, the kill for the week ending August 13 was 3,500 head lower than the corresponding week in 2004, at 15,511 head.
The total throughput at factories was 30,974, compared to 35,340 last year.
There is a bit more confidence in the store trade for cattle in the marts, where prices for quality lots have improved by €20 to €30 per head, and prices are holding for the plainer cattle.
The weanling sales are getting into full swing now, with bulls ranging from €150 to €300 over e1/kg, and heifers making €80 to €160 over."

There was a slight improvement in the trade for bullocks at Bandon, where numbers on offer were up on last week. The heavy bullocks were a good trade with the best selling for up to €220 over €/kg. Lighter store bullocks ranged from €160-€290 over and Friesians sold from €90-€130 over.
Two 602kgs Herefords made €820, two 465kgs Belgian Blues sold for €685, four Simmentals weighing 465kgs made €755, while three Friesians scaling 423kgs went for €520.
In contrast the trade for heifers was quieter than last week, the best of the continentals making €220 over, while Hereford and Angus heifers ranged €50-€90 over €/kg.
There was 530 head on offer at Kilkenny, where beef bullocks were improved by €10/head and trade remained firm for other types of cattle at prices similar to last week.
The beef bullocks ranged €190-€300 over, heavy stores making up to €310 over and stores under 400kgs ranging from €180-€280 over. Beef heifers ranged €170-€255 over and stores made €130-€220 over.
There was a bigger sale at Ennis, where bullock prices improved by up to €15/head, while heifers showed gains of up to €20/head. Up to €400 over was paid for the best of the heavy continental bullocks - prices ranging back to €170 over - with the general run for stores ranging €200-€300 over.
Heifers made up to €300 over, with prices ranging back to €130 over, and there was demand for cull cows, at prices from €200 under to €120 over."

Some exceptional prices were paid for the choice weanling bulls on offer - a 482-kg Belgian Blue sold for €1,240. There was plenty of demand from both the active shippers, buying heifers and quality bulls, and farmers who were buying bull weanlings, which kept a floor under the average R grade bulls.
With quality more variable, and more young stock than last week’s Show and Sale, the margin price also widened. The choice bulls made €350 - €500 over €/kg, with a few fancy prices reaching up to €760 over. A lot of two Charolais 333 kgs sold for €900, a Charolais 346 kgs made €840, and three Limousin 394 kgs selling for €765. At the other end of the scale prices edged back to €220 over.
Quality heifers were also in strong demand. A Belgian Blue weighing 266 kgs sold for €750. A Charolais 352 kgs sold for €780, a 328-kg Limousin made €662 and a 418-kg Limousin sold for €675.
More general prices ranged €120 over to €350 over.
Some weanlings on offer at Fermoy Mart yesterday - as part of the general cattle sale of 900 head - ranged €200 to €260 over for bulls and €120 over to €160 over for heifers. At the cattle sale there was a strong trade for the quality store bullocks which sold for up to €300 over, plainer stores selling back to €70 over. Both beef and store heifers were a good trade at prices ranging €90 over to €200 over.
Forward store bullocks ranged €170 - €260 over at Kanturk Mart, bullocks 400-500 kg making €120 - €225 over €/kg. Beef heifers made up to €150 over and stores sold for up to €170 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10125573.html,2005-09-08 01:00:00,UK re-entry will hit our beef hardest,"Irish beef producers have focused on providing high-quality and fresh beef to EU retail channels, according to the international bank's food and agribusiness research unit.
But it questions whether Ireland's continuous flow of high-quality product can be maintained, once the force of decoupling is felt.
The research unit said suckler cow farms will be hit hardest by decoupling, and suggests this was why the slaughter of cows in Ireland reached a peak at the end of 2004.
Goedhart Westers of Rabobank explained why Ireland could take another big hit, when the UK allows cattle over 30 months, that test BSE-free, back into the food chain.
This is targeted to happen as early as next month. If it goes ahead in September, it will add 76,000 to 87,000 tonnes of beef to the UK market supply for the remainder of 2005. For 2006, the supply increase is predicted at 167,000 to 191,000 tonnes.
""Those countries whose export portfolio includes most fresh beef will therefore feel its impact. These countries obviously include Ireland, since it exports the whole range of fresh beef products to the UK market"","" predicts Goedhart Westers.
He continued: ""This will redirect current Irish exports from the UK to mainland Europe, thus increasing competition. At the same time, however, Irish domestic beef support will feel the negative impact of the decoupling, since Ireland has a significant share of specialised and extensive beef production.""
Along with the impact of the decoupling, he said that EU beef production will shrink when the CAP reforms shove up feed prices, and managing intensive beef operations becomes unattractive.
The reduced beef production should improve EU beef prices, but that market trend will tend to pull in competitively priced beef imports from non-EU countries good news, according to Westers, for non-EU beef producers such as Brazil. His outlook is positive for them, while somewhat pessimistic from the Irish point of view.
""Given favourable exchange rate movements and improvements in access under the WTO Doha round, the window of opportunity for Brazil and other Mercosur countries should only increase"","" he said.
He warned of a strong negative effect on European beef suppliers, if the South American countries succeed in their negotiations for a 100,000 tonnes increase in the Hilton beef quota of 59,100 tonnes of high-quality beef which they can already send to the EU without paying an import tariff.
""The discussions with Mercosur on expansion of the Hilton quotas are crucial in that respect"","" said the Rabobank analyst.
He predicted other winners and losers too, due to the increasing shortfall of production by EU cattle farmers, and the pressing economic danger of under-utilisation of EU processing plants.
As a result, power will shift to those who control sourcing and supply of fresh, high-quality beef for retail, he said.
""Value used to reside in the further processing of carcasses into pre-packed meat or meat products,"" said Westers. ""Now it's shifting back up the value chain to those who have access to and control supplies.""
Rabobank's food and agribusiness research is regarded as one of the best in the world, employs a team of international analysts to continuously inform and advise clients on all relevant issues throughout the food chain.
The European Commission predicts that EU beef consumption will exceed EU beef production by 418,000 tonnes in 2012, compared to 190,000 tonnes now.
Beef production in the 25 member states is predicted to fall by 321,000 tonnes, between 2005 and 2012.
The gap in the market will be filled by rising imports (and by declining beef exports out of the EU-25)."

Fine Gael MEP Mairead McGuinness said the survey study highlighted the vulnerability of income, should there be any significant change in the direct payment regime.
“Direct decoupled payments from the EU are vital for the very survival of farmers, yet they are not index linked and are subject to review in 2008 or 2009,” she said.
Ms McGuinness said the EU was currently struggling to negotiate a budget beyond 2007.
“This poses a real threat to the future of direct payments, despite the promises made under the Fischler CAP reforms of better market prices,” she said.
The Ireland East MEP also warned that the current trend in the beef and dairy sectors - Ireland’s key farming enterprises - is for lower prices to be paid to farming.
IFA president John Dillon said the most striking fact emerging from the Teagasc survey, was that the average annual farm income of Ireland’s 72,000 full-time farmers (those who do not have an off-farm income) is only €19,600.
“This income level is only two thirds of average industrial earnings and works out at less than €10/ hour,” he said.
Mr Dillon added that for all farmers, full-time and part- time, the average farm income last year, while up by 5.4%, was still only €15,559."

Mr Hogan branded the current situation a “nonsense” and said it was time to start putting the consumer first.
Critics argue the order prevents retailers passing on to customers discounts they receive on bulk orders.
“We want the benefits of discounts passed on to the customers, so that shops can sell loss leaders, like baby food, for a limited time, but we do not want to allow predatory pricing that would allow major chains to force local shops out of business,” Mr Hogan said.
He calculated that if such discounts where reflected in over-the-counter prices, shoppers would benefit to the tune of 10% on many items.
The order’s impact on prices was brought to wide public attention by the consumer champion Eddie Hobbs in his show Rip-Off Republic.
Mr Hogan said the Competition Authority (CA) needed to be beefed up so it could police the retail sector more aggressively and stop major chains blowing small shops out of the market once the order was gone.
Tánaiste and Progressive Democrat leader Mary Harney yesterday called for the order to be abolished to benefit shoppers.
Earlier, CA chairman Dr John Fingleton told an Oireachtas Committee such a move would reduce prices permanently.
He said removal of the order could be expected to save the average household up to €481 per annum.
The FG policy shift was the centre piece of the opening day of the parliamentary party’s conference in Laois."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10105369.html,2005-09-15 01:00:00,Farmers versus eco-disaster,"Farmers can help to solve all these problems, and the importance of their role is cropping up more and more, as eco-disasters force world leaders to look more closely at the big picture.
Farmers couldn't do much about the catastrophic forest fires which engulfed Portugal and Spain this summer because too many of them had gone out of business.
When European environment and agriculture ministers met last weekend, they agreed that the loss of more than 20% of the rural population in many Mediterranean regions had left large areas of land poorly managed, with brush and debris building up, becoming an incendiary hazard.
The same threat may be emerging in Ireland, with brush fires seeming to have increased since we were forced by the EU to reduce hill sheep numbers, in order to prevent over-grazing.
Last weekend European Ministers were told that if they can stop the depopulation of rural areas, they will reduce the growing brush fire threat, and also increase biodiversity, and prevent build up of animal diseases caused by the increase in feral animals. Eco-disasters have heightened the risks of tampering with nature, or with farming.
In Switzerland, there is increasing worry about the disappearance of alpine farms, increasing the danger of avalanches.
While upland farmers keep the landscape safe, their lowland colleagues can mitigate the effects of the high oil price, by growing crops for fuel in place.
These biofuels fulfilled only 4% of the EU's energy needs in 2003; the target is to replace 5.75% of all transport fossil fuels with biofuels by 2010.
In the soils and trees on their land, farmers also ""lock up"" the carbon dioxide which causes climate change , and wind power from farms also replaces climate damaging fossil fuels.
The timber from farms replaces concrete and other materials whose manufacture is highly polluting. Food production is the farmer's primary role, but defences against flooding can also be provided , by allowing land by coasts and rivers to absorb rising water levels, and keep it away from towns and villages.
Farming itself contributes 10% of the EU's climate changing greenhouse gas emissions, but it is one of the few sectors which holds out real hope for combating emissions, and becoming ""climate neutral.""
This is the buzz-word: for example, organisers of the 2006 FIFA World Cup aim to stage the first ever climate-neutral finals. Already, the German Football Association is to invest 500,000 in an aid program in a region of India seriously affected by the tsunami disaster, including farming measures which will compensate for one third of the 100,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions forecast to be generated in Germany by increased traffic volumes at the finals.
Farming is the main source of biomass, such as grass, trees, leaves (or even municipal waste), that can be burned instead of fossil fuel, to generate electricity.
The use of biomass in the EU-25 has risen to 68.8 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2003 from 46.8 million tonnes in 1993.
Here in Ireland, forestry growers are looking at heating their own homes and also selling firewood or wood chips for energy generating.
But farmers cannot play their role if they have been driven off the land by low profitability, as has happened in the vast tracts of Spain and Portugal which burned up this summer.
Here in Ireland, only one in five farms is now sustained solely by farming, and beef and dairy farming profits are heading south.
The EU has left farmers in a very vulnerable position, depending on non-index linked decoupled payments from Brussels, subject to review in 2008 or 2009.
More and more are turning their backs on farming in Europe, deterred by UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's anti-CAP stance.
He wants more spending on technology, less on farming.
But no technology can make up for the environmental consequences of an empty countryside."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10088925.html,2005-09-16 01:00:00,Demand for quality stock sustained,"Plain cattle remain hard to sell, a feature of the trade in recent weeks which has now become established as a pattern of the trade this autumn. That came as a direct fall out of the loss of the premium payments which in previous years underpinned the value of plain cattle.
Hardest hit are the progeny of the intensive dairy herds carrying a high percentage of Holstein blood, which are difficult to finish to beef and normally are poor graders.
The near 100% Holstein is not to be confused with the good British Friesian which have the potential to make R grade. There is a difference of €200-€300 between similar weight Continental and Holstein bullocks in the 500kg weight range.
There was a slight increase in cattle numbers at Bandon Mart yesterday. The heavy bullocks ranged €150 over to €250 over, some of the lighter stores making up to €270 over, while Friesians ranged €40 over to €110 over.
A lot of four Charolais bullocks weighing 530kg sold for €780. Contrast that with a lot of six Friesians weighing 501kg sold for €570. There was no change in heifer prices. Best continental made up to €180 over and Hereford and Angus sold at €50-€120 over.
There were 850 head at Kilkenny Mart. Quality lots were steady and plain cattle hard to sell. Beef bullocks ranged €200-€320 over; 400-500kg stores sold at €120 over to €320 over. Beef heifers made €200-€330.
Heavy bullocks were back €15/head at Blessington Mart selling at €160-€270. Forward stores peaked at €250. Beef heifers made €140-€180 while store heifers ranged €120-€200 over €/kg."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10104742.html,2005-09-17 01:00:00,Live exports increase by 200%,"Exports of weanlings and young stores for the first eight months of the year were increased by more than 200% at 36,449 compared to 11,616 for the same period last year. The outflow of the young stock to European feeders is now close to the 2003 level, when almost 41,000 head were exported live in the first eight months.
Exports have been mainly to Spain and Italy with smaller numbers going to other EU markets.
Export buyers for the continental feeders are competing with Irish feeders for weanlings at the mart sales which has strengthened the market for the quality stock this year. While the export trade is good for suckler producers, the drain on the quality stock out of the country will be reflected in lower supplies of quality finished cattle available to beef processors in 2006.
Irish feeders are also finding it harder to compete with the export buyers for the top stock as of the higher return to feeders on the continent from higher beef prices available allowing them the scope to pay stronger prices for weanlings.
Irish finishers will require a strong beef price at the factories in 2006 to justify the cost of these quality weanlings being purchased.
The trade for weanlings in the marts eased slightly this week, partly due to less shipping activity at some of the marts. The most noticeable feature of the trade has been the widening of the price difference with some of the plain weanlings meeting with weak demand and prices showing a substantial reduction on last year."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10105113.html,2005-09-21 01:00:00,Weanling prices on the slide,"Some of the plain light bull weanlings are selling back to €100-€150 over €/kg and the plain light heifers are making less than €100 over with larger numbers on offer at this weeks sales.
The announcement on the lifting of the ban on OTM cattle, to allow the older animals back into the food chain in Britain after November 7 has dampened the enthusiasm of finishers targeting the spring-early summer trade next year, because it will lead to more domestic supplies of beef on the market in Britain, - a market that Irish exporters have become reliant on for up to 60% of export sales.
Weanling bulls at Kilmallock ranged €190-€300 over e/kg and the heifers made €130-€250 over. Shippers were active at Ennis Mart yesterday where the entry was up on last week, but prices for all types of weanlings were back.
Bulls were easier by €20/head and heifers back €10/head for the quality end of the sale, but the plain animals and light- weights were a hard sell and price were back more.
Shippers were very active in the heifer ring. Some strong prices of up to €400 over €/kg were paid for the choice bulls, but they were the exception with the general run ranging €200-€330 over. Apart from strong prices for a few exceptional heifers - which made up to €400 over - prices generally ranged €120-€220 over.
At Dungarvan Mart where the tops of the weanling bulls made up to €330 over, prices were back for all types of cattle.
Weanling heifers ranged €150-€200 over for the continentals, non-continental breeds making €90-€130 over for the heifers and bulls selling at €100-€200 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10081638.html,2005-09-22 01:00:00,Beef trade and prices turn autumnal,"Processors were aided by the change in the weather to more autumnal conditions, as they reduced the prices for R and O grade stock to a range from 243 to 232 cents/kg (87p to 83p/lb), and they cut prices even deeper by re-introducing the price penalty for over 30 months animals.
Meanwhile, the beef industry tries to assess the impact of the decision in Britain to lift the food chain ban on their Over 30 Months cattle in early November, which will release another 12,000 to 14,000 cattle per week into the UK market, when fully operational.
Here in Ireland, the supply of beef cattle to factories has been building up steadily in recent weeks, and processors seem confident that their price cut will not affect this supply trend.
There was resistance to the lower prices in some parts of the country on Monday, but cattle bookings at other plants remained strong.
Processors have reported an increase in the proportion of over-age cattle in the kill in recent weeks, partly arising from some build-up on farms during August of February 2003 born steers, which now appear to be coming out at the factories.
There is a penalty of 6 cent/kg (2p/lb) for over-age stock at most of the factories this week, while some processors who have higher numbers of OTM cattle in their kill have increased the penalty to 9 cents/kg (3p/lb), and are quoting 235-224 cents/kg (84p to 80p/lb) for these over age cattle.
While suppliers who bred the animals or purchased them as calves, and therefore received premia for these animals in 2003 and 2004, have some financial leeway on their side, finishers who paid high prices for weanlings in 2004 with the premia drawn, or who bought in expensive forward stores this year, are now eating into their single payments to balance their books.
On the beef markets, the trade in Britain has improved this week for some of the middle priced cuts of beef, but this has been counteracted by weaker consumer demand for prime cuts.
Demand for forequarter beef is weaker than usual for this time of the year.
Demand has improved in Italy and is weaker in France, Netherlands and Germany.
Some of the shine on the cull cow trade in recent weeks has dulled, with a weakening of prices in the order of 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) to a base of 201 cents/kg (72p/lb) for the heavy cows, but the quality heavy carcasses are still making 20 cents/kg more.
The supply of cull cows has been strong in recent weeks, with weekly intake running 10% higher than this time last year."

However, during August, the lead on last year was eroded by lower throughput, with the margin dropping to 34,000 head over last year, equivalent to 2% by the end of August.
The fall off has continued into September with the margin now down to just over 0.5%.
Supplies in Britain have shown an increase of 225,000 head produced during the first seven months, amounting to an increase of 3%, while in France production is down by 67,000 head for the period to the end of July
The increase in the supply of lambs in Britain and Ireland during the first eight months of the year has been a major feature of the European trade over the period, which has resulted in a knock-on effect on the volume of Third Country product entering the market.
Bord Bia points out that, according to documents of origin for New Zealand lamb exports this year, while the overall trade to the EU has increased by 4% for the first six months of the year, trade with the UK declined by 8%.
Note: Due to technical difficulties the beef factory pay-sheet prices for last week were not available from the Department of Agriculture yesterday."

Irish sales were already growing in Sweden, Finland and Denmark, and cow beef exports were increasing to France.
But new markets for 70,000 tonnes of Irish beef may be needed to fully compensate for the return of 635,000 UK cattle per year, aged over 30 months, and equivalent to 185,000 tonnes of beef.
November 7 is OTM-Day in the UK beef market, when the over 30 months beef starts to return.
Up to now, these animals were purchased from farmers, for about €1.30 per kg of deadweight, and destroyed by the UK food safety authorities as an anti-BSE measure.
Now, UK farmers say they hope to sell the cows for the current average price being achieved for 03 cows in Ireland, of more than €2 per kg, and dislodge imports.
The imports from Ireland of nearly 264,000 tonnes per year will be most affected, predicts the Meat and Livestock Commission.
The UK beef industry will use the next six weeks to prepare the ground for the smooth re-entry of beef from older UK cattle, with burger processors winding down import commitments, and placing new orders with the dozens of UK companies that are preparing to re-enter the manufacturing beef market.
More than 100 UK slaughtering plants have applied to slaughter OTM bovines, with 53 plants planning to start from the first week.
Dislodged imports are not the only worry for the Irish beef industry, The Meat and Livestock Commission also warned that beef prices could fall in the UK.
They said the UK beef market remains vulnerable, after the 7% price slump for finished cattle in June and July, with the still ""fragile"" state of consumer spending posing a big worry for the beef industry."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10035338.html,2005-09-24 01:00:00,Factories pay 3 cent less for beef,"The average for most categories of cattle dropped by 1-3 cent/kg and cull cow prices were back by up to 6 cent/kg (2p/lb) on the previous week, the latter in line with the lower quoted prices for the week.
The intake of bullocks at the factories was almost similar to the previous week at 20,532 head - 2,300 head less than the same week in 2004 - out of a total kill of 37,716 head, compared to 40,276 for the corresponding week last year. Total intake year to date remains 7% lower than 2004.
Farmer pay sheet returns from the factories show that an average of slightly over 88p/lb was paid for R4L bullocks, down 2 cents/kg on the previous week. The highest factory average was almost 91p/lb paid by Donegal Meats, well ahead of the next highest, Euro Farm Foods at Duleek where the average was 89p/lb, similar to that paid by Slaney Meats at Bunclody. Two of the AIBP factories, Clones and Waterford, Newgrange at Navan and Kildare Chilling all paid averages between 88.3p/lb and 88.6p/lb. The average for O4L bullocks was 84.5p/lb. The group averages for AIBP, Dawn and Kepak were similar at 88p/lb, all lower by 1-2 cents/kg.
The national average for R4L heifers fell by3 cent/kg to just under 89p/lb. Kepak at Clonee paid an average of almost 103p/lb - premium priced heifers included - while Slaney Meats at Bunclody and AIBP at Nenagh paid over 92p/lb average. The average for O4L heifers was slightly lower at 85p/lb. The top price for cull cows was 82p/lb paid by Euro Farm Foods for heavy R3 carcasses, which was 6 cent/kg (2p/lb) lower than the previous week."

Both sides acknowledged there was common ground between Irish and British livestock farmers because of trade.
In a joint statement after the meeting, they stated that price signals for beef are undermining producer confidence that there can be a profitable sustainable future for family farms.
""Livestock farmers are the foundation stone of the beef supply chain. But the supply chain can only work if everybody in the chain producers, livestock marts, processors and retailers makes a profit.
""The fact that suckler farmers and beef finishers in Ireland and Britain will make significant losses this year has serious implications for beef supplies going forward, unless producer confidence can be restored rapidly,"" they said.
The statement said producers had reached make or break. It was unsustainable to spend two years producing high-quality beef cattle to find the bottom had fallen out of the market.
""All players in the supply chain have to accept responsibility to address this issue.""
Both sides agreed that quality beef producers in Ireland and Britain were particularly vulnerable in world trade negotiations and a limit on beef imports from South America had to be agreed.
They announced they would meet again shortly in London."

From the perspective of on-farm numbers, the figure has been in constant decline despite EU supports.
The statistics tell a dramatic story. However, the sector remains vibrant and accounted for over €7 billion of export sales last year, despite intense international competition.
Further progress is expected and the number of dedicated food companies carving out market niches continues to grow.
Ironically, the success of the food sector is not mirrored inside the farm gate where the toll on the farming community continues.
Within ten years the number of full-time commercial farmers mainly in the dairy sector may be down to 15,000 with a further 25,000-to-35,000 part-time farmers continuing to generate more than half or more of their income from beef.
Dairy farmers will be located predominantly in south-east Munster or South Leinster with beef production located in the midlands or the west.
The move to more intensive farming to beat the absence of subsidies has implications too for the west of Ireland where poor land and small holdings have become increasingly marginalised.
Two leading authorities, Profr Liam Downey, former head of Teagasc, and Dr Gordon Purvis of Trinity College, warned in a recent study ('Building a Knowledge Based Multifunctional Economy & Rural Environment) that the demise of the west would cause ""major environmental and socio-economic problems"" if the fall-out from the ongoing reform isn't tackled vigorously.
They conclude that the ""face of rural Ireland will be fundamentally changed in the coming decade and trying to get to grips with the reform facing us will be a major national challenge"".
Farming will be more intensive and increasingly agriculture and food processing will converge in the more productive farming regions. Small farmers will continue to be forced out of the system.
To an extent the cold statistics belie the critical importance of the sector to the economy and Irish food and drinks exports continue to win market share in very tough markets overseas.
Irish food, drink and horticulture exports grew in value by 3% to €7.17 billion despite key challenges, including adverse currency movements. To put that in context the figure accounts for over 55% of exports from indigenous companies.
With the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and sterling, the industry had to face a more competitive environment shaped by retailer consolidation, retail food price deflation and product competition.
The most significant growth sectors in 2004, in terms of value of exports, were prepared foods, dairy products and ingredients and beef, with the sterling and euro currency areas accounting for over two-thirds of exports.
Taking into account the movement of the euro against the dollar and sterling, the underlying growth in food and drinks exports in 2004 was 5%.
Aidan Cotter, chief executive of Bord Bia, in the group's last annual report, noted the challenges facing the sector.
The increase in exports is testament to the ability of Irish companies to innovate and create new products to meet consumer and retailer demand.
""With CAP reform increasing the focus on the marketplace from 2005, the food industry is facing into a defining period in its development. This coupled with short-term adverse exchange rate movements and increased competition will pose considerable challenges,"" said Mr Cotter.
Those challenges were highlighted recently by Kerry Group, and indeed by Glanbia. Chilled foods were hard hit as retailers put pressure on processors to cut prices and, as that trend continues, farmers will come under more pressure to produce at even more competitive prices."

Both sides acknowledged there was common ground between Irish and British livestock farmers because of trade.
In a joint statement after the meeting, they stated that price signals for beef are undermining producer confidence that there can be a profitable sustainable future for family farms.
""Livestock farmers are the foundation stone of the beef supply chain. But the supply chain can only work if everybody in the chain producers, livestock marts, processors and retailers makes a profit.
""The fact that suckler farmers and beef finishers in Ireland and Britain will make significant losses this year has serious implications for beef supplies going forward, unless producer confidence can be restored rapidly,"" they said.
The statement said producers had reached make or break. It was unsustainable to spend two years producing high-quality beef cattle to find the bottom had fallen out of the market.
""All players in the supply chain have to accept responsibility to address this issue.""
Both sides agreed that quality beef producers in Ireland and Britain were particularly vulnerable in world trade negotiations and a limit on beef imports from South America had to be agreed.
They announced they would meet again shortly in London."

Prices at Kilkenny Mart fell sharply with up to €60/head knocked off trading for the plain bullocks as demand for poor quality animals slumped and many plain Holstein blood bullocks were a hard sell.
There was an entry of 650 head (1,250 last week) with trade for all types of stock quieter. Quality bullocks fell €20-€30/head, but plain cattle suffered the heaviest fall. Bullocks over 500kg ranged €60-€270 over. A lot of five Charolais weighing 507kg sold for €760, four Herefords scaling 583kg making €650, and seven quality Friesians weighing 588kg made €690. Lighter bullocks (under 400kg) made up to €225 over €/kg with some of the continentals selling back to €40 over. Two Charolais scaling 345kg made €545, two Limousin weighing 311kg sold for €350, and a lot of six Friesians at 385kg fetched €395.
Prices for quality heifers were maintained at yesterday’s sales but prices for plain heifers were down €30/head. Beef heifers made €100-€230 over and stores made €50-€200 over.
The entry at Bandon Mart was also back yesterday. Bullock prices were steady at last week’s prices, heavy bullocks making up to €260 over, lighter animals ranging €150-€220 over and Friesians making up to €90 over. Best continental heifers made up to €170 over and Hereford and Angus heifers ranged €60-€100 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10081344.html,2005-10-01 01:00:00,Cattle supplies to remain stable,"But the unusual circumstances which prevailed during the final months of 2004, in the lead up to the changeover from headage-based premia to the direct single payment structure, will be absent from the equation this year and could result in a bigger carry over of forward cattle into the New Year than occurred last year.
Bord Bia reports that throughput at the export factories for the first nine months of the year was down by 70,000 head, equal to 7%, which was largely accounted for a drop in bullock disposals of almost 11%, while heifer supplies were more than 9% lower.
Trade was very strong for finished cattle on the back of scarce supplies up to the middle of May, during which prices were 10% higher than last year.
This was followed by a period of gradual easing back over the following two months before competition from South American beef in Britain and continental Europe led to the worst collapse in prices for several years.
On the favourable side, beef consumption throughout the EU has now recovered to levels on par with the mid-1990s which is benefiting the trade, but concern for Irish and EU producers is the extent to which imported beef is now supplying the market with very competitive beef.
The autumn promotion for beef within the EU which has been undertaken by Bord Bia is the most extensive ever, linking in with EU retailers and Irish suppliers. The promotion of clearly identified Irish beef is taking place in eight countries over the next two months.
The organisation reports that initial feedback has been very positive in terms of the effectiveness of the promotion on demand for Irish beef. The target is to strengthen the position of Irish beef in markets such as Italy, Holland, and France."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/yourview/arid-10074292.html,2005-10-04 01:00:00,FG view on the fall of farming,"When we left government in 1997, agriculture was in a much healthier state.
In 1997, when the FG-led Rainbow Government left office, there were 130,000 active farmers. Seven years on, this figure has fallen to 113,000.
Since 1997, when FF took office, seven farmers abandon farming every day.
In 1997, before FG left office, average farm income stood at €14,000. Since then, incomes have continued to fall. Recent figures indicate that, in real terms, average farm income stands at €11,000, while the average industrial wage is €30,000.
In 1997 the FG-led government spent €60m on farm pollution grants, yet in 2004 this Government spent only €17m on the same scheme, a cutback of 70%. This does not even factor in building inflation. Is this the type of ‘environmental policy’ that FF are so afraid of?
Deputy Kelleher should tell farmers why...
Since this government came into office, farm incomes have declined by an unprecedented 25% in real terms. Average farm income is now just half the average industrial wage, compared to over two-thirds in 1997. Average farm income in 2003 was just over €15,000.
The price of milk which a farmer receives has remained stagnant for a decade while input costs have soared. The price of cattle at factories and at marts has been reduced in some cases by 50%, yet the cost to the farmer has increased. This is best exemplified by the inaction at Government and EU levels on Brazilian beef imports and the fact that an inspection of the Brazilian meat industry, due to take place last April, was postponed after it emerged that the Brazilian cattle-tagging and traceability schemes had been abandoned. This is an appalling situation and again highlights the fact that there is one very regulated system for Irish farmers producing beef for EU consumers, but there is a very lax regime for Brazilian farmers producing beef for the same market. Is it any wonder that Brazilian beef can be produced for €2.90/kg compared to €9.50/kg for Irish beef?
The cost of inputs has risen with no comparable increase in revenue to farmers. Energy, veterinary and fertiliser costs have all increased while prices received by farmers fell substantially since this Government came to power.
Many farmers believe that regulation and red tape from the Department of Agriculture has become excessively burdensome, and is now a major cost factor in farm competitiveness.
Figures are proof, if further proof were needed, that many farmers are continuing to experience real hardships and that the pay-off between what the farmer is putting in and getting back is being squeezed more and more.
Instead of scaremongering, it would be more in Deputy Kelleher’s line to lobby his farm minister and Government to safeguard the livelihood of those farmers still struggling to stay in business.

“Losses on that scale, where input costs and regulation are increasing, are simply not sustainable and are leading to an absolutely disgraceful income situation facing beef producers,” he said.
Mr O’Leary said that at current prices farmers are being left with little choice because beef production is becoming uneconomic."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10110928.html,2005-10-14 01:00:00,Cattle price rise continues,"Numbers of cattle on offer at yesterday’s sales were maintained or increased on last week and matched by a good attendance of buyers at the ringsides where there was a greater sense of confidence in the trade forward.
At Bandon Mart there was “a very good trade at a fine sale of cattle” with the emphasis on quality maintained. Forward continental bullocks sold for up to €290 over euro/kg while the heavy Friesian bullocks ranged €55 - €90 over.
A 605kg Charolais sold for €810, a lot of five Charolais weighing 536kgs made €805, 12 Limousin scaling 496kgs fetched €785, seven Friesians weighing 521kg made €610 and 10 Angus 328kg made €460. The good trade last week for heifers was maintained. Forward continental heifers made up to €155 over.
A good entry of 900 head at Kilkenny was matched by a very lively trade with quality bullocks and heifers showing an improvement of €40 - €50/head especially for the quality animals. The heavy bullocks made €90 - €370 over euro/kg, medium weights topping at €230 over and light stores making up to €200 over. Up to €270 over was paid for beef heifers, with stores making up to €250 over.
There was a big sale at Ennis Mart where there was an improvement in prices for older cattle and the forward stores with 2003-born bullocks showing gains of up to €30/head. The 2004-born store bullocks were stronger by €10 - €15/head and heifers improved by up to €20/head."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10113012.html,2005-10-15 01:00:00,Brazilian beef ban to boost Irish prices,"IFA livestock committee chairman John Bryan said farmers with beef cattle to sell are determined to secure an immediate and significant price increase from factories on the back of very tight supplies and the EU Brazilian beef ban.
The Brazilian case and resultant EU ban will remove over 200,000 tonnes of beef from the market, equivalent to half of all Irish exports in a full year. This will leave beef supplies extremely scarce and should immediately drive strong demand for finished cattle, he said.
Mr Bryan said the factories blamed Brazilian beef imports for cutting beef prices by 25c/kg (10p/lb) in a two to three- week period in June-July this year. Farmers are now expecting prices to lift by an equivalent amount.
It was essential that farmers get the full value of their livestock. The price offered by the factories for cattle over the last number of weeks was undervaluing stock by at least e100 per head, he said.
ICSA beef committee chairman Robin Smith said: “Although the EU has only banned beef imports from the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana and Sao Paulo, the vast majority of Brazilian beef exports comes from these three states. Sao Paulo alone is stated to be responsible for 70% of all Brazilian beef exports.
“This ban will leave Europe short of beef and Russia, which imported well over 300,000 tons of beef from Brazil to date this year, will have to now look elsewhere.”"

Brazil’s President Lula, on a European trip, denied his government had skimped on funds for farmers to vaccinate cattle, and said farmers were also to blame.
However, further long-term damage may be done to Brazil’s beef industry by the government’s critics, who say the finance ministry withheld €1.2m allocated in this year’s budget to control of animal diseases.
Unfavourable exchange rates and high interest rates may have forced the government and farmers to cut animal health costs, and led to last week’s cases of O-type foot and mouth, even though all Brazilian cattle are supposed to be vaccinated twice annually against this strain of the virus. This year, the government is accused of having spent only 1.57% of the money budgeted for fighting foot and mouth disease.
Mato Grosso do Sul, where foot and mouth was found last week, is said to have not received any government funds this year for fighting the disease. The EU has also barred meat from the neighbouring states of Parana and Sao Paulo.
Brazil has been hardest by its biggest overseas food customer, Russia, which has banned imports not only of beef, but also of pork, chicken, live animals, milk and other dairy products, animal feed based on animal protein and any equipment used to process meat in Mato Grosso.
Israel, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, Indonesia and South Africa also imposed partial or total bans.
However, no ban had yet been reported earlier this week in Egypt, which takes 17,920 tons of Brazilian beef per month.
The EU ban applies to all de-boned and matured bovine meat slaughtered on and after September.
The European Commission says it does not have a regional breakdown of exports of beef from Brazil.
But beef industry sources say the EU ban covers 55 to 60% of exports to the EU, and 60% of all Brazilian beef processing establishments.
Brazil’s National Farm Federation foreign trade chief Antonio Donizeti warned the foot-and-mouth outbreak would cost his country between €420m and €840m this year.
It could take up to two years for the beef industry to recover its status as the world’s largest beef exporter, said Mr Donizeti.
Not only is Brazil likely to relinquish its No 1 position in beef exports; negotiations on opening up beef exports to the US, which had been going well, may also be scrapped.
Otavio Cancado, senior adviser at the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporters, said total export activity would not be badly affected, because Brazil had plenty of beef and export-approved abattoirs in other states.
Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, the president of the association of Brazilian exporters, also downplayed the impact, saying 90% of Brazil’s cattle herd is totally free of foot and mouth.
But there has been a strong reaction at the highest level in Brazil, with agriculture minister Roberto Rodrigues appearing on national television, promising money to overcome the crisis.
And President Lula has appealed to Portugal’s president to help in explaining to the EU what has been done to contain the spread of foot and mouth, and trying to get the EU to lift its ban.
But it seems inevitable that the EU ban will last at least 60 days. The emphasis is on keeping out the virus, which remains alive for months in frozen carcasses, and also survives in hides.
The Brazil beef ban by at least 30 importers could drive up international beef prices, resulting in international political pressures to lift the ban as soon as possible."

Sources in Brazil have warned that their loss of output could drive international beef prices so high that the foot and mouth ban will be short-lived.
For the moment, there is no country which can fill the gap if a large part of Brazil’s exports are blocked, said Jose Vicente Ferraz, the technical director of FNP Consultoria, a private Brazilian consulting firm that examines world agricultural data.
Australia had suffered a 10-year drought that led to a sharp reduction in its herd. Their herd rebuilding programe has cut into their slaughter throughput, and will limit Australian beef production for several years.
Argentina is still recovering from a severe economic crisis, and their beef exports are already at their upper limit.
The EU has gone from exporter to net importer, and the US is suffering the repercussions of two cases of mad cow disease.
FNP experts predicted that the ban on Brazilian beef may last only a few weeks, if the government takes the necessary measures to curb the outbreak of FMD, and carefully explains to importing countries the steps it has taken.
But Irish cattle farmers are determined to make the most of any world beef scarcity, and the EU’s ban on Brazilian beef from three states, estimated to rule out more than half of the beef which comes to Europe from Brazil.
IFA National Livestock Committee Chairman John Bryan said farmers with beef cattle to sell are very determined to secure an immediate and significant price increase from factories here.
He said there’s already a severe scarcity in Ireland of the cattle under 30 months which are needed for prime export markets.
“Some factories have been forced to cancel kills because they cannot get enough stock,” said Mr Bryan.
Sell hard and get the full value of your livestock, he advised farmers.
According to IFA’s figures, the Brazilian ban will remove more than 200,000 tonnes of beef from the EU market, equivalent to half of Ireland’s annual exports. This would leave beef supplies extremely scarce, and should immediately drive strong demand for finished cattle.
Robin Smith, chairman of the Irish Cattle and Sheepfarmers Association’s beef committee, advised farmers to hold back cattle, with a view to getting 2.80/kg or £1/lb for R grade animals.
Sao Paulo alone, one of three states which cannot now send beef to the EU, is said to supply 70% of Brazil’s beef exports, said Mr Smith. Russia, which took more than 300,000 tons of beef from Brazil to date this year, will also have to look elsewhere. “Ireland, which has the lowest beef price in the EU, is the obvious country to benefit most”, he said.

There was some variation in the prices being paid, with factories in the midlands and north pushed towards paying higher prices than their colleagues in the south, where the supply factor was not as critical, and where weather conditions worsened in the early days of this week.
Most factories up country quoted 246 cents/kg (88p/lb), but paid 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) for under 30 months, R grade animals, which they found hard to get in significant numbers.
The O grade stock were quoted at 235 cents/kg (84p/lb), an improvement of up to 9 cents/kg (3p/lb) on last week, but were actually bought for 241 cents/kg (86p/lb), and some producers with a mix of mainly higher grading animals were negotiating flat price deals for the lot with factories.
In the south, the supply situation appeared not to be as tight, and with very bad weather during the early days of the week, a good percentage of Monday’s kill was purchased at 246 cents/kg (88p/lb) for Rs.
The price improvement came through the second half of last week and has continued this week, with the processors finding it more and more difficult to get adequate numbers of young stock. The supply of under 30 months animals has tightened somewhat earlier than expected, and the price lift has resulted a week sooner than anticipated.
A gradual improvement should be maintained for the next six weeks, until orders for Christmas are completely filled, unless there is an unexpected market disruption or unforeseen increase in young cattle supplies.
The rising tide has been lifting all boats, and the improvement in prices for the young stock, has resulted in a corresponding lift in prices cattle over 30 months, which are still very plentiful in the south.
The prices for cull cows are also improved, by at least 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) with a base of up to 207 cents/kg (74p/lb) on offer, and the quality R grade cows worth at least 20 cents/kg (7p/lb) more."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10033651.html,2005-10-20 01:00:00,Finger on the financial pulse at Mogeely,"ONE of the many indicators of farmers' financial health at the Ploughing Championships at Mogeely in Co Cork was the busy queue at the Irish Examiner marquee, when 500 seats for a personal finance advice session by financial pundit Eddie Hobbs were snapped up.
The star of TV has been warning of fast rising consumer debt levels in Ireland, predicting a downward trend in consumer spending, because people just can't borrow any more.
""You hit a brick wall when your lifestyle debt hits 1 to 1.5 times your income,"" he told listeners at the Ploughing.
Are farm families any better at controlling their expenditure? The strong interest in what Hobbs had to say pointed to financial problems also in the largely agricultural audience.
Not far away, the danger of runaway lifestyles was being confirmed the people who know more about farmers' financial affairs than anyone else - their accountants.
On the Irish Farm Accounts Co-Op stand at the Ploughing, Pat Comerford said, ""The cost of living has spiralled in the last 10 years, and farm incomes have not kept in line with it. So a lot of people are borrowing to maintain a lifestyle and farming won't be able to sustain that.""
Does that mean that those people are borrowing dangerously? ""They're just trying to have a lifestyle that is comparable with other people in their age group. A lot of those people are working much harder just to stand still.""
""Twenty years ago, the price of cattle, the price of grain and the price of milk were fairly similar to today, but the costs have multiplied several times.""
Pat Comerford, who works in the Kilkenny office of IFAC, a part of the country with a solid record of good farming, says older people are less affected.
""They all lived at a time when there was less comfort in their lives. They can manage better without the things that everyone in the younger age groups has nowadays.""
Does that suggest an exodus of younger people out of farming in the coming years?
""Not so much an exodus as the lack of an influx of young people, because they don't see the cash in it at the end of the week. A lot of the people who have taken up the Farm Retirement Scheme did not have a son or a daughter to follow them on the farm.""
""A big proportion of the people taking over farms now have a PAYE income as well.""
Is any group of farmers doing better than in the past?
According to Pat, there is one group.
""I notice that farmers who can sell direct to the customer are making an awful lot more money on similar sized farms than farmers who are selling their milk, their beef or their sheep in the traditional way.""
Not every farmer has the opportunity to by-pass the middlemen. But when a man who spends his time looking at every type of farm account makes a statement based on those accounts, he should be listened to.
How does he see the general condition of farmers, as they head into a new era dominated by the post Fischler CAP regime?
""I would describe it as a mild depression across the whole industry, especially for the 30 to 45 years age group.
Paddy Horgan is Agri Business Manager with ACC Bank. He has been dealing with farmers since 1973 and has seen good times and bad times for farmers and for the bank.
He was also at the Ploughing.
""I have seen five or six periods of good times and the same number of periods of bad times - it goes in cycles.""
How does he see the situation of farmers at present?
""We tend to talk about dairying, but the beef situation is bigger, and affects far more people. We have to develop a market where there's a profit for the producer, a profit for the processor and a profit for the retailer.""
""That's not the situation at the moment, because so many producers are not getting a profit.""
""Producers are not going to produce unless they see a profit, and with the new Single Farm Payment system, they don't have to.""
Lending is very active, according to the ACC man, but is very specific.
The bad memories of the early eighties were a learning experience for everybody. Today's farming borrowers have had a long history of loans and repayments. That makes to-days lending very different, says Paddy Horgan.
""It is easier than it used be to pick out the entrepreneur, the farmer who has made progress, made the right decisions and done things well. What we are doing as an agri unit within the bank is to pick the winners for the next 10 years.""
""In dairying, we have to forecast the net margin per litre over the period of the loan. In livestock, we have to look at size of the farm as well as the efficiency. We'd like to see a drystock farmer with two hundred acres or more. We can give him money to scale up his business without buying land. He can rent land, or rent sheds, provided he has a good base to start with.""
What are farmers borrowing for?
""At the moment about 20% of the lending is going into land purchase, and about 15% is going into foreign property investment. The other 65% is made up of a mix of farm investments. Some farmers are hoping to get more milk quota and are actually doing their dairy and building up-grades in advance. Other farmers are streamlining their yards and buildings to make part-time farming less laborious.""
What sort of loan would be typical for land purchase?
""A lot of them would be in the €200,000 to €500,000 range, but very often there might be other elements, like the sale of sites, or part of the purchased land, or a house or even part of the existing farm.""
""In the past, all those arrangements would have had to be tightly agreed, but nowadays lenders will rely heavily on the record of the client.""
""A good farmer is a good businessman. He'll rock and roll with the markets and the opportunities and he'll change to meet the circumstances.

Intake of bullocks fell to 15,790 head - more than 30% down on the same week last year - leaving a deficit of almost 7,000 head on the intake for the same week in 2004. Total throughput for the week was 10,000 head less than the corresponding week last year at 32,634 head.
The factories paid an average of 7-9 cent/kg more for cattle on average, an average improvement of up to 3p/lb. An average of 89p/lb was paid for R4L bullocks, with a top price of over 93p/lb average being paid by Donegal Meats. Ten factories paid averages of more than 90p/lb. While a majority of the factories paid around 89p/lb average four plants bought supplies for an average of less than 88p/lb. Factories which paid averages of 90p/lb included Jennings, Newgrange, Moyvalley, Euro Foods, Slaney Meats and Liffey Meats.
The national average paid for O4L bullocks was slightly shy of 86p/lb, with 90p/lb average being paid at Donegal.
Heifer prices topped the bullocks by more than 1p/lb with a national average of 90.6p/lb paid for R4L. The top price was 105p/lb average at Kepak, Clonee - which included the premium on contract supplies - while Donegal Meats paid an average of almost 93p/lb, Slaney Meats over 92p/lb, AIBP, Nenagh 92p/lb and Dawn, Waterford slightly less. The overall average for O4L heifers was 85p/lb.
Prices for O and P grade cows improved by 6-9 cents/kg (2p-3p/lb), AIBP Clones paying an average of 76p/lb for O grade and Euro Farm Foods paying 74p/lb for P+4 grade. The top price for R grade - 81p/lb at Euro - was unchanged."

Supplies are tightening also in Britain.
This is attributed to some movement away from poultry meat due to the bird flu scare.
Supermarket chains are also turning against Brazilian beef, following the country’s outbreak of foot and mouth disease, which has sparked an EU ban on exports from three regions of the country.
The EU has banned imports of de-boned and matured bovine meat slaughtered in three Brazilian states on and after September 29.
The combination of factors has led to a strong trade for a reduced supply of cattle available to factories in Ireland, and prices are tending upwards.
There is a general quote of 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) for R grade animals at the factories, most of which quoted 241 cents/kg (86p/lb) for O grade.
But processors have been finding it difficult to buy cattle at the quoted prices.
There are fairly widespread reports of 6 to 9 cents/kg (2p or 3p/lb) more being paid in parts of the south and midlands.
Farmers selling beef cattle in the north west report up to 14 cents/kg (5p/lb) more being paid for good quality cattle.
Cattle supplies are strongest in the south this week, following heavy rain.
But supplies are tight in the east of the country and midlands.
The intake at factories has fallen more than 7,000 head per week compared to the same time last year.
The steer supply accounts for between 5,000 and 6,000 head of the fall-off.
This scale of decline was not indicated in supply projections for the second half of the year.
The trend is being attributed to farmers reacting to poor autumn price with earlier housing of more of their cattle than usual, which are being held back to target an expected stronger market later in the year or early in 2006.
Cull cow prices at the factories are holding or improved this week.
Some factories have quoted improvements of up to 6 cents/kg (2p/lb), bringing the base price to 212 cents/kg (76p/lb), but up to 232 cents/kg (83p/lb) can be got for quality heavy carcasses. There is a strong trade in France for cow hinds."

“I am looking for a turnout of at least 5,000 farmers. Agriculture must not be sold out for other industries in the trade talks,” he said.
Mr Dillon is also seeking an urgent meeting with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and has urged Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan to reject Mr Mandelson’s latest offer which, he said, is beyond the negotiating mandate given to him by the EU member states.
Speaking at a Cork Central IFA celebration to mark the association’s golden jubilee, he said further concessions on import tariffs would have grave consequences for Irish and European farmers, as food production in the EU would no longer be profitable for the vast majority of producers.
Mr Mandelson insists, however, he has remained within his negotiating mandate with his latest bottom line offer to nearly halve the EU’s average tariff on agricultural imports to just over 12%. He also repeated an earlier EU pledge to eliminate all agricultural export support by an agreed date, if others do likewise.
ICMSA leader Pat O’Rourke called for an Irish veto on the proposals and ICSA president Malcolm Thompson said the future of family farms is being sold out to deliver concessions on industry and services.
Cormac Healy, Meat Industry Ireland, which represents processors, warned that the proposals will expose the EU market for beef and lamb to significant increases in imports of lower-priced product from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, New Zealand and Australia.
Meanwhile, Minister Mary Coughlan said she remains concerned about a number of aspects in the negotiations, especially the further tariff cuts offered and the threat to the EU’s system of direct payments.
But the Commission’s latest offer reiterates clearly that the EU is not prepared to contribute to a new agreement at any price.
WTO director general Pascal Lamy said the new EU offer to cut farm tariffs was serious and deserved consideration while Oxfam said it appears to give some hope to unblock the world trade talks."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10085855.html,2005-11-03 00:00:00,Beef price rises despite supply hike,"Bullock supplies to the factories increased by over 4,000 head on the previous week as the strong improvement in prices tempted producers to sell, pushing intake to 20,000 head. The intake of heifers increased by 1,100 to 8,284, and strong cull cows supply pushed the numbers at the plants to 39,486 head, 7,000 head up on the previous week.
The strong increase in supply may have influenced a slowing in the rate of price increase with an average gain of 6c/kg (2p/lb) for bullocks compared to 8c/kg (3p/lb) the previous week. The increase in heifer prices was less than the bullocks.
The processors paid an average of 91p/lb for R4L bullocks and just under 88p/lb average for O4L grade. Donegal Meats paid over 95p/lb average for R4L bullocks, with 92p/lb going at Euro Farm Foods, Duffys, and Slaney and slightly less at Newgrange and Moyvalley. Group averages at all three major processors came in below the national average. AIBP bought their supply at an average of 90.6p/lb and Dawn and Kepak both paid averages of 90p/lb - but the price increase at all three groups was 2p/lb.
The overall average for R4L heifers was 91.4p/lb. Apart from Kepak at Clonee paying 108p/lb - including premium for contract heifers - Donegal Meats paid 94p/lb, and Slaney, AIBP at Nenagh, and Meadow Meats averages in excess of 93p/lb. The national average for O4L was just under 88p/lb.
The highest price for cull cows was steady at 82p/lb for R4 grade at Euro Foods, while O grade were 78p/lb at Exel and Euro paid over 75p/lb for O grade. Moyvalley, Liffeys, AIBP at Clones and Kepak at Clonee were also strong on cow prices."

The domestic beef and lamb sectors in the EU cannot sustain import tariff cuts in the order of 50 to 60%, according to MII.
“Whether or not this offer is within the mandate laid down by EU Agriculture Ministers, or whether or not this really is the final offer from the EU, the one thing that is clear is that an outcome on WTO along these lines will have serious consequences for beef and lamb production and primary processing in Ireland,” said Mr Healy.
“Greater import access to the EU market and dramatically reduced potential for EU exports outside the Community”, was his assessment of the proposals put to the WTO by EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson.
Mr Healy said 150,000 tonnes per annum of steak cuts such as striploin is already imported into the EU, after full import tariffs are paid. Tariff cuts now proposed would make additional imports of round cuts possible, by reducing them from 12% above the EU price today to 21% below the EU price in the future.
“Furthermore, the lower import tariffs have the potential to open up the EU market to forequarter beef imports destined for the manufacturing sector,” said Mr Healy.
“The real threat is that if these products can compete on the EU market having paid the full tariff then there will be no limit on the volume that can enter.”
Lamb imports currently take place under specific preferential import quotas at reduced or zero tariff. Other imports are not possible, but the tariff cuts now proposed would expose the EU market to imports of particular cuts such as legs or loins, according to MII."

""Whether we like it or not, we are playing on a global pitch"", farmers were told by the former Food Safety Authority chief executive.
He referred to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the move to a more competitive orientated policy, with a planned further expansion of the EU, the emergence of China as a dominant player and inevitably, increased liberalisation of trade by the WTO.
""We are now facing times as challenging, if not more so, that in the past 50 years"".
""Brazil, for instance, has 190 million cattle and it is only a matter of time before they get their act together and get their standards up to speed.""
Dr Wall said a level playing field for rules and regulations is needed, however, in the global scene if there is to be a fair contest, ""because the cost of compliances is compromising us here.""
Dr Wall said disputes between farmers and processors, who are competing on the global stage, only distract from the efforts that they should be making together outside of Ireland.
""There will have to be some meeting of minds, some partnership approach, mutual respect and trust going forward together,"" he said.
He said farmers have to take stock as business people. They are sitting on valuable assets (land). He did not believe land was going to get cheaper in Ireland, because ""The Bull McCabe is in all of us.""
He said farmers have to consider when they are hosing down the yard, they are an €8 an hour person, but when they are sitting at their desk trying to maximise a return on their assets, they are on €250 an hour.
Dr Wall said some farmers are currently being encouraged to invest their decoupled payment into buying property abroad.
""I think that would be a wrong thing to do for farmers who are serious about staying in farming in Ireland. It would send the wrong signal to young farmers. That is a recipe for us to fail.""
He advised the Cork IFA members that good animal health status is the foundation for the livestock sector.
""We have to work to produce consistent quality in our dairy and beef sector. At the moment we have not got that consistency.
""There is too much variation. Improved genetics will create the potential and improved nutrition will deliver it,"" he said.
""We need to have evidence to support our claims that we are the little green island, the bread basket of Europe.
""We could fall into the trap of believing our own propaganda. We have to have some substance behind it. We have a lot of systems to support our claims, but we need to stitch them together,"" he said.
Dr Wall said the IFA in Cork has some of the country's top farmers and business people, who are in the vanguard of change and will lead the way.
The calibre of young people in Macra na Feirme also gave him hope for the future.
He recalled that Diarmaid O'Sullivan, the Cork hurling full back, was asked, after the All Ireland, if he had been worried, and he replied that the players had the skill, were match fit and had the belief.
""That's important,"" concluded Dr Wall. ""If you don't believe you can succeed, you are setting yourself up to fail."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-10085972.html,2005-11-09 00:00:00,Repeal to trigger supermarket price war,"The consumer boost is set to be triggered by the Government’s long anticipated decision to repeal the Groceries Order which prevents retailers passing on certain discounts they get from suppliers to customers.
The move could save families up to €1,000 a year, according to Rip Off Republic presenter Eddie Hobbs.
Mr Martin stressed he would also be beefing-up competition laws in a bid to reassure independent traders who fear the abolition will see them swept out of the market by chain stores.
The Enterprise Minister said he did not rule out having the new regime in place by Christmas, however Oireachtas observers saw that as optimistic given the amount of parliamentary time which would be needed to effect the changes.
Mr Martin insisted the Government had “no option” but to revoke the order as it had acted against the interests of consumers for the past 18 years.
“There is substantial evidence that consumers are paying higher prices because of the order,” he said.
The minister pointed to the fact food inflation in the Republic since 1996 had risen three times faster than in Britain and by twice the EU average.
Mr Martin added the Groceries Order was “flawed”, difficult to enforce and had not stopped 2,500 shops going out of business since it was introduced in 1987.
Mr Martin insisted community businesses would be protected by strengthening the Competition Act 2002 to guard against “predatory pricing” - whereby supermarket chains try to force small competitors to shut by reducing the price of “loss leaders” intended to lure in customers.
New regulations will also be brought-in to prohibit the use of “hello money” - where retailers receive a non-invoiced payment for stocking certain goods.
Independent retail groups such as RGDATA warned that the abolition would lead to the closure of many family-run corner shops who could not compete on price against the chains.
But the Competition Authority welcomed the abolition of the order, which it branded “one of the most anti-consumer and protectionist devices from the Irish statute book.”
The Society of St Vincent de Paul said it supports cheaper food choices, but does not believe the repeal will achieve this in the absence of wider changes.
National Consumer Agency chairperson Ann Fitzgerald described the move as a “triumph for the Irish consumer. She added that less well-off households, who spend proportionately more on groceries, stood to benefit most."

Mr Rodrigues had frequently complained about Ministry of Finance delays in funding measures against the disease. Last week he also said delays in official tests of a suspected outbreak in the neighbouring state of Parana were bad for Brazil. ""We are working to have the tests performed and obtain conclusive results as quickly as possible"", he said. Parana has nine suspected outbreaks. Reports of outbreaks in three other states cannot be confirmed.
Export bans in about 50 countries have reduced Brazil's cattle sales by $68m in October, and a predicted $100m in November, said Antonio Camardelli, executive director of the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporters.
The president of the National Beef Cattle Council, Sebastião Guedes, said annual exports of up to $800 million may be lost, and Brazil's entry into high-price markets such as Japan, the US and Southeast Asia delayed. He called for Paraguay and Bolivia, neighbouring countries with foot and mouth problems, to participate in eradicating it, and for Ecuador and Venezuela to combat the disease also.
Government sources still hope Brazilian beef exports can resume before the end of the year, which would bring relief for the industry's workforce of approximately 1m.
* Meanwhile, Lebanon continues to take Brazil's live cattle of which 13,000 sailed on November 2. Danish Crown, a well-known brand owned by Danish farmers, has begun importing Brazilian beef to repackage and sell in Europe."

The increase of 4,000 head per week didn’t relieve pressure on processors to pay higher prices, and is unlikely to be sustained this week.
Most processors have been quoting 257 to 264 cents/kg (92p to 88p/lb) for R and O grade animals this week, but they are finding it impossible to buy cattle at these prices and in general, farmers have been getting 3 to 6 cents/kg (1p or 2p/lb) more than these quotes across most of the south and east of the country. Prices in the North West are now around 269 cents/kg (96p/lb) and rising for R grade animals.
The lift in supply probably included the last of the stock which had not been housed. Finishers who have housed cattle will bargain harder before selling and many with cattle fit to sell will target the end of this month and the early days of December for the best returns, as processors search for cattle to fill their Christmas orders.
The supply of cattle relative to processors’s beef market demands will determine if farmers are making the right decision.
The greater deficit in cattle supply since early autumn - the steer intake is down 77,000 head compared to last year - indicates there must be more cattle on farms than last year.
Whether they will come to market before the end of the year or are being targeted for the early spring trade remains to be seen.
The trade for beef has improved in Britain, where supplies are also tight, and the lifting of the OTM ban from Monday last is unlikely to have a big impact immediately.
A good sign of the trade is the strong demand for cull cows.
Prices at the factories have increased by 6 cents/kg (2p/lb) to provide a base price of up to 218 cents/kg (78p/lb) at the factories this week.
Suppliers with good quality R grade cows should be getting at least 232 cents/kg (83p/lb), with some of these making even more this week, as the trade continues to firm."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10085661.html,2005-11-10 00:00:00,Factory beef price increases slow,"Farmer pay sheet returns from the processors show the national average price paid for R4L bullocks and heifers improved by two cents/kg last week down from a gain of 6c/kg achieved the previous week. All of the major processing groups paid averages below the national figure, a first indication of stronger resistance to the higher cost of cattle which has been pushed by scarcity.
A national average of 91.5c/lb was paid for R4L bullocks, while R4L heifers averaged 92.3c/lb. Prices paid for O4L bullocks averaged 88c/lb with similar grade heifers slightly weaker at an average of 87.5c/lb.
Factory slaughterings for the week show that the increase in supply was short-lived. The supply of bullocks dropped 3,000 head to 16,884 - compared with over 21,000 the same week last year - and total throughput last week was back to 33,275 head, down 10,000 head on the same week in 2004.
The top price paid for R4L bullocks was just under 96c/lb at Donegal Meats which was almost identical to the previous week. Seven factories paid averages over 92.2c/lb or better - Donegal, Newgrange, AIBP at Clones, Dawn at Waterford, Duffys, Moyvalley and Liffeys - while the majority paid averages between 91c/lb and 92c/lb.
Trade was stronger at the top for R4L grade heifers with nine factories paying over 93c/lb. The top price for R grade cull cows was improved by 1c/lb to 83c/lb average at Euro Foods and O4H averaging 78.5c/lb at Exel was also 1c/lb stronger."

There were more plain cattle on offer at some of yesterday’s sales which may have contributed to the downward pressure on prices, but the trend all season has been for the brunt of any easing in the trade to hit the plain animals first and heaviest.
There was a smaller sale of bullocks at Bandon, where there was demand for quality lots but plainer lots were a harder sell. Heavy bullocks ranged €140-€210 over €/kg, light stores made €120-200 over and Friesians sold from €10 over to €120 over for the better frame animals. Heifer trade was steady. Best continentals made €165 over and Hereford and Angus sold at €60-€120 over. Two Simmentals 505kg sold for €700, five Herefords 544kg made €745, two Angus 475kg made €650, and seven Friesians 484kg sold for €605.
There were 1,000 head on offer at Kilkenny and while prices were maintained for quality animals there was an increase in the plain cattle on offer which proved harder to sell.
The heavy bullocks ranged €60-€290 over and medium weight stores sold at €70-€270 over. Two Charolais 600kg sold for €645, two Belgian Blues 650kg made €920, a Simmental 702kg sold for €995, and three Friesians 644kg made €700. In the lighter animals two Charolais 360kg made €500 and three Herefords 387kg sold for €520.
Beef and store heifers ranged €100-€250. Three Charolais 362 kgs made €480 and four Simmentals 455 kgs sold for €710."

Exports of calves are also showing a substantial increase. For the year to date over 57,000 head have been exported, an increase of 22,000 head on the same period last year.
Total live exports to the middle of October amounted to 147,246. Live exports for the same period last year was almost 97,000 head.
The export trade for weanlings in 2005 has been assisted by a small drop in prices following the transfer of farm supports from headage to the Single Farm Payment, and strong demand on the continent where some of the EU payments will not be decoupled from production until 2006.
This explains a more than doubling of the live exports to continental EU this year, while live exports to Britain are down 43%.
The strong live export trade has made a vital contribution to supporting the market for weanlings this year, which has returned well for suckler farmers who feared a downturn in the aftermath of the decoupling.
Although the headage based support of up to €540/head for male weanlings over their lifetime to slaughter ended with the change over the SFP on January 1 last, prices for weanling bulls have averaged 89% of the 2004 prices for beef breed animals according to the Department of Agriculture mart reports.

Most of the factories quoted 260-252 cents/kg (93p-90p/lb) for R/O grade animals, an increase of 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) for R grade while O grade improved by 6 cents/kg (2p/lb).
The actual buying price for cattle this week has been closer to 266 cents/kg (95p/lb) for R grade in direct deals with the factories, with some producers securing 93p-94p/lb flat price for lots of cattle with a high percentage of R’s.
Markets in Britain and the Continent have improved over the past week.
Demand has sharpened and prices have edged upwards, but the supply of cattle has become an issue for processors and intake falls far below normal for this time of the year. Following a brief surge a few weeks ago, when the intake of steers drew on par with the corresponding week in 2004, the supply has fallen well behind.
Most recent returns show weekly intake of steers more than 4,000 head lower than last year with the total throughput at the factories falling 25% under 2004 at 10,000 head per week less going through the plants. Year to date figures show that the throughput is down by 100,000 head, of which the steers account for a drop of 81,000 head. This fall off is far below the forecasts for the year and leads to the belief that, in the absence of any pressure of census dates, etc., to sell, more cattle have been retained on farms and are being yard fed in preparation for a stronger market over the coming weeks or the early weeks of the new year.
The early orders for the Christmas trade are beginning to come up for filling and pressure on the factories to get more cattle will intensify over the next three weeks, which should lead to a strong pre-Christmas trade is the supply remains tight. Another good omen is the further strengthening of the trade for cow beef. Factory prices are continuing to strengthen, with a base price of up to 218 cents/kg (78p/lb) on offer and another 15-18 cents/kg (5p-6p/lb) for the heavy R grade cows. There is strong demand for cows among the processors."

Tipperary. Weanling bulls sold for up to €3,000 in general and heifers intended for breeding made €1,000 to €1,400. Beef animals were purchased by factory buyers for up to €2.50/kg.
The show was officially opened by John Browne, Minister of State, Department of Agriculture who said that in general the farming community had welcomed the Single Farm Payment which allows them to concentrate on producing what the market place wants and ""no longer have their initiative and energies diverted into concerns about retention periods, quotas, census dates and other scheme requirements."" He added that the emphasis for the future will be on profitability and efficiency rather than the past emphasis of maximising scale to maximise premium income. Exhibitors from Kilkenny, Tipperary Laois and Donegal shared the awards for breed championships.

About 3,500 British farmers took part in that protest against what they regarded as the low prices paid by retailers for their supplies.
Milk, meat and vegetables were among the goods withheld to put pressure on retailers to ensure producers get a substantial return.
FFA has brought together five other bodies including three from Irelanda for discussions about the future.
The National Sheep Association (NSA), the Farmers’ Union of Wales (FUW), the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers’ Association (NIAPA), the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers’ Association (ICMSA) and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association (ICSA), as well as the FFA, took part.
FFA leader David Handley said there was unanimous agreement on further action to drive home the message that farmers are not receiving a fair share of the retail price for key products such as dairy, beef and lamb.
“One thing that has become clear is that consumers want farmers to get a fair share. In fact, one poll showed that 78% of consumers would be willing to pay more.”
Mr Handley said there is a commitment from all the organisations to co-operate further."

Announcing the increase, Enterprise Minister Micheál Martin said it would enable the Competition Authority “to substantially increase the number of investigations that it can carry out into criminal breaches of the Competition Act.”
Finance Minister Brien Cowen rejected suggestions that the Government had reacted to the Eddie Hobbs backlash.
“I think that what we are simply seeing here is Micheál Martin’s continued priority being given to the funding of such an improved consumer agency,” he said.
Even with the increase, however, overall funding for the Competition Authority in 2006 remains at €5.8 million - comparably far below similar agencies in other EU nations.
Yesterday’s estimates also saw €3m of new funding allocated to the Interim Board of the National Consumer Agency (NCA) to enable it to get up and running properly
All told, next year’s spend on consumer protection will increase by €3.2m to €7.2m.
“The increased allocation will help to demonstrate to consumers that real change is underway, and that their interests are being supported,” said Mr Martin.
Ted Henneberry, director of the Competition Authority’s Cartel Division last night welcomed the increase.
“In particular, the extra resources for criminal investigations reflects the serious nature of cartel offences. Price-fixing or other types of cartel behaviour is nothing more than theft by business people looking to make extra profits at the expense of their customers,” he said.
In the area of science and technology, the minister has announced a 60% increase in funding from €2.5m to €4m. The extra money will be spent to enhance the science programme at secondary level.
A €66m package has been allocated for programmes designed to enhance the employment of people with disabilities. This includes €10m for the Wage Subsidy Scheme launched this year, which the minister said would be widely promoted in 2006.
IDA Ireland’s total capital allocation for 2006 is €101.3m, an increase of €6.3m on 2005.
The allocation to Enterprise Ireland for 2006, at €58.5m, is broadly in line with the 2005 estimate."

The improvement in price has varied from 2% for O4 grade to 3% for R3. The quality heifers are showing a gain of 4.6% over last year for R3 heifers at an average year-to-date price of 280 cent/kg (100p/lb) compared to 268 cent/kg (95.7p/lb) over the first 10 months of last year.
The increase for heifers varied from 2.2% for O4 grade to 4.6% for R3.
Cull cow prices are showing an increase of 5% for O3 grade, with the average year-to-date price coming in at 219 cent/kg (78p/lb). These prices are all inclusive of VAT.
Year-to-date average prices for beef in Britain are down on 2004.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10102486.html,2005-11-23 00:00:00,Farmers not the priority for this Government,"That figure was quoted by Fine Gael’s Enda Kenny in the Dáil two weeks ago. Since then figures have been slashed to 113,0000 he said.
Last week a report put the number of full-time farmers at just over 40,000.
Agriculture Minister Mary Coughlan rejected the findings of the report, commissioned by her department, which painted a much worse picture of the situation than Mr Kenny.
One of the report’s authors, the ex-head of Teagasc, Dr Liam Downey, said he stood over the figures adding that at best only a about 10,000 full-time farmers will be still on the land by 2025.
In a paper a few years back he made similar predictions and the most recent report did no more than confirm his worst fears.
In the context of the flight from the land, Mr Kenny told the Dáil the proposed tariff cuts of up to 60% mooted by EU commissioner Peter Mandelson would cause further havoc for Irish agriculture.
Taking up that theme, beef baron Larry Goodman walked into Ms Coughlan’s office last week with the IFA by his side to express his concerns about the latest WTO talks.
What these findings highlight is the growing pressure on primary producers and on processors.
Mr Goodman is hardly facing starvation as he will get €500,0000 per annum from direct payments from Brussels under the new decoupling scheme.
But there is no doubt farmers are coming under increasing pressure and the countryside is facing enormous change, as it has since the transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy started to take hold.
Regrettably the flight from the land is becoming a foot note to the rapid changes taking place at consumer level in most modern societies.
The talk now is of the food selling opportunities available to Irish food processors and the very critical demands coming from consumers about what they are prepared to eat and drink.
In Dublin last Thursday, Bord Bia talked about the massive opportunities open to the food sector. Last year €250 million of Irish meats and other foods was sold to Sainsbury’s alone.
That figure is closer to €500m if subsidiaries of Irish firms based in Britain are included.
Sainsbury’s trading director, Mike Coupe, said that could reach €1 billion over the next five years.
He said his experience of Irish firms since joining Sainbury’s 12 months ago has been excellent.
He said organic food supplies cannot keep up with demand in his stores indicating a gap to be filled by farmers enterprising enough to take up that challenge instead of bemoaning the removal of EU tariffs.
Bord Bia’s PERIscope (Purchasing and Eating in the Republic of Ireland) was centre stage at last week’s event when it introduced 80 suppliers to what’s going on in global markets.
Its research showed an increasing shift in consumer demand for products that boost personal health and well being. That trend is reflected also by an increasing desire among people to eat healthier foods such as fruit and vegetables.
The consumer is the new fetish and the flight from the land goes unnoticed.
Another loss as the consumer is given primacy of place in the new economic order will be the corner shop.
Several players in the industry have made that point since the Government’s decision to allow predatory pricing.
The latest is David Dilger, boss of food group Greencore, who yesterday warned of the death of the corner shop.
Mr Coupe made the same point last week as did Liam Igoe, food analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers, in his review of the lifting of the below cost selling ban.
Regrettably farmers are a much lower priority category than consumers in this Government’s plans."

The EU has offered a 46% cut in average tariffs, but this falls short of the 54% called for by the Group of 20 developing countries, and well below the 55 to 90% range of cuts demanded by the US.
Mandelson, due to meet delegations from Brazil, India, and the US on Tuesday, said he would continue to ask trade negotiators from other countries to improve their offers. Any new offer he will make at Hong Kong, or later, will be “obviously within the limits of the negotiating mandate”, he told EU foreign ministers.
According to IFA, WTO proposals already made by Mandelson would lead to an increase in EU beef imports from 500,000 tonnes to 1.3 million tonnes, and a resulting collapse in EU beef prices from €2.80/kg now to €2.30/kg. Irish prices would fall to €2.07/kg (74plb), compared to cattle production costs of €3/kg.
Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan, and Junior Ministers for Trade and Commerce and overseas development, Michael Ahern and Conor Lenihan will lead Ireland’s delegation in Hong Kong. Irish Government sources believe that if the Hong Kong meeting fails to set a framework for a WTO agreement, the major participants will fall back on bilateral or regional trade agreements."

For farm families and workers in the factories, hauliers, contractors who lived for generations on beet growing and processing, it will be sad to see it go. The reality is that a once thriving industry can no longer compete.
The sugar industry is going the way of many indigenous industries of this country in recent years. The once flourishing weaving and textile industry is almost gone. Within the food sector, imports have replaced tens of thousands of tonnes of previously Irish produced foods.
The number of farmers has dwindled to an all time low.
We cannot compete with world prices, our production costs are too high.
These rising costs also threaten IT and the other sectors which replaced many of our traditional employment sectors. The lure of lower cost economies, where the necessary skills are improving at a rapid rate, is tempting for our multi-national employers.
The cost of living in Ireland is more than 20% higher than the EU average.
Costs are out of proportion compared to what the world is prepared to pay us for our products - be that sugar, beef, milk or our manufactured products.
The demise of Irish sugar is a warning that more will follow unless we realise that the world does not owe us a living."

The factories’ quoted prices of 274 and back to 263 cents/kg (98p to 94p/lb) for R and O grade animals this week were surpassed by between and 11 cents/kg (2p to 4p/lb) in the prices actually paid by processors to secure sufficient supplies of cattle to fill their early Christmas orders. Strong demand for beef in Britain and on the continent led to plenty of competition between factories for cattle and a return of 100p/lb and over for farmers for the first time in five months.
The strengthening price over recent weeks has been luring out more cattle, but not yet enough to meet the stronger than usual demand. Weekly intake of steers at the factories has now reached its highest for this time of year since 2001, at over 19,000 head per week, and factories reported this trend continuing this week, as farmers took advantage of the stronger price, which could come be gone once the Christmas trade requirements are filled.
But for the moment, orders from the major UK multiples are bigger than normal, leading to depletion of stocks at the wholesalers.
The supply of home produced cattle in Britain is low, and the increase in demand has pushed prices at the UK factories to the equivalent of IR£1.06/lb for R grade animals.
Across the continent, there is also an improved trade for beef. Prices have increased in Germany, and the trade in France, Italy and Netherlands is reported to be solid.
Here, cull cow prices improved further this week, with a base price of up to 224 cents/kg (80p/lb) being offered, while the good quality R grade carcases are worth at least 14 cents/kg (5p/lb) more. There is good demand for cow beef in the manufacturing trade, which is reflected in competition between factories for cows, joined this week by Kepak at Watergrasshill, Co Cork, who have added cows to their slaughtering requirements.
Cull cow throughput is high, at up to 10,000 head per week."

Lower imports of beef from South America and tight domestic supplies in Britain and on the continent, to supply good consumer purchasing, has created stronger demand and higher prices throughout Europe.
The national average for R4L bullocks last week was 96.5p/lb, an increase of 2.5p/lb.
There was a top price of just over 100p/lb paid by Donegal Meats. Exel Meats and sister plant, Newgrange Meats, paid averages of over 98p/lb and a further seven factories paid over 97p/lb average.
AIBP Group paid over 3p/lb more for supplies, with individual factories within the group increasing prices by 4p/lb. The R4L bullock price at the Kepak Group increased by 3p/lb and Dawn Group paid 2.5p/lb more. A national average of 94.5p/lb was paid for O4L bullocks.

Exports from Germany suffered the largest decline at 43,000 tonnes, representing a decline of 46%. Exports from France and Italy were down by a total of 17,000 tonnes. A drop of 80,000 tonnes in exports from the EU-25 showed the decline increasing sharply for the first four months, rising from a fall of 1,625 tonnes for January to over 19,400 tonnes in April, before improving for the following two months.
Exports worsened again in July to a decline of almost 15,000 tonnes for the month.
On the import side, total imports of beef for the EU-25 from Third Countries increased by 3.4% amounting to 12,000 tonnes over the eight months.
Bord Bia points out that the largest importer was the UK at 32% of the total, amounting to an import of 117,000 tonnes, which was 1% higher than for the same period in 2004.
Italy imported 61,000 tonnes, an increase of 10% on last year. Dutch imports at 59,000 tonnes also showed an increase of 10% over 2004. Imports by France were 5% higher at 12,000 tonnes, while Germany imported 9% less beef from Third Countries.
The pattern of imports shows that beef imports were strongest in July at almost 12,500 tonnes, corresponding with the serious drop in Irish beef prices at the factories with strong supplies into the UK. Imports for February were down by 7,661 tonnes, and by 4,385 tonnes for March and were up by 9,610 tonnes for April, the second highest month."

Tighter supplies of beef in Britain and a drop in imports from South America has created a strong market for imports.
Although more of the over 30 months beef will be coming in to the food chain in Britain in early 2006, there should be a firm export trade for beef in Britain during the early months of the new year.
Keeping supply in balance with demand will be important to the return for producers during the first quarter of 2006, because the carry over of beef into the new year will be much higher than last year end and orderly marketing by producers will be crucial to maintaining the price during the early months.
The quality forward continental bullocks are making up to €300 over €/kg in the marts with up to €350 over being paid for choice lots. Moving down the weight scale the best of the bullocks around 400 kgs are not making a lot with €200 over.
The heavy bullocks made up to €310 over at Kilmallock and up to €300 over at Dungarvan, up to €380 over at Skibbereen, and peaked at €245 over at Kanturk yesterday.
At the lower end of the quality chain, the good Friesian is making up to e130 over and plainer lots selling back to a little over €/kg.
The quality beef heifers sold for up to €220 over at Kanturk yesterday, peaking at €210 over at Kilmallock and making up to €160 over at Dungarvan.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10083365.html,2005-12-08 00:00:00,Fixing an unequal world,"That is the contribution to the WTO debate from the Irish Catholic Bishops' Commission for Justice and Social Affairs.
They made no direct comment on the EU's current offer in world trade talks, which European farmers, described as ""horrifying"", and putting millions of EU family farms at stake.
It will not be the poorer developing countries who will profit, but multi-national processors and exporters, says COPA, the EU farmers grouping, as human-scale sustainable agriculture in Europe could be destroyed in order to encourage further expansion of large-scale farming in Brazil at tremendous cost to the environment.
Farmers were not surprised when the Confederation of British Industry recently brushed them aside as an ""increasingly irrelevant minority"" holding up multi billion euro world trade increases. But the Bishops' comment has hurt, with the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association calling it ""naive and preposterous"". What the Bishops stand for would lead to 50,000 Irish food and agriculture job losses and over 600,000 more across Europe, according to ICSA, benefiting wealthy ranchers with the economy of scale to succeed in world trade - not African farmers with three cows.
Beet growers and sugar workers will also take the Bishops' words to heart. It was complaints in the WTO from Brazil, Thailand and Australia about EU subsidies that spelled the end for their business, and for sugar industries in poor African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The beneficiaries are sugar export firms in Brazil, Thailand and Australia.
It's all part of a debate setting farmers against farmers in the developed and developing worlds, observes Fine Gael MEP Mairead McGuinness - an over-simplistic debate, she says, because many factors give rise to an unequal world. She points out that the Common Agriculture Policy itself was born out of hunger, in Europe after World War Two, and the problems it causes for the developing world are now being tackled.
Perhaps the real acid test is that the Irish Bishops' words would not be widely welcomed in poor countries.
According to the Co-ordinating Committee of Family Farmers in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, it would be a ""grave error"" for developed countries to eliminate subsidies, before developing countries undergo agrarian reform. They point out that agricultural growth of more than 3% a year still leaves most Latin Americans agriculture workers in poverty, gaining little from export commodities like fruit, beef, coffee and soybeans.
Alberto Broch, vice president of Brazil's largest federation of landless rural workers and small farmers says ending subsidies would be ""beneficial"" but not sufficient to promote rural development - what is needed is more credit and guaranteed minimum prices for small farmers.
Action Aid helps more than 13 million of the world's poorest, and says ending trade-distorting subsidies would be good, but only if Third World family-based agriculture is developed and corporate agribusiness controlled.
Otherwise, only Cargill and the other transnational corporations would benefit.
Miguel Pickard of Mexico's Centre for Economic and Political Research for Community Action says eliminating subsidies will not solve the big inequities in world trade. Industrialised countries will respond by buying up land in developing countries.
Argentine agronomist Walter Pengue warns trade liberalisation could increase pressure on the environment, further concentrate land ownership, and cause mass migration of small farmers to cities.
The Irish Bishops say ""national advantage will sometimes be limited by the need to find common solutions to common problems"". The problem for Irish farmers is they are being asked to give up farming in return for a solution which may or may not help poor Third World farmers."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10049381.html,2005-12-08 00:00:00,Some plants booked out by Monday,"As the pressure on processors to get sufficient cattle eased, the upward trend in prices slackened, and cattle farmers found it difficult to build on last week’s rates for cattle.
With the count down to the festive season under way, an increase in supply was not unexpected, confirming the belief that larger supplies of cattle than normal were being fed in preparation for the Christmas trade.
Processors got tougher as the supply strengthened, with few prepared to offer any increase on last week’s prices, fewer paying the flat prices of last week for mixes of R and O grade animals.
The general quote was 274 cents/kg (98p/lb) for R grade animals and 269-266 cents/kg (96p-95p/lb) for O grade. The factories paid 277 to 280 cent/kg (99p or 100p/lb) for Rs, but it was much harder to get more than 280 cent/kg this week, with adequate supplies or better in most areas of the country.
Flat prices of up to 274 cents/kg (98p/lb) were paid for good mixes of R and O grades, but producers trying to secure a flat price of 280 cents/kg (100p/lb) were not getting much of a hearing. Supplies of cattle were strongest in the south, where the bookings were heavy on Monday, and some of the plants had sufficient stock for the week booked in by Monday evening, and were turning away cattle, much to the annoyance of farmers who failed to get a definite kill date before Christmas.
The intake was also strong in the east of the country, and was increased in the midlands. The result of the surge in supply is a consensus that beef prices have peaked for the season, and some processors, confident that they have plenty of cattle in the pipeline for the Christmas trade, have been circulating word that they will harden prices closer to the quoted rates, which in effect means paying 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) less for cattle next week.
The threat of a price cut is a certain ploy to bring out more cattle, but they know that farmers who want their cattle killed before Christmas have little time on their side.
The cull cow prices are holding strong. There is a base price of 224 cents/kg (80p/lb) readily on offer and suppliers of good R grade cows can expect 15 to 18 cents/kg (6p/lb) more."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10106966.html,2005-12-13 00:00:00,Beef heifers in demand,"In the east, Slaney Meats quoted 280-269c/kg (100p-96p/lb) for R/O grade quality heifers and bullocks under 30 months, but they showed very little interest in supplies of overage cattle re-introducing a penalty of 6c/kg (2p/lb). Up to the benchmark of 100p/lb or a shade more was being paid for heifers at a number of centres as they general took the edge over the bullocks.
Factories in general quoted 274-269c/kg (98p-96p/lb) for R/O grades and securing 100p/lb for bullocks was much more difficult than recent weeks, particularly for the overage bullocks, with good supplies of cattle available to the factories for the beginning of the phase down for Christmas. Some suppliers secured a flat price of 98p/lb for mixes of good R/O grades.
In most regions quality heifers were the only category showing a gain over last week.
The supply of bullocks in particular has continued strong (up 3,000 head per week on this time last year), while heifers are down about 1,000 head per week on 2004, but export markets are continuing good and processors have been anxious for the stronger supply to meet the demand, which is partly the result of the ban on supplies from some regions of South America.
Some factories are planning to have the requirement of cattle pre-Christmas booked in by tomorrow evening, and some discontinued quoting for pre-Christmas cattle by yesterday afternoon.
Cull cows continued a steady trade this week with a base price of 224c/kg (80p/lb) on offer and expect to get 12-15c/kg (4p-5p/lb) more for the good R grade cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10124833.html,2005-12-15 00:00:00,Heifers sell best as trade winds down,"Gains of 3 to 6 cent/kg (1p or 2p/lb) were achieved for the quality heifers this week.
Similar gains were made for steers aged under 30 months at some of the processors, but most processors maintained prices at last week’s rates, and some did not quote at all for cattle this week.
Slaney Meats were strongest in the south and east of the country, offering 280 and back to 269 cents/kg (100p to 96p/lb) for R and O grade heifers, and under 30 months steers, while the general quote from the factories was 274 and back to 269 cents/kg (98p to 96p/lb) for R and O grades.
Demand was strongest for the quality heifers this week, with supplies running at 1,000 head per week back on this time last year, and good market demand driving competition between the processors for available supplies.
Up to 100p per lb was readily on offer, and a bit more depending on regional supply and demand at each factory for the quality R grade heifers.
Supplies on the beef market in Britain are now adequate to meet demand.
But strong consumer buying is expected for the days immediately prior to Christmas.
In contrast, higher numbers of steers having been carried forward from autumn is showing in the strong supply levels now.
Intake of steers over the past couple of weeks was running at 3,000 head per week higher than this time last year. Although export orders are strong, partly as a result of the ban on beef from some regions Brazil, the current strong supply of steers in the south and in most of the midlands has eased any pressure on factories to pay more to secure extra cattle.
Exel Meats at Kilbeggan and sister plant Newgrange Meats, Navan did not quote for cattle this week, because their supply was very strong.
Factories will operate two or three days next week, before closing down for Christmas, and slaughtering requirements up to the New Year will depend on demand.
Some factories expect to have a light kill the week after Christmas to supply supermarket demand.
The trade for cull cows continued steady this week with a base price of 224 cents/kg (80p/lb) on offer. The quality cows making R grade are fetching 12 to 15 cents/kg (4p or 5p/lb) more, with good demand for the heavy carcasses.
* Continuing firm beef prices across Europe and euro exchange rate gains against the dollar were given as reasons by the EU Beef Management Committee for the recent unexpected cut in export refunds.
It’s a setback for exporters hoping to take advantage of strengthening world markets due to bans on Brazilian beef and moves in Argentina to curb their beef exports, and to divert any shipments dislodged from the UK market by the return of British cow beef. The setback follows a 20% export refund cut last June and will hit Irish trade with markets such as Russia, Lebanon and Egypt, which resumed taking Irish beef last October."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10052767.html,2005-12-15 00:00:00,Large increase in live cattle exports,"Bord Bia says the main contributors to this large increase in live exports were the store, calf and weanling categories which increased by 8,000, 24,000, and 20,000 head respectively this year. Finished live exports were also up 1,200 head (+9%), with the majority going to Lebanon.
In the period under review, exports to Spain were greatest at 46,000 head (+27,000 head), followed by Italy with trade totalling 43,000 head (+25,000 head) and the Netherlands - where exports totalled 42,000 head (+12,000 head).
Trade to Northern Ireland however was back almost 18,000 to 25,000 head, reflecting poor beef trade there all year."

Ms Coughlan insisted, however, that the agreement between the 148 World Trade Organisation (WTO) countries was the best possible outcome for Ireland.
She said it would promote growth in developing countries while protecting the model of agriculture practised in the EU and the livelihood of its farmers.
Ms Coughlan, speaking on her arrival in Brussels yesterday to attend an EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting, said she was most surprised at the exaggerated reaction in some quarters to the outcome.
She said the elimination of export refunds had already been agreed in August 2004 and had been flagged as far back as 2001.
The date now agreed for their elimination is the end of 2013, not 2010 as originally sought, and is conditional on the phasing out of other forms of export trade subsidies by trading partners.
Ms Coughlan said the more critical part of the current WTO round was a question of access to the European market, which will be the subject of further negotiations next year. The WTO Doha round is due to be finally concluded before the end of 2006.
But Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) president John Dillon said farmers had paid a heavy price. It was a case of all losses and not a single gain. One of the lowest-income sectors in Ireland had been forced to bear the full cost of the deal.
“Irish farm families have been sacrificed to further the interests of multi-national traders and South American ranchers,” he said.
Mr Dillon said the deal would destroy one-third of Irish farm output that would mean a loss of €1.2 billion to the country.
He said farm incomes would fall by 35%, with a knock-on loss of €800 million to the rural economy.
There would be 50,000 jobs lost in farming, farm supplies and processing as more and more of the
European food market was taken over by North and South America, Australia and New Zealand, he said.
Mr Dillon called for the establishment of a high-level working party under the auspices of the Taoiseach’s office to co-ordinate Ireland’s handling of the vital technical negotiations in Geneva that have to be completed by April 2006.
Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers’ Association president Pat O’Rourke described the agreement as disastrous for Irish farmers, particularly for the beef and dairy sectors, while the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association leader Malcolm Thompson said it was a bad day for Irish farming.
Fine Gael agriculture spokesman Denis Naughten said the deal was bad for Irish farmers and consumers alike and would put tens of thousands of Irish farmers out of business.
It would also result in substantial volumes of food products coming into the EU, which would not be produced to the same high standards as product from Ireland, leading to a greater frequency of food scares, he said.
Labour Party spokeswoman Dr Mary Upton, urged the Government to formulate a new strategy for Irish agriculture following the conclusion of both the world trade and EU budget negotiations."

Most factories paid an average of 100p/lb for R4L bullocks - give or take a fraction - and only slightly more for heifers.
The margin between average and the highest individual factory average narrowed with a top price for 101.5p/lb for R4L bullocks at Donegal Meats, Slaney Meats at Bunclody and Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare paying an average of 100.4p/lb.
Most other factories came in on 100p/lb or a fraction under.
The major players in the beef sector - AIBP Group, Dawn Group and Kepak Group - all paid a shade under 100p/lb average.
The average for O4L bullocks was 97.6p/lb with a top price of 99p/lb paid at AIBP at Bandon.
The average for R4L heifers was 100.5p/lb.
A top price of 105p/lb was paid by Kepak at Clonee.
Four more factories paid averages between 101p/lb and 102p/lb. They were AIBP factories at Bandon and Waterford, Slaney Meats at Bunclody and Dawn Meats at Waterford.
The top price for O4L heifers was 97.4p/lb. Kepak at Clonee paid the highest individual factory average at 100p/lb.
Price for cull cows showed improvements of 2p/lb.
The top price paid was an average of 88p/lb for R4L cows at Euro Farm Foods at Duleek.
Exel paid an average of 84p/lb for O4L and Euro was tops for P grade at 84p/lb."

The importance of BVD should not be under-estimated, according to the company. It is very prevalent in the Irish cattle population and weakens animals’ immune defence mechanisms, thereby allowing other “bugs” to cause disease.
Rispoval 3 has the longest licensed period of protection of any RSV combination vaccine on the market, providing six months of respiratory protection.
Within beef herds, the cost of a preventative vaccination programme against these common pneumonia viruses is less than 20% of the cost of such an outbreak, according to Pfizer Animal Health.
A primary vaccination regime, consisting of two shots, for a 50 unit herd would cost €650 to €700, less than the price of one dead animal. It is vital that the booster shot and initial primary shot are given, usually three to four weeks apart, advises the company.
The course should be completed at least three weeks in advance of high risk periods such as the of housing animals.
Users should consult their vets for advice on their most appropriate approach to pneumonia prevention."

Tom Doyle, chairman of the ICOS mart committee and president of the European Livestock Marts Association (ELMA), said it is important the EU remains competitive in export markets for live animals, as well as beef, as it still needs to export both to certain markets. “This is essential to maintain strong competition in the trade, especially when EU markets are weak.”
Mr Doyle said ICOS and the ELMA had called on the Commission to withdraw its proposal. He said Agriculture and Food Minister Mary Coughlan and the Department officials should oppose the proposal.
This was necessary to ensure competitiveness on all export markets. Otherwise the EU will be conceding markets to competitors and weakening the internal EU market price for beef and live cattle.
The EU Commissioner for agriculture and rural development Mariann Fischer Boel said now is the right time to put an end to these exports refunds. “The outlook for our own beef market is positive and therefore no longer justifies the continuation of this support to our farmers,” she said, urging member states to back the measure.
However, Minister Mary Coughlan said she strenuously objected to the Commission’s intention to eliminate the export refunds."

“It was important to meet people in their own places and chat with them about their problems and worries,” said the 44-year-old dairy and beef farmer from Killinan, Thurles.
Mr Cahill, who farms 130 acres and rents another 100, said farmers are wondering whether they can make a living out of beef or milk and are worried they won’t be able to make ends meet.
“The other issues are the new regulations, nitrates and cross compliance, and the uncertainty about whether they are going to be let farm the way they were taught to farm.
“We can farm as good, if not better, than anyone else in the world. Grass is our advantage. As long as we are allowed to grow the grass the way we are able to, we will be able to withstand whatever cold winds come our way better than other farmers in Europe,” he said.
On milk prices, Mr Cahill said the power of farmers and their organisations, which might be underestimated at times, is crucial.
Farmers must keep making the point to processors, co-ops and plcs that they have to get a fair slice of the cake.
Mr Cahill said he would advocate cooperation rather than major rationalisation in the multi-billion dairy industry.
Costs must be reduced, but he had not seen any great benefits to farmer members of major co-ops, such as Glanbia and Dairygold, over the small to medium-sized co-ops.
He said Newmarket and the West Cork co-ops, and his own Centenary Thurles Co-op, are paying a competitive price for milk. Farmers would be nervous there would not be competition on price if there were not enough co-ops around.
Mr Cahill said young people need two things to make farming their career.
“They are not going to choose a career that has not got a reasonable return and is filled with paperwork.
“That is a challenge and if we don’t address those issues young people are not going to enter farming,” he said.
Mr Cahill said farmers need their organisations now, but they are going to demand a better service.
“There is an increasing role for us to defend farmers’ interests. As the economy continues to boom, agriculture is going to become a smaller part of it. We have to shout louder with the Government to make our presence felt.”
Mr Cahill said without a healthy farming industry, rural Ireland will disintegrate and disappear.
“Rural communities, to survive, require farming and a thriving farming industry,” he said.
Referring to internal tensions within ICMSA in the past year, during which there was a staff strike, he said it had been a difficult period.
“Some people were not happy with the stance I took, but my view is fair play has to operate within an organisation, both fair play for staff people and fair play for elected people.
Regarding farm organisations, he said they all have the same objective, improving the lot of farmers.
“We do not want bickering between the organisations, and while we often have differences on objectives, the end goal is the same and I look forward to working with them in the future,” he said."

The highest weekly factory kill in four years was recorded for the second week in December, with the throughput exceeding 44,000 head at the meat export plants.
Such a level of output for December would not have delivered good returns for producers in previous years.
The year finished as it had started, with a lot of unpredictability on cattle prices, caused mainly by the unexpected trend in beef supplies into the EU from Argentine and Brazil.
Large supplies into the UK market in early summer seriously affected demand for Irish beef and resulted in record low prices for beef in June and July.
The outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease detected in Brazil in October, resulted in a ban on exports of beef from the main regions of that country, and a very big fall in world beef supplies to meet strong demand in November and December; the market responded with higher prices for EU beef finishers.
Compared to 2004, prices in 2005 varied from 7% lower in August to almost 15% higher in December.
The beef price peaked during late April and May, when up to 107p/lb was paid for R grade animals at the factories, before declining almost 20p/lb by July, and sliding back to 85p or 86p/lb in October. Prices lifted from early November through to the end of the year, with more than 102p/lb paid for R grade animals by the end of December."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10073279.html,2006-01-06 00:00:00,"Young farmers must adapt or perish, warns Macra leader","The young farmers’ leader had reason to think about the future. He was to deliver a speech on the subject in Mullingar in Co Westmeath a few nights later.
The dairy, beef and tillage farmer, elected president of Macra na Feirme a few months earlier, impressed farming and agri-business leaders at the Young Farmer of the Future award presentations with his speech.
He repeated what many others had been saying - agriculture is at a major crossroads in Ireland.
But he has a vision for young farmers based on factual realism.
“For over 30 years, since we joined the EU, we have had a variety of production-based supports that has allowed us build our businesses in a consistent and stable fashion.
“Now, however, we are facing into a time of much greater uncertainty, with market instability, ever increasing regulation and stiff competition from low cost competitors,” says Mr Markey.
“At a time like this, people often say that you have to have a positive outlook, be optimistic and everything will be all right in the long run. I don’t believe in idle optimism.
“I believe you have to be realistic about the many challenges that face us, whether it’s the nitrates directive, cheap Brazilian beef imports or an ever increasing cost base.”
Mr Markey says farmers have to be prepared to ask some deep and challenging questions about efficiency, how they can justify their work on their farms and how they will use their single farm payment.
“As farmers, we are the chief executives of our own business. The buck stops with us. We have to work to ensure a similar return on our investment as can be got in other industries.”
Mr Markey believes farmers need to ensure they have good business plans and a vision of what they want to achieve.
“We need to be open minded to change, constantly reviewing, ready to adapt to any potential opportunities or problems.
“We need to invest in technology to streamline in terms of scale and labour efficiency.
“After all, it is not about the time you spend farming. It is about how efficiently you use your time when you are farming.”
Mr Markey warns there is a serious doubt whether Europe can be relied upon to support farming as it has in the past.
“It is now vital that we take a cold hard look at our industry and where it is going,” he said.
He points out that Macra has always had two main goals - getting young people established on farms in their own right and then ensuring they have a viable future in farming.
The Macra leader said that while agriculture was still very important to the Irish economy, it was difficult for young farmers to have confidence in an industry that was dogged by poor prices.
“Young farmers are just as focused as any other business people. They won’t stay farming purely for the love of the land.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10096725.html,2006-01-12 00:00:00,Omens good for strong spring trade,"While the supply of cattle to factories has been increasing again this week, slightly easing the market pressures on factories, any effect on cattle prices paid to farmers has been marginal.
Farmer optimism for a continuing firm trade over the coming weeks appear to be soundly based.
The general quote from the processors this week was 289 and back to 280 cent/kg (103p to 100p/lb) for R and O grade animals.
In a majority of the transactions, more than the quoted rates were being paid by the processors.
But the indications were that the top rates were slightly tighter than last week.
Up to 292 cents/kg (104p/lb), and in some cases even more, was paid for R grade bullocks and heifers, and some deals were done for R and O mixes of good quality cattle at 289 cents/kg (103p/lb) flat.
However, that is harder to get this week, as the supply of cattle increases after the Christmas break.
These prices are up to 11 cents/kg (4p/lb) up on the pre-Christmas trade.
Compared to the trade in early January 2005, the R grade price is 20 cents/kg (7p/lb) higher presently.
And there are no indications of any clouds on the horizon that should undermine the price trend in the short term at least.
The trade is being driven by the replenishing of stocks, following a strong trade for beef at consumer level in Britain over Christmas, which depleted stocks.
The retail trade in Britain is continuing very strong, a pattern which is reflected in the demand for cattle in Britain, where prices to farmers are continuing to increase, currently running at the equivalent of IR2p or 3p/lb ahead of Irish prices.
The trade for cull cows has been following the prime beef market, with prices continuing to improve.
The factories quoted up to 246 cents/kg (88p/b) for good quality cows this week, and there were many reports of suppliers holding out for 252 cents/kg (90p/lb), and in some cases getting it.
Demand for cow beef is always reckoned to be a good barometer of the prime beef trade.
Using that yardstick, the trade for early spring beef should be strong."

Agriculture and food remains Ireland’s largest indigenous exporter providing total employment of around 160,000. It accounts for close to one tenth of the Irish economy with annual sales of €18.5bn and relatively low import content.
Chief executive Aidan Cotter said: “Bord Bia is committed to working with Irish food and drink companies to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and thereby enable them to exploit the opportunities that are part of a dynamic and fast-changing market.”
The annual trade report revealed that beverage exports recovered strongly and were the best performing export category in 2005. Exports from the sector are estimated to have grown by 5.8% to over €1bn.

Heavy heifers showed gains of up to €20/head with number of cattle on offer on the low side.
The highest reported price for cull cows was paid at Ennis where a 674kg Limousin sold for €950 and a 552kg Limousin made €800.
Manager Martin McNamara said that there was a very strong trade for both feeding and beef type cows with the tops “making beef cattle prices”.
Prices ranged from €200 under €/kg to €280 over, with Friesians selling at the lower end - 666kgs making €470.
There were plenty of customers for the 300 cattle on offer. The heavy store bullocks of 600kgs plus were €20-€30 dearer than the pre-Christmas trade, with lighter animals selling at unchanged prices and a good demand for butchers’ heifers.
At Bandon, prices for bullocks were improved by up to €60/head, with the heavy bullocks selling for up to €300 over €/kg and heifers were also an improved trade. Two Friesian bullocks weighing 635kgs sold for €935, a lot of four Charolais 566kgs made €840. Prices for lighter animal ranged up to €222 over. Three Herefords (448kgs) sold for €670 and three Charolais weighing 345kgs made €550.
At Kilkenny, where there was an entry of 300 head, the cull cows made €170 under to €150 over. Quality lots of heavy bullocks sold for up to €415 over. Store bullocks under 450kgs were back €10-€15/head, while prices for heifers were improved by up to €20/head.
A Charolais bullock weighing 650kgs sold for €1,065, a lot of two Charolais 650kgs made €1,025 and seven Charolais 524kgs made €885. In the heifer ring, two Charolais scaling 526kgs sold for €790."

However, the ‘bargain police’ rarely register the fact that Ireland has one of the highest basic wages in Europe.
We also have some of the highest indirect taxes on food and wine in the EU. Ireland applies a VAT rate of 21%, and excise duty, to sparkling and still wines. The figures for VAT in Spain, Italy and Portugal are 16%, 12% and 12% respectively on sparkling wine and 16%, 20% and 12% on still wine. The excise duty on a standard bottle of still wine in Ireland is €2.05, €1.80 in Britain, €0.03 in France and nil in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal. The excise duty on sparkling wine in Ireland is €4.10, €2.57 in Britain, €0.06 in France and, again, nil in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal.
Ireland also has the eighth highest rate of VAT on food in restaurants in the EU.
Insurance costs have increased significantly, and cost increases in public and employers’ liability, and other types of insurance cover, have led to increased costs for restaurants. Waste disposal charges have also increased and the additional costs incurred by restaurateurs have also had to be passed on to customers.
Which is why we need to be careful to actually compare like with like, before we jump to conclusions.
I got to thinking about all this afresh recently when I had lunch at a new café in Midleton, Co Cork, called Fire and Ice.
Chef-owner Gary Masterson is from Coventry. He trained in Britain with De Vere Hotels and has worked in the Cayman Islands, Spain, on the QE2, the Queen Mary 2, and in Anguilla in the CuisinArt Resort. He also spent some time in Dublin working at the Mermaid where he met Winnie, who is now his wife and business partner.
Winnie trained with Michael Clifford in his restaurant Cliffords on the Mardyke in Cork and Finíns in Midleton, and ran the restaurant at the Distillery. She spent some time in San Francisco working with Wolfgang Puck and Stars before returning to Dublin where she helped set up Eden with Eleanor Walsh, and then moved on to the Mermaid.
At Fire and Ice in Midleton, Gary devises the daily menu and sources as much local food as possible from artisan producers. Winnie is responsible for the delicious cakes and desserts as well as running the floor.
The menu changes every day depending on the produce available in season. My friends chose a goat’s cheese and tomato tartlet, and a spiced, grilled flank steak with green mango and herb salad. I was tempted by the char-grilled pizza with smoked salmon, avocado and cucumber pickle, mint, capers and crème fraîche.
The thin pizza was covered with slivers of smoked salmon, chunky slices of avocado, pickled cucumber, crispy lettuce and tiny capers. The secret ingredients were thin slivers of pickled ginger and some crème fraîche zig-zagged over the top. It was really good.
Flank steak is a very undervalued piece of beef. Gary cut it into slivers across the grain and seared it quickly on the pan and piled it atop a green mango, chilli and fresh herb salad.
The goat’s cheese and tomato tartlet sat on a bed of onion marmalade and this was served with a rocket salad with roasted pepper dressing.
Gary says he seeks out really good quality ingredients and buys as much local produce as he can get his hands on, including vegetables grown in his garden by Winnie’s father.
They hope to soon sell their own pickles, chutneys, relishes, jams and marmalades as well as rubs, seasonings and fresh tea blends.
All chefs know that good produce is what creates the wow factor on the plate but really good produce simply costs more money - hence the eternal dilemma between the chef and the accountant.
Gary and Winne say the eclectic menu reflects their travels and moods and what they like to cook and eat themselves. After some delicious puddings, the couple kindly shared some of their recipes with us.

The largest increases were in Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, with Northern Ireland and Britain - where prices were lower than 2004 - the only regions recording a lower price gain than the Republic.
The average increase across France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Northern Ireland and Britain, and the Republic was 7%. All of the countries with the exception of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain are producing young bull beef.
Prices increased by an average of 13% for the year in Germany; 11% in Denmark and Belgium and 10% in the Netherlands. Prices increased by an average of 7% in Spain and 6% in France and Italy. Ireland came in at 4% followed by Northern Ireland at 3% and in Britain the average over the year was down 1% on the previous year.
In five of the countries the average paid for R3 male beef animals exceeded the equivalent of Irish 100p/lb (VAT excluded). The highest average was paid in Italy at 319 cents/kg (114p/lb) marginally higher than France. The average for Germany was 105p/lb, slightly less for Spain, and 102p/lb for Denmark.
In Britain, producers received an average of IR98p/lb, 97p/lb in Northern Ireland, and 94p/lb in Ireland. The price was lowest in Belgium at an average of 84p/lb."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10058360.html,2006-01-18 00:00:00,Food industry must offer new culinary twist,"Bord Bia’s reports for 2004 and 2005 show food and drink delivered overseas sales of about €7.1 billion in each year.
Overall however the 2005 figure reflected some improvement year-on-year with sales up a modest 0.7%.
In a tough market this was probably a good outturn, but given the importance of the food sector to the economy, it wasn’t exactly a firebrand performance. In the context of tough trading markets the figures demonstrate we will have to fight every inch of the way to gain market share.
Beef exports accounted for two-thirds of total meat and livestock exports, and overall achieved a small increase in sales.
On the continent, however, the figure was up an impressive 11.1%, as the sector moved away from commodity international markets to supplying the European consumer with premium quality meat.
That statistic alone is a cause for encouragement because it shows what can be done if we provide Europe with what it wants in terms of food and drink.
It is encouraging also because the increase is an endorsement of the efforts the state-sponsored group has been making to get a stronger toe-hold for Irish beef in Europe.
The thought occurs also that from an Irish perspective the mainland of Europe probably offers better opportunities for producers and processors than Britain or the US.
The bigger players are an exception to that rule with Greencore, Kerry and IAWS in particular very strong in those markets.
They have their own agenda and to a greater or lesser extent have the measure of the big multiples in terms of margins and product specification to their suppliers.
In a recent survey Bord Bia highlighted the growing interest in health and nutritional beverages that represents a global - not just a European opportunity - for the food sector that needs far greater focus going forward.
And the thought occurs that, instead of spending millions on raw research, we would do far better to put applied science to work to help us find the nutritional and health-based goods and beverages the market wants.
This is what the more health conscious consumer is seeking.
Never before has what we eat and drink been so driven by health and nutritional factors. If we can exploit that niche market we will have it made in at least one sector of the food market.
Bord Bia is addressing those issues and says it plans an active promotion programme designed to showcase the Irish food and drink industry to foreign buyers in 2006.
The promotion programme includes hosting the International Speciality Food Forum, which will be held in Dublin in May, and the sponsorship of the Ryder Cup in September.
But it strikes me that Irish food needs to develop a “wow” factor that will give it a reputation second to none.
Despite all the hype and back-slapping precipitated by the boom, we are not exactly known as Europe’s culinary capital.
Until such time as we get serious about the food we ourselves eat, without it having to cost an arm and a leg, I suspect much of the “cooing booing” we do about Irish food and its green production base will count for little in the lucrative international markets.
It seems to me one leads to the other. People are still coming here for the craic and not the quality food.
Bord Bia’s job would be made a lot easier if we boasted an eating out culture that stood for more than the price it costs.
The proliferation of fast food outlets is synonymous with a society that is prepared to settle for junk.
We need to step up our act. It would add credibility to the very fine range of goods produced in Ireland."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10080197.html,2006-01-19 00:00:00,Strong trade for cull cows good sign,"There has been an easing of the trade in Britain, with uncertainty as to the impact which the ending of their Over Thirty Minutes scheme will have on the supply of cattle.
Here, most of the cattle killed during the opening days of this week were pre-purchased at last week's prices, and probably cost the processors a shade more than they would have made this week, when a tighter policy was adopted on pricing, with the possibility of a squeeze on prices if the trade continued to weaken.
Up to 291 cents/kg (104p/lb) is being paid for R grade animals, which is broadly in line with last week. Prices in the south of the country edged a shade lower, coming closer to 288 cents/kg (103p/lb), while in the north west, 294 cents/kg (105p/lb) was reported.
Prices for O grade are 283 and back to 280 cents/kg (101p or 100p/lb).
The trade eased in Britain over the past week after a very strong start to the year.
Strong demand after Christmas for re-stocking after a strong seasonal trade resulted in a sharp increase in prices for supplies of cattle, and there are reports this week that some of retailers are finding it difficult to retain profit margins on the higher cost carcasses.
There is also concern in the trade that the ending of the Over Thirty Months scheme could result in an additional 10,000 head of cattle per week being available for the UK market, leaving wholesalers uncertain as to how it will impact on the market, and running down stocks in the lead-up.
Nevertheless, the absence of Brazilian beef from the UK remains a huge factor, and it is more likely that the trade will enter a period of stability at current prices, rather than weaken, which would be out of character as the spring trade approaches.
There is a very good trade continuing here for cull cows, which is a good sign for farmers.
Up to 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) is being quoted for good quality cows this week, and the best quality are making in the region of 266 cents/kg (95p/lb) at the top paying outlets, which equates with the price for prime beef of a couple of months ago."

Throughput was up to 20% higher than average for the first week of January at a total kill of 30,767 head. There was a bullock supply of 13,110 head and 9,134 heifers, both substantially higher than the same week last year or the average weekly kill for early January.
The top individual factory average for R4L bullocks was 106p/lb at Donegal Meats. AIBP at Clones, Euro Farm Foods, Duleek, Dawn Meats at Ballaghadereen all paid 105p/lb and almost all the other operating plants paid averages of over 104p/lb.
The highest factory average for R4L heifers was over 106p/lb at Kepak, Clonee. Donegal Meats paid an average of just under 106p/lb and AIBP at Rathkeale, Slaney Meats and Kildare Chilling each paid an average of 105.4p/lb. The average for O3 heifers was 102p/lb with a top price of 104p/lb at Jennings of Ballinrobe and 103p/lb or better at Dawn Meats, Ballaghadereen, Ashbourne Meats, Roscrea, and Euro Farm Foods, Duleek.
Neighbouring processors Euro Farm Foods and Exel Meats at Kilbeggan led on cull cow prices with plenty of competition for the good cows in particular. Euro paid an average of 96p/lb for cows grading R. Exel paid an average of almost 92p/lb for O4L grade and over 89p/lb for P+3 grade. Meadow Meats, Rathdowney, Kepak, Clonee, Moyvalley Meats, Co Kildare, Duffy’s of Gort, AIBP, Clones and Dawn Meats Ballyhaunis were also among the strong contenders."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10112027.html,2006-01-19 00:00:00,Strong EU demand for Irish beef predicted,"Officials at the food export board believe that strong EU beef consumption provides the basis for stable trading in 2006, despite several major unpredictable market factors.
They predict an EU-15 beef shortfall of 350,000 tonnes between production and consumption, even after allowing for increased cow beef supplies from the UK.
However, how much of the deficit can be filled by Irish beef will depend on factors such as how long the EU ban on Brazilian beef continues; when British beef exports resume; and the outcome of World Trade Organisation negotiations.
Potential obstacles for Irish exporters include a backlog of Brazilian beef hitting the EU, if the foot and mouth ban is lifted; and UK beef re-appearing on the continental markets, if the EU lifts a nine year old export ban.
Meanwhile, Irish exporters are resigned to losing about 25,000 tonnes of trade to the UK, now that their over 30 months cattle are back in the food chain.
In 2005, Irish meat and livestock exports, with a combined export value of €2.1 billion, accounted for some 30% of total Irish food exports, and were 2% higher than in 2004.
The shift to continental EU markets continued, with volumes rising by 11%.
Exports to non-EU markets accounted for less than 8% of the total, compared with more than 50% some five years ago. These are expected to dwindle further, as EU export subsidies are phased out by 2013.
Bord Bia chief executive Aidan Cotter said access to the EU market is a key issue in the WTO negotiations now drawing to a conclusion. If the EU offer now on the table were to be part of an overall agreement, beef imports to the EU would rise from 7% to 19% of the market by 2013, and beef prices would fall by 10%.
Live cattle exports from Ireland increased by more than 40% during 2005, according to Bord Bia, which predicts similar volumes during 2006, but warns that trade to the Lebanon is unlikely, after last month’s withdrawal of export refunds. Live exports depend on continued shipping access to continental Europe, which worked very well in 2005, according to the food board."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10080197.html,2006-01-19 00:00:00,Strong trade for cull cows good sign,"There has been an easing of the trade in Britain, with uncertainty as to the impact which the ending of their Over Thirty Minutes scheme will have on the supply of cattle.
Here, most of the cattle killed during the opening days of this week were pre-purchased at last week's prices, and probably cost the processors a shade more than they would have made this week, when a tighter policy was adopted on pricing, with the possibility of a squeeze on prices if the trade continued to weaken.
Up to 291 cents/kg (104p/lb) is being paid for R grade animals, which is broadly in line with last week. Prices in the south of the country edged a shade lower, coming closer to 288 cents/kg (103p/lb), while in the north west, 294 cents/kg (105p/lb) was reported.
Prices for O grade are 283 and back to 280 cents/kg (101p or 100p/lb).
The trade eased in Britain over the past week after a very strong start to the year.
Strong demand after Christmas for re-stocking after a strong seasonal trade resulted in a sharp increase in prices for supplies of cattle, and there are reports this week that some of retailers are finding it difficult to retain profit margins on the higher cost carcasses.
There is also concern in the trade that the ending of the Over Thirty Months scheme could result in an additional 10,000 head of cattle per week being available for the UK market, leaving wholesalers uncertain as to how it will impact on the market, and running down stocks in the lead-up.
Nevertheless, the absence of Brazilian beef from the UK remains a huge factor, and it is more likely that the trade will enter a period of stability at current prices, rather than weaken, which would be out of character as the spring trade approaches.
There is a very good trade continuing here for cull cows, which is a good sign for farmers.
Up to 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) is being quoted for good quality cows this week, and the best quality are making in the region of 266 cents/kg (95p/lb) at the top paying outlets, which equates with the price for prime beef of a couple of months ago."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10106861.html,2006-01-21 00:00:00,Year’s final figures,"Just over 1.6 million head of cattle were processed at the export factories.
This was a drop of 6.8%, equivalent to 118,000 head less going through the plants, but the drop in numbers was partly compensated for by an increase of 4% in the average weight of carcasses.
This meant the total production of meat at the factories fell only 2%.
According to Bord Bia the total value of beef exports was 1% higher at €1.34 billion. This was due to the rise in cattle prices of over 4% for the year and the higher carcass weights.
The throughput of bullocks was down 75,000 head, a fall of 9%.
The fall reflected the strong level of disposals during the final weeks of 2004 - to benefit from the slaughter premium which ended on December 31, 2004 - impacting on supplies during the first half of last year. Higher live exports during 2003 also contributed to the lower availability of finished cattle for slaughtering last year.
The changeover to the Single Payment in January 2005, which removed the restriction on stocking levels for premia entitlement, led to farmers retaining cattle for longer to raise slaughter weights and the increase meat yield of 4% at the factories.
The supply of heifers to the factories fell by 10% with 42,000 less available for slaughter during the year. This pattern was also contributed by the change in direct payments to farmers.
There was very little change in the number of male beef animals sold as bulls at a throughput of 94,000 head and cow throughput was also largely unchanged at 342,000 head.
Carcass weights for young bulls were 9% higher and cows were 2% higher."

Sales increased 4.5% to $5.23 billion (€4.25bn), the company said yesterday.
McDonald’s said it plans to buy back $1bn (€810m) in stock this quarter.
Full-year capital spending will total $1.8bn (€1.4bn) and include the opening of 800 new restaurants, McDonald’s said. The company affirmed its goal of increasing annual sales by 3%-5% and operating profit by 6%-7%.
Global comparable-store sales rose 4.2% last quarter, gaining 4.1% in the US and 5.8% in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa.
Growth has slowed from a year earlier, when global same-store sales climbed 9.5%.
In the US, extended hours and wider availability of credit and debit card payment options helped sales, chief executive officer Jim Skinner said.
In June, McDonald’s increased to 4,000 from 2,500 the number of restaurants open 24 hours a day.
Fourth-quarter operating margin for company-owned stores was unchanged at 15.3%, McDonald’s said.
The US margin widened to 19.1% from 19% after the gain in same-store sales outweighed higher costs for commodities, labour and rent.
Declining same-store sales and rising labour expenses in Britain caused the European margin to narrow to 15.7% from 15.8%. Beef costs also increased.
But a discount ‘eurosaver’ menu and healthier offerings including salads have helped sales in Europe.
Since taking over in November 2004, Mr Skinner has continued his predecessors’ strategy of boosting revenue with more expensive items appealing to health-conscious consumers, including premium chicken sandwiches and fruit and walnut salads.
Television and radio advertising spurred sales of ‘McGriddle’ sandwiches.
For the year, net income increased 14% to $2.6bn (€2.1bn) on a 7.9% gain in sales to $15.4bn (€12.5bn)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10039077.html,2006-01-26 00:00:00,Jitters after OTM ends in UK,"The OTM scheme is replaced by the Older Cattle Disposal Scheme - restricted to animals born before August 1996 - potentially flooding the UK market with an extra 4,000 tonnes of cow beef per week.
The wholesale trade in Britain had been exercising caution last week and showing nervousness about holding large stocks of beef ahead of the ending of the OTM Scheme last weekend, unsure as to the immediate effect it would have on supplies.
Irish processors reacted in a similar manner on Monday, reducing quotes for all grades of animals by 6 to 9 cents/kg (2 or 3p/lb), as they awaited the impact of the additional supplies on the UK trade.
Farmers labelled the factory move as “opportunistic” pulling of prices while supplies were strong. But resistance was limited from farmers anxious to sell, minimising any effect on supplies to the plants.
The general quote across the country for cattle on Monday was 285 and back to 274 cents/kg (102p to 98p/lb) for R and O grades, with the processors reporting that they were getting plenty of cattle. They were aided by the continued increase in finished cattle supplies. Last week’s factory kill of 33,255 head was up 2,500 head on the previous week. Steers accounted for 14,863 head compared to 13,110 head a week earlier. This left processors confident that the supply of cattle is at least adequate and, despite the lower price quotes, booking remained strong this week.
Beef processors and wholesalers on both sides of the Irish sea are acting with caution until the extent of the OTM impact on the UK trade becomes clear.
It is likely that there will be a week or two of pressure on prices while the market settles, but the trade should remain stable while Brazilian beef supplies remain excluded from Britain.
Cull cow prices have not been affected here this week - which is a good sign. Up to 266 cents/kg (95p/lb) is available for carcasses making R grade and the base line prices are ranging from 235 to 252 cents/kg (84 to 90p/lb), with plenty of competition for cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10077044.html,2006-02-03 00:00:00,Beef bullocks up €40/head,"All sales reported more cattle on offer, leading to the largest sales of the New Year, plenty of demand for all lots, but it was very much a day for the beef bullocks to show the strongest gains.
Up to €425 over €/kg was paid at Kilkenny Mart for the best of the heavy beef bullocks in an excellent trade which saw prices for beef males gain up to €40/head on last week. The overall entry was up on last week, with 630 head on offer and store bullocks were also in strong demand showing gains of €10 to €15/head.
In the heavy bullocks a 760kg Simmental sold for €1,190, a 674kg Limousin made €1,040, and a lot of two Friesians weighing 784kg fetched €1,130. Two Limousin scaling 573kg sold for €920, four Simmentals 562kg made €815, and a lot of eight Friesians weighing 530kg sold for €680.
The trade for heifers was easier than last week but the quality beef heifers sold for up to €300 over and stores ranged €130 over to €250 over €/kg.
There was a substantial increase in the numbers on offer at Bandon yesterday where the trade remained steady at last week’s rates. The heavy bullocks made up to €260 over and lighter lots ranged €150-€230 over. Best of the continental heifers sold at up to €210 over.
There was a bigger sale at Ennis Mart where the best of the continental beef bullocks made up to €465 over €/kg, with improvements of up to €15/head. Charolais dominated the top prices. A lot of two weighing 698kg sold for €1,165, another lot of three scaling 667kg made €1,115, and a lot of two weighing 610kg sold for €1,055. Up to €450 over was paid for the best of the beef heifers with prices scaling back to €170 over."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10079956.html,2006-02-14 00:00:00,Beef prices show further gains,"Cattle supplies were strongest in the south and east yesterday, but considerably tighter up country where the prices were strongest with plenty of competition between processors for the quality animals.
Most of the factories were offering 3 cent/kg (1p/lb) more in their quoted prices with the top-up dependent on the level of supply available. While some processors in the south claimed to be getting plenty of R grade animals for 286 cent/kg (102p/lb) it was hard to find many producers willing to sell below 289 cent/kg-plus (103P/lb), which was freely available in the south. Moving east 291 cent/kg (104p/lb) was on offer at Slaney Meats and in the Midlands Exel was getting very few animals for less than 105p/lb. In the north-west they were worth another 2p/lb at least. Prices for O-grade stock were 283-280 cent/kg (101p-100p/lb) with most of them making 102p/lb and edging towards 103p/lb.
Although the market in Britain is reported to be well supplied and some of the prime cuts under pressure, the demand for cattle at Irish factories is strong, as reflected in the recovery in prices following the recent dip.
The cow trade varies dependent on requirements. Some factories are not as keen on large supplies this week, but there is still plenty of demand for all cows available and competition for the good cows in particular continues to underpin the price. The good O-grade cow is making up to 252 cent/kg (90p/lb) with a further 4p-5p/lb to be got for any R-grade carcass."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-10038478.html,2006-02-15 00:00:00,Strict paper trail from farm to plate,"There are no tests available to prove food is organic and so, for instance, if producers or retailers can pass off a conventionally-farmed chicken as organic, there could be a profit margin of more than 200%.
For this very reason, and because organic producers like to believe that trust is the hallmark of their relationship with customers, regulations are the linchpin of this sector.
Every organic producer has to take part in a paper trail which proves that his goods comply with the organic standards of one of three bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association (IOFGA), the Organic Trust or Demeter.
The Department of Agriculture is the competent authority in charge of organic food and farming in Ireland but it has approved these three bodies to inspect and certify to EU and national regulations.
In Ireland, the term organic is legally protected and so anyone using the term to describe foodstuff must comply with EU regulations. In the words of the Department of Agriculture, ""organic food is quality food produced to strict, legally-backed, internationally-recognised standards"".
""Organic farming represents a different view of farming systems, which puts a strong emphasis on environmentally friendly and sustainable farming practices, with particular concern for animal welfare. Organic farming avoids the use of synthetic fertilisers, chemicals and/or additives,"" a spokesman added.
However, it is only in the past two years that the department has really been given the teeth to tackle potential organic fraud.
Under a 2004 statutory instrument, the department now has the power to prosecute an operator who contravenes the regulations. A person found guilty of such an offence is liable on conviction to a fine of up to €3,000 or imprisonment for up to six months.
A Department of Agriculture spokesman said yesterday they hadn't prosecuted anyone yet but one case is pending. They refused to give any further information about the case for legal reasons.
As Organic Trust national co-ordinator Helen Scully explains, the regulations leading to certification are very thorough.
""For instance, an organic beef farmer is inspected every year at least once and additional inspections are random and unannounced.
""Every aspect of the management of the herd is inspected and queried, from the straw used to bed the cattle right through to the feedstuffs. All issues of animal welfare are also fully examined,"" she says.
""The abattoir used for the slaughter of the animal as well as the meat processing and labelling facilities are also inspected and audited by the Organic Trust. The distribution of the meat is also covered by strict criteria and the meat labelled as 'organic' is then placed on the supermarket shelf fully monitored from field to plate.""
IOFGA, Demeter and the Organic Trust all believe that the regulations are tight enough to unearth any foul play.
IOFGA certification manager Paschal Gilliard says: ""We have had a few cases where people have been abusing the organic sign but the department are normally down on them within the days. It's getting tighter and tighter.
""It can also be expensive for producers if they flout the law as, for instance, if they are in the fourth year of Department of Agriculture-run Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), which has extra payments for organic farmers, they will have to give back grants received to date.
""They can add up to a considerable amount of money. We believe the department have a strong strategy in this area.""
But Demeter scheme manager Michael Miklis says there will always be a few black sheep.
""There are very few out there and they are known. But there is the sense now though that many of the newcomers to organics are more money-driven than their predecessors.
""They're much less idealists. We have 218 pages of standards in our booklet and you'll see that they'll just pick out what they want and ignore the rest.""
Some of the older organic farmers have also allegedly ""lost faith in regulations"" as they believed that the EU regulations, which began in 1999, were set ""to the lowest common denominator"".
Richard Auler from Cahir, Co Tipperary, an organic farmer of 25 years and an IOFGA member, says: ""Many people believed that they were harmonised to the lowest possible standards.
The British Soil Association have set their regulations at a higher level and the three Irish groups tried but the department wanted to keep the gate open and not deter newcomers with higher regulatory standards.
""It also worries me with some of the newer converts that they could have a 'how much can I get away with?' attitude unlike others who, for instance, won't use any conventional feed while the newer people will use the maximum of what they are permitted. It's more about money and less about ideology.""
The Department of Agriculture doesn't believe that there is any need to strengthen regulation but said: ""As cases are prosecuted, the adequacy of the 2004 statutory instrument will be tested.""
They also added that in the area of poultry and animal housing, they have aimed higher than the EU regulations.
""There are as many people complaining that the regulations are set too high as there are saying they are set too low,"" a spokesman added.
It's also worth noting that the department is targeting farmers' markets to ensure that stall holders are not falsely selling goods as organic. An inspector, solely looking after farmers' markets, is now employed by the department to check organic credentials.
But, if there is one area of the organic market that appears more open to abuse, it is clearly the import/export market.
EU Regulations provide that organic produce can be imported from third countries once that country is on a list of countries approved by the EU Commission who are deemed to have equivalent standards to the EU.
Countries with equivalent rules of production at present include Argentina, Australia, Hungary, Israel and Switzerland.
The Department of Agriculture may also authorise the importation of organic produce from third countries not included above. These are authorised on a case-by-case basis.
There are fears amongst producers that an increasing amount of 'organic' food is coming in from overseas, making it difficult to establish its exact origins.
Up to 70% of the fruit and vegetables in Irish supermarkets are imported largely because the likes of common fruits like oranges, grapes and bananas can't be grown locally. In many cases however, multiples can also secure a bigger mark-up and locate less single-minded producers abroad.
Last year, speaking at Britain's Nafferton Ecological Farming Group Research Centre, Professor Carl Leifert said that ""most imported organics scrape the bare minimum of organic standards because it's all about cost"".
""This produce is typically swathed in plastic packaging in order for it to withstand the journey from, say, Kenya or the US. A kiwi fruit from New Zealand will create five times its own weight in CO2 emissions.""
Already, in the US and Canada, big business and the Organic Consumers Association have been at knife pont over moves by the Organic Trade Association, which represents big food names like Kraft, Dole and Horizon, to lobby the Senate to overturn a court ruling outlawing the use of synthetic substances in organic processing.
They say such changes would savage their margins.
Also last year, a British butcher was fined more than £6,000 (€8,742) for falsely labelling food. Andrew Portch, a Somerset farmer, was fined more than £3,000 for food-labelling offences and using organic certification without the right accreditation.
As organic food increases in popularity, more people are going to take advantage, the British Trading Standards Institute admitted afterwards.
Certainly, the issue of organic regulation is on course to become a more hotly-debated topic in and outside the organic sector as the number of producers swell, lured by lucrative REPS payments, the financial constraints of the Fischler reform and by growing consumer demand.
And, as larger food companies buy into this lucrative niche market, tensions are also bound to reach boiling point."

In the south, the general quote for R grade stock was 289 and back to 286 cents/kg (103p or 102p/lb), with prices offered for O grade at 283 and back to 280 cents/kg (101p or 100p/lb).
In the east, 291 cents/kg (104p/lb) was on offer, and in the midlands, up to 294 cents/kg (105p/lb) was being quoted to cattle farmers.
Although the supply of cattle was generally reported to be stronger across the south and east of the country, farmers were negotiating better than quoted prices for their cattle with the factories.
The top up was based on the factories’ need to get more cattle, and in general, demand was strong enough to necessitate paying a margin over the quoted price.
Quality R grade stock were making 299 cents/kg (107p/lb) in the north west, with pro rata prices on offer for O and U grades.
The beef trade in Britain continued to make a full recovery from a setback at the end of last month.
The trade for prime cuts is reported to be still under pressure, but overall, the trade has steadied. The supply of beef to the market is reported to be relatively strong, boosted by a steady supply of cow beef.
Prices to British farmers have also recovered, with R4L returning the equivalent of 297 cents/kg (106p/lb), incl VAT.
The Irish beef market dipped in tandem with the UK market, and the supply of steers followed this trend, but has since increased, as prices lifted.
The trade for cows continues strong, and has come through the ending of the OTM scheme in Britain without impact.
Although some processors here were not as interested in large numbers of cows this week, there is still strong demand for cows, and plenty of competition to keep prices strong.
Up to 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) is being paid for O grade cows, while the quality cows are commanding 266 and back to 263 cents/kg (95p or 94p/lb)."

Imports of beef slaughtered after February 4, from the disease hit Argentinian province of Corrientes and six neighbouring regions, are likely to be banned. Russia, which takes 20% of Argentina’s beef exports, is likely to follow suit.
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Israel, Paraguay, Peru, Singapore, South Africa and Uruguay immediately banned all imports of beef and beef byproducts last week from Argentina, the world’s third-largest exporter of beef.
The EU takes the largest share of Argentina’s 1,400 million per year beef exports.
With about 9,000 tonnes (and about 6,000 tonnes of corned beef) annually going to the UK, which is Ireland’s main customer for beef, farmers here are likely to gain from the effect on the market trends. But they will also recall their own narrow escape from devastation by the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in the UK, and be fully aware of the potential for foot and mouth to wreck the beef industry - particularly now because the disease has also struck recently within miles of the EU border, in the Thrace region of Turkey, which shares a border with Greece.
All 3,500 head on the affected 15,000 acre ranch in Argentina were slaughtered, after about 70 cattle were found to have foot and mouth symptoms.
The disease may have come from illegal imports of live cattle from Paraguay, where prices are lower.
It will have a disproportionate effect on a world beef supply already hit by prolonged drought in Australia, the aftermath of BSE discoveries in the US and Canada, tates, and FMD in Brazil.
But Brazil still managed to increase its beef exports in 2005 by 30% despite the disease outbreak in October, and Argentina may also increase production from non-affected areas, in order to exploit the world beef supply shortage."

The improvement was paid in a week that saw bullock supplies increase by 1,400 head to 14,718 head. The total kill for the week was 33,318 head, 1,200 head higher than the same week last year. Supplies of heifers at 9,875 and cows at 6,227, were higher than at this time last year.
The highest prices paid for bullocks last week was 107.8p/lb for U grade at Donegal Meats, a whisker ahead of Newgrange Meats and Liffey Meats. Donegal paid an average of 106p/lb for R4L with Liffey Meats paying over 105p/lb and Newgrange, Moyvalley, Kepak (Clonee), Slaney (Bunclody), and AIBP (Clones) each averaging a shade under 105p/lb. Most of the remainder paid in excess of 104p/lb average.
Ashbourne, Jennings and Donegal paid averages in excess of 103p/lb for O4L bullocks and were just ahead of Liffeys, Exel and Euro.
The average for R4L heifers was similar to the bullocks. Kepak (Clonee) led the pack at 106p/lb. Slaney, AIBP (Nenagh), Donegal and Liffeys all paid in excess of 105p/lb. The average for O3 heifers was 101p/lb.
The top prices for cows were improved by 2p-4p/lb. Quality R grade cows gains up to 4p/lb Euro paying over 96p/lb. Exel Meats at Kilbeggan continues to push the trade for cows paying an average of over 91p/lb for O grade and almost 90p/lb for P grade cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10107424.html,2006-02-16 00:00:00,Up to 299 c/kg (107p/lb) quoted,"With the exception of some parts of the south, where supplies of cattle were most plentiful, quoted prices were generally improved by 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) for R and O grade cattle at the processors. In the south, the general quote for R grade stock was 289 and back to 286 cents/kg (103p or 102p/lb), with prices offered for O grade at 283 and back to 280 cents/kg (101p or 100p/lb).
In the east, 291 cents/kg (104p/lb) was on offer, and in the midlands, up to 294 cents/kg (105p/lb) was being quoted to cattle farmers.
Although the supply of cattle was generally reported to be stronger across the south and east of the country, farmers were negotiating better than quoted prices for their cattle with the factories.
The top up was based on the factories’ need to get more cattle, and in general, demand was strong enough to necessitate paying a margin over the quoted price.
Quality R grade stock were making 299 cents/kg (107p/lb) in the north west, with pro rata prices on offer for O and U grades.
The beef trade in Britain continued to make a full recovery from a setback at the end of last month.
The trade for prime cuts is reported to be still under pressure, but overall, the trade has steadied. The supply of beef to the market is reported to be relatively strong, boosted by a steady supply of cow beef.
Prices to British farmers have also recovered, with R4L returning the equivalent of 297 cents/kg (106p/lb), incl VAT.
The Irish beef market dipped in tandem with the UK market, and the supply of steers followed this trend, but has since increased, as prices lifted.
The trade for cows continues strong, and has come through the ending of the OTM scheme in Britain without impact.
Although some processors here were not as interested in large numbers of cows this week, there is still strong demand for cows, and plenty of competition to keep prices strong.
Up to 252 cents/kg (90p/lb) is being paid for O grade cows, while the quality cows are commanding 266 and back to 263 cents/kg (95p or 94p/lb)."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10121806.html,2006-02-18 00:00:00,British sheepmeat production to fall,"The expectation is for a smaller lamb crop in 2006 and an increase in ewe lamb retention rates, leading to a reduction in new season lamb. A further decrease in the breeding flock is anticipated for this year as producers adjust to decoupling.
Arising from the drop in production, the MLC predicts an increase of 7% in imports, following a drop of 8% in imports last year. Along with continued imports of mutton from Ireland, New Zealand will continue as the largest supplier of sheepmeat to the market at around 115,000 tonnes. An increase in the supply of lamb meat from non-EU countries is also expected to contribute to the market, but this could be tempered by the effect of any spread of foot-and-mouth disease in South America.
With lamb continuing to be more expensive for the housewife than other meats in Britain, it is expected that consumption will drop by about 3%, marking a continued decline in consumption of sheepmeat for the third consecutive year. Demand for sheepmeat is being affected by more competitively priced beef coming on to the market this year. Forecast consumption of sheepmeat in 2006 at 347,000 tonnes will be the lowest since before 2003.
The forecast of the MLC is that Britain will also export about 81,000 tonnes amounting to 4% more lamb in 2006. France will account for up to 75% of exports for the year.
Irish lamb production year to date is slightly lower than the same period last year with just under 1,000 head less being supplied to export plants."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/yourview/arid-10054449.html,2006-02-22 00:00:00,Why promote beef from South America?,"I was very disappointed that a home-grown programme would promote South American beef when prices for our beef have fallen low enough to threaten the viability of beef farming in Ireland.
While Irish meats are subject to the strictest of regulations, the same does not apply in South America.
Irish beef is 100% traceable to the source of origin and is totally safe for the consumer.
In contrast, the IFA has stated that a 2005 report from the EU Food & Veterinary Office (FVO) on South American beef raised serious questions about consumer issues, including deficiencies in traceability, movement controls, animal health and hygiene.
The use of hormones in farming in South America - a practice banned in EU countries - should be a cause of serious concern for the Irish consumer.
The FVO have stated that even though the South American beef that Europe imports is supposed to be hormone-free, in practice this rule is not being enforced effectively.
At present 30% of our meat is imported from non-EU third countries, primarily Brazil and Argentina.
Unfortunately, if that meat is processed in Ireland, it can be sold as Irish beef.
This is unfair to the consumer.
I appeal to people to buy Irish when shopping for food and everything else. Our jobs and our communities depend on it.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10092873.html,2006-02-23 00:00:00,9c per kg price range from north to south,"A considerable range if prices is offered to farmers from north to south, which is widening as more pressure comes on northern processors to pay higher prices to get sufficient cattle.
Factories in the south generally quoted 289 cents/kg (103p/lb) for R grade animals this week with 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) more on offer in the east and 294 cents/kg (105p/lb) on offer in the midland with a further 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) being offered in the north west.
Prices for O grade stock ranged from 283 to 289 cents/kg (101p to 103p/lb).
While the factories in the south are trying to buy cattle close to the quoted prices, and resisting any significant top up on these prices, processors further north have to pay over the quoted prices to get cattle, as the market continues to harden.
Although, there has been no change in the market in Britain over the past week, domestic supplies are lower than anticipated, which is helping to maintain the price level. With no immediate likelihood of a lifting of the restriction on Brazilian beef, and some Argentine beef also now banned, reliance on domestic and Irish supplies continues, and prices for the quality R grade steers at the processors have edged 6 to 9 cents/kg (2p-3p/lb) over the Irish price.
Markets in France and Italy are reported to be stable and there are slight improvements in the trade in Netherlands and Germany.
Here, the trade for cows is continuing very strong.
With plenty of competition for cows, over 90p/lb is being paid for good quality O grade cows, and the best of the Rs are making up to 95p/lb in trading, which has continued stable and strong for several weeks and shows no sign of immediate change."

But with the exception of Kepak, the price increase was not sufficient to bring them into the listing of the highest paying factories as overall prices continued to move positively upwards and group average prices at both AIBP and Dawn remained slightly under the national average.
Nationally the average paid by the factories for R4L bullocks was just short of 105p/lb. The supply of bullocks increased further to 15,854 head, similar to the corresponding week last year. A top price of 107p/lb was paid at Donegal Meats. The other leaders among 12 factories paying averages over 105p/lb were Euro, Newgrange, Kepak (Athleague and Clonee) Kildare and Liffeys. The average for O4L bullocks was a shade over 102p/lb.
The heifer kill was a strong 9,805 head, 1,500 head higher than the same week last year, with an average of almost 105p/lb for R4L and O3 averaging under 102p/lb. Kepak (Clonee) paid the highest individual factory average at 106.3p/lb, just ahead of Slaney and AIBP (Nenagh) at 106p/lb. Liffeys, Newgrange and Euro were all on averages of 105.5p/lb.
AIBP (Clones) took over the leading position for cows paying an average of almost 95p/lb for R5 and 93p/lb for O4H with Newgrange the top for P grade paying an average of 91p/lb for P+4L. Also competing for cows on price were Kepak (Clonee), Exel and Moyvalley."

Surfaces and utensils should also be thoroughly cleaned.
Despite food safety assurances, poultry sales have been hit hard by the arrival of the virus in europe.
Around 20 countries have banned poultry imports from France, the world’s fourth-biggest poultry exporter
Within the EU, early market trends indicated that consumers caught up in the bird flu scare were turning to veal. Beef and pigmeat prices showed only modest changes, indicating no pick-up in demand as an alternative to poultry.
However, veal prices have increased strongly. EU prices for finished veal calves have gained 5% since the start of 2006 and are currently 33% ahead of this time last year according to EU Commission figures. Dutch veal prices have seen the largest increase, rising 12% since the start of 2006."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10048214.html,2006-03-03 00:00:00,More buyers pay higher prices,"The biggest improvement in prices was in the Leinster region, where very strong demand pushed all prices forward at mart sales at Kilkenny and Blessington. Trade was a bit more tempered in the south, with prices similar to last week at Bandon Mart.
Prices for forward store bullocks increased by €50-€70/head in Leinster, where stores over 500kgs sold for up to €550 over and up to €520 over was paid at Kilkenny for similar weight range animals.
Trade at Kilkenny was described as “fast selling with a lot of customers for both bullocks and heifers” and “an excellent trade for cull cows.”
A lot of four Charolais bullocks weighing 546kgs sold for €1,065, another lot of three Charolais weighing 543kgs made €990 and in the heavier weight range a 662kgs Angus sold for €1,090, a lot of two Charolais weighing 760kgs sold for €1,260, and another lot of two Charolais scaling 661kgs made €1,055, while a lot of two Friesians 718kgs sold for €1,080. Heavy heifers fetched up to €350 over and up to €325 over was paid for stores.
At Blessington store bullocks over 500kgs ranged €350-€550 over, and choice prices were paid for fancy beef bullocks and heifers.
Store bullocks over 400kgs sold at €300-€430 over. Store heifers ranged €230-€300 over.
At Bandon Mart heavy bullocks ranged €170-€260 over and lighter stores ranged €200-€310 over. The best of the continental beef heifers ranged up to €245 over €/kg, and Angus and Herefords sold at €140-€180 over.
The increase in the numbers of cattle on offer at the mart sales has levelled off with supplies at yesterday’s sales similar to last week at most of the centres."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10121431.html,2006-03-09 00:00:00,Up to 108p for cattle in north west,"The rate of price increase has varied, depending on local availability of cattle and varying levels of demand at processors.
Factory resistance to price rises also remains a factor in the market.
While some factories advanced their quoted prices up to 3 cents/kg (1p/lb), others held their quotes and only paid extra if they had to, in order to get sufficient cattle, and some decided to reduce their killing days rather than pay higher prices for cattle.
Prices for R grade animals ranged from 105p/lb in the south and the midlands to 106p/lb in the east, and up to 108p/lb, which was secured for good quality stock in the north west.
Prices for O grade cattle ranged from 102p to 104p/lb.
Supplies have tightened over the past two weeks, putting the squeeze on processors, and strengthening the hand of cattle farmers to deal for higher prices. Farmers with good quality stock are securing deals for 105p or 106p/lb, and dealing the transport into the price in certain cases.
The recent cold weather helped to firm the trade in Britain, where demand remains steady, and prices have edged up slightly, maintaining a slight margin over the Irish prices, while prices to producers in Northern Ireland are more or less on par with the south.
There is still a very good trade and keen competition for cows, which is always reckoned to be a good omen for the beef trade. Some factories have increased their quotes for cows by 6 cents/kg (2p/lb), with 92p/lb on offer for good quality O grade animals. Suppliers with quality R grade cows can bargain for up to 96p/lb at some of the best paying factories which have good contracts for quality cow beef."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10041534.html,2006-03-09 00:00:00,Sugar jobs could still be saved,"However, as things stand, EU and Government decisions of the past few years appear to have doomed the industry in Ireland.
But action by Government and Greencore could still save the 350 jobs in sugar processing for at least another year, even at the eleventh hour, and ensure that enough beet is grown for processing - if Greencore decides processing is commercially viable.
SIPTU, representing sugar factory workers, has expressed concern that not enough farmers will grow beet. But if they look at the situation through farmers’ eyes, they will see how the writing has been on the wall for sugar beet since 2003, when farm production was decoupled from the Single Payment.
This had a major effect on tillage farming last year, when Irish growers took advantage of the new scheme to cut their cereal cropping by 60,000 acres, and in most cases end up with more money in their pockets, because of the low profitability of tillage farming. They did this through “stacking” - drawing their full Single Payment entitlements on as little as 50% of the land they farmed five years ago. Of the 16,000 tillage farmers who draw entitlements, 4,000 “stacked”, and this trend may be accelerating, judging from the reduced sales of seeds for winter cereals.
This was a big shake-up for tillage farmers, but no sooner was it agreed than Brussels started to dismantle the EU sugar regime.
And farmers were hit at the same time with the Nitrates Directive, which complicates the business still further.
For example, they can no longer gain the full benefits of long established practices, such as autumn ploughing for spring crops, and can’t rely on extra fertiliser to boost a poorly performing crop, due to the Directive.
The decision whether or not to sow beet could not have been put to them at a worse time.
According to Teagasc sources, Irish tillage farmers are not just pessimistic after the way their business has gone in recent years, they are depressed, and less likely to take a chance with a crop which they would welcome if times were better.
Indeed, the huge uncertainty for tillage farmers who cannot make plans, because Greencore Sugar may or may not cease processing this year, could push many more to give up tillage this year than last year, and could have bad consequences not just for the sugar industry, but for the grain business as well.
“Stacking”, or even leaving the land fallow, could be the easy way out, rather than wait another few weeks for Government and Greencore decisions. The other option this year is to grow grass and raise cattle, taking advantage of the EU’s high prices, while foot and mouth reduces the beef supply from Brazil.
Unfortunately, sugar beet is down the list of options, after the 36% price cut and 20% transport subsidy cut.
Even growers still committed to this crop are fast running out of time to rent land for beet.
Four out of every 10 acres of sugar beet is normally grown on rented land, but why rush around in late March trying to secure a conacre land bargain (the Teagasc advice is that beet growers cannot afford to pay a high rent after the beet price cut)? Saying No to conacre beet is an easy and correct decision for beet growers in the midlands, and the slump in conacre prices this spring indicates that many famers are saying No.
Throw in the chance of low yields and high contractor costs, and a beet crop could be a big loser financially for them.
On the other hand, non-renting beet growers will have to continue planting an equal acreage of tillage crops to that on which their sugar beet Single Payment entitlements is based, in order to qualify for this cheque from Brussels - just one more complication for the already bamboozled tillage farmer.
Throw in the restructuring levy of €126.40 per ton of sugar which Greencore Sugar must pay the EU this year, and the 11.55% cut in sugar quotas agreed in Brussels last week, and the odds lengthen against Irish sugar processing in 2006.
The questionnaire sent by Greencore Sugar to growers won’t shed any new light on the conundrum, because it was worded in such a way that IFA advised all growers to protect their beet quota rights by responding with a Yes, whether it is their final decision or not to grow beet in 2006.
But against all the odds, there is a way to make sugar processing in 2006 possible, and secure 350 jobs for at least one more year. That requires Greencore Sugar, perhaps with the help of the Government, to draw up a fast procedure for growers who want out to transfer their beet quotas to farmers who see beet as still the most profitable tillage crop on owned land, if yields are high, and are willing to take a chance with it.
Unfortunately, much time has been lost, and every day counts if the industry is to be secured, jobs saved, and a return earned on the €25m investment to upgrade the Mallow Sugar Factory."

The intake at the factories was slightly lower at 30,869 head, bullocks accounting for 14,500, similar to the previous week, but 3,000 head down on the same week last year. The supply of heifers was down 1,100 head on the previous week at 8,363, but 2,000 head higher than the same week in 2005.
An average of just under 106p/lb was paid for R4L bullocks and the same for R4L heifers the bullock prices gaining 2 cent/kg and an improvement of 1 cent/kg in the heifer price.
Donegal Meats and Dawn Meats topped for the bullocks, both paying an average of 107p/lb, back 0.5p/lb on the previous week at Donegal and an improvement of over 2p/lb at the Dawn plant."

Some deals worth 107p/lb were reported from the Midlands for R grade stock, but they were the exception rather than the rule, except for the north-west where deals worth 107p plus were reported. Prices for O grade animals are generally 103p/lb. The factories quoted 105p-106p/lb for Rs and 102p-103p/lb for O grade.
The pressure on the processors to get cattle, in a climate of resistance to paying higher prices, has eased with supplies in more plentiful in the south and east yesterday.
The supply of beef in Britain has tightened over the past week, but it has not resulted in any upward movement in prices which continue stable at slightly above the prevailing prices to Irish producers. The trade in France, Netherlands and Italy is reported to be steady at unchanged prices, while there has been an improvement in the return for whole carcasses and most cuts in Germany over the past few days.
The trade for cows is continuing very firm with increasing competition maintaining prices at historically high levels which are running at more than 8% above 2005. Factories interested in getting cows have to pay 90p/lb plus for Os which are making up to 93p/lb. The heavy R grade cows have ranged up to 97p/lb in recent weeks and there is no sign of any weakening in this section of the trade."

Only Timoleague Brown Pudding, Imokilly Regato Cheese and Clare Island Salmon are currently registered and Connemara Hill Lamb has applied.
This compares to the hundreds of products from beer to bread that other EU states have registered.
The British have registered Scotch beef, Welsh lamb and Cornish clotted cream for instance, while the Belgians have registered dozens of their famous beers.
The French, Italians and Spanish have their culinary delights on the list too, with products ranging from cheeses to honey.
But the Irish list is very short, said Ms McGuinness.
“For a country that prides itself on quality food products it is a pity that only three Irish produced products rank as having special merit and are protected under EU food regulations.”
Registration is given for traditional speciality foods. The Protected Geographical Indication registration protects the producer and prevents copying by others.
“Clearly there are many companies of artisan Irish produce missing out on this protection, as well as the marketing opportunities arising from such registration.
“Having more such companies registered would also enhance Ireland’s international reputation as a high quality speciality food producer,” she said.
But she said the complex procedures and detailed rules that apply are very often a deterrent.
She told the European Parliament that while speciality foods were important, Europe must not forget the big picture. The demise of the Irish sugar industry was a warning of what might lie ahead as the WTO shapes the EU market.
“The question must surely be asked if sugar beet is sacrificed today, what about beef farming tomorrow. Europe needs to keep its eye on the big picture.
“It needs to recognise that the continuation of food production in the EU depends on a commitment to the sector and recognition that it cannot be expected to survive the onslaught of unlimited market access to the EU with low cost commodities produced outside the EU.”
The Irish speciality food market is currently estimated to be worth €250 million at retail prices and is predicted to grow by 65% over the next 10 years."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10069861.html,2006-03-23 00:00:00,Good prospects to midsummer,"Most processors across the southern half of the country are reasonably comfortable with the flow of cattle this week and with forward bookings. They are paying 297 cents/kg (106p/lb) plus for R grade animals, with prices a bit harder further north, and reports of more than 302 cents/kg (108p/lb) being paid in the north west.
Prices for O grade cattle are showing the best improvement from last week, with more special deals being negotiated with processors for mixed lots of finished cattle. In general, O grade prices are ranging from 103p to 105p/lb.
Beef prices in Britain, which were similar to that being paid in this country, have strengthened slightly over the past week, as reliance on supplies from the home market and on Irish imports increased after with the decision in Argentina to suspend beef exports - an encouraging development for Irish beef exporters, adding to the effect on the market of the bird flu scare and the ongoing exclusion of imports from foot and mouth disease affected areas in South America.
There are few clouds in the sky right now, with beef prospects sunny for some time ahead, a welcome change. Supply sources to the UK market have tightened up, while consumer demand holds up.
But anyone who knows the history of the beef trade will be slow to express too much optimism, fearful of uncertainties, even if market prospects through to midsummer seldom appeared better.
The trade for cow beef in Britain is also stronger and that is being reflected in the prices being paid by factories. More processors than ever are keenly interested in cows, competing strongly on price, which has strengthened over the past week.
Expect 93p/lb plus from the top factories for good quality O and P grade animals, and bargain for up to 97p/lb for quality R grade cows, which has been paid by some of the top factories."

AIBP group held the group average cost of R4L bullocks at the previous week’s level of 105.7p/lb, while Dawn Group paid an average of 105.9p/lb - an increase of 0.2p/lb - both falling short of the national average of 106.4p/lb. On individual factory performances, AIBP at Waterford exceeded the national average by paying 106.7p/lb, while four of the six factories in the AIBP Group paid average varying from 105p/lb to 105.8p/lb. Among Dawn Group, Ballaghadereen paid an average of 107.3p/lb and Meadow Meats just short of 107p/lb, with three of the six Dawn factories paying averages of 105.2p/lb or less. Kepak Group average at 106.6p/lb was slightly over national average.
Bullock intake was back by 1,000 at 14,924 head.
The highest price was 110.8p/lb for U4 bullocks at Slaney Meats.
Donegal Meats topped R4L bullocks at an average of 108.5p/lb. Euro, Dawn (Ballaghadereen) Liffeys and Kepak (Clonee) all paid over 107p/lb. The average for O4L bullocks was 104p/lb.
The national average for R4L heifers at 106.7p/lb and O3 at 103.7p/lb was unchanged from last week.
Ashbourne (Roscrea) took over the lead on cow prices at over 96p/lb for R4H. Dawn (Ballyhaunis) AIBP (Clones) and Newgrange paid over 94p/lb for Os."

Many farmers are either deferring buying-in until grass growth improves or reducing the number of cattle they are purchasing.
Marts at Bandon, Kilkenny and Blessington all reported more cattle on offer at yesterday’s sales. At Bandon a bigger entry was met with a good trade for bullocks in particular. Heavy bullocks ranged €220 to €340 over.
Two Limousin 535kgs sold for €870, a lot of 11 Friesians weighing 552kgs made €810, five Herefords scaling 480kgs sold for €800. Among lighter lots, four Simmental 343kgs fetched €580, and four Charolais 364kgs made €680. The best continental beef heifers made €300 over and stores selling at €150-€250 over.
There was 900 head on offer at Kilkenny, where trade was on par with last week or a shade easier for the plain cattle. Heavy bullocks fetched strong prices, ranging €300-€500 over, bullocks 400-500kgs making €400 over, and a good trade for quality light stores with some lots under 400kgs making €515 over. A high of €450 over was paid for the top beef heifers - a continental heifer weighing 432kgs selling for €880. Stores made €150-€320 over.
Up to €430 over was paid for beef bullocks at Blessington, stores making up to €320 and up to €350 over for beef heifers."

“I cannot understand how asking dairy farmers to foot the cost of a nest egg for those leaving the industry will improve competitiveness,” he said.
Mr Markey said the department’s emphasis on increasing competitiveness in the dairy sector is again focused on farmers, while there is little or no mention of the need for greater competitiveness at processing level.
He said the minister should abandon her plans for open trading and start examining ways of getting more milk quota into the country.
Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association president Malcolm Thompson welcomed the emphasis on consumer-focused marketing in the plan. This was central to delivering better beef and lamb prices to farmers.
“The proper resources must be committed to ensuring that there is a future for sustainable farming in Ireland,” he said.
Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers’ Association president Jackie Cahill said he was disappointed there are few actual proposals for the business of farming in the plan.
Meanwhile, an IFA blueprint for the future of agriculture is to be launched within weeks, IFA president Padraig Walshe has announced."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10059761.html,2006-03-30 01:00:00,Decoupling is double-edged,"How to reconcile contradictions like these posed a difficult task for Agriculture Minister Mary Coughlan and her staff.
And it didn’t help that its release coincided with a major stockbrokers’ report, predicting that the Irish economy could double in the next 15 years.
That doesn’t leave much time to usher in the improved land mobility, consolidation of farms, early transfer of land, and flexible quota management, which the planners rightly say are needed to make Irish farming more competitive.
They noted that farmer numbers are dropping in all developed countries, but that the rate of loss of farmers in this country has been lower than in several of our European neighbours.
That could change fast, because the likely explanation is that economic boom is still only a 10-year wonder here, whereas our European neighbours have had earlier decades of industrial prosperity pulling people away from the farms - a trend that may only be starting here.
So, personnel could quickly become the limiting factor on Irish farms. Already, a huge amount of our farm output depends on part-timers who work very long weeks, not really for the money, but because they don’t want the family farm to lie idle.
But they are quite likely to give up farming, when the tougher times for farmers predicted in the action plan arrive, and they end up earning only pennies, or even losing money, during the farming hours they put in on top of their off-farm working hours.
Most of our 135,000 farms depend on livestock and meat production, challenged by falling export refunds and greater access to the EU for imported meats.
Moving closer to world prices means much lower incomes on Irish cattle farms, for example, after the current temporary slump in world beef supply is cleared.
Pig and poultry farmers here are only now facing the environmental and animal welfare constraints which have severely hit farm output in countries like the Netherlands.
Nor can dairy farmers look forward to an easy street, as our industry vies with New Zealand and Australia for a share of the expanded trade in developing countries. On the positive side. the agri-food action plan welcomes decoupling and the freedom it gives farmers to produce only what the consumer needs.
But it’s a two edged freedom, and farmers could just as easily turn their back on the plough or the cattle shed, and chase some of the Celtic Tiger riches, as opt for hard work and low pay and dependence on the whims of the world food market.
The Government envisages that the right mix of policies and actions can provide a satisfactory lifestyle and level of income for a core of commercially viable full-time farmers, while giving part-time farmers the opportunity to supplement their farm incomes through off-farm work.
But that is a stiff challenge, as the pull from the non-farm economy strengthens, and farm profitability falls, primarily due to world trade trends.
“Structural change is necessary to increase productivity levels, improve economies of scale and maximise income earning potential”, say the planners.
In other words, Ireland needs ranches to match those in Argentina and New Zealand.
Where previous plans for farmers sought to maximise farmer numbers, the Government is now more realistic, and says it remains committed to maintaining the “optimal” number of family farms.
That’s a significant wording change, and they also admit that existing taxation incentives and Installation Aid and Early Retirement have failed to build Irish farms to competitive scale.
More will be needed, and farmers who are committed to staying in the business will have to be receptive to controversial measures to shake up farm structures. Unfortunately, the mixed reaction to Minister Coughlan’s plan for open-market transfer of milk quotas next year does not bode well.
For the objectors, there’s a timely warning in the action plan: “Old attitudes and approaches will not survive the test of competition”."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10086818.html,2006-04-06 01:00:00,Automated classification increased price range,"“We proposed a spread of at least 40 cent to 45 cent per kilogram across the range of animals but did not succeed at the time,” said Cormac Healy of Meat Industry Ireland (MII), during a report on carcase classification to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food.
But farmers who supply top quality cattle now get up to 22c per kg more than a supplier of inferior cattle, according to the spokesman for MII, which represents beef processors.
“One must bear in mind that some producers favour the flat pay system because it may suit the poorer quality animals. With flat pricing, however, poorer animals benefit at the expense of higher quality animals,” he told the Committee.
He reported that between 85% and 90% of cattle slaughtered at export approved premises in 2005 were graded by the automated carcase classification system. It is in place at 24 of the country’s 35 export approved premises, with each machine grading between 300 and 350 carcases per day.
The Department of Agriculture has expressed satisfaction with the new grading technology, following about 55,000 independent checks in the past year, during 750 visits to plants. They found 80% accuracy in grading.
Unannounced visits are made to plants using the new grading machines at least every six weeks by the Department’s standards panel.
Department officers assess carcase classification and the results produced by the machines, including checking adherence to national carcase dressing specifications.
“In the near future, a European inspection of the system will be introduced. The grading system in each member state is assessed by a European panel on a rotating basis and we have one of those inspections at the end of April,” said Mr Healy.
“Saleable meat yield is the next step, and technology is capable of predicting it,” he told the Committee.
“There is work to be done to get the saleable yield part right, because we no longer sell carcases of beef,” the Committee was told by Ciarán Fitzgerald, chairman of Meat Industry Ireland.
He said: “People consume boneless meat cuts, and we need a better correlation between the yield of those products and the information the farmer gets. There is a commitment at industry level to doing that and, in parallel, to encourage producer groups, because many of the niche markets are best served by individual contractors with producer groups.”
Vision-image technology is used to predict saleable meat yield, muscle size and muscle distribution. It would have to be adapted to the EUROP grid, but results were favourable in Irish trials in 1990 and 2000.
“One of the challenges that lies ahead concerns the required cutting specification,” said Mr Healy. “Carcases are cut up into primals and then into consumer cuts. Different customers, outlets and markets have different cutting specifications and, therefore, while there is a standard EUROP grid for grading, not every company throughout Ireland operates to the same cutting specifications.”
He said the industry in Ireland is well ahead of counterparts in many other member states, being first in the EU to use automated carcase classification."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10088645.html,2006-04-06 01:00:00,Call for fairer pricing,"“Quality beef production from the suckler cow herd will not survive under this type of penal price structure,” says the cattle farmers’ spokesman.
He says the price structure has not changed since the early 1990s, when 90% of steer beef was going into intervention or to low-priced international markets. Mr Bryan says it is time for the processing industry to reflect the premium prices being paid for quality production across the continental EU markets.

Bullock supplies rose by a further 1,000 head to over 18,000 - the highest year to date and the highest for corresponding weeks since 2003 - out of a total throughput of almost 34,500 head. They are now running at 3,000 head per week more than this time last year.
The supply of heifers increased by a further 500 head to over 9,100 which is more than 3,000 head higher than the same week in 2005.
The top price paid was a shade under 111p/lb for U3 at Donegal Meats. The average for R4L bullocks increased to just over 107p/lb. Donegal Meats topped at over 109p/lb. Five more paid over 108p/lb, Euro, Kepak (Athleague), Dawn (Ballaghadereen), and Newgrange.
Group averages for the major players were not in the top league and showed wide variation in the prices from one area to another for similar grade animals. AIBP Group average of 106.4p/lb varied from an average of 107.7p/lb at the Clones plant, to 105.5p/lb at Rathkeale.
Average for the Dawn Group was 106.8p/lb, with the price spread from over 108p/lb at Ballaghadereen, to 105p/lb at Charleville.
Kepak group average was just on the national average at 107.1p/lb.

Southern factories quoted a base price of 106p/lb for R grade animals this week, but very few cattle were sold for less than 107p, with some making a bit more in special deals. In the midlands, 108p was easily attainable, with 110p to be got in the north west, where supplies are tightest, as usual.
Prices for O grade animals are generally ranging from 104 to 106p, with some finishers doing deals with the factories for a 106p flat price for good quality mixes of R and O stock.
Although the intake reached a three year record for March two weeks ago, when over 18,000 bullocks were supplied, factories are still very anxious for all of the cattle they can get. The market for beef is continuing strong in Britain, where supplies are very tight, and prices achieved by UK farmers have now gone slightly ahead of Irish prices. Demand for beef has improved in the Netherlands over the past week, while Italy is experiencing a steady trade, and prices are holding in France.
The trade for cow beef has further strengthened at home and overseas. There is increased competition among Irish factories for cows, at higher prices. They are paying 93 or 94p for O grade cows, and up to 97p for the good quality heavy R grade cows. Prices have improved in Britain, where a drop off in supply is attributed to the introduction of pre-movement testing for TB."

The farmer pay sheet returns from the highest individual factory price within the group was almost 108p/lb at Clones and the lowest was just over 107p/lb at Rathkeale.
The returns showed the average paid was slightly lower at just over 109p/lb. Overall 10 factories paid an average of 108p/lb or better, a further 10 paying over 107p/lb, while five purchased their supply for less than 107p/lb against a national average of 107.5p/lb, which gained 1 cent/kg on the previous week.
The top prices paid for bullocks was 111p/lb for U4H at Kildare Chilling just ahead of Donegal Meats. The average for O4L bullocks was 105.5p/lb. Contrary to perceptions of a tightening in supply, intake of bullocks climbed by a further 2,000 head to 19,420, out of a total kill of 36,709, but the stronger supply did not deter the upward price trend.
The average for R4L heifers was almost identical to that of the bullocks at 107.6p/lb with a top price just short of 111p/lb at Kepak, Clonee. Prices for O3 heifers averaged 105p/lb.
The trade for cows reached a new peak at 98p/lb for R grade animals at Euro Foods. Liffeys paid 95p/lb for O/P grades."

The ban remains until the beef supply to the domestic market is ensured at prices accessible to consumers, said Government ministers last week, as they reached agreement with the meat industry and cattle farmers on the supply of 180,000 tons of beef per month.
As a result, consumers in Argentina should pay between €0.66 and 2.50 per kg. They have one of the highest beef consumptions in the world, at 135 pounds per person per year.
The latest Government action seems to have poured cold water on a federal judge’s temporary ruling against the ban on beef exports. Interior Minister Anibal Fernandez criticised the ruling."

Trade for Friesian bullocks was slightly stronger at Bandon where there was a bigger sale and trade in general similar to last week.
Heavy bullocks ranged €230 over to €320 over. Lighter lots sold at €200 over to €330 over and Friesians ranged €80-€240 over. A lot of three Charolais weighing 530kg sold for €850, six Angus 515kg made €800, five Friesians 458kg made €605, and three Herefords 380kg sold for €630.
Trade for heifers was solid with continental heifers on offer making up to €250 over. Stores made €140-€220 over. There were 1,200 head on offer at Kilkenny. Trade for bullocks was unchanged, but the lighter lots were a harder sell mainly due to the shortage of grass.
Two Charolais 649kg sold for €1,050, four Charolais 616kg made €1,050, three Simmentals 601kg sold for €960. Up top €420 over was paid for the best of the beef heifers and stores ranged €220-€330 over.
There was a big sale at Ennis where €1,450 was paid for a black Limousin bullock weighing 786kg.
More general prices ranged €200-€500 over, with a small number of lots selling for more than €500 over.
A Charolais heifer 670kg made a top price of €1,290. Heavy heifers in general ranged €200-€500 over.
The pattern of trade was similar at Blessington Mart where beef bullocks ranged €350-€445 and forward stores made €300 over to €420 over."

AIBP (Rathkeale) added 1.5p/lb to bring the average paid to 108.5p/lb, with a similar gain at Charleville Foods bringing the return to 107p/lb at the plant.
The farmer pay sheet returns show that Euro Foods and Moyvalley paid averages for R4L bullocks of more than 109p/lb, followed by Liffeys, Newgrange, Exel and AIBP (Rathkeale) each averaging just under 109p/lb. AIBP Group average gained 0.5p/lb to 108p/lb, Dawn Group adding 0.6p/lb to bring the group average to just under 108p/lb, while Kepak Group was unchanged paying an average of 108p/lb.
The top price overall for bullocks was 112.4p/lb for U grade at Kepak (Athleague) and 113.3p/lb for U grade heifers at Kepak (Clonee).. Donegal Meats and Slaney Meats were also strong contenders on price for U grade bullocks. The average for O4L bullocks was 106.3p/lb."

But when intake reached a three year high for April, there was no easing in demand, nor in the improvement in prices - which supports expectations that the best is yet to come, and cattle farmers will enjoy the best spring and early summer prices for many years.
Factory quotes were improved by up to 3 cents/kg (1p/lb) when slaughtering resumed on Tuesday after the holiday week-end.
There was very little R grade beef being bought by processors in any part of the country for 302 cents/kg (108p/lb), with 302 to 305 cent (108 or 109p/lb) being generally paid, increasing to more than 305 cent (109p/lb) in the midlands, with a further 3 cent (1p/lb) being paid in the North West.
Prices for O grade stock are running from 294 to 300 cent (105 to 107p/lb).
On the supply side, processors are under pressure this week to maintain the intake levels of recent weeks, because of the shorter working week, and hardening price demands from farmers.
Over the past five weeks, factory intake continued to steadily increase, compared to the same period of last year.
Throughput at the factories reached 36,709 head in recent weeks, which was almost 8,000 head higher than the corresponding week in 2005, and the highest April weekly intake since 2003.
The supply of steers, at 19,420, was up almost 4,000 head on the corresponding week last year, while the supply of heifers was 2,500 head higher than 2005.
The cows trade also continues to strengthen.
The export market for cow beef is at its strongest for many years, leading to more factory activity in cow beef, and competition for supplies. The base price for cows has increased to a range of 260 to 263 cents/kg (93p or 94p/lb), and the quality heavy cows are commanding up to 274 cents/kg (98p/lb)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-30255061.html,2006-04-20 15:49:00,"Bush-Hu meeting focusing on trade, military, human rights","While US president George Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao hoped their discussions inside the White House would cool tensions over a yawning US-China trade gap, demonstrators massed outside today to protest Beijing’s human rights policies.
The talks between Bush and Hu, who was visiting Washington for the first time as China’s leader, were expected to produce little in the way of substance on the trade dispute and no breakthroughs on the major irritant: China’s tightly-controlled currency.
After two days spent wooing American business leaders in Washington state, Hu arrived last night in Washington for the half-day summit for what were expected to be frank discussions about the US' $202bn (€163.9bn) trade deficit with China, the biggest ever recorded with a single country.
That imbalance has spurred calls in Congress to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese products unless China halts trade practices that critics contend are unfair and have contributed to the loss of nearly three million US manufacturing jobs since 2001.
The visit attracted high-profile attention both inside and outside the White House gates. The spiritual movement Falun Gong, condemned by the Chinese government as an evil cult, gathered hundreds of demonstrators on street corners near the White House in the early morning.
Marchers banged gongs, chanted and waved American and Chinese flags. Banners denounced Hu as a “Chinese dictator” responsible for genocide and other “crimes in Chinese labour camps and prisons”.
The Chinese government had its say as well. In a median in front of the Chinese embassy, the Falun Gong protesters that are nearly always there had been replaced by Chinese supporters holding huge red-and-yellow banners offering to ”warmly welcome” Hu on his American visit.
There were some obvious signs that the summit was not considered on the US side as a “state visit”.
Though the Chinese flag flew over Blair House, the official guest quarters for visiting dignitaries across the street from the White House, lamp posts surrounding the compound were bare of the usual pairings of flags from the US and its guest country.
In addition to trade, Bush was to raise a number of other issues with Hu, including a bid for China’s help in dealing with current nuclear stand-offs with North Korea and Iran, complaints about China’s human rights record and questions over China’s growing military strength and whether it poses a threat to Taiwan.
The two sides have even disputed what to call the visit, with the Chinese insisting that it is a “state visit”, which was the designation former President Jiang Zemin received in 1997, or an “official visit”, the designation the Bush administration is using for Hu’s trip.
While Hu was not receiving a black-tie state dinner, he was being greeted by a 21-gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House and a formal lunch for China’s first family, with music supplied by a Nashville bluegrass band.
For his part, Hu has carried on a tradition started by Deng Xiaoping on his first visit to the US in 1979 of courting American business executives in recognition of the fact that the US is China’s biggest overseas market.
Hu had dinner at the home of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates on Tuesday and yeserday he received a warm welcome from employees at Boeing’s massive Everett facilities.
Last week, a contingent of more than 200 Chinese trade officials and business executives toured the US, signing sales contracts in American goods, including 80 Boeing jetliners, all in an effort to show that China is trying to bring down the massive trade gap between the two nations.
White House officials said in advance of today’s meetings that they did not expect any major announcements on currency or other trade issues, noting that China did make several commitments last week, such as requiring that all personal computers sold in China be loaded with legal software and agreeing to drop a ban on imports of US beef.
Some small progress may be made in the area of energy, where China’s rapidly growing economy has increased global demand for crude oil, pushing prices higher, and sent China rushing to lock up sources of supply in such areas as Sudan, Burma and Iran.
But without movement on the currency problem, congressional critics are likely to be unimpressed with the results of the meeting."

The purpose of the ban was to curb rising inflation in Argentina. Domestic beef prices have increased 165% over the past four years and the rise in cost of domestic meat supply has been held as one of the underlying causes of higher inflation.
A revision of the policy has now been agreed between the meat industry and the Ministry of Economics to permit an increase in the vole of beef exported. The meat industry has agreed to supply the domestic market with 180,000 tonnes per month at a fixed price, in return for which they are being allowed to increase exports. The agreement is expected to be fully in place by the end of this month, permitting exports of almost 90,000 tonnes of prime quality beef and forequarters.
The agreement to release the ban on exports of prime beef, within two months of imposing the six month ban, is a major U-turn by Argentinean authorities. While the agreed level of export is only a fraction of previous annual exports, any increase in low cost beef on the EU market will have some effect on the trade. It is also clear that the meat industry in Argentina is in the mood for dealing with the government on low-cost domestic supplies in return for clearance to increase exports.
Meanwhile, exports of beef by Uruguay are increasing steadily. Between January and March exports to EU markets increased by 36% on a low base to 13,300 tonnes."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10093185.html,2006-04-27 01:00:00,Missed deadline endangers WTO talks,"The setback lengthens the odds against a deal which would have cut by more than half the barriers which keep much cheaper farm produce out of the EU.
Such a deal would have opened the EU borders to unlimited beef imports at prices considerably below prevailing prices for Irish or EU product, according to Irish beef processors.
If negotiators miss a new end of July deadline it would become almost impossible for them to complete all the technical work required to draw up a world trade agreement, before US negotiating authority ends in mid-2007.
This authority, which forces Congress to accept or reject a trade bill without introducing amendments, is thought to be essential for trade talks success.
Now there are signs that the US is giving up hopes of a deal, having pulled Rob Portman out of the trade representative job after less than a year in the office.
The Bush administration had pushed hard for trade liberalisation, but American politicians are once again turning protectionist, and many observers believe that talk of removing agricultural protection would prove too unpopular ahead of mid-term elections in the US this year.
In the EU, Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has failed to win the backing of member states like France and Ireland, committed to protecting their farmers.
Mr Mandelson recently accused the US of demanding further cuts in agricultural subsidies and tariffs, which would make agricultural production impossible to sustain in the EU.
Led by India and Brazil, the G20 group has also held up talks, refusing to negotiate without deeper concessions on agriculture.
July 31 is also the target date to set out in detail how governments would implement a formal trade treaty.
World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy was understandably positive about delays: “We have missed a deadline, but we have no deadlock. I don’t think it’s good news for the round, but I don’t think we should cry over the missed deadline. What we need is more determination and a clearer sense of purpose”."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-10059028.html,2006-04-27 01:00:00,Argentina in no mood to lift ban on beef exports,"The world’s third biggest beef exporter cut off the trade nearly two months ago, with the government pledging to continue the ban for 180 days, in order to curtail rising meat prices paid by Argentine consumers. Some 600,000 tonnes of beef has been diverted from exports into the domestic market.
The decision has helped to boost cattle prices in the EU, which produces 400,000 tonnes per year less beef than its citizens consume.
Beef supplies to the EU from three foot-and-mouth states in Brazil (the world’s leading beef exporter) which have been affected by the disease, had already been cut off. This ban is set to continue as new cases of the disease have been found recently.
Last week, Argentina’s government extended its control over the country’s beef sector, with a price-reduction agreement now covering more cuts and livestock categories.
But some sources in Argentina said this will only worsen the country’s beef supply crisis, rather than succeed in driving down the price of Argentine beef.
The Argentine Rural Confederation said that the price controls will hit cattle-farmer confidence and limit the growth of beef production.
The government has said it would consider lifting a ban on beef exports only if beef prices fall."

The party Agriculture and Food spokesman Denis Naughten told their annual conference in Dublin the growth of energy crops was an untapped sector which offered Irish farmers huge potential returns.
“There has never been a better time for Irish farmers to become involved in the growth and processing of bio fuels.
“Crude oil prices have doubled oer the past year, with Ireland now facing fines of up to €400m under the Kyoto Protocol, while the security of our energy supplies are under threat,” he said.
Before the energy crop sector could get on its feet it was vital that supports and markets for energy crops was in place to kick start the industry, he stressed.
Fine Gael would establish the necessary conditions by ensuring the industry thrived.
The key proposal involved “creating a market for bio fuels by the removal of excise duty on bio fuel and legislating that all motor fuels must include a blend of fuel from renewable sources,” he said.
Mr Naughten added: “All petrol sold will include a 5% bio ethanol mix and all diesels would contain a 2% bio diesel mix.”
There would also be reform of existing Energy Crop Scheme and seed capital for producer groups that would consist of up to 50% of the cost of setting up a group – to a maximum of €300,000 per group.
He also flagged the establishment of an Office of the Agricultural Ombudsman which would take on the duties of the existing Appeals Office and expand them to include dealing with redress to the public for unfair treatment by the Department of Agriculture and its agencies.
Mr Naughten hit out at the government accusing them of having negotiated away the livelihoods of farmers without lifting a hand to address the structural problems within the current system.
“The fact is that during this Government’s watch agriculture and food production has declined and farm communities are collapsing,” he said.
The government was accused of being more interested in attracting foreign investment than supporting home-grown employers.
“Is it any wonder we have seven farmers a day exiting the land,” he asked.
Mr Naughten singled out labelling of food as another issue to be addressed.
“How can we continue to tolerate a situation whereby beef is imported from Brazil, lamb from New Zealand, chicken from Asia, vegetables from Israel and being passed off as Irish due to loopholes in our food labelling laws,” he said.
He also signalled plans for a single super food agency which would co-ordinate and oversee all aspects of the Irish food industry instead of the plethora of current government bodies and agencies.
The new agency would also develop a new single Irish food label – to be known as Green Ireland – which would be used to promote all home produced goods, he said,."

The cost of electricity is set to rise along with gas, but the warning from AIB economist John Beggs that inflation will also hit basic items hard is seen as a major worry for families.
The constant rise in the cost of fuel and housing is being blamed for having a knock-on effect.
But Phil Hogan, Fine Gael Carlow-Kilkenny TD, called on Enterprise Minister Micheál Martin to intervene.
“The prediction by AIB economist John Beggs that the price of essential items will increase by 10% towards the end of this year, and that general inflation will reach 5%, will send shivers down the spine of households across the country,” he said.
“With prices rising this fast we are facing into a winter of household discontent.”
Fine Gael accused the minister of having a laissez-faire attitude to consumer rights claiming he is yet to publish the heads of a bill to establish a tough National Consumer Agency.
“We need the immediate implementation of the National Consumer Agency Bill and a declaration by the minister that he will strengthen the original remit of the Agency in order to give essential support to consumers,” Mr Hogan said.
He vowed to support the Bill in order to give the watchdog the teeth it needs by allowing it to,
:: Conduct regular price surveys and name and shame those charging excessive prices.
:: Create a price league websites on all major products
:: Impose fines for non-display of price lists in petrol stations, pubs, hairdressers and restaurants up to a maximum of €3,000.
:: Appoint a representative of the Consumers’ Association to the Agency.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party urged Noel Dempsey, Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to sit down with the UK government over fears North Sea gas supplies are ever-decreasing while energy demands are soaring.
Despite two new pipelines being built the British authorities feel they have been cancelled out as resources are used up.
Tommy Broughan, Labour Party spokesman on energy, said gas prices would rise by 34% this winter but there was a risk they could go up again.
“We are almost entirely dependent on imported natural gas that is sourced from the UK, especially for the generation of electricity,” Mr Broughan said.
“These worrying price and supply developments in the British gas market have serious implications for Ireland’s energy sector and our economy in general."""

Comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher put investors at ease about upcoming economic and retail sales reports. He said the economy continues to grow strongly, and he did not indicate that inflation was presenting a problem.
Stocks have risen six out of the past seven weeks as oil prices continued to tumble, helping lift sectors that typically are large energy consumers. Lower energy prices are also viewed as a boost for consumers, especially heading into the holiday shopping period.
“There is a tremendous amount of momentum built into the market,” said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist for Weeden & Co. “We’ve had a good run, we’ve consolidated, and we need this acceleration going into the holidays.”
He pointed out that technology stocks continue to drive the market higher, with both Intel Corp. and Dell Inc. pushing the Nasdaq near to a six-year high. Merck & Co. helped lead the Dow Jones industrials after it said one of its painkillers did not result in increased risk of heart attacks.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.45, or 0.19%, to 12,131.88.
Broader stock indicators also gained. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was up 3.52, or 0.25%, at 1,384.42, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 16.66, or 0.70%, at 2,406.38.
Fisher’s speech in San Antonio had little impact on the bond market, which, like Wall Street, is still awaiting tomorrow’s release of the Labour Department’s Producer Price Index and the Commerce Department’s retail sales data; both reports will measure the economy during October. Bonds were weaker, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising to 4.61% from 4.59% late Friday.
Oil prices declined, with a barrel of light sweet crude down 1.01 dollar at 58.58 dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
“We got an awful lot of data, an extremely busy calendar,” said Stephen Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities. “The drop in oil has helped the market quite a bit, positive comments from the Dallas Fed, and an upgrade of the semiconductor group. There really hasn’t been anything on the bear side at all.”
The only negative piece of data released today came after the Treasury Department said the federal government started out its new budget year in October with a slightly higher deficit than last year. Revenues and spending both set records.
Intel led both the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrials, rising 42 cents, or 2%, to 21.00 dollars. The world’s largest maker of chips for computers benefited after Citigroup upgraded the entire semiconductor sector.
Dell, which reports earnings this week, rose 60 cents, or 2.4%, to 25.49 dollars after being upgraded by Deutsche Bank. The bank told clients it expects the company’s shares to hit 28 dollars within the next 12 months.
Tyson Foods Inc. spiked 58 cents, or 4%, to 14.93 dollars after saying it expects to return to profitability this fiscal year. The company had reported a fourth-quarter loss due to one-time charges and losses in the chicken and beef sectors.
Merck up 34 cents to 43.46 dollars after saying its new arthritis painkiller is safer than Vioxx. Rival Novartis AG shed 1.06 cents to 58.30 dollars after the Swiss company disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission delays with its Galvus drug.
A memo leaked to The Wall Street Journal stated that Toyota hopes to gain a 15% market share by targeting Russia, India, China and Brazil. However, the stock gave up 94 cents to 120.88 dollars. General Motors Corp. rose 42 cents to 35.09 dollars.
Gannett Co. picked up 62 cents to 59.78 dollars on reports the media company is interested in acquiring rival Tribune Co., whose shares rose 43 cents to 32.46 dollars.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 3.26, or 0.42%, to 772.41."

Laboratory tests confirmed four peacocks and at least two geese at the Islamabad zoo had contracted the disease, said Mohammed Afzal, a spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry.
Mr Afzal said the infected birds would be killed and buried. Tests on the zoo’s staff showed none were infected with the virus, he said.
Bird flu predominantly affects animals, but the H5N1 virus has also made the jump to humans, killing at least 167 people worldwide since 2003, according to the World Health Organisation.
Pakistan’s poultry industry was badly hit by the disease in 2006, when thousands of farmers across the country had to slaughter their flocks to try to prevent its spread. Prices of eggs and chicken fell as people switched to beef and mutton.
Three other cases of H5N1 were reported earlier this month – in domestic chickens in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, and in peacocks near the north-western city of Mansehra. However, there have been no reports of bird flu in commercial poultry so far this year.
Islamabad zoo director Raja Javed said H5N1 was detected after samples from 15 birds which had died were sent to the National Institute of Health for tests.
The small zoo, which houses more than 200 other birds as well as animals including elephants and monkeys, will be closed to the public for three days while workers vaccinate birds and spray the area with disinfectant, he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-30322276.html,2007-08-06 16:22:00,Export ban to cost UK £10m a week,"An export ban prompted by the foot and mouth outbreak will cost the British red meat industry around £10m (€14m) per week, it was estimated today.
That figure includes lost revenue from both live animal and red meat sales, according to the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC).
It also includes the knock-on losses to related businesses such as abattoirs, packers, processors and transport firms.
MLC head of communications, Guy Attenborough, said the EU market accounted for around 90% of British red meat and live animal exports.
“The export ban will mean a loss of £10m (€14m) per week to UK red meat businesses,” he said.
“Getting exports restarted following the all-clear will be a number one priority of the MLC.”
Long-term movement and export restrictions could cost the British red meat industry “tens of millions of pounds”, according to National Farmers’ Union director of communications Anthony Gibson.
“The longer this goes on and the more cases we get, the greater the costs are going to be,” Mr Gibson said.
“We know from long and bitter experience that a ban on exports leads to very low prices.
“Further price cuts could be the last straw for an awful lot of people.”
Mr Gibson said an export ban effectively made UK red meat producers into “captive sellers” to the domestic market.
He appealed to retailers and abattoirs not to take advantage of the foot and mouth outbreak as a means of pushing down the prices they pay to UK producers.
“We hope movements of animals will resume in the next two to three days. If we get it right we want to be able to minimise the damage.
“If things go wrong and we do get further outbreaks and people in the meat trade move to exploit the situation, we could be looking at costs running into tens of millions of pounds,” he said.
The National Beef Association (NBA) fears a long-term export ban could cause the domestic price of British meat to plummet.
Kim Haywood, director of the NBA, which represents around 3,000 producers, said: “What we are concerned about is a complete and utter price crash when farmers desperately need to get as much money from the market as possible.”"

He also said officials were reviewing price cuts blamed for making life even more difficult.
Mugabe said a government edict June 26 to slash the prices of all goods and services – which has left shelves bare of staple foods across the country – was intended to halt exploitation by businesses.
But last week the government raised the prices of some goods and doubled the price of beef to restore supplies. Retailers have complained they could not keep shelves stocked if they had to sell food for less than they paid for it.
“We are accused of bringing hunger to the people,” Mugabe said today during the annual holiday honouring fallen independence fighters.
“When we assert our sovereignty, they say we are out of touch with reality. The government is very clear about its programmes. We run things our own way.”
Mugabe said those who died fighting for independence from British colonial rule in 1980 had been unflinching in their belief in freedom from exploitation.
“We should pause and reflect on the supreme sacrifices made by our selfless fighters. We pray those acts and spirit of dedication be rekindled in us,” Mugabe said.
Zimbabwe’s official inflation is given as 4,500 percent, the highest in the world, although independent estimates put it closer to 9,000%.
Meat and many other goods are sold on the illegal black market at up to five times the government’s fixed price.
At least 7,000 executives, business managers, traders and bus drivers have been arrested in the price clampdown since June 26.
Corn meal, meat, bread, milk and other staples have disappeared from stores. Beer, cigarettes and newspapers were the latest items mostly unobtainable Monday.
Acute petrol shortages have crippled transport services and stranded tens of thousands of travellers hoping to visit rural families across Zimbabwe over the Heroes and Defence Forces holidays.
Tomorrow also celebrates the defence capability of the nation’s military, which is commanded by many former guerrillas.
Mugabe described the holidays as one of the most revered occasions in the life and evolution of the nation and that they symbolised “not just the freedom of the men and women of Zimbabwe but also of our animals, our birds, our fish and everything that belongs to us.”
“It is the wealth of Zimbabwe that we celebrate,” he said in an address broadcast by state television from Heroes Acre, a cemetery outside Harare for former guerrillas and politicians.
Chinese-built fighter jets screamed above a military parade and Mugabe led a wreath-laying ceremony. Supporters waved banners, one saying: “Economic saboteurs do not have a place in Zimbabwe.”
“Let us continue to defend Zimbabwe from internal and external forces seeking to reverse the gains we have so far registered. Let Zimbabwe be an impenetrable fortress inhabited by people determined to conquer current temporary challenges and look to the future with hope and optimism,” Mugabe said."

The party says the research found that goods which cost €18 in 2004 will not set shoppers back more than €31.
The price of beef, milk, eggs and vegetables were all monitored as part of the survey, which also shows that the gap between farmers' prices and those of supermarkets has widened by 85%."

A woman and a child – one of scores of lost children separated from family members – died in two separate surges against the gates on Saturday, police spokesman James Sabau told state radio today.
Attendances at this year’s show at the Harare Exhibition Park were the highest for several years, with many people hoping to find produce which has disappeared from normal stores in Zimbabwe’s acute economic crisis. It was also the biggest in years as exhibitors said they were lured to the show in hopes of being allowed to sell their animals.
A cattle auction was banned on Thursday at the showground by price control authorities after it became clear bidders from butcheries, hotels and groups of private buyers were willing to pay up to 10 times the government’s fixed price for on-the-hoof beef in the meat-starved nation.
A government order to slash prices of all goods and services by about half in a bid to tame the world’s highest inflation in June has left shelves bare of meat, corn meal, bread, milk, eggs and other staples.
Officials at the six-day event said about 100,000 people entered the gates on Friday. No tally was immediately available for Saturday.
Crowds jostled at the exit gates at the closing on Saturday, hurrying to get into lines for public transport outside, witnesses said. Acute petrol shortages have crippled transportation services.
Commuters routinely wait more than three hours to board buses for a 30-minute trip to Harare’s satellite townships.
Official inflation is given as 7,634%, though independent estimates put real inflation closer to 25,000%. The International Monetary Fund has forecast it could reach 100,000% by the end of the year.
Earlier this month, two people died in a stampede in a sugar queue in the second city of Bulawayo. One woman also went into labour in a food line, assisted only by a passer-by after other shoppers intent on keeping their place in the line ignored her cries for help.
In southern Zimbabwe, another woman died of strangulation when her neck scarf caught in a petrol-fuelled generator during the nation’s daily power cuts.
Attorneys this week reported clients facing acute food shortages in prisons. Relatives asked to bring food often could not find enough in the shops or get rides to prisons.
A panel of lawmakers has reported acute shortages of basic foods in government youth training centres favoured for the training of ruling-party militants blamed for much of country’s political violence and intimidation.
The state Sunday Mail newspaper, meanwhile, reported 36,000 tons of wheat destined for Zimbabwe was being held at the Mozambique port of Beira awaiting payment.
With shortages of bread and bakery products worsening, Didymus Mutasa, the powerful security and lands minister, said the nation’s wheat was down to a week’s supply.
“We do not have wheat stocks at the moment. We are feeding from hand to mouth. As soon as we pay, a little amount is brought in ... this is usually a week’s supply,” he was quoted as saying by the paper."

Up to a third of the workforce are to be axed under the proposals, which may also see corporate sponsorship for bands.
The firm’s private equity owner, Terra Firma, said as many as 2,000 jobs would go in the next six months to help save €265m a year and enable the label to meet the “challenges” of the digital age.
Other planned changes include beefing up and changing the roles of EMI’s talent spotting network, nearly halving the marketing spend, and the elimination of “significant” duplications within the group.
The turnaround is aimed at the recorded music arm of EMI – whose artists include Coldplay, Robbie Williams and Lily Allen – and which has struggled with falling CD sales across the industry due to digital downloading and piracy.
The company made pre-tax losses of £263.6 million last year. Terra Firma, led by financier Guy Hands, took over the business last summer in a £3.2 billion deal.
Mr Hands has outlined how he wants to see EMI’s talent spotters – currently around 6% of the recorded music arm’s 4,400 staff – concentrate on scouting and maximising artist potential.
A new unit called music services is being set up to maximise the artists’ potential and co-ordinate how their music is sold and retailed.
Initiatives include helping performers and bands to “monetise their work” through sponsorship deals with firms, similar to those in the football industry, and linking up local bands with local businesses.
Mr Hands said he believed the “revolutionary new structure” for the EMI group would improve every area of the business, but there were warnings that the plans risk offending the “artistic sensibilities” of big-selling acts such as Coldplay.
Robbie Williams’ manager has already accused Mr Hands of acting like a “plantation manager”, while it was reported last week that the pop star himself has threatened to withhold new records until he gets assurances over marketing and distribution.
But in an interview, Mr Hands denied that Williams had refused to work on a new album and effectively gone on strike.
He said only Williams’ manager, whose percentage cut of the artist’s advances could be threatened by the changes, had suggested the singer would withhold his work.
“Robbie is still working in the studio, but he’s working at a slower pace, which is appropriate to producing the best music he can, and that’s something we at EMI support him in,” Mr Hands said.
Hermann Verseraaten, who works in artwork production for EMI, said: “Obviously, it’s sad news, but we hope the new plans will work and we will come out stronger.
“Everybody is very worried about job losses, but we don’t really know the details yet. We are just waiting to find out.”
John Webster, from the Music Managers Forum, branded aspects of Mr Hands’ strategy for EMI as “naive”.
On the prospect of corporate tie-ups for artists, he said: “People have tried this for years but it’s always foundered on artistic sensibilities.
“It’s not impossible – the Rolling Stones have always had their price for example.
“But people have to consider that some bands aren’t interested and fans could potentially be turned off something like that.
“At the end of the day, this business is all about relationships and the main relationship is between the band and its fans.”
Coldplay, who are one of EMI’s biggest recent success stories with more than 30 million album sales, have been an active supporter of various social and political causes including Oxfam’s Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International.
Lead singer Chris Martin famously branded shareholders the “great evil of this modern world” as their third album was released in 2005.
The band’s manager Dave Holmes told the Financial Times he was keeping an open mind before hearing the full plans about EMI’s restructuring.
But he added that he would “definitely not” advise one of the new artists he represents to sign to the label because it was going through “too much change”.
EMI’s total worldwide headcount is around 5,500. Mr Hands has set up a board at EMI that includes former BAA chief Mike Clasper, former BBC director general Lord Birt and former Northern Foods chief executive Pat O’Driscoll.
Ms O’Driscoll, who has been brought in by Mr Hands to identify what talent the new slimmed down EMI needs, told the Financial Times she wanted to see the changes in place by the end of June."

The draft, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, said the fundamentals of the world economy were solid, but uncertainty had increased because of a deterioration of the US economy, financial market turmoil, high oil and commodity prices and heightened inflation expectations.
But Chancellor Alistair Darling has played down the chances of other countries taking similar action to the Bank of England, which cut interest rates by a quarter point on Thursday, insisting circumstances in each were not the same.
The final version of the document will appear after a G7 meeting later today. Finance ministers and central bank governors had so far left blank the paragraph on exchange rates.
“Going forward, we will continue to watch developments closely and take appropriate actions, individually and collectively, in order to secure stability and growth in our economies,” the draft said.
The G7 had faced calls for increased co-ordinated action to deal with the financial market turmoil, although the various countries differed on what measures were appropriate. The US has urged other countries to pursue policies to boost domestic demand, while the Europeans said their economies were resilient and focused more on regulatory co-ordination.
French finance minister Christine Lagarde said earlier that the statement would call for beefing up stabilisation efforts in the wake of the US credit crisis, which surfaced last year, rocking global markets and fuelling fears of a worldwide slowdown.
“There is a great convergence of views on proposals aimed at improving transparency, governance and supervision,” she said.
Ms Lagarde and senior ministers from Japan and Britain, however, have already thrown cold water on hopes that this weekend’s meeting will produce any sweeping policy agreements – such as a unified move to cut interest rates – to remedy market instability.
After talking with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ahead of the G7 meeting, Ms Lagarde said Mr Paulson made clear the US had not called for others’ stimulus packages, despite comments out of Washington favouring boosting demand.
The remarks were similar to sentiments expressed earlier by other participants, who played down expectations for anything more than a message of unity among the seven industrialised nations in G7 – the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
After lunch, the officials will meet more formally at a Tokyo conference hall. Finance chiefs from China, Russia, South Korea and Indonesia are expected to join the G7 officials at a dinner later to expand the discussions.
""Going forward, we will continue to watch developments closely and will continue to take appropriate actions, individually and collectively, in order to secure stability and growth in our economies,'' the statement said.

The various countries, however, have differed on what measures would be appropriate. The US has urged other countries to pursue policies to boost domestic demand, while the Europeans said their economies were resilient and focused more on regulatory co-ordination.
The draft statement took note of the downturn in the global economy, but it did not forecast a recession.
“The world confronts a more challenging and uncertain environment than when we met last October, though its fundamentals as a whole remain solid,” the statement said.
Senior ministers had already thrown cold water on hopes that this weekend’s meeting will produce any sweeping policy agreements – such as a unified move to cut interest rates – to remedy market instability.
They had played down expectations for anything more than a message of unity among the seven industrialised nations comprising the G7 – the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
After a lunch meeting, the officials met more formally in the afternoon at a Tokyo conference hall. Finance chiefs from China, Russia, South Korea and Indonesia were expected to join the G7 officials at a dinner later to expand the discussions.
Japan was expected to bring up the idea of a multilateral fund to help poor nations curb global warming. Tokyo has said it will push such climate change efforts at a July meeting in Hokkaido of the G8 – the G7 plus Russia.
World financial markets have been battered since the start of the year amid worries about a possible US recession and uncertainty about the full extent of the subprime mortgage crisis that has led to billions of pounds of losses at major banks.
US efforts to tackle the credit crunch are expected to be a key discussion topic.
At the gathering, the senior officials will hear a preliminary report from a panel of experts led by Mario Draghi, the head of Italy’s central bank, who were asked by the G7 last fall to study the market turbulence and make recommendations on what should be done."

""We have seen other food commodities rising in the last few months but beef has been edging up very slowly, and is still a long way off any kind of profit margin,"" said Scully.
""Farmers are getting hammered by the rising costs of feed, fuel and fertiliser. Grain has increased by €80 a tonne, fuel, as everyone knows, has rocketed over the last year, and fertiliser has gone through the roof, jumping by up to €100 or 33% a tonne.
""We need €1 more, and the retailers will have to stop squeezing farmers out of their margins, or Irish beef will be as rare as hen’s teeth.
""Today Os, Rs and Us (Bullocks) can fetch €3.19/kg, €3.30/kg and €3.36/kg, which is well below the €4/kg needed to stay afloat."""

The world’s largest independent games group has gone public with an all-cash bid of $26 (€17) a share, after the New York-based company’s board privately rejected two offers.
The proposal is a 50% premium to Take-Two’s closing share price on Friday but Take-Two has rejected the approach, saying it lacked value for shareholders.
EA chief executive John Riccitiello said Take-Two’s quick acceptance of the offer would mean EA could put its marketing muscle behind the release of Grand Theft Auto IV, set for April 29.
Take-Two called the EA offer a “highly opportunistic” attempt to take advantage of the game’s upcoming release.
“Electronic Arts’ proposal provides insufficient value to our shareholders and comes at absolutely the wrong time,” Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick said.
Mr Zelnick said EA rejected Take-Two’s offer to resume discussions of the takeover bid the day after “Grand Theft Auto IV” was released.
The interest emerged as Take-Two attempts to recover after a rocky period.
Shareholders threw out most of the company’s top leadership last spring over poor results as well as accounting troubles and controversy surrounding violent and sexual content in the company’s games.
Last year, the British Board of Film Classification refused to certify violent game Manhunt 2 – the first UK ban for a video game in a decade.
EA, which publishes the FIFA Soccer series among its sports franchises, has been working recently to beef up its product line-up with a wider variety of titles.
The EA’s proposed buyout of Take-Two comes amid consolidation in the sector, which is expected to increase competition in the games market.
French media and telecom giant Vivendi plans to combine EA’s chief rival, Activision, with its own games unit to form Activision Blizzard. The merged company will own the popular online game World of Warcraft and the Guitar Hero franchise."

The Ulster Farmers’ Union said the situation had been highlighted by the results of the latest Agriculture Survey published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
The study showed the number of cattle in the North at the end of last year was down 9% and pigs down 8% compared with a year before.
UFU president Kenneth Sharkey said the survey was an interesting indicator of trends in the farming industry.
“It is clear from this survey that during 2007 many suckler cow and pig producers have downsized their herds or ceased production.
“This has been our warning to processors and retailers for a long time. If producers aren’t paid sustainable prices they will not stay in the industry and consumers will be deprived of high-quality local produce,” he said.
Mr Sharkey said 19% fewer prime cattle had been slaughtered in the North in January this year compared with January 2007.
“Many pig producers are also seriously considering de-stocking because of unsustainable prices.
“The retail sector must respond to this and look seriously at how to secure sustainable supplies of local produce which their customers are demanding.”
Meanwhile, local food and drink suppliers to Curley’s supermarkets were told today that big new markets could open up to them following the takeover of the two outlets by Sainsbury’s.
James Laws, Northern Ireland commercial operations manager at Sainsbury, said local suppliers who had worked with Curley’s would have every opportunity to supply them following the takeover.
He said: “Sainsbury’s is committed to supporting local suppliers and where appropriate we will visit Curley’s suppliers in the coming weeks and months to talk to them about opportunities which exist within not just these two stores in particular, but throughout the wider Sainsbury network.
“Sainsbury’s already sources over £300m (€398m) of goods locally and some of our suppliers have gone on to sell their products in Sainsbury’s stores right across the UK.”"

Fáilte Ireland also wants to send out a strong message that swapping overseas travel for an Irish break could help bolster the battered economy.
The campaign will include a revamped website flagging special offers, new -ook guide book and holiday planners as well as a multi-media advertising blitz.
John Concannon, director of Fáilte Ireland, said research showed a significant drop of almost 40% in the number of Irish people planning a short break abroad this year.
“This is very good news for the tourism industry and offers the prospect of good business in the face of weaker demand internationally,” he said.
“However, Irish consumers will be looking for value and quality more than ever before and this will be the core of our home holiday campaign as we present Ireland to its own people as a convenient, good value alternative to an international holiday.”
Adverts on television, radio, newspapers and internet over the coming weeks will focus on the value and convenience of holidaying at home.
Fáilte Ireland research showed that seven out of ten people will compare costs and prices before making a final decision about the destination of their holiday.
Some 34% said the hassle of international travel would be a key reason for staying at home this year.
“It’s all about value and convenience,” said Mr Concannon.
Fáilte Ireland said it would overhaul its website www.discoverireland.ie to make it more user-friendly and up-to-date while a beefed up special offers section is to be added.
“Interestingly, the internet has now overtaken word of mouth from friends and family as the primary source of information, illustrating the huge importance of the web to Ireland’s tourism industry” said Mr Concannon."

A new state-of-the-art €2m Drive-Thru restaurant was opened at Gort Road in Ennis by Munster, Irish and Lions rugby star David Wallace.
It is part of a €12m investment the company is making in Irish outlets during 2009.
John Atherton, managing director of McDonald’s Ireland said: “The investment and the creation of 50 new jobs is a lift for Ennis, which has always been a vibrant and lively town but one that has been hit by the current economic downturn.
“We believe that Ennis is a great location in which to invest and we look forward to providing great food and great service at a great price to our local customers and indeed working with local businesses to increase footfall amongst shoppers over the coming months.”
He said the company was committed to supporting the local community through the contribution it made to the agricultural community in the mid-west.
“We are one of the largest purchasers of beef from Irish farmers, some €86m last year, with many farms in the region supplying us with top quality Irish beef for both the Irish and European markets.
“This economic contribution is helping to sustain and support the local economy and this cannot be underestimated during these tough economic times,” added Mr Atherton."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30412831.html,2009-05-29 15:44:00,Price makes first public appearance since split,"Katie Price made her first public appearance since splitting from Peter Andre today.
The former glamour model was not exactly dressed in mourning for her relationship, strutting on the catwalk at the Clothes Show London in a neon pink cropped tee-shirt and hotpants.
The outfit was part of her new range of equestrian clothing, KP Equestrian, though how advisable it is to ride a horse in hotpants is debatable.
As well as her return to the public eye after the end of her three-and-a-half year marriage to Andre, today’s show also marked Price’s debut on the catwalk.
The 2,500-strong audience at London’s Excel Centre, made up almost exclusively of teenage girls and their mothers, gave the 31-year-old an ear-splitting welcome as she took to the runway flanked by half a dozen beefy male models.
Price, also known as Jordan, beamed as flashbulbs fired and fans cheered - perhaps relieved not to be given a frosty reception after her split from 36-year-old Andre.
The couple announced they were parting ways earlier this month, and last night Andre was greeted by hundreds of screaming women as he introduced a sexy new male dance show at London’s O2.
Price cancelled a planned appearance on Jonathan Ross’s chat show earlier this week, saying she did not feel ready to talk about recent events, and so her appearance today caused a media frenzy.
Organisers struggled to pack dozens of photographers into their pen without blocking the audience’s view.
Price took to the stage twice more, once in white bikini for a mock seaside beauty pageant – which she “won” – and once in a silver jumpsuit and gigantic white permed wig.
The excitement was lost on one of the show’s presenters, George Lamb.
Speaking backstage before the show, he said: “I probably shouldn’t say this, but I couldn’t really give two f***s about Jordan, to be honest with you.
“I think it’s really sad that young people look up to people like Jordan with so much respect and admiration.”
Surprisingly for the host of Big Brother’s Little Brother, Lamb said he felt there was too much celebration of celebrity for its own sake.
“Look at all the incredible nurses who look after people day in, day out. Look at all the healthcare workers,” he said.
“I think we should celebrate people like that rather than celebrating some dolly bird who makes far too much money.”
Co-presenter and model Erin O’Connor was rather more charitable, saying Price was a “heroine”.
It is not known who chose the music for today’s show, but there was at least one break-up song among the tunes, U2’s With Or Without You, and given her choice of outfit, one might think Price was taking heart from the lyrics of another: “Enjoy yourself, while you’re still in the pink.
“The years go by as quickly as a wink. Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it’s later than you think.”"

The retail giant today extended its border price cuts campaign to Dublin with plans to roll it out nationwide by August to stem the flow of cross-border shopping.
Yet while claiming massive cuts, bosses said they were forced to increase prices on 200 grocery products around a month ago blaming higher charges from suppliers.
A spokesman for the supermarket said 300 more items had fallen in price on top of the 12,500 announced last month.
“It would more than balance out in terms of reductions,” he said.
“There will always be a possibility or risk of increases if supplier prices increase.”
The supermarket giant introduced its Change for Good price cuts in 31 stores along the border early last month, claiming shoppers can save around €50 per week.
With around €100m being spent in northern shops every year by Dublin consumers, Tesco extended its price cut campaign to nine stores in north Dublin.
These include Balbriggan, Blanchardstown, Artane, Clarehall, Clearwater, Prussia Street, Santry, Jervis St, and Parnell St, with the rest of Tesco’s 29 Dublin stores to follow in a fortnight.
Tony Keohane, CEO Tesco Ireland, said: “We are delighted to extend our border prices to customers in Dublin and we look forward to rolling it out to all other counties in the coming weeks.
“It is proving good for customers, good for jobs and good for the Exchequer.”
Company chiefs claim the border campaign has worked well estimating that €50m less will be spent in the North by shoppers from the Republic this year, rising to €200m when all shops have cut their prices.
The supermarket refuted suggestions the price war being waged by the supermarket will hurt Irish producers.
Mr Keohane said: “Tesco remains as committed as ever to Irish products as you will see in our stores, all of which will be highlighted to guide shoppers to them.
“We are committed to selling Irish products that customers want and a key part of the success of this programme so far has been the performance of many Irish products. Depending on the season, 40% to 50% of sales are of Irish products.”
The company said almost €2bn worth of Irish food and drink products are bought by Tesco every year, with all its fresh beef and lamb coming from Irish farms."

Around 500 farmers are blockading the entrance of the Musgrave distribution centre in Kildare.
They say they are being forced to sell produce below cost because supermarkets are driving the prices down.
Farmers are refusing to let any trucks in or out of the distribution centre in Kilcock but they have agreed to let some workers out.
They plan to continue the blockade until midnight tonight.
Addressing the crowd, IFA president Padraig Walshe warned the supermarkets not to underestimate farmers.
Musgrave expressed its surprise at the protest.
""Musgrave is surprised by today’s protest outside its depot in Kilcock,"" said a statement.
""Musgrave representatives recently met with the Padraig Walshe, president of the IFA and his colleague Pat Smith, the general secretary and CEO. These discussions are ongoing, with Musgrave as ever, operating an open door policy with farming representatives.
""Musgrave would like to point out it is the biggest supporters of Irish agriculture, Irish jobs and Irish suppliers. Across our range, 75% of everything sourced by Musgrave on behalf of its SuperValu and Centra brands is either produced or sourced in Ireland – significantly more than any other player in the Irish market.
""These purchases are worth in excess of €2.85bn every year to the Irish economy and indirectly support 14,000 Irish jobs. In addition, our business is based on supporting independent retailers who operate in local communities across Ireland, who employ a further 28,000 people.
""Additionally, Musgrave and its Retail Partners in SuperValu and Centra uniquely stock 100% Irish beef, pork, bacon, lamb and chicken, which is born, bred and reared in Ireland, while 65% of all of our fruit and veg is also Irish."""

Starting today, an additional 1,000 everyday products and brands across all ranges are reduced significantly in all 29 independently owned SuperValu stores in Cork, according to the company.
This was being delivered without sacrificing its commitment to Irish suppliers and Irish jobs, the company have stated.
The value of the price reductions and offers would top €230m in 2009, with over 3,000 permanent price cuts in-store so far this year, according to Donal Horgan, managing director, SuperValu. For consumers this would mean a saving of almost €70 on their average shop since the beginning of the year.
Six weeks ago SuperValu announced a significant number of price cuts and offers. The company has now extended this further, across another 1,000 everyday products and brands.
“SuperValu listened to what consumers wanted,” said Mr Horgan. “Given our market share performance, which is growing ahead of our competitors, we know we are getting it right.
“The price cuts are being delivered without compromising our support for Irish suppliers, brands and jobs, as has been our commitment all along,” Mr Horgan said.
No one could match SuperValu’s credentials when it came to supporting Irish, he claimed, and added they would be continuing with this policy.
Currently 75% of everything on SuperValu shelves was sourced or produced in this country, it is claimed.
These purchases were worth in excess of €2.85bn every year to the economy and indirectly supported 14,000 Irish jobs.
All SuperValu branded beef, lamb, chicken, pork and bacon was 100% Irish, while 65% of all fruit and veg was also Irish adding up to €1.2bn worth of fresh produce every year.

Former footballer and Hollywood hardman Vinnie Jones lashed out at Dane Bowers and Nicola Tappenden, insisting that because they had gone against his wishes and allowed the rapper to help herself to the food supplies they would be in charge of meals until Sunday.
In a heated discussion in the living room, he told them: ""You two and Sov do the dinners, that's fair. You think there's enough so you do it.""
Earlier Jones had turned on Alex Reid, telling him his hoped-for acting career was doomed in Hollywood because of his current reputation.
Jones, star of 'Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels', tried to persuade the cage fighter, who is dating glamour model Katie Price, to admit he is not really a cross-dresser.

Bookmaker William Hill said it had Ivanova as odds-on favourite to leave at 4/9, with Fleiss on 9/4 and Lady Sovereign on 7/1.
Former footballer turned Hollywood hardman Vinnie Jones is currently the front runner to win the celebrity reality contest with odds of 11/10.
Housemates nominated for the first time on Sunday and the female trio received the most votes from their fellow celebrities.

Jones told Reid, who has previously appeared in Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks: “No one’s going to want to work with you right now – if you offered me five million dollars to be in a movie with you, I wouldn’t take it.”
Jones told Reid that, as far as the acting world is concerned, he has been “sent to Coventry” because of what was currently written about him in the tabloid press.
He said: “People will cross the street to get away from you.”
Reid was discussing his future career and cross-dressing antics with Jones, Bowers – who has also dated Price – Thong Song singer Sisqo, actor Stephen Baldwin and Fleiss.
Jones demanded: “But why don’t you keep quiet about it then? Don’t think you can take the mickey out the media. They will chew you up. You’re no more a cross-dresser than the rest of us.”
Quizzed by the other celebrities on the positives of his current image, Reid said: “The good stuff is I have got a lovely partner (in Price). That’s the good thing about it. I’ve got a TV show coming out.”
But Fleiss told him: “Your TV might flop, millions of people are watching you now, on this show.”
Baldwin advised: “You can control your destiny by being consistent. Say ’I am this’ and then be it. Right now you’re a frickin’ tossed salad. You’re a little bit of everything.”
Reid told Jones while in the bedroom that he wanted children because he saw it as his “next big adventure”.
Housemates then gathered in the lounge to watch as Jones was questioned by Big Brother in a Mastermind-style quiz to win prizes for the others. His specialist subject was the Big Brother Welcome Pack."

Mr Gilmartin said: ""This initiative by the Commission is at odds with the severe restrictions imposed on Brazilian beef as a result of the much lower standards applied in that country. It is also outrageous that these talks should be instigated without first having a considered discussion with all 27 member states via a farm council meeting.
""The Commission is shooting itself in the foot to be giving away huge concessions given that a WTO agreement was not possible in 2008. Despite this, efforts continue to reignite WTO discussions.
""It would seem prudent that the EU should be making no concessions at this point. The history of the EU approach on agricultural trade policy has demonstrated that concessions given in advance of WTO negotiations generally never get any recognition at these talks.
""When one looks at the beef price paid to farmers in the past 12 months in the absence of such a deal, it beggars belief that the EU thinks its own farmers could sustain any further damage to price. Instead of moves to support Brazilian agriculture, the EU urgently needs to look at what can be done to encourage increased EU beef production.
""EU policies are clearly failing when we see that it’s no longer self sufficient in key commodities like beef and lamb.""
He concluded: ""I would encourage the Minister to use every available means to block this pre-emptive strike against the Irish beef sector at a time when we need to do everything in our power to maintain our indigenous industries as part of a plan for economic recovery."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30467040.html,2010-07-27 18:52:00,BP chief 'demonised and vilified' over spill,"Outgoing BP chief executive Tony Hayward today said he had been “demonised and vilified” over the Gulf of Mexico disaster.
He spoke as his successor pledged to put the oil giant “on the road to recovery” as it reeled under a $32.2bn (€24.7bn) blow from the spill.
The financial hit sent BP crashing $17bn dollars (€13bn) into the red for the April-June period following the Deepwater Horizon tragedy – its first loss in 18 years.
Mr Hayward, who will make way in October for US citizen and fellow board member Bob Dudley, told reporters he had no major regrets about his leadership of the group since 2007 and that his decision to leave was a purely practical one.
He said: “This is a very sad day for me personally. Whether it is fair or unfair is not the point. I became the public face (of the disaster) and was demonised and vilified. BP cannot move on in the US with me as its leader ... Life isn’t fair.”
He added: “Sometimes you step off the pavement and get hit by a bus.”
Mr Dudley, who becomes BP’s first overseas chief executive, said he did not underestimate the task ahead but added that BP was “financially robust” and boasted “enviable” assets and staff.
“I believe this combination – allied to clear, strategic direction – will put BP on the road to recovery,” he said.
The huge charge includes the direct costs of tackling the spill, clean-up costs for the catastrophe and a $20bn (€15bn) compensation fund agreed in June.
But the longer-term fall-out such as fines, penalties and potential legal action will inevitably add to the bill and spread the pain over a number of years.
BP also hopes to sell around 10% of its production assets over the next 18 months, with the aim of raising $30bn (€23bn) to beef up its balance sheet to meet the crisis.
Meanwhile Mr Hayward, who has drawn fire for a series of PR blunders since the crisis began, leaves with a pay-off of one year’s salary – £1.045m (€1.25m) – and an £11m (€13m) pension pot.
He will remain on the BP board until the end of November and has been put forward as a non-executive director of the firm’s TNK-BP Russian joint venture.
BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said the firm was “deeply saddened” to lose him but said the explosion – which left 11 workers dead – had been a “watershed incident”.
“It will be a different company going forward, requiring fresh leadership supported by robust governance and a very engaged board,” Mr Svanberg said.
Mr Hayward joined the company in 1982 and has been chief executive since 2007. Before the spill he had been credited for reviving the fortunes of the oil giant but said he would always feel a “deep responsibility” for the tragedy.
He said: “The Gulf of Mexico explosion was a terrible tragedy for which – as the man in charge of BP when it happened – I will always feel a deep responsibility, regardless of where blame is ultimately found to lie.”
He added: “BP will be a changed company as a result and it is right that it should embark on its next phase under new leadership.”
He said the company had reached a “significant milestone” after the capping of the spewing well, while the sales will leave BP with a “smaller but higher quality” exploration and production business.
Shares in the firm fell 3% today to 406p. Investors are awaiting the completion of relief wells below the sea bed which should finally cut off the flow of oil early next month.
BP is a staple holding for UK pension funds though shareholders have already felt the pain after the firm scrapped dividends for the first time since the Second World War. They have to wait until 2011 to find out when payments will resume.
Stripping out the impact of the Gulf, BP said its underlying performance was “very encouraging”, with a 72% hike in profits of $5bn (€3.85bn) – meaning the company was in “robust shape” to meet its obligations.
The firm’s refining and marketing operations posted their best performance since 2006, when refining margins were double their current levels. The US operations also returned to profit for the first time in more than a year.
Higher prices for oil and gas also helped its exploration and production business grow profits despite a 4% fall in production on last year due to disruption caused by the oil spill."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30481663.html,2010-11-13 13:18:00,Cost of British beef set to soar,"The price of British beef is set to soar under new proposals outlined by the Food Standards Agency, it was suggested today.
The watchdog plans to pass the full cost of meat inspections – currently around £69m per year and shared between abattoirs and the tax payer – on to producers.
But the move was slammed by the National Beef Association (NBA) who claim it could devastate small businesses and lead to burgeoning meat prices.
It is likely to have ramifications for all livestock farmers.
“You could see a dramatic increase in the price of beef on the shelf as the cost would have to be recovered in retail sales of meat,” NBA director, Kim Haywood said.
“At the moment, inspection costs for cattle range between £7 and £25 a head, depending on which part of the country you are in and whether it is a small abattoir or a big abattoir. Effectively that could now double.”
The FSA’s three-month consultation would see producers gradually shoulder an additional annual cost of up to £31.8m.
It has proposed a reduction in costs for smaller businesses.
The increase is expected to be felt most keenly by beef producers who are still subject to the additional requirements of BSE inspections set up in the 1990s.
Ms Haywood hit out at the FSA’s “overbearing attitude” accusing the watchdog of being a “fat cat concerned only with its own preservation”.
“They are dumping the whole cost on the meat industry which we just can’t afford and small abattoirs will go in their droves,” she added.
“Like other meat and livestock orientated organisations, the NBA finds this insulting.”
A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the move was designed to reduce the burden of costly inspections on the tax payer.
“The fact remains that it is unsustainable for the tax payer to pay £32m annually for meat inspection and reform of the charging system is overdue,” a spokesman said.
“Our proposals published this week are part of an ongoing process to engage the industry on reforming meat hygiene charging.”
A decision on the consultation is expected to be announced in February."

Police blocked roads and set up random checkpoints in Riyadh, searching residents and vehicles around a central mosque as large numbers of people gathered for Friday prayers.
Witnesses said groups of policemen manned street corners and intersections and a helicopter flew over the city.
By midday, no protesters had showed up in the capital and the police presence significantly decreased.
In the eastern city of Qatif and nearby areas where the country's minority Shiites live, several hundred people staged protests, shouting slogans calling for reforms and equality between Shiites and Sunnis.
In Qatif, the protesters were surrounded by armoured personnel carriers and dozens of riot police in full gear.
On Thursday, violence broke out at another protest in Qatif, when Saudi police opened fire to disperse demonstrators. At least three protesters and one police officer were wounded. Today's protest was largely peaceful.
Activists have been emboldened by other uprisings in the region that have toppled long-time rulers of Tunisia and Egypt. The Saudi activists have set up online groups calling for protests in Riyadh.
Security officials on Friday said security measures around state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco and its oil facilities in the east were beefed up protectively, in case of any violence. The company is based in Dhahran district on the kingdom's eastern coast.
Investors are sensitive to any sign of upheaval in Saudi Arabia because the OPEC leader has been using its spare capacity to make up for oil output lost amid the violent uprising against Libya's government.
When news broke that Saudi Arabian police fired shots to break up the protest on Thursday, prices soared by three dollars in just 12 minutes.
The country's Shiites, who make up 10 % of the kingdom's 23 million citizens, have long complained of discrimination.
The pro-Western monarchy is concerned protests could open footholds for Shiite powerhouse Iran and has accused foreigners of stoking the protests, which are officially forbidden."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-20438833.html,2017-01-12 00:00:00,Food and drink exports over €11bn for first time,"The €11.15bn in exports last year represented a 2% rise on 2015, and marked the seventh successive year of growth of Irish food and drink exports.
Exports have grown by €3.3bn (41%) since 2010. The strongest sectors in 2016 were prepared foods (€1.92bn, +9%), beverages (€1.4bn, +4%) and dairy product and ingredients (€3.38b, +2%).
Agriculture Minister, Michael Creed, said: “One notable feature of this achievement is the impact of market diversification in the year in which the UK chose to leave the EU.
""While trade with UK fell by 8%, this was offset by exports to international and emerging markets.”
Bord Bia estimates that sterling’s decline has negatively affected the competitiveness of Irish exports, reducing the value of trade by up to €570m.
However, exports to north America rose €200m to reach €1.1bn last year, China rose 35% to €845m, and the rest of Asia rose 6% to €330m.
Recovery was also seen in continental EU markets (up 3% to €3.53bn) as good economic conditions led to demand in key categories. The euro strengthened by 13% against sterling in 2016, while there was little change in exchange rates with the US dollar.
Bord Bia predicts that export markets will remain challenging in 2017, but highlights also the pickup in global dairy demand and further opportunities for growth in beverages.
In 2016, beverage exports rose 4% to €1.4bn. Whiskey exports jumped by 8% to €505m in 2016 and are predicted to double by 2020.
The strongest performers in 2016 were prepared foods, sheepmeat, beverages, pigmeat and to a lesser extent dairy.
Weaker prices drove down the value of beef and edible horticulture exports, while lower volumes affected seafood exports.
Livestock exports declined in value terms largely due to a significant reduction in live cattle shipments. Poultry exports also declined.
Michael Carey, Bord Bia’s chairman, said: “Despite difficult trading conditions, it is encouraging to see this industry continuing to grow business and extend its global footprint to more than 180 markets around the world.
""Increased export volumes were recorded across a number of key categories, with milk availability over 5% higher during the first 10 months of the year and beef export volumes up 5%.
“The combined impact of higher output in these sectors is estimated to be in the region of €250m,” he said."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30795594.html,2017-06-29 01:00:00,Fanciful talk of good times in beef farming is a load of old bull,"If there is one thing that drives me absolutely bananas, it’s talk about good prospects in the beef business.
Having read some reports recently that suggested it could well be a bright year ahead, I damn nearly lost my cool.
The only people who believe prospects are good in beef farming are those who do very little of it, those who spend their days looking at charts as opposed to cattle.
It can be easy to be flippant about the future of beef, when your wage comes from spouting hot air rather than looking after a bullock or heifer on the farm.
In the real world, on the ground, on the farm where expenses are high, few are looking to the brighter days ahead, most find the present troubling enough.
Mart prices have risen in the past few weeks, this is true, and perhaps they are on a par with last year.
But last year was diabolical.
The Friesian store needs to be making €2/kg, otherwise you are only wasting your time.
And the Angus and Hereford bullock needs to be making €2/kg plus €100 on top for the seller to see any profit from a year and a half of rearing stock.
Such prices are rarely being hit this year.
We have to go back to 2015 to see such times.
Of course, the buyer might argue that factory returns do not justify paying such sums for store stock.
Well that’s a problem for another page. We deal with the marts here.
And the truth at the moment is that the farmer selling stock is not making enough to justify the work he or she puts in. That’s a fact.
So let’s have less of this bluster about good outlooks and prospects ahead in beef, let’s look at the way things stand right now.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30795602.html,2017-06-29 01:00:00,Pressure on beef finishers to hold line at €4/kg,"Erosion of beef prices at factories continued this week, with the weekly returns to beef finishers estimated to be down as much as €1m compared to the prices which were being paid at the beginning of June.
Processors have cut prices and rely on the flow of cattle to their plants being sufficiently strong to overcome any resistance from finishers, and to meet their market requirements.
The base price on offer for steers has eased to 400 cents/kg at a number of plants this week, but with a few still willing to offer a base of 405 cents/kg.
Most beef finishers are trying to hold out for 405 cents/kg, but it is getting harder to achieve, and reports of up to 410 cents/kg being paid are few and far between.
There is no doubting that the challenge for finishers going forward will be to hold the base at 400 cents/kg for as long as possible into the autumn.
The base for heifers is running at 10 cents/kg over steer prices, with quoted prices at 410-415 cents/kg.
As usual, it is a shade easier with heifers, compared to steers, to get into the higher end of the price range.
Cow prices have also slipped back, for lower grading cows in particular, over the past couple of weeks.
O/P-grade cows are now on a base of 300-330 cents/kg, with the better quality making up to 335 cents/kg.
There is still good demand for the quality R-grade cow at 350-355 cents/kg.
The total cattle intake at the factories last week was around 34,000 head, slightly lower than the previous week, resulting from a drop in the supply of cows.
In Britain, beef the trade remained strong through last week, as recent fine weather boosted the trade for barbecue products such as steak and burgers, and supplies of finished cattle remained tight.
This market situation lifted prices, and R4L-grade steers averaged equivalent to 446 cent/kg (at 88p sterling for the euro, and if VAT is included).
The weaker sterling since the UK general election continues to make Irish product more expensive in the UK.
In France, the beef market is reported to have remained slow, due to lower demand in recent heatwave conditions.
Beef retail promotions are ongoing, but are mostly for French produced beef only.
In Italy, the market remains slower, also due to consumption easing during the recent hot weather (soaring temperatures and lack of rainfall across Italy have cost the country’s farmers €1 billion so far this year, according to their Coldiretti national agricultural association).
The beef market in Germany is described as being relatively in balance."

Had Macroom Castle not been foolishly torn down a decade earlier, it would surely have fallen on June 26, 1977.
It was said the racket made by Rory could be heard in the village of Bealnamorrive some six miles away. Unfortunately for me, I was neither in Macroom nor Bealnamorrive on that momentous evening. Aged six, I was most likely in bed. But the point today is that a ticket for Rory’s concert back then in 1977 cost £2.50. Put it another away, 40 years ago, a handy store bullock sold at Macroom mart (at 1970s prices) would have enabled you to purchase about 100 Rory Gallagher concert tickets. Not only would you have had enough to bring the entire family along, but almost everyone at the mart.
Next Saturday morning, tickets go on sale for an Ed Sheeran concert planned for Páirc Uí Chaoimh in May of 2018. With a price tag of €91 a ticket. When I got word that some in this house were anxious to attend, I damn nearly had heart failure.
In today’s farming environment, the sale of a handy store bullock will get you about five tickets to see Ed Sheeran and his red hair.
When you realise what needs to be sold in order to secure a few concert tickets, you quickly realise that all is not well in the world of Irish beef farming. There won’t be too many beef men in the mosh pit rocking to Galway Girl at Páirc Uí Chaoimh next summer, and that’s for sure. Larry Goodman could well find himself on his own, if he decides to go.
So much for the blues from all the reminiscing of the good old days when a bullock could buy you something, I will strike on with this week’s mart report.
Kilmallock mart on Monday had a reduced sale of cattle.
The mart had 800 cattle and calves on offer.
“The excellent grass growth in recent weeks has buyers very keen to buy stock,” said Denis Kirby of GVM.
“Strong prices continued here on Monday with bullocks selling up to €2.91 per kg.”
In Kilmallock on Monday, dry cows (74 on offer) sold for up to €1.82 per kg. Heifers made up to €2.48 per kg. Weanlings hit €2.80 per kg.
Dairy stock made up to €1,320 (for a 2½-year-old in calf to a Hereford). In the sucklers ring, a 10-year-old Hereford and her Charolais heifer calf made €1,400.
Calves in Kilmallock (272 on offer) made up to €780 for runners, and up to €450 for younger calves.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30796523.html,2017-07-06 01:00:00,Summer beef price battle lines set at €4 per kg,"Both sides in the beef trade are playing hard ball, with supply and demand varying across the country, helping to determine what price farmers and processors settle on.
There was very little change in the overall supply to factories last week, with the intakes of both steers and heifers remaining strong, at around 12,500 steers and some 9,000 heifers in the overall supply of almost 33,700 head, marginally lower than the previous week.
Some of the fall-off in the number of cows sent to beef factories, which is back 2,500-3,000 head per week from their earlier peak, is being compensated for by the supply of steers and heifers, both of which have built up as finishers move stock off grass quickly, to get in ahead of any further price cuts.
Actual prices being returned to finishers for steers, within the base grades, have fallen by about 8 cents/kg on average over the past forthnight, confirming that the processors have effected most of their quoted cuts in prices.
At this stage, the battle for the finishers is to hold the base as much as possible above 400 cents/kg for as long as possible, resisting processors’ efforts to pull prices back.
That is where the trade is hoovering this week, with several processors trying their hand at quoting a base price for steers of 400 cents/kg, while others are finding that they have to give 405 cents/kg to get in the cattle.
There are reports of up to 410 cents/kg being paid, but it is hard to get, and not generally available.
Heifer prices are running at a base of 410 cents/kg at most of the factories, with a good sprinkling of them making up to 415 cents/kg, but it is very hard for finishers to get above that.
Cow prices are stable, with O/P-grade cows being quoted at 310-340 cents/kg, and up to 355 cents/kg going for the better quality R-grade cows.
In Britain, the beef trade continued strong last week on the back of good demand. while supplies of finished cattle were reported to be tight, which helped to hold the prices.
R4L-grade steers were averaging equivalent to 452 cent/kg (if VAT is included, and at 88p sterling for €1).
In France, the beef market was reported to be similar to previous weeks with hot weather continuing to negatively affect the trade.
The market in Italy is described as slow, with consumption down, in particular for hindquarter cuts,
According to Bord Bia, for the first five months of 2017 chilled beef exports from Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay combined increased 3% compared to the same period in 2016, with reduced trading by Brazil and Paraguay offset by double digit growth in exports from Uruguay and Argentina."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30796493.html,2017-07-06 01:00:00,Pressure on beef exporters,"Brexit-related currency trends have left Irish beef exporters to the UK 9% worse-off this year, in euro terms, despite sending 5% extra beef across the Irish Sea.
“This would suggest that processor margins have been under pressure, given the price inflation that has been seen in the Irish cattle market,” according to a report on how the first four months of 2017 went for the Irish beef industry, which supplies two thirds of the UK import trade, sending nearly half of Ireland’s beef to the UK.
According to UK trade data, Ireland exported 61,000 tonnes of fresh and frozen beef to the UK in the first four months, a 5% year-on-year increase.
Analysis by the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) confirms that the UK’s beef imports from Ireland rose by over 6%, to £223m. But in euro terms, the value fell 9%, because the euro was worth only 73 to 77p early in 2016, compared to 84 to 88p in the first four months of this year.
This unfavourable currency fluctuation for Irish exporters followed the Brexit vote in June 2016, when a majority of UK voters chose for the UK to leave the EU.
AHDB’s analysis also shows beef cattle prices have been rising faster in Ireland than in the UK or Europe, with Irish cow prices climbing to a relatively high level in EU terms, putting further pressure on processors’ profits.
Along with the currency shock, the Irish beef industry had to cope with big changes in the number of finished cattle supplies.
At the beginning of the year, Bord Bia had forecast an increase in finished cattle supplies of 100-110,000 head, or 6% compared with 2016.
What actually transpired was a 4% increase year-on-year, to 590,000 head. There was particularly strong growth in throughputs of cows at export abattoirs. But carcase weights of both prime cattle and cows in Ireland were so far behind the 2016 levels that Irish beef tonnage for the first four months rose by less than 1%.
“Trade has been relatively undaunted by either the narrowing price differential between Ireland and the UK, or the slower than expected growth in production,” according to the AHDB.
“Irish exporters have weathered narrower price differentials with the UK in the past, as recently as mid-2016, without reducing volumes. As long as the UK market requires these imports to balance its supply and demand, increasing prices on the other side of the Irish Sea could continue to add impetus to already strong cattle UK prices and give UK beef a competitive advantage.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30796519.html,2017-07-06 01:00:00,Phosphate reduction plan has split Dutch dairy farmers apart,"“Dutch farmers, who are growth-oriented, are now facing the same issues as with the milk quota, but in addition, they are all dealing with a low milk price as well, because the phosphate amounts are managed nationally, while milk volumes are controlled at EU level.
“It is a disaster.”
So says the former president of the NMV Dutch dairy farmer’s association, Hans Geurts, just months into the country’s plan to reduce cow numbers in order to reduce phosphate pollution.
But it’s not all bad.
“The fact that some limits have been put on us in the Netherlands is actually good for dairy farmers all over Europe,” said Geurts, in an interview by Christine Weißenberg, published in Germany’s Unabhängige Bauernstimme independent farmers’ monthly newspaper in May.
Dutch dairy farmers are four months into implementing an urgent plan to save their permission from the EU to carry on intensive grassland farming which produces up to 250kg of nitrogen per hectare per annum from livestock manure, compared to the EU’s standard 170 kg per hectare.
The nitrogen derogation is needed to accommodate intensive production from the country’s big national dairy herd (the EU’s sixth largest).
It facilitated dairy herd expansion in 2015 and 2016, but the EU called a halt when the agreed ceiling for phosphate emissions to soils was exceeded.
This ceiling will probably be exceeded again in 2017, and in February, the European Commission approved a Dutch plan of phosphate reduction measures.
It involves removal of dairy cattle, but the Dutch dairy industry was happy to agree, to comply with the European environmental requirements, and to develop a more sustainable dairy farming sector.
Agreeing was necessary if they are to continue intensive dairy farming.
The plan provides for an annual reduction of 8.2m kilograms of phosphate by the dairy farming sector.
This should be sufficient to drop below the EU-permitted phosphate ceiling in 2017.
The plan includes cessation of farming and phosphate reduction schemes which will together reduce phosphates by 6.5m kg.
Retiring dairy farmers are being well compensated, receiving €1,200 from the government for each animal removed from the national herd, and a further €1,200 a cow for the phosphate rights that will be freed up.
The phosphate reduction scheme incentivises dairy farmers to reduce their herd to 96% of the cows and heifers they had in July 2015, when phosphate reduction plans were first proposed.
The sooner the reductions are achieved, the higher the bonus, but farmers who fail to make sufficient adjustments will pay a levy.
There will also be phosphate reductions in the feed and pig and poultry industries, but they will represent only a fraction of the dairy reductions.
The forced phosphate cullings were evident in cow slaughterings in January and February increasing 36% compared to 2016.
The first tranche of the reduction scheme was oversubscribed, resulting in a cull of more than 30,000 cows (the target is 60,000).
According to Hans Geurts, farmers will be allocated phosphate quotas in 2018, which can be traded, and will become expensive.
“Building additional stalls for significant increases in growth will become close to impossible.
“That is absolutely uneconomical, because of the additional costs incurred due to the necessary effluent- disposal certification and the phosphate quota.”
Geurts says the phosphate herd cull overshadows all other topics in Dutch farming, and has led to major disagreements between dairy farmers, some of whom faced into this year short of money after the low milk prices of 2016, and were probably hoping to recover financially by increasing milk production at this year’s improved prices.
His words were prophetic, because legal cases brought by unhappy farmers have now threatened the country’s efforts to keep hold of the EU nitrates derogation it needs for intensive dairy farming.
A court has ruled in favour of 51 farmers who challenged the government over the plan to reduce phosphate production.
This group of dairy, organic dairy and beef farmers argued that the plan would force them to sell cows, and was disproportionately unfair for them.
They had entered into irreversible financing obligations for land and buildings before July, 2015, and said they may not be able to comply with their financing obligations due to the phosphate scheme.
The court granted them dispensation from the phosphate scheme, ruling that they were unfairly affected, they could not have predicted the scheme when they expanded their businesses before July 2015, and that organic producers were not the root cause of the phosphate pollution problem on Dutch farms.
More farmers are believed to be lining up to launch similar cases.
For every farmer who wins such a case, and is exempted from the reduction plan, continuing dairy farmers will have to cut phosphate production even further, if the country is to squeeze back under its EU-stipulated ceiling for phosphate emissions to soils.
A poll of 788 Dutch dairy farmers, conducted by the Boederij magazine, has indicated that 48% were in favour, and 52% against the litigation by farmers to escape the phosphate reduction plan.
In any case, the Dutch ministry of economy has urgently appealed the court rulings, apparently basing their appeal case mostly on a belief that all Dutch dairy farmers knew that measures would be taken, if the European phosphate ceiling was exceeded in the Netherlands.
Agriculture Minister Martijn van Dam urged farmers to stick to the phosphate plan, saying it was well under way, and a large part of the goal to bring phosphate production back under the European ceiling in 2017 has already been achieved.
He urged dairy farmers to “go full speed ahead.”
The chairman of the largest dairy co-op and milk processor in the Netherlands, Friesland Campina, has urged co-op members not to go legal in a bid to escape the phosphate reduction plan.
“Continue to support the charted course and continue to act in the collective interest,” said Frans Keurentjes, who said the focus must be kept on saving the country’s 250kg nitrates derogation now and in the future."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30797583.html,2017-07-13 01:00:00,No price changes in beef cattle market ‘stand-off’,"Martin Ryan
Processors continue to carefully balance beef cattle prices against their need to keep an adequate supply of cattle flowing through their factory gates .
Meanwhile, beef finishers also try to hold a firm line on selling prices.
In this &lsquo;stand-off&rsquo;, it seems more and more obvious that 30,000 head per week is no longer the point where processors have a licence to cut the beef price.
With export demand for beef remaining strong, thanks to successful efforts to develop markets overseas for Irish beef, it now appears that processors require at least 32,000 head per week to meet market requirements, before they can exert pressure on cattle prices.
The overall outcome of the &lsquo;stand-off&rsquo; this week is very little change in the market place for beef.
While some processors continue to try their hand at quoting back to 400 cents/kg as a base for steers, in reality they are finding it difficult to get hold of sufficient stock at prices under 405 cents/kg, which appears to be the base price generally.
The heifer trade is at a premium of 10 cents/kg over the steer prices, running off a general base of 415 cents/kg, while some processors quote at a base of 410 cents/kg.
There is a view in the trade this week that the ceiling on price is a bit tighter at the top for heifers, with finishers finding that harder bargaining in hope of getting over 415 cents/kg is not being very effective.
The cow trade also stays more or less where it has been over the past couple of weeks, at a base of 310-340 cents/kg for O/P grade cows, and up to 350-355 cents/kg for the better quality R-grade cows.
In Britain, the beef trade remained firm over the past week, with a good level of
demand, and relatively tight supplies of finished cattle.
This kept prices for R4L-grade steers equivalent to 455 cent/kg (if VAT is included, at 87.7p sterling for &euro;1).
In France and Italy, the beef markets were unchanged last week.
Globally, beef exports from Uruguay are at an 11-year high, with China the main market destination, followed by the US and Israel.
In Australia, beef exports for the 2016-2017 fiscal year have dropped below one million tonnes for the first time since 2011-2012, due to herd liquidations. Australian beef exports are down 17% year-on-year, and 19% compared to the five-year average.
The principal markets for Australian beef include Japan, the US, Korea and China."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30797543.html,2017-07-13 01:00:00,Brazil’s tainted meat rejected,"Another contaminated shipment of Brazilian poultrymeat destined for Ireland has been detected by EU authorities.
The frozen salted chicken breasts from Brazil, via the Netherlands, were found to have &ldquo;serious&rdquo; salmonella bacterial contamination, according to the EU&rsquo;s rapid-alert system.
The shipment was detained, and the incident was one of 13 EU rapid alerts last week involving serious bacterial contamination in or border rejection of Brazilian produce, all poultrymeat except for one shipment of black pepper.
Since EU surveillance increased in March of meat shipments from Brazil, two earlier consignments had been rejected at Dublin Port.
Brazil is the largest exporter of beef and poultry combined, but the announcement in March by Brazilian police of an investigation into corruption among food safety officials prompted several countries to ban imports of Brazilian meat. In late June, the US Department of Agriculture banned imports of fresh beef from Brazil.
In the Philippines, after 162t of beef and 336t of chicken from Brazil tested positive for salmonella, a blanket ban on imports from Brazil is being considered.
The EU&rsquo;s imports of beef from Brazil were 140,566 tonnes in 2016 (only 1.8% of the beef consumed in the EU). Only 22t (worth &euro;98,000) came to Ireland.
And it is hundreds of shipments of poultrymeat from Brazil, rather than beef, that has been rejected at EU borders due to contamination.
The US ban on imports of Brazilian beef, over what the US Department of Agriculture called a &ldquo;system-wide food safety problem&rdquo;, has further dented international confidence in Brazil&rsquo;s beef industry. The recent opening of the Chinese market for US beef may also reduce Brazil&rsquo;s market share in China.
These setbacks have knocked beef cattle prices in the state of Sao Paulo back to levels not seen since since August, 2014. In June, prices fell 17.9%, the sharpest price drop since 1997. Brazilian cattle prices have also been hit by scandals at JBS, the country&rsquo;s top meat processor, forced to shut downs some of its plants, and delay cattle payments to farmers."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30797580.html,2017-07-13 01:00:00,"Trade picks up, but we are still in a different league to Cristiano Ronaldo","Denis Lehane
You&rsquo;d have to wonder, after seeing pictures of Cristiano Ronaldo&rsquo;s high life earlier in the week.
Did we choose the wrong career path entirely when deciding to make a living off the grass.
I mean, while farmers like you and I risk life and limb struggling to eke out an income from the grass, here was your man, who makes his money simply by running up and down a field after a rubber ball, and he enjoying the height of luxury, wealth and pampering.
Lying out there on a lavish yacht, moored in some exotic spot, weighed down with a bevy of beautiful women. If he were an old tomcat, he would surely have been purring.
There are precious few in the beef farming game who are indulged in such a fashion.
If only it were balls and not bullocks we were steered towards, it all could have been so differently.
Anyway, to dwell on what might have been could drive a fellow bananas. And besides, it isn&rsquo;t all bad news on the land this week.
The rain has arrived.
While Ronaldo might have the women, the wealth and the Riviera, we get the rain.
And a more welcome visitor to our shores would be hard to find. We needed rain to push the grass, and now the grass has pushed up cattle prices.
We might still taste success in 2017 like Ronaldo.
There could be some extra time added. We may be pushing well into the second half of the year, but the game is far from over.
&ldquo;Three weeks ago, you would have clearly seen the effect the tightness of grass was having on the cattle trade,&rdquo; said manager Tom McCarthy at Bandon mart last Monday. &ldquo;But because of the growth now, due to better conditions, the picture has changed dramatically.
Demand has returned.&rdquo;
That demand was certainly in evidence in Bandon on Monday, particularly for the heavier Friesian store bullock of 500kg and upwards.

Ireland held its market share despite processors here having to buy cattle cattle at increased deadweight prices, compared to 12 months previously.
The UK imported a total of 21,200 tonnes of fresh and frozen beef in the month of May, broadly similar to the import levels of 12 months previously. Neither the narrowed gap between UK and Irish prime cattle prices, nor Ireland’s lower than previously expected level of beef production, have affected exports to the UK, which are running at 5% higher for the year to date than in 2016, according to the AHDB.
The strong Irish beef export performance has contributed to a 25% increase in the food and live animals export category measured by the Central Statistics Office. This is part of an overall 10% increase in the value of Irish goods exports in May this year, compared to May, 2016."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30798744.html,2017-07-21 01:00:00,Beef trade better balanced than usual for late July,"With the intake of cattle holding steady in the 32,000-33,000 head range, there is little scope for processors to squeeze prices tighter, having cut them as much as 10 cents/kg over the past month.
The intake tightened slightly last week, putting a shade more pressure on processors.
Rarely has the trade been so balanced in the second half of July between processors’ cattle needs and what price finishers will accept.
Excellent farming conditions in 2017 are also a factor in this market situation, with beef animals thriving even where the supply of grass has begun to tighten.
And so it is that the quoted prices for this week are unchanged for steers, at a base of 400-415 cents/kg.
Some processors have tried their hand at offering a base of 400 cents/kg for steers, but this week most of them appear to be willing to pay up to 405 cents/kg to get stock.
Heifer prices have strengthened slightly, with processors finding that few are available for less than a base price of 415 cents/kg this week.
However, in the cow trade, prices have weakened a shade this week, particularly at the lower end.
The general run for O/P-grade cows is 300-340 cents/kg, with up to 355-360 cents/kg going for the better quality R-grade cows.
The cattle intake at beef factories for last week was just over 32,000 head, when Kepak (Clare) is included, although the official kill will show around 31,500 head, because the former Kelly plant in Co Clare, which has been acquired by Kepak , and is now under the Kepak umbrella, has not yet been fully integrated into the Department of Agriculture cattle market reports system.
In Britain, the beef trade remained firm last week with good demand and relatively tight supplies of finished cattle.
Prices increased again, with R4L-grade steers averaging equivalent to 453 cent/kg (if VAY is included, and with the Euro at 88.56p sterling.
In France, the beef market remained sluggish last week, negatively affected by the weather conditions.
Beef promotions at retail level were for domestically produced items.
In Italy, the market remains steady, with demand best for forequarters.Despite this trend at the factories, there was a firm trade maintained at the mart sales on Monday were up to €81 over was paid by butchers for lambs."

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30799521.html,2017-07-27 01:00:00,All seem to have accepted the huge value of including adequate clover in pasture swards,"The biggest news in grassland reseeding is everyone in Teagasc, and most progressive farmers, at last seem to have accepted that including adequate clover in swards has huge financial advantages, writes Joe Sheehy.
Recent trials at Teagasc Moorepark and Teagasc Clonakilty Agricultural College showed that clover swards have the potential to increase profitability per cow by up to €200.
Clover swards provide up to 100 units of nitrogen per acre free from the air, and cows on these swards produce an extra 50kg of milk solids per lactation.
The clover swards also produce an extra 1.5t of dry matter per hectare in intensive grass-based dairy production systems.
There has been a traditional bias against clover in Ireland, but the latest trials proved that any perceived problems with clover can be overcome with suitable management.
Reducing nitrogen application by 100 units per acre from May onwards did not affect herbage yield of the clover swards (150 units versus 250 units).
This allows is a significant saving in fertiliser costs.
Reseeding
On average, less than 3% of potentially good grassland is reseeded annually.
It should be 10%, to bring our national grass production up to what is required for reaching the 2020 targets for dairy and beef production.
Most farmers now realise the value of reseeding, but the amount of ground reseeded any year varies as much as 50%, largely depending on the weather and the economic situation on farms. Widespread Teagasc surveys indicate that many Irish pastures are producing 50% less than their potential.
Teagasc Moorepark research indicates there is huge variation in grass dry matter production on farms.
There is up to 50% difference between farms, and 60% within farms, and the key factor is the level of perennial ryegrass within pastures.
Of course, poor soil fertility, soil type, and poor management will also significantly reduce grass production and utilisation. Over 90% of soil samples are deficient in either P, K or lime.
With pressure on farmers to increase production and efficiency, and the high price of fertilisers, and other rising costs, reseeding pastures that have a low level of perennial ryegrass has become more important than ever. Farmers cannot afford to be applying fertiliser on poor pastures that give a poor response.
New late diploid grass will be top recommended in 2018
Teagasc Oakpark researchers have has bred an excellent late diploid grass. Its expected PPI of about 135 should top the recommended list in 2019.
The Pasture Profit Index (PPI) is similar to the EBI in animal breeding.
There is a difference in PPI of over €100/ha/year between the best and the worst varieties.
Using the PPI and the Department of Agriculture’s recommended lists enable merchants and farmers to choose the best varieties for different situations.
Varieties are divided into early, intermediate and late, on the basis of heading dates.
It is easier to maintain high digestibility with late varieties throughout the grazing season. In recent years, most farmers have used all late varieties in intensive grazing areas. However, where early silage may be required, it is probably best to use one early growing medium variety and two late ones.
Newer late varieties have very good spring growth, and are only classed as late because of their heading dates.
Seed mixtures
Co-ops and reputable seed merchants have good seed mixes, formulated by seed experts and Teagasc, to suit different farms, with only the top varieties included. Most merchants have at least four different mixes.
Teagasc research indicates that grazing and one-cut silage swards should include at least 1.5-2kg of clover seed per acre. Late autumn is not suitable for sowing clover rich pastures as clover seedlings are vulnerable to early frosts.
However, clover seed should be included in all August-sown reseeds.
The full list of recommended varieties is available in Teagasc offices.
The many advantages of reseeding
The advantages of reseeding poor quality pastures are as follows.
- Potential 35% increase in yields of grass and silage (depending on how bad the old pasture is, and how well the reseeding is carried out).
- Better response to fertilizers (25% better response to nitrogen fertiliser).
- 20% higher digestibility
- Better seasonal growth
- Better quality silage, by ten units of DMD (digestibility), easier to preserve.
- Big savings in concentrate feed requirements: worth 60 cent per animal per day.
- Better animal performance: adding 4.5 litres per cow per day to milk yields, adding 0.2% to the milk protein percentage; and increasing live weight gains."

In a world jammed full of nonsense and balderdash, sensible questions are in short supply. And it’s not just in RTÉ where sensible questions should be asked; in farming too, we could well do with asking some sensible and direct questions. One question that comes straight to mind is, where’s the money?
Where’s the money for the beef farmer? Where is the money for the hard worker who produces first rate, world beating, top class beef?
That stuff that brings the fancy restaurants of Europe to life. I’m don’t see a healthy return for my efforts, and I doubt if you do either.
We are the toast of the nation and yet we receive crumbs for our trouble. The only thing that is wrong with Irish beef today, is the manner in which the farmer is treated. The beef is doing fine, we are the ones getting the roasting.
It’s time we all started to ask the sensible question.
More importantly, it’s time we got some direct answers.
We will start this week’s look at the marts in Macroom, where I was on Saturday.
One thing that always strikes me about this mart is the distance that farmers travel with stock. I saw cattle on Saturday from 40 miles away. And the reason the sellers come is not for sightseeing purposes, but for price. The mart has a good reputation when it comes to selling cattle, and on Saturday it certainly lived up to its name. Some stock that caught my eye in the bullock ring were five good square Friesian stores born in the spring of 2016. These stores weighed 494kg and made €905. Another lot of five from the same farm in Dripsey weighed 473kg and sold for €840. Good cattle, good money. In Macroom mart on Saturday, dry cows sold from €105 to €790 over the kilo. Hereford and Aberdeen bullocks sold from €265 to €645 over their weight.
Heifers sold from €260 to €860 over their weight. Continental bullocks sold from €310 to €715 over the kilo. Weanling bulls in Macroom sold from €275 to €635 over their weight, with weanling heifers selling from €280 to €505 with the kilo.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30799605.html,2017-07-27 01:00:00,Market signals say no autumn cattle supply glut,"Market signals remain positive for beef finishers, with prices at the factories stable, as autumn trading gets nearer, writes Martin Ryan.
Expecting beef prices at the factories to harden by very much at this time of the year would be out of character with the usual seasonal pattern.
But 2017 could be the season to buck the traditional trends.
Predicting the beef trade is among the most hazardous of challenges, because there are so many unpredictable factors, from weather to markets, cattle supply, and currency movements, that it’s akin to selecting the winning numbers of the Lotto.
Nevertheless there are some signals which hold hope for optimistic cattle finishers.
It seems that the current strong markets for beef will see the year out, and factories have weekly demand for at least 32,000 head and maybe a little more.
Fear of a cattle supply glut this autumn is receding.
That said, the processors are very price-conscious, and anxious to pull back a bit from the current price level.
But it will be challenging for processors to cut prices if the current market trends continue, which are keeping supply and demand in balance.
Quoted base prices for both steers and heifers are unchanged this week.
The steers are at 400-405 cents/kg, and there are indications that a bit more of the supply is making the higher end of the price range.
Heifers are steady at a premium of 10 cents/kg over steer prices, in a 410-415 cents/kg range.
There are isolated reports of some finishers getting a few cents more, particularly for better quality heifers, but it is not very freely available, with the processors very wary of conceding anything that would be perceived as a rise in prices.
Nor is there any change in prices on offer for cows, although there are reports of more interest from processors in cows.
Quotes for O/P-grade cows are ranging from 300 to 340 cents/kg, and up to 360 cents/kg is on offer for R-grade.
The supply to factories remains tight, at just under 31,900 last week, slightly increased from the previous week.
In Britain, the beef trade remained steady over the past week, with good demand and relatively tight supplies of finished cattle,
Prices increased again, with R4L-grade steers averaging equivalent to 455 cent/kg (with the euro at 89p, and VAT included).
In France, the market is reported to have weakened, with beef cattle prices easing.
Trading remains best for domestically produced cattle.
In contrast, the market in Italy has been showing some improvement on the back of higher consumption due to the start of the busy tourist season, with demand increasing for hindquarter cuts.
Lamb prices trail 2016 levels after latest cuts
- Martin Ryan
It has been another difficult week for sheep farmers after prices were hit again, with a cut of as much as 30 cents/kg leaving prices behind where they were a year ago.
Most of the processors have reduced their quoted prices for this week to a base of 500 cents/kg, ranging as high as 515 cents/kg, plus the usual bonus payments for quality of up to 10 cents/kg.
Processors point to the weakness of the market in France, where consumption has dropped, putting pressure on the trade, and to the supply of lambs increasing.
In the marts, there was also a quieter tone to the trade on Monday, with prices easing as much as €8/head, after numbers increased, and demand did not match that of recent weeks.
There were 620 head on offer Monday at Corrin Mart, where the trade was back from last week. The butchers’ lambs sold for up to €73 over, and ranged back to €55 over. The prices for factory lambs peaked at €64 over and ranged back to €40 over.
There was an entry of 750 head on Monday at Kilkenny Mart, where the prices were back by €3-€8/head. Butchers’ lambs sold for up to €66 over and the factory lots peaked at €60 over.
In Britain, there was little change in the trade last week. Lambs were making the equivalent of around 516 cents/kg. Supplies for the year to date remain strong, up 7% compared to the same period in 2016.
Between January and May 2017, the UK’s imports were back 14% compared to the corresponding period last year, due to the weaker sterling and lower supplies from New Zealand.
Pig price trend positive for farms
- Stephen Cadogan
Pig farmers have welcomed a positive week of demand from all processors forcing the trade to continue a slow upward price trend.
According to IFA, no official price rises were reported, but prices reported by the Department of Agriculture showed an increase of 4c/kg in July. Farmers say prices range from €1.72 to €1.76/kg for the majority of pigs this week, and strong demand from processors for the last few loads of pigs to fill their weekly demand resulted in stronger spot prices, of up to €1.80.
IFA welcomed the EU-Japan trade agreement which will see reduced tariffs from 2018 onwards on all EU pigmeat going into Japan.
According to analysts at Rabobank, EU pigmeat exports are slowing due to strong prices, with tight supply and firm demand maintaining upward price pressure and starting to challenge exporters.
The Rabobank experts predict a 2% pork production in 2017 in China, the main pigmeat import market.
The longer term OECD-FAO forecasts have global pig meat production increasing 10% between 2016 and 2026, including 12% in China."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30799497.html,2017-07-27 01:00:00,Don’t miss opportunity to buy grain off the combine,"The 2017 harvest has got off to a good start, with ideal harvesting conditions, writes Brian Reidy.
Moistures and bushels seem to be of a high standard, meaning excellent quality feeding for the winter.
And straw has been baled in excellent condition.
It has however been a very mixed few weeks around the country with regard to grass growth, with some areas experiencing a mini-drought, and even though we got some rain over the last week, more is still needed to push on grass growth.
Second silage cuts have not yet been made on most beef farms, due to delayed first cuts.
We are now heading into August, so it will soon be time to start planning for the banking up of grass for the autumn.
It is important if you have a shortage of grass until after the second cut that you slow down the rotation and supplement with either silage or concentrates.
If you don’t identify this shortage early enough, it will mean having to supplement grass for a much longer period.
It is important that you keep applying nitrogen after grazings, to keep growth going.
Buying cereals off the combine
There are various cereal options for beef farmers to feed over the winter.
This year is no different.
The price for cereals off the combine remains excellent value for the end user, meaning that it makes great sense to try and source and store some for the coming feeding season.
With the current beef price prospects, it is essential that production costs are controlled, without compromising on animal performance.
In plain English, you should buy top quality native cereals at good value, rather than purchase less feed and make do with lesser animal performance.
As with all recent years, we still see a scenario where native cereals are at a low price, and the feed industry continues to import grain and inferior by-products for inclusion in ruminant feeds.
The powers-that-be must do much more to encourage farm-to-farm trading of cereals, and maximum inclusion of native Irish cereals in compound feeds.
Best value this autumn
Cereals off the combine again represent fantastic value per unit of energy versus what will be available in the form of most blended feeds this winter.
Cereals will always be higher in energy during the winter than compound blends constructed on a least cost basis.
Buying wheat, barley or oats off the combine, and storing it with any of the available treatment methods, will result in a high-energy, top-quality feed being available to feed at approximately €190 per tonne.
This will help to hugely reduce total concentrate costs, by €50 to €80 per tonne, once the feed has been balanced for your stock.
If you have any notion of buying and storing grain, you should purchase it sooner rather than later.
The most cost-effective way to get grain is directly from the grower, so talk to local tillage farmers to secure your supply.
Get advice before you decide on whether to buy barley, wheat or oats.
This advice must be based on how you intend to treat the grain, the volume you will feed and what type of animals you are feeding.
Some methods offer longer storage than others, while there are also treatment methods that enhance the grain’s feed value.
Feeding high levels of cereals for top performance
Many beef producers feed high levels of cereals to finishing cattle.
Most of these are feeding young bulls to finish under 16 months.
It is critical that management in a finishing system like this is top notch.
Preventing digestive upsets is the number one priority with ad-lib diets.
An excellent method of feeding ad-lib cereals to cattle is by treating the grain with an additive that increases the pH to an alkaline level of around 9, which also enhances the protein content.
This option means that you can feed all native cereals, and eliminate lower energy imported materials.
The high pH prevents the animals from getting the acidosis normally associated with high starch feeding.
For those intending to feed 6-8 kg to steers or heifers this winter, the alkaline cereals with enhanced protein would be a complete feed to balance good quality grass silage along, with a mineral supplement."

Miracles are rarely experienced in beef farming, and the seasonal norm of reducing prices to match the higher autumn supply appears to live on, with cuts across the board to coincide with the arrival of August, although there has been no surge in supply yet.
Most processors reduced their quoted base prices by around 5 cents/kg this week, breaching the €4/kg base for steers which had been steady over the past weeks, and thereby throwing down a price challenge to finishers.
The run of the base for steers this week is 395-400 cents/kg, with heifers at 405-410 cents/kg.
It’s a struggle to get to the higher end of these price ranges at most of the factories, with agents for some plants giving a “full for the week” reply. In view of that kind of response, it will be interesting to see how the intake this week compares with the steady 32,000 head or so of recent weeks.
Heavy rainfall over the past week in some areas probably helped processors by urging some finishers to lighten their stocking rates.
Last week’s kill showed little change from the prior weeks, at just under 31,800 head, the composition of which however showed some changes, with steers increasing by about 1,500 head to 14,500, while heifers were back by a few hundred head.
Meanwhile, there are indications that cold store stocks of beef are low, with the higher supply year-to-date moving on to the markets, which is positive for finishers.
Average prices paid last week for beef cattle were back slightly compared to prior weeks, indicating that the processors were securing a higher percentage of stock at the lower end of the price range.
This week, cow prices are steady at 300-340 cents/kg for O/P-grade and up to 355 cents/kg for Rs.
The beef trade in Britain remains steady, with good demand and relatively tight supplies of finished cattle.
R4L-grade steers have been averaging equivalent to 452 cent/kg (if VAT is included, and at 89p for the euro).
In France, the sluggish beef market continues, with trading back for most cuts, and an abundant supply of competitively priced domestic, German and Polish beef available.
But Irish Angus beef products such as ribs and skirts have been trading well.
In Italy, the beef market has eased due to lower consumption arising from recent hot weather.
Up to 510 cents/kg paid to secure lamb supplies
- Martin Ryan
Lamb prices at factories continued to tumble this week.
Most processors quoted the lambs back to a base of 480 cents/kg on Monday, cutting 20-25 cents/kg off the price, while the remainder offered 490-500 cents/kg, at least for the opening days of the week, with the usual bonus of up to 10 cents/kg for quality.
However, the word from around the country is that processors have to pay up to 510 cents/kg in order to get supplies of lambs, with the size of that top-up varying in line with local supply and demand.
There was a very mixed trade at marts in the opening sales of the week on Monday, with reports varying from ‘steady’ to prices falling as much as €8/head, and with offerings of lambs at the sales all showing a big increase compared to recent weeks.
The supply increased to 660 head at Corrin Mart, where prices held up well, with butchers paying €52 over to €74 over, and the factory lots selling for up to €62 over.
The entry was also increased on Monday at Kilkenny Mart, where there were 900 head on offer, and prices were back by €3-€8/head from last week.
Butchers lambs sold for up to €59 over and factory lots peaked at €54 over.
In Britain, little change was reported in the trade over the past week, with supplies remaining relatively strong, and exchange rate fluctuations helping the export trade. Lambs were making the equivalent of around 458 cents/kg.
In France, Grade 1 Irish lamb made 562 cents/kg (including VAT) during the past week.
Farmers surprised by cut in pig prices
Pig farmers got something of a shock last Friday in the form of some processors quoting 4-6c/kg less for pigs.
Various explanations were given by procurement managers for reduced quotes, but IFA Pigs Committee Chairman Tom Hogan said that there was little justification.
“The European market had forged well ahead of the Irish price over the summer and eased slightly in recent weeks. A number of processors had taken this as an excuse to follow suit.”
Up to 174c/kg is now quoted at Irish export plants.
Meanwhile, UK prices and EU mainland prices were unchanged last week.
But in the four weeks ending July 23, the EU pig reference price had fallen by €6.72 to €170.25/100kg, its lowest level since mid-April.
EU pig prices often level off in the summer holiday period and dip in September, but the earlier 2017 pig price decline may indicate a shift in the market. It could be due to Chinese imports falling by around one third since the end of March, compared to a year earlier, the first time since the end of 2014 that quarterly imports did not increase year-on-year."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30800547.html,2017-08-03 01:00:00,137-acre Patchwork Farm of Potential on Shannon Estuary,"The gently rolling hills that typify the topography of the land to the west of Limerick City are home to an interesting mixture of land uses, writes Conor Power. This is where one of the prime agricultural zones of Ireland sits shoulder-to-shoulder with one of the most important industrial regions of the country.
The lands are rich and productive and the levels of farming are generally intensive, with dairying being very much to the fore on the edges of the roughly-defined Golden Vale.
At the same time, there is much industry here, with activities that run the entire gamut of industry types, from cottage industries to IT-specialist SMEs, multinational giants, and heavy industry.
These are complementary activities in their own way, with workers and city dwellers needing farm production as much as farms need markets and wealth creation on their doorsteps for their own survival and prosperity.
The 137-acre coastal farm currently for sale with GVM Auctioneers is located right in the heart of this highly productive part of Ireland. From the air, it certainly cuts a fascinating presence, with its multi-coloured patchwork of fields denoting various crops and activity.
It is situated on the southern side of the Shannon Estuary in the townland of Courtbrown and features a very lengthy stretch of meandering shoreline that comprises its entire western boundary and much of its northern flanks. The village of Askeaton lies 5km to the south, a small settlement dating from the 16th century.
To the west, it’s all industry, with the towering buildings of the Aughinish Alumina — Europe’s largest alumina production facility — just 10km away and the Foynes deep-water port a farther 5km from the farm.
To the east — 33km away — lies Limerick City itself and to the north just across the broad river is Shannon International Airport. The farm is accessed through a cul-de-sac roadway.
As selling agent Tom Crosse reveals, this farm represents an eclectic mixture, both in terms of activity and land quality: “It’s very mixed in terms of quality: there’s forestry in there and some shoreline land and there’s some good arable agricultural land too — currently under tillage. There’s about 40-45 acres of good land and about 50-55 acres of crag, a couple of acres of shoreline and then there’s about 45 acres of forestry.”
There are no entitlements with the bulk of the land but the forestry plantation is still producing yearly premiums. Further details are available from the agents.
There is a farmhouse, which is located more or less in the middle of the property, surrounded by outbuildings. These are all in a derelict condition, according to the agents, but have the potential to be improved if the next owner so desires.
The interest in the property so far has been steady, according to Tom: “It’s just on the market a couple of weeks and we’ve had quite good interest with a few people looking at it.”
The guideline price for this intriguing substantial farm is €650,000. At €4,700/acre, it’s certainly one way of acquiring a good quantity of land in a very well-served area.
Indeed, the entire holding is one that holds plenty of potential: “There is a bit of work to be done that could improve it and that could be done over time but it’s suitable for beef or dairying or equestrian purposes if developed right.”
The farm has plenty of markets on its doorstep and a current tenant has been using the farm to supply local buyers for his produce, according to the selling agents: “He’s a local man who subscribes to all the local markets around Limerick and beyond and he has about 50 acres of it under tillage.”
When you’re in the middle of one of the country’s most important industrial zones, you always have such options."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30800544.html,2017-08-03 01:00:00,Finishing cattle off grass quickly has many advantages,"Beef finishers were encouraged by recent prices, and as a result, stores have been a good trade in marts countrywide, writes Brian Reidy.
There has been some downward price pressure of late, but hopefully this will not continue.
Whether you rear your own cattle or purchase them for finishing, one thing critical to the success of your business is how well you finish them.
Cattle should never be put on an intensive finishing diet until it is appropriate.
This has nothing to do with their age, and everything to do with how well they have been grown. It is still too regular an occurrence for finishers to be disappointed with carcase and fat scores, because the cattle were fed too early, and slaughtered due to age, or due to a perceived optimum duration of the finishing period.
Knowing how to manage feeding the type of stock you have is important, before you put them on a finishing diet. Their start weight, breed and sex will determine their intake, and dictate what type of ingredients should be included in the finishing diet.
Each type of stock will require slightly different nutrition, for optimum performance.
Obviously, if you are finishing young bulls, they have no business outdoors at this stage. They will burn up too much energy, as they tend to be too active and aggressive. Remember farm safety; drawing meal to young bulls is not a sport for the faint hearted!
Autumn grass management
There are two main objectives for grassland management once you get into August — maintain animal performance from good quality grass, and prepare swards for autumn grazing.
In the middle of August, grass quality begins to deteriorate due to a drop off in dry matter and sugars.
To make best use of autumn grass, it is essential to avoid wet weather poaching.
Dividing bigger fields into grazing blocks for two or three days will give better utilisation, and allow areas ahead to continue to grow.
A back fence to restrict grazing of re-growths will allow covers to recover, for subsequent grazing before closing for the winter.
Continue to apply fertiliser right up to the closing date, as there will be a response while conditions allow. Soil temperatures are currently excellent, so take advantage of it.
Finishing off grass
At best, autumn grass can achieve 0.75 kg of live weight gain per day in finishing cattle, whereas the target is a gain of at least 1 kg per day.
Cattle always show a good response at grass when supplemented with 2.5-3 kg of meal per day, at this time of year — provided that excellent quality grass is available.
If excellent quality grass is not available, it will be necessary to feed up to 6 kg/day to heavy heifers or steers that are close to finish.
The amount of meal needed will depend on the breed and sex of the animals being fed.
At this time of year, finishing cattle off grass quickly has many advantages, in terms of stocking rate, profitability and work load.
Appropriate concentrates
Meal needs to be high in energy and low in protein in order to get the final cover of fat on cattle quickly.
With cereals off the combine well worth the money at present, good value should be sought when buying any high-energy, low-protein meal.
Barley and oats in particular are ideal complements to autumn grass for advanced stock. Avoid fillers like palm kernel and sunflower in mixes, they do not add anything to a finishing ration."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30800579.html,2017-08-03 01:00:00,"No pressure when it’s the mart doing the selling, so all I need to do now is relax","I don’t know about you, but I seem to be getting more and more nervous about selling cattle with every passing year.
Twenty years ago, I would have strolled into that seller’s box, with the same confidence that Donald Trump strolls across the White House lawn. Nothing would faze me.
But now, the older I get, the more nerve wrecking the job of selling appears to be.
The razor moves shakily along my chin on the morning of the sale. Beads of sweat start to trickle down my forehead as the seconds count down to the moment of sale.
And finally, when my cattle appear in the ring, and the time comes for me to head to the seller’s box, it’s with a startled expression and a very unsure step that I move.
A bit like Brian Cowen last week when he wore that silly hat, it’s really not something that sits comfortably on me.
If I don’t get a handle on it soon, I’ll be a right emotional rag by the time I’m 50.
And when you think about it really, there is nothing to get too worked up about.
Not when it’s the mart that is arranging the sale, and very capable auctioneers doing the selling. You and I in the sellers’ box are merely the eye candy — we should relax.
The only worry we should have is on how we will spend all the money we make.
“Pressure,” as one farmer said to me over the weekend “is only for tyres.”
And in Bandon mart on Monday, sellers like myself really had very little reason to feel pressure — there was a flying trade. It was a day with plenty of buyers present at the ring and plenty of demand for the stock that appeared in it. Dry cows in Bandon mart on Monday sold from €70 to €585 with the kilo.
Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks made from €275 to €680 with the weight. Continental bullocks sold from €335 to €705 with the kilo.
Friesian bullocks in Bandon made from €200 to €535 with the kilo. Heifers in Bandon sold from €265 to €800 with their weight.

Unlike other sectors of Irish society, where a serious row is ongoing with regard to salaries and pay gaps, I’m proud to report that in Irish beef farming, no such pay squabble or gap exists. We are all paid the same. Man, woman or child, there is no difference in our take home pay packet.
No need for costly investigations here. All Irish beef farmers end up earning the same amount, the princely sum of nothing, or near enough to it. The Basic Farm Payment is our only lifeline and that comes in September to pay for the school books, and again in December to pay for Santa Claus.
The only outward sign of money in beef can be seen when you go for a meal and are forced to cough up €25 for a mouthful of steak. And that can be really hard to swallow, when the beef factory practically falls apart if it is forced to pay a meagre €4/kg to the farmer.
But that’s another story for another day. The focus here is on equal pay. And with regard to the hard working farmer, we are all equal.
But in the bigger picture in the Irish beef industry, clearly some are more equal than others.
Anyway we will move on, and it’s to Dungarvan mart we turn next, where on Monday, Friesian bull calves sold for up to €130. Hereford and Aberdeen Angus bulls sold for up to €340 a head, with quality Hereford heifers making up to €480 a piece.

And finally for this week, just to remind you all that the year is moving on fast, Kanturk mart held a weanling show and sale on Tuesday last.

We had 270 top class weanlings entered, with the supreme championship going to a Blonde d’Aquitaine bull of 430kg, selling for €1,620 (€3.76/kg). The owner was Eamonn O’Mahony of Kiskeam and the buyer was Ned O’Connor, Kilbrin.
“Reserve champion went to a Belgian Blue heifer owned by Jeremiah Twomey from Donoughmore. This weanling weighed 415kg and sold for €1,450 (€3.49/kg) to Stephen Crampton, Birr, Co Offaly.”"

Selling agent, David Shee, says the farm is on the N76 (the main Clonmel-Kilkenny road), on the edge of the village of Grangemockler. It is 12km from Carrick-on-Suir, 19km from Clonmel, and 27km from Kilkenny City.
Described by the agents as a “very attractive agricultural holding”, the property is all in grass and contains a bungalow and outbuildings. The single-storey house is in need of modernisation, as are the outbuildings.
Accommodation includes an entrance hall, sitting room, kitchen/living room, toilet, bathroom, and three bedrooms. The house has oil-fired central heating, and double-glazed windows in the kitchen, and in the front door and rear door.
The land is the main attraction, in such a strong agricultural area. Dairy farming would be the dominant activity, but there is no shortage of beef farming, as well as equestrian interests and tillage farming.
This farm would suit any activity, with its central location and good-quality access an advantage.
The holding is well-fenced all around and the River Lingaun forms a natural boundary along much of the northern bounds.
The farm has a “pleasant, sloping aspect”, in nine divisions, with attractive views and mature hedging.
Its convenient road access makes it conducive to being divided into lots. The agents say that offers will be considered for “one or more lots”. How these will be divided (or even if they are divided) will be determined by how the interest in this farm evolves. For the moment, however, the price guide puts the house and curtilage (including outbuildings) at €100,000, while the land is expected to fetch between €8,000 and €9,000 an acre."

Money to pay the vet, the bank and the feed merchant. Money to pay almost everyone.
Last Tuesday morning in this house, the mart cheque arrived — and by last Tuesday evening most of it had gone again.
A bit like a revolving door, it can be hard sometimes for the farmer himself to get a look in, without getting caught in the mechanics of the thing.
But at least when the dust settles, if you have made enough to cover your costs and your bills, you can breathe a sigh of relief. You’ve made enough to keep the show going, and in this beef game where fellows go to the wall quicker than a Mexican on the Texas border, that alone can be some achievement.
And speaking of keeping the show going, we begin our mart report by heading first to the bank holiday sale of cattle at Kilmallock mart, where on Monday numbers of cattle were up and demand was good.
Denis Kirby of GVM gave us all the details. “We had almost 1,200 calves and calves on offer here at Kilmallock mart on Monday. These were very big numbers for the August bank holiday. Once again, this week exporters and farmers fought keenly for stock.”
Bullocks in Kilmallock on Monday sold for up to €2.34 per kg, while weanlings hit €3.04 per kg.
Dry cows sold for up to €1260 each or €1.85 per kg. Heifers hit €2.83 per kg.
Dairy stock made up to €1,220 (paid for a four year old calved Jersey). In the suckler ring a four-year-old Charolais and her Limousin bull calf sold for €1,900. And in the calf ring, runner type calves made up to an eye-rubbing €800. This sum was paid over for a 21-week-old Charolais bull. He must have been some bull.
This Saturday, August 12, a weanling show and sale takes place in GVM’s Abbeyfeale mart, while on this coming Monday, there will be one held in Kilmallock. Intake for weanlings at Kilmallock commences at 8am.
The show begins at 9.30am, and the sale starts with weanling bulls at 10.30am.

While bank holidays are of course a big deal in the wider world, in farming they are about as welcome as coccidiosis in young calves. Farmers in general hate bank holidays.
They’re a real inconvenience, with so many business premises shutting up shop.
We have too many bank holidays these days, they seen to be occurring with ever greater frequency. We didn’t have half as many when I was a young fellow, and people worked a lot harder. Who decided the labour force was in need of so many siestas? Were the backs breaking at an alarming rate?
Anyway, in Macroom on Saturday, while a queue of bored-looking caravan-towing families snaked their way slowly through the streets of the town in search of a better life in Killarney, at the mart it was business as usual.
Macroom mart had plenty of cattle on offer with plenty of buyers on-hand, ignoring the urge to tow a caravan and put the feet up. In Macroom, dry cows sold from €20 to €645 over the kilo. Continental bullocks made from €330 to €720 over the kilo. Hereford and Aberdeen Angus bullocks sold from €270 to €545 over their weight. Heifers sold from €280 to €545 over their weight.

Two Charolais cross steers, born in March 2015, weighed 682kg, and sold for €1,340 at Macroom mart last Saturday.
“Forward store bullocks and heifers showed little or no change, and some of the plainer type cattle were a little more difficult to sell.
“Beef heifers peaked at €2.60 per kilo on Thursday, with forward store bullocks peaking at €2.80 per kilo. Cull cow prices remain firm.”

Beef processors turned the screw again on finishers this week, with prices slipping further, and bad weather boosting the cattle supply to the factories.
Base prices for steers were reduced by a further 5 cents/kg, to 380 cents/kg, a level at which processors are likely to be happy enough as they face into the autumn beef trade.
However, some processors were finding it difficult to get in enough cattle at the reduced prices of last week-end, and many deals were negotiated by finishers for at least 385 cents/kg for their steers.
But torrential rain in many parts of the south has probably eased procurement pressures on processors a little, because some farmers are coming under pressure to move cattle off rain-softened ground.
Heifer prices are at a premium of 10 cents/kg over steer prices, at a general base of 390 cents/kg, but it is a bit easier to get 395 cents/kg for heifers than for steers, and a good percentage are expected to trade at the slightly higher price.
There are some reports of up to 400 cents/kg being paid for heifers, but it is not generally available.
While processors have point to the weakening of sterling in recent weeks, as an excuse for cutting prices, there wasn’t any supply flush of cattle into factories to put pressure on prices.
There has been very little change in cow prices this week, with O/P-grade ranging from 300 to 325 cents/kg, and up to 335-340 cents/kg for Rs.
In Britain, the beef trade remained relatively steady last week, with little change in prices, and demand and supply finely balanced.
R4L-grade steer prices were steady, averaging equivalent to 446 cent/kg (with €1 worth around 91p sterling).
For the first time since 2013, there has been a decrease in calf registrations between January and June in Britain, according to the UK’s Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board.
Calf registrations for the first half of the year are back 1% compared to 2016.
This has been driven by lower dairy bred calf registrations, both males and females, while beef-bred calves increases.
Angus bred registrations continued to grow, although Limousin remained the most dominant beef breed in calves.
In France, the beef market was quiet last week, with some restaurants and butcher shops closed for holidays.
In Italy, little change was reported in the market last week, with trade relatively steady."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30805038.html,2017-09-08 01:00:00,Currency shocks are just tremors ahead of the potential Brexit earthquake,"The immediate aftershock of the Brexit vote on June 23, 2016, caused the value of sterling to drop literally overnight from about 76p to the euro, to 81p to the euro.
Since then, sterling continued to weaken to a low of just over 90p, but steadied in the mid-80s, for almost a year after the Brexit vote.
However, since mid-May, sterling has weakened 10%, bringing its current value to about 92p per euro.
The initial drop in the value of sterling almost immediately wiped out a number of Irish mushroom growers.
They were perhaps the
“canary in the mine”, given their high exposure to the UK market in terms of their profit margins from that market, and their over-dependence on that one market.
The plight of the mushroom producers should be seen as a warning for the rest of us.
Now, the weakening of spot prices for cereals, and of factory prices for beef, is being attributed to the slippage in the value of sterling.
A strong euro versus the UK pound does very little to benefit Irish agriculture, with fairly minimal inputs originating from the UK.
Strengthening of the euro also makes it increasingly difficult for our exporters to find alternate markets outside of the UK and the eurozone. The currency of international trade, the US dollar, has weakened nearly 15%, from a high of $1.05 to the euro to a current $1.19, since the start of 2017.
These currency fluctuations are just tremors.
The fallout from Brexit may yet make conditions for trading with our nearest neighbour incredibly more difficult.
Potential implications for Irish farmers could include:
n If the UK is removed from the EU for VAT purposes, any local form of goods and services tax (GST) becomes non-recoverable to an Irish VAT-registered entity, potentially increasing the cost of goods and services by up to 20%.
n All imports by registered or unregistered farmers would be liable for VAT, tax payers having to self-account for VAT on such purchases.
This will add to the administrative costs of farming businesses. In the case of unregistered farmers who currently buy goods in the UK, the differential between Irish and UK VAT rates will mean an extra 3% VAT cost, when self-accounting for VAT, rather than the current rate of 20%.
n Customs duty may
become payable where the goods price exceeds €150 for imports, increasing direct and indirect costs for taxpayers.
n Customs duty may
become payable by UK customers on the purchase of goods from Ireland, undermining our competitiveness.
n Capital and income taxes may be affected; existing double tax treaties may be
re- negotiated. Unilateral domestic legislation dealing with, for instance, agricultural relief applicable to agricultural property within member states may no longer be applicable to transfers of UK farm land to Irish beneficiaries. This may affect persons farming on both sides of the Irish border.
The ramifications of Brexit for Irish farming could potentially go far beyond anything we have seen in our lifetimes.
The fallout is unknown, and the economic implications and tax implications could be catastrophic for many marginal farm enterprises.
Undoubtedly, Irish agriculture will survive, and the UK will continue to deal predominantly with Irish suppliers who have a proven track record. We are after all their nearest neighbours. But this is however little comfort in protecting Irish farming profit margins.
The policy shift of the EU away from intervention,
export refunds and quotas works against us; we no longer have price support measures that can protect farm incomes.
Although we have another 18 months before March 2019, the expected date for the UK exiting the EU, it is at this stage that we should be shouting about these potential
impacts of Brexit, in order that Brexit is framed as best as possible to protect us."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30805043.html,2017-09-08 01:00:00,"Six years on, ICMSA’s John Comer still fears milk price volatility ’nightmare’","Candidates are not yet declared, but the 40-year-old ICMSA deputy president, Pat McCormack, who farms near Tipperary town, is seen as the obvious contender so far, for the hot seat at the top of the Irish Creamery Milk Supplier Association.
That position has been held since December, 2011, by John Comer.
His has been a steady hand on the tiller, successfully steering the Association through six years which were so contrastingly traumatic for the country’s other main farmers’ organisation. IFA’s general secretary Pat Smith and president, Eddie Downey, stepped down after a huge financial controversy erupted late in 20156 over Mr Smith’s pay package.
Mr Comer, who will have completed his allowed two terms as the milk suppliers’ leader in late December, has given us his perspective on current issues, informed by his leadership of the country’s dairy farmers.
The dairy and beef farmer from near Castlebar, Co Mayo became an ICMSA National Council member in 2000, and was elected Deputy President in November 2007.
Your presidency coincided with setbacks for farmers, including a fodder crisis in 2013/14 and a dairy farm income slump last year. What did you learn from these setbacks during your time as President?
The first thing to note is the essential difference: the fodder crisis was brought on by a really wet winter spring and was therefore a “weather event”.
To that extent, it was a question of reacting quickly and convincing the Government of the extent and depth of the
crisis, and coming forward then with policy responses to the problem itself and to the resultant debt incurred as farmers desperately
purchased and imported fodder.
The dairy income crisis of 2015/16 was not really weather related. It was instead a direct result of incorrect policy and hesitant reaction that dropped the bottom out of the market, and saw milk suppliers receiving a price below the costs of
production for over a year.
We have to say that we found the reaction of both the Government and the EU Commission to the price and income collapse to be much more hesitant and slower than was required.
The idea that the market would “work itself out” was wrong, because what was actually happening was that where farmers had fixed or rising input costs and loans, they were being forced to chase with milk volume what they were losing on margin.
So, even as the milk price dropped, farmers had to increase production to try and make up for the fall in their price.
It’s important to note here that it was only the price that was paid to the farmers that collapsed.
The price paid by consumers never fell by a cent.
It was only the farmers that were wiped out by the price collapse; other links in the dairy supply-chain kept or increased their margins, and did very well out of the fact that they were able to dictate a price backwards to the farmers that was less than it was costing to produce the milk.
Quite early on, ICMSA, and our colleague organisations in the European Milk Board, told the Commission that supply volumes would have to be reduced on a voluntary basis, and I stress voluntary, to put a floor back under the market, and eventually, our solution of a voluntary supply reduction scheme was introduced, and it made an almost immediate difference.
Actually, the present dairy price rally dates practically exactly to that policy change.
I remember well the Dairy Forum in June, 2016, when dairy processors were predicting it would October 2016
before a milk price increase would happen.
Commissioner [Phil] Hogan announced the Voluntary Milk Supply Reduction scheme in July, and within weeks, the same milk processors announced price increases for July milk.
That was not a coincidence.
You seem to be a little more sceptical about the Commission’s commitment to the best possible Brexit deal for Ireland, why?
I don’t think that “sceptical” is the exact word.
But it’s fair to say that I’m anxious about a situation where our €5bn-odd of food and agri-exports to the UK could end up being held
hostage by another member state demanding that, for instance, their people have a freedom of movement concession from the UK similar to the one we’ll presumably continue to enjoy.
I want to believe that Ireland’s interests are front and centre and, in fairness to Mr Barnier [the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator], he has been consistent on this.
But I recently had to take issue publicly with a prominent French farm leader who stated that his members could not accept an open border between North and South, over which non-EU imports could move freely.
This is exactly what I fear, that others, through no real fault of their own, just can’t appreciate that a hard border would be disastrous for the farming and agri-food sectors, as well as raising issues that we had left behind, with huge difficulty and sacrifice by all sides.
I have to say that the course being pursued by the Irish Government seems to me to be the right one. We have to make all other parties, whether in the UK or the EU, understand that the preservation of our centuries old, multi-billion-euro food trade with the UK on a tariff-free basis is a central national strategic objective.
There’s one other aspect of Brexit that needs to be emphasised.
The CAP Post 2020 will have to be maintained at present levels of funding, at least.
That means that the remaining Member States, including Ireland, will have to make good the UK contribution.
I’ve said it from the first day of my Presidency of ICMSA, and I’ll go on repeating it to my last: CAP and direct payments are not a subsidy to the farmer, they are actually a subsidy to the retailers, that enables EU consumers to buy the highest quality food, produced to the highest standards of sustainability, at a price that does not sufficiently reward the farmer.
These farmer direct payments are the cost of the EU’s ‘cheap food’ policy.
You’ve described excessive milk price volatility as a “nightmare” for dairy farmers. What’s needed to solve this problem?
“Nightmare” is not an exaggeration. It’s not possible to run a family farm with fixed or rising costs against a background where the milk price can swing from 22cpl to 34cpl in one year. Where you can go from having no income whatsoever in one year to a reasonable level of income the next year, while raising your family at the same time.
Farmers don’t want a peak-and-trough model. ICMSA certainly doesn’t want that. How can you plan any business on that basis? How do you invest or borrow?
We need a mechanism that addresses income volatility, and that’s why ICMSA has recommended a number of initiatives to the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food & the Marine.
One is a Farm Management Deposit Scheme that allows farmers to put away funds in good years in a official and tax-compliant deposit scheme, that they can draw down in bad years, when price volatility, or price falls, mean that income disappears.
We think it’s a measured and workable model that will tackle the nightmare, and we’re quietly confident that our arguments have been heard, and might bear fruit in next month’s budget.
John Comer, ICMSA"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30805037.html,2017-09-08 01:00:00,"Rain and 35,800 cattle per week squeeze markets","There are some things in life that never change, like the numbers game dictating the price for beef cattle every autumn, with which beef finishers are very familiar.
When a spell of heavy rainfall is added to the numbers game, you have a perfect recipe for a drop in beef prices, as sure as night follows day, year in and year out.
And in 2017, the decline in the value of sterling has added another factor to the mix, helping to cancel out the continuing strength of markets for beef, and the scarcity of beef stocks within factories, despite a strong supply of cattle over recent months.
Beef processors have been doing a good export marketing job, resulting in an apparent weekly demand at factories for up to 33,000 head of cattle.
The question arises as to how long beef finishers can generate that level of cattle supply, with many very successful finishers opting out and switching to milk production.
Calf births are well up on previous years, but growing live exports will also affect the supply of beef cattle, as the switch to milk production is accelerated by continuing low returns from suckler farming and other beef enterprises, particularly felt at this time of year... every year.
Some processors, particularly in the western counties, are offering a base of 375 cents/kg for steers this week, hoping to take advantage of the pressure on farmers to sell cattle off land soaked by recent deluges of rain.
However, most processors are at a base price of 380 cents/kg, and it is hard for them to get cattle for less than this, with some reports of up to 385 cents/kg being paid.
On the other hand, the increasing number of animals coming up to 30 months old is helping to keep a lid on prices by bringing out extra supply, a trend which will continue through September and October.
Heifer prices are generally at 390 cents/kg, although some processors are quoting at 385 cents/kg.
There is good demand for cows, at unchanged prices.
Prices for the O/P-grade cows range mostly from 315 to 330 cents/kg, but up to 335 cents/kg, while the quality R-graders are generally at 345 cents/kg or a shade higher.
The cattle kill last week hit 35,800 head, one of the highest weekly supplies in 2017.
The beef trade in Britain has remained stable last week, with demand firm and supplies relatively tight.
Supplies are expected to recover, with the latest cattle count indicating a rise in the number of prime cattle under 30 months.
In terms of prices, the R4L grade steer prices were averaging equivalent to 442 cent/kg (at 92p sterling for €1).
In France, little change was reported in the beef market last week.
It is hoped the reopening of schools and businesses after the holiday season will boost the trade over the coming weeks.
In Italy, the trade is reported to be remaining sluggish, and in Germany, the market was reported as finely balanced."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30810382.html,2017-10-18 12:53:00,UK facing food hikes post-Brexit,"Britain’s poorest families will face the biggest food price hikes if Brexit happens without the UK reaching a withdrawal deal with the EU, a new report warns.
In a ‘no deal’ scenario emerging from EU-UK talks, a joint report by Resolution Foundation and Sussex University’s UK Trade Policy Observatory estimates UK average price of dairy goods will rise by 8.1%, meat products by 5.8%, with cars and other vehicles rising 5.5%.
The average yearly household bill would rise by £260 (€290) in a ‘no deal’ scenario, in which UK imposes the same tariffs on the EU as it does for other World Trade Organisation countries.
However, 3m families could see price rises of over £500 (€560) while the proportionate impact on the poorest fifth of households would be 33% greater than on the richest fifth, the joint report calculates. The hikes in food prices would be central to that jump having the worst impacts on poorer sections of UK society.
Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The [UK] government has said that while it wants a comprehensive trade agreement it is also preparing for a ‘no deal’ scenario when we leave the EU. Such an outcome — which could see the UK imposing tariffs on EU imports — would increase the annual shopping bills of millions of households by £500, with poorer families taking the biggest hit.
“While trade may not have been the biggest issue in the referendum, it is one that will affect the day-to-day living standards of every family in Britain.” The report’s authors have urged the UK government to continue to prioritise a comprehensive new trade deal with the EU to avoid UK households facing higher prices and rapidly escalating households budgets.
Meanwhile, ICSA president Patrick Kent has urged the
Irish
Government and all Irish MEPs to oppose any EU concessions on beef quotas in the Mercosur talks. He cited threats Irish beef is already facing from Brexit.
“We cannot accept the EU making trade deals all over the globe when they are making no progress in solving the trading arrangements with the UK,” said Mr Kent.
“The UK took 270,000 tons of Irish beef in 2016. Anything which damages that market is disastrous for Ireland and combining that threat with 70,000 tonnes or more of ultra-cheap Brazilian beef and equivalent amounts of poultry would be suicide for our sector.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30814446.html,2017-11-16 00:00:00,Upward trend in beef prices,"by Martin Ryan
The factories are finding that they are having to concede a shade more for stock this week as the pressure continues to get supplies, despite a good increase in the kill for last week.
As expected, the supply recovered significantly last week in the aftermath of the bank holiday the previous week, with supply in the order of 38,500 head, bringing it close to the peak of season weekly supply again.
The recovery has dispelled any suggestion that cattle numbers were about to dry up. There was a few more cents going for the stock and suppliers took advantage of that to lighten stock.
The upward trend on price has continued this week, or be it at just a very gradual level, with producers securing a shade more again for their stock.
Most of the suppliers are holding out for 380 cents/kg for the steers this week, even though some factories are continuing to offer 375c/kg and are trying to get cattle at that price, which is proving difficult.
Nevertheless, while some are trying to negotiate for up to 385 cents/kg as a base it is not easily got, except there the processor in under extreme pressure for the extra stock.
The heifer prices are tracking the steers at a premium of 10 cents/kg with 390 cents/kg the most general price that suppliers are reporting. Again there is continued resistance from the factories to conceding above that, although there are some reports of deals at up to 395 cents/kg for good stock.
These are crucial weeks for the factories to get their supplies for the Christmas orders. Within another ten days or so, most of the requirements for the bulk of the pre Christmas trade will be within the factories.
However the pattern of orders now dictate that the close down for Christmas has got very short for those supplying the fresh trade and demand continues through the holidays, but the sharpness of the trade could ease if current strength of supply remains a reality.
There is very little change in the prices on offer for the cows.
The base for O/P grade ranges 300-330 cents/kg and up to 345 cents/kg being offered for the R’s this week.
In neighbouring Britain, the trade recovered slightly last week on the back of an ease in supplies and little change in demand.
In terms of prices, the R4L grade steer prices increased marginally and were averaging at 376.8 pence/kg dw which is the equivalent to 448 cent/kg with the exchange rates for the euro during the week strengthened to around 88.4p sterling on average.
In France, little change was reported in the trade last week.
In Italy, the trade remained relatively steady last week for most products.
Meanwhile in Germany the market remained relatively balanced with demand best for young bulls."

The 31-year-old from the Callan Macra club in Co Kilkenny had been farming with his parents for 10 years, before he took over the running of the farm in 2015, and has increased cow numbers from 72 to 430 in just three years.
Expansion has been driven with a focus of maximising grass-based output.
The crossbred herd has a six-week calving rate of 85%, and averaged 461kg of milk solids per cow in 2016.
PJ aims to produce 480kg of milk solids in 2017 from a concentrate input of 500 kg/cow.
A few days after winning the prestigious Young Farmer of the Year award, PJ O&rsquo;Keeffe highlighted for me the challenges for dairy farming, as he sees them.
He said labour is first and foremost on everyone&rsquo;s mind, and is something the industry has to learn to deal with very quickly, because we are the best in the world at growing grass and the most efficient from a climate point of view or an emissions point of view, but we are not the best with people.
&ldquo;We are way down the pecking order as far as that&rsquo;s concerned, and that is something we have to focus on, and all
industry leaders, whether they be co-ops or representative bodies such as Macra, IFA, ICMSA, the government, or farmers in general, everyone has to take a proactive approach to this.
&ldquo;We need to get our replacement rate right, taking into consideration the average age of dairy farmers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We need to start worrying about the next generation of farming.
Farming whether it be dairying, tillage, beef, it does not matter what enterprise you are involved in, it needs the cream of the crop running [it] on a daily basis, because it&rsquo;s a great business, but it&rsquo;s a business that gets a lot of challenges thrown at it on a daily, weekly, monthly bases.
&ldquo;We need the best people out there running our farms, in charge of primary food production.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We just need the right people to deal with these challenges.
&ldquo;We need industry, who have come on board through the Glanbia fixed price and fixed feed, but we all need to be doing our bit.
&ldquo;People are calling this an excellent year in dairying, this is only where dairying is sustainable, anything else is not acceptable.
&ldquo;There is nothing to be proud about being able to produce milk at 21 or 22 cent per litre and to run an industry on that basis, it&rsquo;s not even worth talking about.
&ldquo;Where it&rsquo;s worth talking about is where it is sustainable, where people can get paid a proper wage for themselves and their family, and also for people that are working on farms as part of a team to drive on this industry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If we are going to compete with other industries for the cream of the crop of talent coming out of secondary schools, we have to be able to remunerate and look after them far better than we are doing right now.&rdquo;
PJ explained the cow breeding policy his parents pursued, which allowed him to hit the ground running.
&ldquo;There was always quality on the farm, from a milk quality point of view or a breeding quality point of view.
&ldquo;My father had always quite low empty rates, so I had a nice type of cow to breed off, a very good high-mark kind of cow that I was allowed breed from, along with stock brought in over the years.&rdquo;
Would you have any preference for genetics or breed?
&ldquo;Absolutely none whatsoever, I have seen some quite good results over the years from crossbred type cows, but there is no longer in my opinion a gap between a crossbred type of cow and a black and white.
&ldquo;If I am looking to benchmark myself against the best in the business, some of the guys out there at the moment are doing equally as well with the black and white herds as with crossbred herds, so there is absolutely no difference whatsoever.&rdquo;
We see in the Netherlands that increasing cow numbers does not necessarily translate into making profit. How do you make profit milking 430 cows?
&ldquo;Quite simply, we have kept the template we had when milking 72 cows. I haven&rsquo;t lost any of my efficiencies. We have been very strict and rigid about the way we have done things, about
expansion, controlling our costs, controlling our output, whether that be through stocking rate, grass growing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t slipped in efficiencies in any manner, and that hasn&rsquo;t been easy, but we kept our finger on the pulse.
You look at beef and the sheep guys, they are better than we [dairy farmers] are.
They have to deal with unsustainable prices on a constant basis, but yet they manage to have money to put bread on the table and for their families to prosper.
&ldquo;They are resilient, and we have to be.
&ldquo;Farming is a wonderful way of life, but we just need to ensure that, and there is a role for the media to keep focusing on the positives that are there, and to push the industry as a whole to make sure that there is sustainability.&rdquo;
If we had a year of low milk prices like we did in 2016, how do you insulate yourself from low milk prices?
&ldquo;I am quite fortunate to supply Callan Co-op, which in turn has a milk supply agreement with Glanbia.
&ldquo;I had quite a percentage of my milk [price] fixed last year, and to me, it&rsquo;s all about safety, there are not that many people in farming to be millionaires, we are in it for a beautiful way of life to enjoy what we do, to work with the land and to work with the cows.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fixed [price] milk was one way to offset that, as regards the downturn in the price of milk last year, but also the type of cow we have is giving us a couple of cent per litre bonus on the base price.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not something that should never be taken into account but it helps insulate us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If could [price] fix 100% of my milk, I would, to be quiet honest with you, because it helps me sleep easier at night, and I can forecast exactly where it&rsquo;s going to be.
Forecast exactly where people are going to get paid, whether it be for land, for wages, for everything.
&ldquo;I would much rather we were an industry where we were [price] fixed completely.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to the people, if they want to get involved in the industry, that the gun isn&rsquo;t being put to their head on a five-year cycle that they are being given a 21c or 22c per litre base milk price.&rdquo;
&ldquo;People can say that only the strong survive, but that is not an industry we want, I don&rsquo;t want to promote people producing milk at a high cost, or anything like that, but we have a beautiful island, and the same cost of production does not exist all over this island.
&ldquo;I want you to highlight that yes, it can be done, some people are producing milk at 20c/l, but they are on some of the driest areas of land.
&ldquo;They do not know what it is to farm in certain parts of the country where it&rsquo;s a far different playing field altogether, and that doesn&rsquo;t for any second make them any better or worse farmers than the guy doing it on superb farms.
&ldquo;It just shows vast differences in producing milk across this country.&rdquo;
What are your plans for the
future, PJ?
&ldquo;The greatest challenge that I am going to have going forward is to consolidate what I have got, and that is just not literally in cows, it&rsquo;s to make sure that people are happy, it&rsquo;s not all about PJ O&rsquo;Keeffe, it&rsquo;s all about whoever is working on the farm, to make sure that they are happy, because they are part of the next generation who maybe want to be dairy farmers.
&ldquo;It is to give them an opportunity, and that&rsquo;s my plan, to work on the future of the farm and the future of the people that are on it.
&ldquo;Cow number wise, we are happy enough where we are, if opportunities come along, we will obviously will have a look at them, but I am pretty happy where we are at the moment.&rdquo;"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30817601.html,2017-12-07 00:00:00,"Average 2017 dairy income will exceed €90,000","It&rsquo;s a record year for farming, and particularly for dairy farming, with Teagasc economists estimating an over 30% increase in the value of output from dairy farms, a sector far outstripping the national economy&rsquo;s EU-leading 5% growth.
This is largely due to a spectacular increase in world dairy commodity prices (particularly for butter), and 36c per litre paid for milk to Irish farmers (compared to 28c in 2016).
Meanwhile, dairy farmers expanded their output by 8%, and the resulting income arising on the average dairy farm (with 60 hectares, 72 cows, and 1.4 labour units) is expected to exceed &euro;90,000.
This compares with about &euro;52,000 in 2016, when markets were not so favourable, and dairy farm incomes fell by 17%.
There has always been a gap between incomes earned in the dairy sector and in other farming activities, but this became an even wider chasm this year.
Nevertheless, most farming sectors had an acceptable year, compared to earlier years.
The other sector which had a particularly improved year was pig production, with feed costs 10% lower than the five-year average. Pig prices rose by 13c to 162c per kg.&nbsp;
The profit margin over feed increased from 43c per kg to 58c, and pig output increased by 90,000 head, or about 2.5%.
World grain prices have been low for some time, reducing cereal farm incomes, and earlier estimates in 2017 suggested this too would be a bad year.
But record yields for spring barley have boosted profit margins this year, by about &euro;50 per hectare overall.
However, there is a serious problem in the cereal sector, with healthy profit margins for only one third of farms, another third breaking even, and losses for the remaining third.
Incomes on beef farms with a suckling enterprise are stable at a low level in 2017.
A slight improvement in margins and incomes is the outcome on cattle finishing farms.
Profit margins in lamb production have improved by 20% in 2017, due to increased output and higher prices.
Both beef and sheep enterprises remain heavily dependent on subsidies for adequate income.
And the dairy boost may be short-lived, with the milk price predicted by Teagasc to fall 10% in 2018, to 32.3c per litre. Despite this, milk output is expected to grow by 4%. The net profit margin per hectare is expected to fall about 22%, but this outcome would still result in income levels above those experienced in any other year except 2017.
Pigmeat prices and profit margins are also forecast to fall in 2018.
Beef prices are however predicted to increase, due to strong EU demand, and a reduction in supply.
Sheep meat prices are expected to fall."

As one year ends, the cycle begins again, and reviewing the previous one allows us to plan for the next.
What lessons have we learned from 2017 and what are we going to change in 2018? Do you have a wish list for 2018, is it a realistic one?
Year in review
Looking back, 2017 can be summarised as follows:
A spring with average growth &mdash; particularly April.
A difficult May for silage production.
Excellent silage was produced before the May 11 before the rain started.
A small window for silage appeared again in late May.
A summer with excellent grass growing conditions for most.
July silage ended up being very dry for many.
An autumn that started well but got wet quickly, forcing stock indoors early in many areas. A difficult spring cereal harvest.
So overall a mixed year with plenty of challenges due to weather.
Fodder shortages
After this spring where silage pits were close to emptied, most were worried that this winter would see severe fodder shortages. Unfortunately, conditions during the year have resulted in this becoming a reality, particularly in the west and north.
Learning from 2017
It is important that we look back at records from previous years in order to improve planning for the next year. Make a list of your production results for the year relative to targets.
Calves born
Mortality rates
Disease Incidence
Vet calls for sick animals
Empty cows
Live weight gain per day
Weanlings
Stores
Finishers
Grass grown per ha
Silage yields and quality.
Cattle kill out performance; Grades, fat covers and prices achieved.
Meal purchases
Fertilise usage
Etc&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
List any other things you feel are important to your business.
What happened this year?
Did you run out of grass at critical times in the spring and summer?
Was this due to drought/over stocking, etc?
Older/unproductive swards.
Nutrient imbalances in soil-pH and or P&amp;K issues.
Are you happy with Silage in 2017?
Most 2017 silage is relatively dry, particularly 2nd cuts, but quality is not as good as most had hoped for.
Quality was affected by the delayed cutting dates.
Early May cutting dates should be aimed for.
Plan now for 2018 silage
Did some paddocks grow less grass than others?
Do they need reseeding?
What is Lime, P &amp; K status?
Do they need trace elements?
Is compaction an issue?
How did crops yield this year?
Assess soil nutrition before planting in 2018.
What is soil condition like?
Are you growing the right crops for your production system?
What input did you change that did or did not work?
Did you buy on price and compromise on quality?
Are there feeds that you have stopped feeding that probably should be re-introduced so as to improve performance?
Animal Performance
Were there any new disease outbreaks?
What things should you be vaccinating for if anything?
In suckler herds did the calving season go to plan?
What was calf survival like?
Did cows clean easily?
Did feeding, environment and mineral status influence this?
If you are in the BDGP are you hitting targets as we head closer to 2020?
Were suckler offspring of desired quality?
Did your bull(s) produce consistent quality calves?
Did you use AI?
Was heat detection accurate enough to achieve target submission rates?
How well did first calving heifers perform?
Did they go back in calf?
Had they grown sufficiently before calving?
Did they have enough milk?
Did finishing animals grade as they should have?
Many stock continue to be slaughtered in Ireland way before they are properly fit!
Is the finishing system the correct one for you and your farm?
Bulls vs bullocks vs heifers?
Were home grown forages good enough?
Was the meal quality good enough?
Was enough meal fed?
Was grass quality as it should be?
Do you need help with grassland management?
Were your herd&rsquo;s weanlings at the desired weight for sale?
Did cows produce sufficient milk?
Was grass quality as it should be?
How well did bought in stock perform on the farm?
Were there any losses?
What were the farm&rsquo;s losses caused by?
Stress?
Disease?
Was your parasite control strategy effective in 2018
Wish list for 2018
So, after reviewing 2017 you should then be in a position to write your wish list for 2018
Here is mine
I hope that farmers, both beef and dairy will realise the benefits of cutting silage much earlier than they have been over recent years.
Early May first cuts and consider a three-cut system where you will produce sufficient quantity at significantly better quality. This will reduce concentrate usage and enhance animal performance
All going well, silage stocks will be replenished around the country.
Hopefully beef prices will improve, and that quality will be rewarded.
Let&rsquo;s hope Munster lift some silverware.
Tipp win back Liam?
Happy Christmas and all the best for 2018"

Isolde Goggin, chairperson of the CCPC, confirmed that the Commission has received a small number of complaints about the Twenty20 Beef Club arrangement, and is examining them carefully.
However, the CCPC does not have grounds to be concerned that a breach of competition law has occurred.
She said the Twenty20 Beef Club is a vertical agreement, an agreement between players at different stages in the food chain, and is generally permissible under Irish and European competition law.
“Specifically, there is the vertical block exemption regulation in European law which exempts from competition law scrutiny vertical agreements where the market share of both the buyer and the seller is under 30%”
In general, competition agencies are much more concerned about horizontal agreements, agreements between players at the same stage in the market.
“Agreements that cover a lesser part of the market are generally not considered to be a problem, unless there were three or four agreements that sewed up the entire market and nobody could come in at either level.
“Looking at the statistics in the Twenty20 Beef Club, if all the predictions and market share forecasts came true, they might get up to 5% in a few years, and that is not a level that would trigger our concerns.”
Mr O’Leary said: “It is not a concern at the moment, but the bigger it gets, the more attention it would get from us.”
The Twenty20 Beef Club was launched in April by Glanbia Ireland and Kepak Group, offering Glanbia Ireland supplier dairy farms a guaranteed market for their heifers and steers, with a predictable and transparent pricing formula at the time of slaughter. Glanbia Ireland and Kepak have plans to rapidly expand the programme to 50,000 calves per annum.
Members would benefit from an advanced cash flow payment of up to €770 per animal (interest charge of 3.75%).
All relevant farm inputs consumed by Club herds will be sourced and supplied by Glanbia Ireland."

Meat Industry Ireland, representing processors, said about 3,000 workers at 20 plants around the country have already been temporarily laid off, because picket lines have shut production by preventing cattle from coming onto the factory floor.
Among those affected are about 300 Dawn Meats workers in Grannagh, outside Waterford City, who were called into a meeting yesterday afternoon to be told they have been temporarily laid off.
In seeking an injunction against protesters two weeks ago, Dawn Meats had told the High Court that the pickets were resulting in daily loss of turnover of €1.5m.
“Decisions to cease processing operations have not been taken lightly but in the face of the unwillingness of protesters to stop their illegal blockades, companies were forced to act,” Meat Industry Ireland said in a statement last night.
Some 80% of overall processing capacity has now closed, and further closures and layoffs are likely in coming days.
Agriculture Minister Michael Creed has appealed to Meat Industry Ireland to return to talks aimed at resolving the impasse between farmers, the industry, and retailers over the price paid for cattle.
However, he suggested that Meat Industry Ireland’s demand that protesters stand down before talks can resume poses a difficulty given the grassroots nature of the demonstrations, which are not organised by established farming organisations.
“Standard operating procedures in terms of normal industrial relations, standing down pickets, getting into talks don’t apply,” said Mr Creed.
He said he would make the direct point to Meat Industry Ireland that “we cannot have a situation where their refusal to engage effectively closes down the entire industry”.
“I would appeal to them, and to all parties now to reflect, and particularly to reflect on the fact that any unilateral action now has the capacity not to add to the possibility of a solution, but actually to exacerbate the difficulties we face,” said Mr Creed.
“I would appeal to particularly Meat Industry Ireland, to reflect on that matter and on the fact that direct engagement with their customers is a business imperative in any business, and it is not after the last man standing at the picket line has been hauled before the courts that that can happen. It has to happen now.”
However, Meat Industry Ireland said “negotiating while illegal and threatening behaviour is ongoing is not compatible with negotiation in good faith”.
“We need to be very clear that it is not the industry that has caused the closedown, or that is forcing the closedown now,” director Cormac Healy told RTÉ’s News at One.
“It is illegal blockading that has been going on for a good four weeks of the last six weeks at this stage that is responsible for it, the industry has shown that it’s willing to talk.
“It is only three weeks ago that we engaged in extensive discussions with the farm bodies, we got to a consensus agreement, but then the Beef Plan pulled out of that.”
However, Mr Healy conceded that “trying to figure out who represents who and who can deliver something that removes protesters from the blockades is one of the fundamental difficulties here”.
While picket lines were originally established by the Beef Plan Movement, their involvement in demonstrations officially ended when talks were established last month.
Protests not affiliated with the Beef Plan have continued, and another group called Independent Farmers of Ireland yesterday published an open letter in which it made a number of demands of the Minister for Agriculture, Bord Bia, and Teagasc."

Speaking on RTÉ radio's Morning Ireland, Mr Healy said Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed ""can't wash his hands out of it "" in relation to the crisis in the beef industry.
""I think the Minister needs to put a lot more pressure on them. It’s sad that it has come to a situation that Meat Industry Ireland needs someone to put that hex on them and to get them back into the talks.
""They should be in the talks, they know how important it is to find a solution, you won't find a solution if you're not at the table and we called on Meat Industry Ireland to get down off their high horse and get back around the table.""
Mr Healy said farmers would not be protesting were it not for the fact that they are being paid a price that is well below the cost of production.
Farmers attended the talks and they will return to the talks, he said, but there was no point in just the farmers being at the table, Meat Industry Ireland needs to be there too with proposals.
The IFA is in constant contact with farmers on the picket lines, he said. ""But they tell us, unless ye have something to come back to us with, we're not leaving where we are.
""And that's why we're so anxious that Meat Industry Ireland (MII), and that the Minister, takes a bigger involvement and that particularly Meat Industry Ireland comes back to the table, gives us proposals that we can go to those farmers with.
""We have guaranteed them (MII) that if they come back to us with adequate proposals, we will go to the farmers on the picket line.
""We will talk to them, we'll talk to the representatives to try and see an end to this,"" he said."

Minister Creed says he's determined to bring the parties back to the negotiation table to find a way forward.
Beef Plan Movement's Dermot O'Brien is confident of a positive outcome.
""We have to commend Minister Creed for having the courage and resource to have a meeting reconvened again this evening,"" said Mr O'Brien.
He added: ""we're pretty hopeful that there will be a positive result.""

All sides in the beef dispute have been invited to the table for talks this evening.
It comes amid fears that up to 8,000 workers could be temporarily laid off at meat factories in the coming weeks.
A second round of discussions to resolve the ongoing beef row were cancelled on Monday after the Meat Industry Ireland pulled out, blaming protests outside meat factories.
It has since announced the protests have forced it to temporarily lay off 3,000 staff at the facilities but they say 5,000 more may follow.
Meat Industry Ireland said these demonstrations by farmers over the price they get for their animals are to blame for the job losses.
There were calls last night from the Irish Farmers Association and Meat Industry Ireland for Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to bring all sides back to the talks table.

Earlier: Your questions answered as the sides meet to resolve the beef dispute
Meetings are due to get underway this evening between the Agriculture Minister, farm organisations and the meat factories in an effort to resolve the ongoing beef dispute.
A series of individual meetings is due to take place between the Minister and all of the key stakeholders.
A second round of talks to break the impasse was cancelled earlier this week when Meat Industry Ireland pulled out.
Today's talks come as a number of farmers have begun a picket at a Tesco Depot in Dublin. Trucks are being delayed from entering the Ballymun distribution centre.
Beef dispute Q&A
Why are farmers protesting the price of cattle now?
A number of factors have led to farmers picketing outside factories and, for the first time today, outside a retail distribution centre.
Brexit uncertainty, and the impact the UK leaving the EU will have on our largest export market is an ongoing concern.
This summer’s EU trade deal with Mercosur - the South American trading block comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - hasn’t helped.
Ultimately, however, this all comes down to the prices farmers are getting for their cattle.
Dr Kevin Hanrahan, Chief Economist with Teagasc, told RTE's News at One that prices are back “significantly” this year, as compared to last year, down some 10% according to the latest Department of Agriculture data.
It also has to be considered that last summer’s heatwave brought with it a fodder crisis - meaning the cost of production for farmers bringing cattle to factories this year was higher.
If production is grinding to a halt, does that mean we’ll have no beef on the shelves?
Not according to Bord Bia, which said exports will be harder hit than the domestic market.
“Currently there is no significant disruption as retailers and their suppliers have put in place plans to deal with the situation. However, in the long term, depending on how events develop, disruption is a possibility,” Bord Bia CEO Tara McCarthy told the Irish Examiner.
“The matter is of serious concern and there is potential for significant business disruption. Apart from the immediate and direct impact being experienced by both beef producers and processors, in many cases our export customers are now having to consider alternative sources of beef. Several of Bord Bia’s promotional activities for Irish beef, including inward customer visits, are also being disrupted,” Ms Mc Carthy said.
That assessment is backed up by Dr Hanrahan.
“90% of our carcass output is exported, so even if we were running at half of our capacity, there would be more than enough meat produced to more than feed the Irish consumers,” Dr Hanrahan said.
“The real risk here is that we lose the export market that has been hard won over the last 30 years, and facing into Brexit and looking at very high barriers to a market that takes half of our beef at the moment, if we were trying to persuade buyers in the rest of Europe to buy the beef that we heretofore shipped to the UK, what's happening now is not a good way to advertise our reliability as a supplier.”
What about staff across the closed factories? How long are they out of work?
It's hard to know. We're in a Catch-22 situation where Meat Industry Ireland - representing the producers - says it won't enter into talks with farmers until the picketing of the factories end. The farmers say they won't stand down until MII members lift legal threats against protestors and come back to the negotiating table."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30950244.html,2019-09-11 22:42:00,Conversion to crops would release the carbon sequestered in grasslands,"By Eamonn Pitts
Many farmers accept that the world is warming, that this warming is potentially disastrous for our grandchildren, that this change has been caused substantially by human actions, and that much of the damaging greenhouse gas generated in Ireland arises on farms.
They are also aware of a growing anti-farmer sentiment, particularly among the young, based on their perception that farming — and in particular livestock farming — is not environmentally friendly. And a growing sector of the population abstains from or substantially reduces their meat and dairy consumption, potentially damaging the growth in markets for our main agricultural products.
Meanwhile, the State faces very substantial fines (though very little is being said in public about these fines) if it fails to meet targets set by the EU for reduction in the greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. When these fines have to be paid, the farming sector could be facing down aggrieved taxpayers.
So it was timely that the ICMSA organised a think-tank last week, at which 70 farmers, scientists, environmentalists and journalists got together to discuss where in particular, the dairy industry should go, faced with climate challenges. The discussion was lively and informative.
How can the farming sector reduce its carbon emissions?
Firstly, what are the targets? Ireland is supposed to reduce its carbon emissions by 2030, in transport, light industry, waste disposal, housing and farming, by 30%, compared with 2005 levels. At present, farming accounts for nearly half of these emissions.
So, reaching the target must involve substantial reduction in measured farm emissions. In 2017, farming emissions were 2% over 2005 levels, rather than heading under.
A Teagasc team, led by Professor Gary Lanigan, has prepared a blueprint on what can be achieved.
There are three avenues:
The farming sector has another serious environmental problem, related to ammonia. It is not a greenhouse gas but is an air and water pollutant, and there is a target to reduce it by 5% compared to 2005 levels.
Animal manures account for 92% of Irish ammonia, and a reduction in ammonia is therefore hardly compatible with an expansion of the dairy and beef herds.
The broader carbon emission strategy advocated by Teagasc team includes:
It was clear in the ICMSA think-tank that, while some of these tasks, such as reducing fertiliser applications, are relatively easy, many of the other actions are extremely difficult.
Increased efficiency (fewer emissions per kg of beef or milk) is already being achieved, through better animal breeding, but is being outweighed by increased dairy cow numbers.
One specific recommendation is to replace urea with protected urea. Yet, think-tank delegates complained that protected urea is unavailable in many areas.
A departmental decree banning the use of simple urea, after a short time frame, would seem to be required. Likewise, farmer think-tank delegates complained about animal feed formulations which lead to higher methane emissions.
Such problems are instantly solvable, unlike increased sequestration or bioenergy. Some farmers at the think-tank said they get the same price now for their milk as they did 30 years ago, forcing them to expand herds and increase fertiliser use, in order to make an adequate living.
They were running hard in order to stand still. Only increased prices from the marketplace would enable them to cut back on production. (However, this argument is contradicted by conventional economic theory, that increased return induces increased output).
A solution, often cited by those outside farming, is to diversify output, by increasing tillage and horticulture. In terms of greenhouse gas production, these activities would start with a negative.
Conversion of grasslands to tillage or horticulture would involve ploughing permanent grassland, releasing into the atmosphere carbon stored (sequestered) in grasslands. There are additional problems in relation to horticulture, in that only a relatively small amount of land is suitable, the market for produce is limited, and there is a shortage of skills in this area.
Forestry and Land Use
We now know that draining the bogs for turf released carbon, and we should ideally reverse this process, to save the taxpayer and the dairy farmer (in the short term), and future generations. Re-wetting bogs is proposed. Can Bord na Móna, which has the land and the engineering skills, reverse its role?
To maintain our dairy herd, significant investments in forestry and in re-wetting bogs are needed. These activities take time to deliver carbon sequestration (up to 20 years).
Meanwhile, annual targets for increasing forestry are not being met. If Irish forestry planting does not increase, forestry will be a net contributor to carbon emissions by 2032, when plantations are being harvested.
Farmers have been reluctant to invest in forestry (even if the returns appear good), due mainly to the requirement that the area must be replanted after harvesting. The “think tank” left everyone with an appreciation of difficult times ahead in meeting targets for greenhouse gas production.
The actions which farmers can take are relatively straightforward, but may not deliver the required targets, without reduction of the dairy or beef herds.
Land use changes which could make a considerable difference, in forestry and bogland, will take a long time, and are unlikely to generate much enthusiasm among farmers without substantial subsidy.
It would seem that Bord na Móna and Coillte, which have in recent decades had a predominantly commercial role, may have to be reorganised and given a substantial environmental remit.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30950256.html,2019-09-11 23:16:00,Sides disagree on day to start talks on beef dispute,"There is disagreement among stakeholders in the beef crisis around when talks aimed at resolving the dispute should resume.
Meat Industry Ireland and the Agriculture Minister are suggesting Monday.
However, farming organisations say they need to begin on Saturday due to the seriousness of the issue.
All parties met with the Agriculture Minister in Dublin earlier this evening.
The Beef Plan Movement, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association (ICSA) and the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) were among those who attended the discussions.
Meat Industry Ireland, who pulled out of talks on Monday, met with the Agriculture Minister Michael Creed independently earlier today.
It comes amid fears more jobs could be lost at meat processing plants around the country.
Yesterday, MII announced that 3,000 workers had been temporarily laid off as a result of what it called the “illegal blockades” by farmers at the factories.
There are fears this morning that a further 5,000 workers could be laid off if the protests continue.
Speaking after this evening's meeting, Beef Plan Movement spokesperson Dermot O'Brien said: ""These are basically talks about talks.
""The Minister has announced retailers are still not going to attend the talks.
""We feel it is very, very important that the retailers attend - they're a key ingredient here for a successful outcome for the farmers in this country.""
The Beef Plan has offered to talk to the farmers – provided the threat of legal action is completely withdrawn.
They insisted farmers are not to blame for job losses, with spokesperson Brendan Barry insisting they could have been avoided if processors engaged in talks to end the dispute.
“There is a lot of money being made from beef sales in Ireland but the farmer, the primary producer, is not getting a fair share,” he said.
“The farmers decided enough is enough and they were prepared to go out on these protests to get a fair share.
“It is regrettable that people are off work now – but that is not the fault of the farmers; that is a decision that Meat Industry Ireland took.
“They should have stayed in the talks on Monday.”
He called on the meat processors to “return to the table as soon as possible and sort these issues out for everyone.”
“These issues are all solvable – it is just a matter of getting round the table and getting them worked out,” he said.
Monday’s talks were cancelled after MII said it would not negotiate with the farmers until the blockades at meat processing plants were lifted.
It said it had “shown good faith” by putting off legal action against the protesters ahead of the talks but insisted it could not enter talks while the protests continued."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-30950224.html,2019-09-12 01:00:00,We can’t continue to sell the soul of rural Ireland for €3.45 per kilo,"The stand-off at the meat factories is not just about beef, it’s about who owns our land.
There is surely nothing more emotive to any Irish person than that question.
When I say it’s about who owns our land, I don’t mean who owns it legally; I mean who gets the benefit from working it.
It is on this question that our land agitation and Land Acts turned. It was on this question, eventually, that our very independence as a nation turned.
Most of us feel emotional about our land and are protective of those who work it. We know on some instinctive level that those who work on the land to produce food deserve to profit from it.
When we hear farmers breaking down outside meat factories because they can’t afford their kids’ school books we get upset.
We know something serious is happening and we want to fix it.
How, though? There is no easy fix.
Emotion won’t fix the price which protesting beef farmers are getting for their animals.
It wasn’t going to re-open the meat factories which the meat processors say were closed by the farmers’ pickets or immediately restore the more than 3,000 meat processors’ jobs which were lost this week, hopefully temporarily.
Emotion only matters if it is followed by action. We need immediate action from Government now.
Of course we need to get the meat processors into talks with the farmers but they do have to have something to talk about.
The hard fact is that when the meat processors say that the price for beef is low because the European market for beef is depressed they have a point.
As a farmer explained to me off the record, the problem is that we have allowed our beef to enter the commodities market where it competes on price with much lower quality beef.
Our precious green fields are used by small farmers to rear their cattle for months and months to produce prime beef which is then minced by the international market and served up in hamburgers.
This “race to the bottom” agricultural policy has been pursued by government after government.
This requires greater inputs in feed and fertiliser until the farmer is ruined and so is the land.
When he gets to the factory gate, the farmer takes the price he’s given: currently as low as €3.45 per kilo.
Yesterday, the Beef Plan Movement was approved as a “producer organisation”, meaning it can negotiate prices on behalf of its members.
But Kieran Delaney from the protesting Independent Farmers of Ireland in Nenagh had earlier reckoned the price would need to be €5 for a profit to be made.
“This is the last chance”, he says of the pickets. “If this doesn’t work out, farming’s gone.”
Meat Industry Ireland wants the pickets stood down before they will negotiate but Delaney says the pickets won’t be removed because if they are the factories will go into hyper-production and the moment will be lost.
Even on a good day for beef farmers, EU subsidies currently comprise all the profit they get. This is a profound insult to farmers and an abuse of the national resource which is our land.
We need a proper land use policy for our country.
Clearly the Common Agricultural Policy should be reformed to reward practices which protect our land, our waterways and store rather than emit carbon. That policy may not be ready for another two years or more, however.
Meanwhile, rather than banging the heads of farmers and processors together, our Government needs to appreciate the depthof the problem facing rural Ireland and aggressively seek new solutions.
The rule which penalises farmers whose animals are brought to slaughter at more than 30 months is punitive and pointless.
When Bord Bia considers beef slaughtered at under 36 months to be “quality assured” and outlets such as Lidl and Supermacs are happy to sell it, why make farmers force-feed and process their beef cattle so fast?
Many argue that it is a unsustainable practice.
The processors say the markets demand it but farmers are not even told precisely where this demand is coming from. National governments can only do so much when it comes to retail which is why it is very important that the EU gets serious about banning the below-cost selling of food.
A motion to do so was passed by the European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee late last year by 38 votes to four in a move described by a spokesman as an attempt to “arm the weakest in the food supply chain to ensure fairness and social rights”.
Too true. Selling food too cheaply destroys farms wages, destroys the land, destroys our respect for food and our healthy relationship with it.
So why are we still waiting for the EU to issue a directive which finally deals with this practice?
When it comes to meat processing, why have competition rules allowed control to be vested in so few hands?
Over 90% of meat processing is done by the three big processors and yet the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has said there is “no evidence of a cartel” and nothing to investigate.
Supermac’s chief executive Pat McDonagh has been out saying processors must be profiting because he is still paying the same price for beef , while the price paid to farmers has gone down. He has called for a guaranteed minimum percentage price for farmers.
The figures do show that the processing industry has a margin of around 0.7% or 1.2%.
If the factories’ economies of scale were not so great they might look for a better margin.
However, one holding company which owns Slaney Meats and Irish Country Meats and which is owned by Larry Goodman’s ABP and Linden Foods from Northern Ireland did post a profit of €3.12m last year.
Gerry Loftus of another new farmers’ group, Ireland’s Future, is calling for farmer-led and owned meat processing.
He is also calling for farmer-owned offal processing, and Larry Goodman’s control of licensed offal rendering and disposal in this country comes up again and again when you talk to picketing farmers.
Says Loftus, who has been the Mayo Chair of the Irish Natura and Hillfarmers’ Association:
It’s time we called this industrialised, business-led model of Irish agriculture what it is, a disaster for Irish farm families.
He is calling for a new, sustainable model of farming which respects farmers and respects the land.
All over Ireland, this call is now being echoed by diverse voices among smaller farmers, smaller food producers and quality retailers.
Anyone who thinks the crisis at the meat factories can be solved with a few spare quid is a fool.
What is being played out here is no less than a battle for the soul of rural Ireland.
If we continue to sell the soul of rural Ireland for €3.45 per kilo our hell will be dead villages,dead towns and dead waterways on dead land."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-30950222.html,2019-09-12 01:00:00,Beef processors need farmers - Common sense must prevail now,"The decision by the Department of Agriculture to designate the Beef Plant Movement, a group of protesting farmers, as as a “producer organisation” is a welcome development in the ongoing beef crisis.
It means that representatives of farmers will be able to negotiate directly with meat factories to determine the price received for cattle.
Ultimately, the development could mean that for the first time farmers, rather than factories, can set the price at which cattle are sold into meat plants.
Whether that is what happens in practice is another matter. Over the past few months, there has been an absence of trust between both sides in the dispute.
Up to now, there has been little more than a war of words between meat plants and those who supply them. On the one hand, farmers groups have taken to barricading processing plants and picketing retailers.
On the other, there has been little sign of restraint shown by the beef processors who have used their deep pockets to bring the law to bear on their behalf by seeking — and being granted — High Court injunctions against the blockaders.
Up to now, the beef processors held all the cards, with enough money to force the farmers into submission.
The meat processors have always been the dominant party when negotiating with farmers which meant that, on the face of it, they should win, but that may have proved to have been a miscalculation.
There are some farmers who are actually losing money in beef cattle because they receive so little reward for their efforts.
Teagasc figures show that profitability starts at around €4.50 a kilo, while many farmers are getting as little as €3.45. That means that efforts by the beef processors to shut them down may have actually helped some farmers stem their losses and stabilise their finances.
As Baltasar Gracián, the 17th-century Spanish Jesuit and philosopher put it: “Never contend with a man who has nothing to lose.”
The beef barons have not just contending with men and women with nothing to lose but also provoking them by using the courts as a cudgel while refusing to negotiate in the face of persistent blockades.
The latest development is welcome for a number of reasons, not least of which is that it could save hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs not just on farms but in the factories.
It is time for the beef processors to realise that they need farmers as much as farmers need them. If beef farmers cannot make a living, neither can the meat industry.
While factories around the country were forced to cease production and lay off workers, we entered into the blame game.
Cormac Healy, senior director of Meat Industry Ireland, said it was not the industry that had forced the closure of factories but the blockades.
That may be the truth, but it is not the whole truth. Farmers have been blockading meat processing plants around the country since late July in protest over the pittance they receive for their cattle.
Hopefully, with this breakthrough, that will no longer be the case. It is now time for common sense to prevail on all sides."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30950269.html,2019-09-12 07:05:00,New hopes of talks to resolve beef crisis,"Hopes for a breakthrough in the ongoing beef crisis have been raised after agriculture minister Micheal Creed met representatives from both sides of the dispute.
Farmers have been blockading meat processing plants around the country since late July in protest at cattle prices. Fears that the beef crisis may become entrenched intensified after Meat Industry Ireland pulled out of planned talks earlier this week.
However, a number of positive developments emerged from talks held at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Dublin yesterday evening.
Describing the talks as “a first significant step towards a resolution”, Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association president, Pat McCormack, confirmed that an agreement had been reached that sets out a mechanism that involves meat processing factories ceasing operation and protestors lifting their pickets.
It is hoped that such a sequence of events can enable meaningful talks aimed at a resolution to begin shortly thereafter.
Mr McCormack said that this process, if delivered upon, should give “the space necessary for parties to engage on the basis of good faith, and deliver a solution to what is now a major problem coming on top of other very serious challenges already facing Irish farming and food production”."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30950327.html,2019-09-12 12:15:00,'I understand the frustration' - Minister hopes beef crisis talks can resume today,"Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has warned that there is a tipping point at which the beef crisis could cause long term damage to the beef industry.
“We need to pull all the threads together,” he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.
Mr Creed said he hopes that talks can resume later today, but he could not say definitively and he did not underestimate the size of the challenge.
The issue is not just about price, he added. “There is a deep sense of frustration. Farmers are feeling mistreated that they are not being given the full picture by the meat industry.
I understand the frustration brought on by lack of income. They feel that they haven’t been taken on board as equal partners in the industry.
The Minister called for structures to be put in place in the industry. If the industry is to prosper then farmers need to be recognised as equal partners in the industry.
“This will require movement on both sides to get there. I want to get to a situation where farm leaders can go to the picket lines and look at the individuals and say ‘now we have a basis to proceed’ with these negotiations.”
“There is a danger of getting to a tipping point that will lead to significant losses to both sides.”
However, Mr Creed said that the Government is not in a position to give contractual security to farmers.
The State doesn’t buy beef and can’t tell what to pay for beef.
No side can afford to not give an inch, he added. The best chance to get back to work is through talks, but this is difficult because of picket lines, court cases and “people acting unilaterally”.
The Minister said he agreed that there should be engagement with retailers and he hoped to make progress in that area."

Mr Creed said the issues that have seen farmers mount pickets at factories and retailers go beyond the price paid for cattle.
“I don't underestimate the challenge of getting these talks back on the rails,” Mr Creed said.
“It's not just about price. There's a kind of a deep sense of frustration, boiling over borne out of years of feeling that they have been mistreated, misunderstood, not given the full picture by the meat industry,” he told Sean O’Rourke on RTÉ Radio 1.

""I think part of the resolution of this will have to recognise that breakdown in relationships and put in place structures into the future, for proper partnership.
""I've commented on this issue before, long before this boiled over, the difficult state of relations and how that has to be addressed if this industry is to thrive and prosper into the future and to recognise that farmers are an equal partner in that business,” he said.
There is also the deep emotional issue. I've had grown men on the verge of tears talking to me about this, they just feel that it's time to make a stand
Mr Creed said while there is an anxiety on both sides to resume talks, the terms to facilitate this to both sides’ satisfaction have yet to be established:
“I want to get to a situation where farm leaders can go to the picket line, and look at their individual farm members, and those who are members of no farm organisation who are there and say, 'listen, now, I think we have the basis on which to proceed into these negotiations, and get an outcome that enables us to move on' because there is a real danger now that we approach a tipping point where there are more significant losses for both sides.""
“I'm very conscious that we export 90% of our beef to international markets and we've had a period of six weeks of difficulties. That begins to have an impact, not just in terms of the media coverage, and the reach of that but also in terms of retail partners,” he said.
Mr Creed said Wednesday’s announcement that the first producers' organisation has received legal recognition is significant: “It's not a silver bullet, it won't address all the issues. It won't, in many respects, buck the market, but it will give certainty and contractual certainty to those farmers who are in these producer organisations when they engage with processors.""
“[At present] when you drive up on any morning of the week with a trailer load of cattle, you take the price that's on offer. What a producer organisation can do is give certainty, some distance out, that if you produce what the factory wants you can see well in advance what price you'll get,” he said."

Tara McCarthy also said that similar arrangements could follow in the UK depending on how long the beef dispute continues. Once the processors followed Bord Bia’s rules and procedures and submitted to occasional audits they could be approved.
Ms McCarthy told RTÉ radio’s News at One that the current crisis is ""a huge challenge,"" but that there is a desire among retailers, processors and consumers that people continue to eat Irish beef.
Speaking at the annual conference in Kilkenny of the Agricultural Science Association, she added: ""Unusually, and it is in a very unique circumstance at the moment, the product that's now on the market has had that further processing happening in the UK, but it’s still following the exact same rules of processing being inspected by Bord Bia,"" Ms McCarthy said of the Aldi stock.
Clearly we would love all of the value all of the time to be captured in Ireland but that’s not possible with the current impasse.
Asked if there was a possibility of Irish shops running out of Irish beef, Ms McCarthy said she did not know.
""I don’t know because I’m not aware, we’ve been talking to the retailers and our customers about their current stocks and to date they’re able to manage within the stocks available to them. It’s a chicken and egg, how long will this crisis go on and when will stocks run out.

The orders were made in favour of C&D Pet Foods, which is located at Edgeworthstown Co Longford by Mr Justice Tony O'Connor during Friday's sitting of the High Court.
The injunctions permanently prevent the defendants, their agents and anyone who has knowledge of the orders from trespassing at or blockading the plant, and from intimidating individuals going to and from the plant.
Patricia Hill Bl for the two named defendants in the case - Fine Gael Cllr Paraic Brady of The Meadows, Drumlish, Co Longford, and Colm Leonard of Aughanoran Dring Co Longford - told the court that the orders could be made on consent.
Brian O'Moore SC for C&D said while the orders were on consent a protest is ongoing outside the plant.
Counsel added that his client will give consideration ""to all options"" available to it, should the need arise.
Earlier this week the company sought orders against protesters, who C&D claimed had for several days physically obstructed the plant's entrance, in support of farmers involved in the on-going dispute with meat processors over the price of beef.
The company claimed that if the blockade wasn't lifted more than 500 workers in the locality faced being laid off and that its business reputation would be severely damaged.
C&D is owned by the ABP Food Group, which is one of Ireland's largest beef processors.
C&D claimed that despite the fact it plays no part in determining prices paid for beef, as it mainly uses pork and chicken in its products, it has been ""tactically targeted by protesters purely on the basis that it is part of the ABP group.""
C&D said it did not wish to halt any peaceful or lawful protest outside the plant, However, the defendants and others have gone beyond a legitimate peaceful protest, it claimed.
It claimed the protesters maintained the blockade by walking in continuous circles around trucks trying to leave or enter the plant.
The protest meant that deliveries had to be cancelled.
The blockade caused major disruption to the firm's business and that only two of its 8 production lines are currently operating. This has resulted in a loss in revenue of €400,000, C&D alleged.
It also alleged that its staff were subjected to threatening and abusive language from the protesters.
A nearby packaging business is also affected by the protest, it was further claimed."

Farming organisations will meet with processors’ representatives Meat Industry Ireland in talks convened by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed, who said an “urgent solution” was required to the dispute over the price paid to farmers for cattle and other conditions.
“Now is the time for people to take a step back from entrenched positions and to take a positive approach towards resolving their differences,” Mr Creed said.
""I expect all sides to recognise the urgency of the current situation, and to enter talks in good faith and with a firm intention to reach agreement.""
MII has agreed to Mr Creed’s request that beef slaughtering operations will remain suspended in blockaded plants during the talks, but said existing limited stocks of beef must be allowed free movement in and out of meat plants: “This is critical to avoiding further loss of domestic and export customers for Irish beef which would be to the long-term detriment of the sector.""
The Irish Farmers’ Association has put the onus on both the Minister and MII to table proposals to appease their members.
IFA president, Joe Healy, said: ""We can’t afford to spend any time on posturing and game playing. We need to get this solved this weekend. IFA has detailed proposals which were put forward by our National Livestock Committee and agreed at our National Council this week.""

However, a spokesperson for Tesco told the Irish Examiner that it “has no plans to process Irish beef in the UK for our customers here in Ireland”.
“We continue to source 100% of our Tesco brand fresh beef from Irish suppliers and this has not changed. All of the Tesco fresh pork, lamb and chicken is 100% Irish. We continue to provide our customers with a wide range of Irish meat products,” the spokesperson said.
Lidl said it is not experiencing any shortage of fresh beef products at present: “We remain committed to our Irish supply base, supporting local farmers and providing Irish consumers with the best quality beef. We are hopeful of a swift resolution to this issue.""
A spokesperson for Musgraves said some prepackaged product has been affected by the reduced supply.
""While supply of some of our prepacked beef ranges has been affected, customers can still buy 100% Irish beef available in-store. We continue to monitor the situation and hope to limit any disruption,"" the spokesperson said."

Meat Industry Ireland has confirmed they are entering the negotiations organised by the Agriculture Minister, Michael Creed.
He says he expects all sides to recognise the urgency of the situation, and to enter talks in good faith.
Beef Plan Movement South West Chairman, Dermot O'Brien says farmers must get a fair price for their beef.

The deal includes&nbsp;an immediate increase in prices for farmers and&nbsp;reform of the Irish beef sector.
Minister for Agriculture&nbsp;Michael Creed said the agreement was reached between meat industry representatives and farm organisations including the Beef Plan Movement.
The agreement involves a number of interventions to provide immediate benefit for beef producers, as well as a range of strategic measures to address structural imbalances in the sector.
The agreed measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers
Farmers have been protesting about the prices they receive for beef since July.
Confirming details of the agreement, Mr Creed said: &ldquo;Beef producers will benefit from an immediate increase in a range of bonuses, including an increase of 66% in the current in-spec bonus for steers and heifers from 12 cent to 20 cent per kilo.&rdquo;
It also include a new bonus of 8 cent per kilo for steers and heifers aged 30 to 36 months.
The minister said a beef market taskforce&nbsp;will be established to develop a pathway for the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.
The taskforce will be independently chaired by an appointee of the minister, and will include department officials, state agencies and nominees from farm organisations and the meat industry.
Mr Creed said the taskforce will provide a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement.
I hope that this agreement will prove to be a first step in fostering stronger partnerships in this critical sector for the Irish economy and for rural Ireland
The government expects the agreement will bring to an end protests outside meat processing factories.
In a statement Mr Creed said: &ldquo;A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain were agreed upon.
&ldquo;For example,&nbsp;an immediate scientific review of the Quality Payment Grid by Teagasc,&nbsp;an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in relation to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector.
&ldquo;The agreed measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.
&ldquo;I wish to thank all participants in this process for their contribution towards agreeing a way forward for the Irish beef sector.
&ldquo;I hope that this agreement will prove to be a first step in fostering stronger partnerships in this critical sector for the Irish economy and for rural Ireland.&rdquo;- Press Association
The Independent Farmers of Ireland group has issued a statement, stressing that the agreement only comes into effect when pickets are stood down from all affected factories.
It says that despite reports the deal is done, that decision can only be taken by protestors at the factory gates.
Earlier: 'Appetite for a deal' as beef talks continue
Talks to find a resolution to the ongoing beef row are continuing at the Department of Agriculture.
The various groups involved in the dispute are considering proposals.
The Irish Food Board is reassuring consumers about the quality and traceability of processed Irish meat.
Bord Bia says it is aware some Irish beef products are currently being processed at plants outside the Republic of Ireland - but says the practice is being carried out within fully traceable guidelines - in order to secure continued supplies.
Meanwhile, sources close to this weekend's ongoing talks in Dublin say there is ""an appetite for a deal"" after seven weeks of protests."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30950962.html,2019-09-16 06:30:00,Faction to stay on beef picket lines,"Farmers will see an immediate increase in the price they receive for their cattle following a deal with meat producers.
After 36 hours of intense negotiations, a tentative deal between farmers and meat processors was agreed yesterday in talks convened by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed.
A cautious welcome has greeted the news of the deal which had followed weeks of bitter protests from farmers at meat factories across the country. Cattle slaughtering at blockaded plants has been halted during the talks.
However, the agreement does not come into place until all blockades have been lifted. Last night, some farmers on the picket lines were refusing to budge, despite the deal.
The deal was struck between Meat Industry Ireland, the beef producer’s representative body; the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA); the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers’ Association (ICMSA); Macra na Feirme; the Beef Plan Movement, and the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.
Under the terms of the deal, beef producers will immediately benefit from increased prices for cattle they sell.
The deal commits to an increase of 66% in the current in-spec bonus for steers and heifers from 12c/kg to 20c/kg.
It also sees the introduction of a new bonus of 8c/kg for steers and heifers aged between 30 to 36 months, which meet all non-age related existing in-spec criteria, and which up to now have not received any bonus.
A number of other bonuses and reforms are also to be introduced.
A new Beef Market Task Force will be established to “provide leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.
The deal also provides for An Bord Bia to develop a beef market price index model based on three components: cattle price index, beef market price index (retail and wholesale) and an offal price indicator, which will be introduced this week.
Commenting on the deal, Mr Creed said: “I wish to thank all participants in this process for their contribution towards agreeing a way forward for the Irish beef sector. I hope that this agreement will prove to be a first step in fostering stronger partnerships in this critical sector for the Irish economy and for Rural Ireland.”
The agreement has been welcomed by various farm organisations.
ICMSA president Pat McCormack said he hoped the taskforce will be a starting point the delivery of adequate margins for the farmer primary-producer.
“The agri-industry and food production has to be refocussed so that the people doing the most work for the longest time get an adequate share of the final retail prices,” he said.
IFA president Joe Healy said “difficult negotiations” had produced a realistic and deliverable agreement which will be recommended by all organisations.
“During a difficult endgame to the talks, the farm organisations stood together to get the best available outcome for farmers,” he said.
“This is far from a perfect deal. While there are some aspects which will make a difference immediately, there are others that will require a lot of further work.”
Mr Healy said the key elements of the agreement include additional bonuses for ‘In spec’ cattle and cattle between 30 and 36 months.
One farming organisation at the talks — the Independent Farmers of Ireland — issued a statement last night to say it never signed off on the agreement.
Farmers outside Dawn Meats in Co Waterford said that, despite the development, they would remain on the picket line. Should that sentiment not change in the coming days, resistance to the deal could grow."

Farmers will see an immediate increase in the price they receive for their cattle following the deal with meat producers, agreed yesterday.
After 36 hours of intense negotiations, a tentative deal between farmers and meat processors was agreed Sunday in talks convened by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed.
However, despite the agreement being reached, the Independent Farmers of Ireland later said they could not “accept or reject these proposals”.
“Despite reports in the media that this document was signed off by all parties, these reports are not true,” said the group.
The three spokespeople have the approval to negotiate but not the power to make the final decision as this is a democratic movement.
Initial reaction from factory gates across the country was not positive, with many farmers expressing disappointment and anger that nothing has been delivered to improve the base price of cattle.The deal was struck between
Meat Industry Ireland, the beef producer’s representative body; the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA); the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers’ Association (ICMSA); Macra na Feirme; the Independent Farmers Organisation of Ireland; the Beef Plan Movement and the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.
Under the deal, beef producers farmers will immediately benefit from increased prices for cattle they sell.
Fianna Fáil agriculture spokesman Charlie McConologue told the Irish Examiner:
I welcome the agreement between farm organisations and MII. It is now important that farm organisations advocate all aspects of the deal to their members and that MII and the Minister for Agriculture ensure that all agreed actions are implemented promptly.
“This agreement needs to be the start of a very necessary rebalancing in the beef supply chain in order to ensure that farmers get fair play and that there is price transparency in our beef sector.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30950966.html,2019-09-16 07:00:00,Farmers losing faith as threats mount,"There has been a collapse in confidence levels among farmers and their families, with Brexit, the bitter beef crisis, and the Government’s depiction of the sector as “the cartoon ‘baddies” of climate change” fuelling growing pessimism.
The Irish Examiner/ICMSA poll found only 32% of respondents those polled were positive about farming in general — down from 66% a year ago.
It is the most significant swing on what has been an annual question in the poll for the past six years.
The finer details in the poll of more than 500 farmers and rural families bears this out: almost half (49%) of farmers are either slightly or very pessimistic about the future of farming, while livestock farmers are particularly negative, with 59% of them citing pessimism.
Brexit uncertainty is a major factor in the wave of negativity washing across the sector in the biggest week of the agricultural calendar.
ICMSA chair Pat McCormack said farmers were under attack on many fronts.
“The fact is that the past year has seen our farming and agri-food sectors completely undermined and under attack from a variety of threats,” he said, adding that the beef sector was “a mess” and would have to be fundamentally redesigned.
“Only the EU can solve this and if the new commission doesn’t carry on the work started by Commissioner [Phil] Hogan, then the breakdown we’re seeing in the beef sector will spread,” he said. “That’s not a threat — it’s just a fact.”
Mr McCormack also referred to what he called “the most astonishing example of government and EU hypocrisy”, the launch of the national climate action plan that he claimed depicted farmers as “the cartoon baddies of climate change”.
“Farmers barely had time to digest the implications of climate change and what it will mean for them when the EU announced that agreement had been reached with the Mercosur Group and that an additional 100,000 tonnes of South American beef would be imported as part of that agreement,” he said.
“Barely weeks after the Mercosur Agreement was signed, huge swathes of the Amazon were on fire as the ranchers interpreted the EU decision as a green light to produce more beef that they think will be exported to the EU. I cannot recall a single more demoralising episode in my years involved in ICMSA.”
Mr McCormack also referred to “the giant black shadow of Brexit” and the recently announced BEAM fund to compensate for losses on animals sales, which then excluded all dairy farmers with herds in excess of 40 cows.
Dr Kevin Hanrahan, head of Teagasc’s Rural Economy and Development Programme, said the collapse in confidence is not surprising.
“This in some sense is responding to the external environment and the commentary about issues. The farm organisations and media have made a big deal about Mercosur. The reality is that no additional beef — no additional beef — has entered the EU as a result of the deal.
The deal has not been politically ratified either on the EU or on the South American side and even if the ratification succeeds — this is likely to take a number of years — any extra beef imports will take a number of years after ratification to materialise.
“All in all, additional EU beef imports as a result of this agreement won’t hit the shelves until the mid to late 2020s. The current low beef prices have little if anything to do with non-EU beef. Because of low prices across the EU, EU beef imports are in fact lower than in 2018.”"

However, Hugh Doyle also warned that he has no control over protests and pickets at processing plants.
He told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that on Sunday “after 44 hours on the go” he had finally gotten to bed thinking he “had something to come back with to farmers.”
On Sunday he drove to Ballyjamesduff to speak to farmers protesting at the processing plant where he explained the plan but it was rejected.
“They said until the base price is raised they won’t budge.
You have no idea of the frustration and sense of abandonment felt by farmers. They (farmers and processors) just don’t understand each other.
Farmers are seeing their livelihoods “going down the toilet” and “they can’t pay their bills,” added Mr Doyle.
“I have no control over that picket, it just started organically.”
He called on all parties to “take a step back” and find some middle ground.
""Fiddling"" with a ticking bomb was not the way to deal with the problem, he said. “This is the time to bring in the experts.”"

Gerard Gough participated in the talks convened by the Minister for Agriculture at the weekend and brought the resultant deal to picketing farmers in Ballyhaunis.
“I could neither accept nor reject the deal,” he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show. His duty was to bring it to the farmers despite efforts to bully us into the corner.”
I said this is the document. On a personal level I think there’s some good points in it. The biggest problem is the fear factor, the distrust towards Meat Industry Ireland.
Mr Gough said he did not understand why Meat Industry Ireland did not come to the table to discuss the issue face-to-face with the farmers.
“Why didn’t they come around the table? What are they afraid of?”
One of the positive aspects of the deal brokered at the weekend was “a little crack” in the 30-36 month rule. “It’s a start. It’s positive, we want to see any little move on the base price.
“We have to see can the factories commit to give a little bit more.”
Farmers are afraid of the base price falling back down to €3.30 to €3.20 with the threat of Brexit.
Farmers feel they can’t trust the factories.
Mr Gough said his personal opinion was that the deal should be studied “a little bit more” and “we can go forward from there"".
“My personal view would be to come off the picket.”"

Cormac Healy also said that irreparable damage is being done to the Irish beef industry and there remains “a big question” about the number of customers who will remain after the dispute.
“This is the wrong position to be in so close to Brexit,” he told RTÉ radio’s News at One.
Mr Healy said there needs to be leadership in the debate. Seven farming organisations were involved in the talks facilitated by the Minister for Agriculture over the weekend.
If people were sent forward as representatives for the protestors, their asks were addressed. We should have expected that everyone would now consider the matter resolved.
Mr Healy acknowledged that some discussions about base prices were ongoing with individual companies, but they were essentially “being blackmailed” by those blockading the gates.
“The meat industry entered the talks in good faith even though the blockade continued. The negotiations went on all weekend. We listened to the asks of the seven farming organisations.
“Agreement was reached on those asks, they were replied to and responded to. The farming organisations left the meeting saying agreement had been reached.”
Mr Healy said that the base price could not be discussed in the context of the discussions as it was determined by the European beef market which continues to be very depressed, he said.
When asked if legal action will be taken by the beef processing companies against protesters, he said: “that’s not where we’re at. Farmers should be allowed process their cattle and not be held up by a few.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30951096.html,2019-09-16 18:35:00,Beef industry may look for Gov supports if blockades continue,"Meat industry representatives say that they may look for Government support if blockades continue to stall beef production at factories across the country.
Meat Industry Ireland, representing producers, has warned that the decline in beef productions is causing “irreparable damage” to Ireland’s export markets, and that State intervention may be sought to make up the shortfall.
The warning follows confusion in the aftermath of talks aimed at resolving the row between farmers and producers over the price of cattle and other criteria.
MII has said that despite its understanding that pickets would be stood down after a deal was struck on Sunday, protests continue outside its members’ factories.
However a spokesperson for the Beef Plan Movement - one of the farmers’ bodies represented at the talks - said the fractured nature of the protests makes it more difficult to bring the demonstrations to an end.
“Unfortunately it’s not as simple as walking up to a picket line and expecting all farmers to desist protesting,” the spokesperson said.
He said that while the Beef Plan Movement had no problem in telling its members to stand down from the picket lines, the various memberships of those involved in the protests required all farmers’ groups to make similar efforts.
Even then, the spokesperson warned, there were protestors not affiliated with any groups - and some may not even be farmers.
“We believe that not all on the pickets may be from the farming community,” the spokesperson said.
The Beef Plan Movement said both the deal struck at the weekend and the legal recognition afforded to its Producer Organisation were positives that would mean farmers are better off now than they were six months ago.
Meat Industry Ireland’s Cormac Healy said processors were being ‘blackmailed’ by protestors.
“This is a blackmailing situation where protesters are illegally blocking the gates and suggesting that they discuss with management when they can reopen,” he told RTÉ’s News at One.
“We are at a juncture where irreparable damage is being done to the customer base for Irish beef, and whenever we do get back processing normal processing activity, there's a big question mark over how many customers will still be there.
“They are moving to, and have moved to, get supply from other markets. When we get back open, if many of these customers are gone, we'll be looking to government to look at market support measures rather than trying to supply those good premium customers that we had.
“Many of those protesting on gates are not actually suppliers of the plants and the individual processing plants have a relationship with their farmer suppliers that are by and large, regular suppliers. There is no question that there's real issues in the sector at the moment driven by a depressed market situation and putting serious pressure on farmers that are producing. That is recognised, but it is driven by the market. Efforts have been made over the weekend by the industry fully engaged in these talks to address some of these issues that have been ongoing and they have been addressed,” he said.
“Farmers should be allowed to be able to process their cattle now and they're being held up by a small few,” Mr Healy said."

The owners of the Meadow Meats Factory in Co Laois say they can't rule out the clousure of the plant because of an ongoing blockade by a small number of protestors.
Staff they say were temporarily laid off last week but the action could become permanent because the blockades have called into question the long term viability of the business"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30951154.html,2019-09-17 06:00:00,More than one-third of farmers struggle to meet household bills,"There has been an increase in the number of farming families struggling to meet domestic bills, according to the latest Irish Examiner/ICMSA opinion poll.
While 26% of farmers agree that their level of farm debt is too high, that is a drop of 8% compared with the findings from last year’s poll.
Dairy farmers in particular, following the abolition of milk quotas, have made more borrowings in recent years as they sought to expand their milking operations.
Conversely, the poll shows a rise in those who struggled to meet household bills in the last year — up 5% to 35% of those questioned.
Tillage farmers, those aged 45-54, and/or those with smaller farms are the more likely to agree they struggled financially in the past year.
In July, the Teagasc National Farm Survey for 2018 showed a 5% rise in overall debt on farms.
However, it also showed two-thirds of farms have no farm-related debt at all and that the level of debt varies considerably by farm type, with six out of 10 dairy farms having borrowings in 2018, compared to only two out of 10 on sheep farms and three out of 10 on cattle and tillage farms.
Kevin Hanrahan, head of Teagasc’s Rural Economy and Development Programme, said debt levels are mainly concentrated on dairy farms.
“I think there are also new players on the farm credit scene — the credit unions — that are now seeking to be providers of credit to farmers, particularly focused on the cash-flow needs of non-dairy farmers,” said Dr Hanrahan.
“There may be a need to for additional credit due to Brexit shocks and farmers should be talking to their credit suppliers about how they will deal with the likely period of lower prices and volatility that is likely coming down the track due to Brexit.”
ICMSA president Pat McCormack said: “Income has improved somewhat for dairy farmers following an extremely expensive 2018 and have fallen considerably for beef in the last year. Inflation is obviously low but the cash-flow in farm families remains a major problem, which is one reason why ICMSA has stressed the need for Basic Payment Scheme, ANC [Areas of Natural Constraint], and Glas payments to be made absolutely on time this year.
“The survey’s findings that farmers appear to be intent on paying down debt might also reflect the more general economic pessimism that pervades most sectors right now — the feeling that things are going to get more challenging and it won’t be pleasant for those with high borrowings.”
He said any discussion of the issues around farm debt and farm borrowings will quickly run up against the astonishing rates that Irish lenders habitually charge over-and-above their continental counterparts.
“ICMSA has repeatedly drawn attention to the difference of between 2% and 2.5% that Irish borrowers pay over the rates charged by, say, German or Dutch institutions lending to similarly secured farming enterprises,” said Mr McCormack.
“The Central Bank seems very comfortable with the astonishingly more expensive rates paid by Irish farmers.”"

Meanwhile, Meat Industry Ireland have said that continuing to lock down the beef industry is not going to put it in a better place.
The majority of farmers want to accept the deal reached at the weekend, according to the group.
Many farmers want to see the base price for animals increased, which isn't allowed under competition rules.
Cormac Healy from MII says processing needs to resume at factories:
""That agreement (made at the weekend) does have significant benefits in it for beef producers,"" he said
""What we need to see now is a resumption of processing so that the thousands of farmers out there that have animals fit for market can actually get processing and selling them again and we see the benefits from them."""

Mr Bryan also pointed out that some non-EU workers in the meat processing plants who have been laid off this week will not be eligible for social welfare payments.
SIPTU is calling on the Government to establish an additional support fund for workers which should be contributed to by employers, he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.
Mr Bryan called on protesting farmers to consider the proposals agreed between farming organisations and the meat industry in talks last weekend.
It is time for cool heads and warm hearts. These are detailed proposals, like all negotiations you don’t always get everything you want.
Workers are “extremely worried”, he said. “I heard the Minister talking about ‘self harm’, this industry is now at risk of self destruction.
“There needs to be calm heads, there needs to be cool heads. Examine the proposals in detail.

Mr Bryan said that continued protests and continued legal action are not going to solve the issue.
Earlier: Michael Creed: 'Self harm' being inflicted on Irish beef industry
Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed
Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has warned that “real self harm” is being inflicted on the Irish beef industry by the ongoing dispute between farmers and processors.
Farmers need to look at the bigger picture he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.
Ireland’s reputation is important in the global beef industry, but the industry is now at tipping point he said. ""We are now witnessing self harm.""
Mr Creed added that there was a need for the sector to re-engage and reassure customers. He acknowledged that the price for beef is depressed, but Ireland is at the European average, he said.
We depend on our reputation. For every day that this goes on it will have a long term impact.
Farmers’ voices have been heard, he said. “This is as much as can be done. We’re at tipping point. I do acknowledge that it is a difficult time for farmers. The global beef market is extremely competitive.
I appeal to farmers, to the silent majority. We are at a critical point. We are now witnessing real self harm to our beef industry.
Mr Creed said it was unfortunate that the bigger picture was that the damage being inflicted on processors will have an even bigger impact on the industry internationally.
Legally there had been nothing that could be done about prices in last weekend’s talks, he said.
On the same programme, the President of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA), Pat McCormack, said the ICMSA had worked with beef farmers involved in protests to try to secure a better deal for them as his organisation has a ""major stake in the game"".
The situation had built up following a decade of low and eroding margins, he said, adding that no business could sustain that. Mr McCormack also said it was important that a frictionless border remains following Brexit.
He warned that costs will escalate if border checks are introduced and the sector would become very uncompetitive.
Meanwhile, IFA president Joe Healy has said concessions cannot be made on the backstop as the UK “cannot be allowed to go off and make trade deals. We need that guarantee.”
It comes as an Irish Examiner/ICMSA opinion poll of farmers and farm families showed nine out of 10 farmers concerned about the impact of the UK’s departure without a deal.
Mr Healy also called on protesting beef farmers to “read the details” of the agreement reached after marathon talks last weekend.
“I believe at this point in time it is the best deal. It is time to read the document and allow processing to take place. There will always be the right to go back to negotiate.
“Let’s get back to normality.”
A strong message had been given to processors during the talks, he said, that there can be no drop in the base price as that could eat up bonuses. He called for more clarity from the Minister for a road map for the future of Irish agriculture.
All of this is happening “in the shadow of Brexit” he warned. No country has as much to lose as Ireland and no sector has as much at stake as farming, he added.

As tens of thousands of people descended on Fenagh for the opening day of this year's event, protests continued at the gates of meat factories around the country amid a continuing impasse over the issue of base price.
Officially opening the Championships the President said he was concerned about the vulnerability of rural producers and suggested the time was right for greater clarity on how the price paid by the consumer for food is divided, stating ""when you know more you can make good decisions"".
""All of our wishes go out to those who want to see a future for the family farm,"" he said.
""And I do wish those who are trying to solve things I wish them every success.
""If it can't be solved by what is on offer, it's a beginning and beginnings are important, but more importantly, I hope at the end of the ploughing you will all know the importance of how in fact the contribution is divided between the agent of production, the farmer, the processor, and the retailer.
""That everybody should know more, and when you know more you can make good decisions. So that is another advantage of the ploughing this year.""
He told the crowd and invited guests, among them the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, that it should not be a case of people ""paying lip service to farming"" and that instead farming and farmers needed to be protected, adding: ""No one is too far from the land.""
He also referred to ""those who do the work, who are entitled to their fair share"".
Later he also referred to ""a person who may have only one purchaser"".
""I have been been concerned about the vulnerability of the rural producer and the person who in fact ... really needs protection, they need transparency, protection and a fair system,"" he said.
""The word 'fair' was there in the campaign for fair rent, so let us know have fair produce, fair treatment for everybody involved and let's move on from that.

""The very best way to do that, maybe what is on offer may not be the perfect resolution, but let's make it the best beginning and go on and build on that.""
President Higgins also referred to the challenges of climate change and the unpredictability of weather, praising those involved in the GLAS scheme, adding: ""The evidence is there that Irish farming is responding to these challenges and Irish farming in cooperation with the others who are responding to climate change and sustainability can do it together.""
He challenged farmers to be at the head of the race regarding sustainability, biodiversity and climate change and stressed the importance of family farming, stating that it was ""keeping a way of life alive"" as well as making a contribution to the public good.
He said people in rural Ireland must enjoy ""equal citizenship"" and that people must be prepared to pay for services in rural Ireland to ensure that can take place.
He also referred to concerns over any threats to the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement and said the Ploughing was a chance for rural and urban to come together and celebrate a shared Irishness."

Kepak’s announcement tonight came as protesters were urged to call off the demonstrations at factory gates that has hit beef production, with claims the ongoing pickets are causing ‘self harm’ to the industry.
In a strongly-worded statement, the company accused protesters of creating ‘chaos’ in the beef industry and that as a result it “regrets to confirm that it has indefinitely postponed a planned and publicly announced, major €6.5m investment at its Clare site in Drumquin as a direct result of the ongoing illegal blockades”.
It said the Clare plant has been the most severely affected by ongoing blockades, with all processing “suspended there effectively since 2 August”.
“Kepak is immensely grateful for the support of its loyal staff, customers and farmer suppliers who have been harshly impacted by the illegal and intimidating behaviour of protesters many of whom are not known as suppliers to Kepak Clare,” the statement read.
“Kepak have now laid off 1,400 people including all staff at Kepak Clare. Kepak is endeavouring to provide our colleagues with every support and assistance during this difficult time.
It is now evident that self-appointed protesters are creating chaos in the Irish beef industry with little regard for its long-term future.
Kepak claimed the weak market prices for beef was an EU-wide challenge that “will not be resolved by illegal blockades of Irish meat processors”.
“The short-term hardship and financial stress imposed on staff and farmers, exacerbated by an overhang of factory ready stock, arising from the illegal blockades, is extreme and indiscriminate,” Kepak said.
“Longer term, more hardship is envisaged as some hard-won EU customers have already switched to sourcing their supply of beef from other countries. Loyal customers are now beginning to question the reliability of the Irish beef sector as a dependable supplier.
“On two occasions, negotiations and agreements have been spurned in favour of intimidation and lawlessness by a cohort with little regard for the havoc being caused. It is critical that blockades are lifted to allow farmers and the industry to resume normal activity before it suffers irreparable damage and losses,” the company said.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney - a former Agriculture Minister - today added his voice to the chorus of pleas to farmers to allow production to resume at plants, and warned that the crisis is now at ‘tipping point’.
The Tánaiste’s intervention echoed earlier remarks from Agriculture Minister Michael Creed, who again asked protesters to consider the deal struck between farming organisations and producers over the weekend.

Screaming teens and big machines at celebration of the sod
By Noel Baker
Lauren Delaney, Loreto Secondary School, Kilkenny, takes a selfie with Love Island winner Greg O’Shea at the Grá Island contest held in the National Dairy Council’s tent. Picture: Robbie Reynolds
Farmers never retire, the ploughing never gets old, but yesterday there was something of a generation gap in Fenagh. Essentially, everyone under the age of 20 uttered these very words: “So, did you see Greg?”
Alright, maybe not everyone, and yes, we did see Greg, that being Greg O’Shea, newly-crowned Love Island champ and a prime example of Irish beef.
He was peering out from under a cloth cap in something called “Grá Island” alongside another star turn, Marty Morrissey. In front of them stood leagues of screaming teens. Maybe this would have happened if The Beatles had visited the ploughing back in the ‘60Sixties.
Elsewhere, the sun shone and there were fewer wellies were on display than usual with the sun beaming down on the 102,500 visitors descending on this part of Co Carlow.
The organisers of the Championships said that this year’s key theme is “sustainability”, primarily in reference to initiatives such as the rollout of drink bottles using 100% recycled PET (plastic). But it is the sustainability of farming — in general, because of issues such as Brexit — and a beef sector currently in the throes of crisis that occupied the minds of many in attendance.
The Irish Examiner/ICMSA annual opinion poll showed Brexit fears uppermost in the minds of farmers, around half of whom would back Government concessions on the border backstop if it helped shore up Irish agriculture.
At a panel discussion in the Brexit Hub, Minister for European Affairs, Helen McEntee, Minister of State in the Department of Housing, Damien English, and Minister of State in the Department of Rural & Community Development, Sean Canney were trying to inject a bit of positivity amid any Brexit blues.
English, en flique in suit and work boots, said many arrangements had already been agreed to ensure life continued after October 31, while McEntee said: “I understand our farmers are in a difficult position at the moment and especially our beef sector. But for us, any kind of concession on the no-deal, essentially it doesn’t protect the sector, it just creates more uncertainty and it just removes any legal certainty that they would have.
“The backstop is there to protect the all-Island economy, but also their markets and Ireland’s ability to access the rest of Europe.”
She said “we have to stand our ground”.
That is also what many protesters are continuing to do outside the gates of meat factories around the country. President Michael D Higgins referred to the crisis in his speech, but while there had been an expectation of some sort of protest here, yesterday was not the day for it.
There is simply too much to do and see across the sprawling site, and as the President said, the ploughing is a chance to rekindle old friendships and create new ones.
There can sometimes be a patronising tone used in relation to farmers and the rural community, a kind of pat-them-on-the head aspect to things, but this is also the one week of the year when the focus of the nation turns back to the sod and the crops and the machinery, the kicking of tyres on equipment, the sight of men tugging on cigarettes like they’re holding a whistle, the occasional novelty cowboy hat with strings attached.
Anna May McHugh, the managing director of the National Ploughing Championships, spoke of cultivating the land as “a passion”.
President Higgins spoke of farming’s legacy and its contribution. The sun shone and the people flooded across this unique campus, another massive day out. We’re back to the subject of Grá Island, and let’s be honest — it’s not a bad place to be.
Plastics ban backing but electric cars enthusiasm stalls

Three-quarters of farmers and farm families would back a ban on single-use plastics to help the environment, but a much smaller percentage are willing to pay higher green taxes or switch to an electric car.
Responses from face-to-face questioning show 75% believe the Government should ban single-use plastics, with 9% opposed.
While that proposal receives strong backing, farmers and their families are less sure when it comes to electric cars or paying higher taxes aimed at cutting harmful emissions.
Just 23% of respondents said they were willing to pay higher levies or taxes to help reduce carbon emissions. Some 58% disagreed, including 39% who strongly disagreed, while around one in five respondents had no view either way.
Similarly, 27% agreed either strongly or slightly that they would consider going electric the next time they change car, compared with 54% who disagreed, including 34% who strongly disagreed. Again, around a fifth of respondents were ambivalent about the issue.
Regarding a ban on single-use plastics, perhaps surprisingly, the lowest level of support was among those in the 35 and under age group (65%); 82% of 55 to 64-year-olds were in favour of a ban.
Those aged under 35 were more likely to consider buying an electric car in future (31%), while support for paying higher taxes or levies to protect the environment was highest among tillage farmers (36%) and lowest among small farmers (18%).
Dr Paul Deane, research fellow at MaREI, the Environmental Research Institute at UCC, said the issue of plastics might have grabbed public attention but transport issues were a bigger concern.
“There is a huge level of awareness around single-use plastics today. This is good but in terms of climate change, it is a much smaller problem for Ireland,” he said.
“Emissions from road transport are far more significant and damaging to our health and environment. One of the main reasons Ireland is not on track to meet emissions targets is the lack of action of sustainable transport. A lot more needs to be done here and raising the carbon tax is one of many unpopular measures required.
Today electric vehicles are more suited to urban areas where infrastructure is better and trips are shorter. EVs typically replace petrol cars and are unlikely to make significant inroads into rural communities in the near term.
“The cost of EVs must come down significantly before sales numbers go up in rural Ireland.”The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) said research carried out at the end of last year showed that 70% of respondents would consider buying an electric car instead of a petrol or diesel car - up from 41% of respondents in the previous year.
“Interestingly this result is paralleled by the doubling in size of the number of electric vehicles sold in Ireland over the last two years,” a SEAI spokesperson said.
“In 2018, 2% of new cars were electric and we estimate in 2019 this number will increase to 5%.“We generally expect higher levels of interest in urban, suburban or commuter belt areas where daily distances travelled are within the typical battery range of an electric car.
""We expect that as the technology continues to rapidly improve, range will increase and electric cars will increasingly become an option for more and more people including rural dwellers.”
Fewer farmers taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

There has been a fall in the number of farmers who say they have implemented measures on their land to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and in the percentage of those who believe farming contributes negatively to climate change.
One in four of those polled said they don’t believe in climate change while 40% said the Government is doing enough to tackle the problem. Just one one third of farmers said they would plant more grant-aided forestry to mitigate the effects of climate change.
The latest Irish Examiner/ICMSA opinion poll of more than 500 rural dwellers found:n 54% said they had implemented measures on their farm to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions which is down around 6% compared with findings in the previous two years.
One in four farmers are still climate-change deniers, a similar percentage to that in the 2018 poll, while 58% said they did believe in climate change, a slight fall compared with the finding from a year ago.
32% said they would plant more grant-aided forestry for climate mitigation, against 40% who said they would not. Half of those strongly disagreed;n 40% believe the Government is doing enough to combat climate change, just 9% strongly agree, while 41% disagree, including 17% who strongly disagree.
The potential effects of climate change have arguably become more marked in recent years with Hurricane Ophelia, Storm Emma and the drought of summer 2018.
Paul Deane of the Environmental Research Institute at UCC said Irish agricultural would need to step up to meet consumer demand for more sustainably-farmed products.
Belief or acceptance in climate change is not a necessary prerequisite for action. Most governments accept climate change to be real but are not doing much about it.
However, consumers are demanding more environmentally sustainable food. In Europe, large co-ops like Arla in Denmark are already planning for low carbon and even zero-carbon milk .
Consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable farmed products and Ireland will have to come on board or risk being left behind,” he said.
Beef crisis: President calls for protection of producers
By Noel Baker

President Michael D Higgins has waded into the beef crisis by telling crowds on the first day of the National Ploughing Championships in Co Carlow that there needed to be more transparency in the price relationship between producers and farmers.
As tens of thousands of people descended on Fenagh for the opening day of this year’s event, protests continued at the gates of meat factories around the country amid a continuing impasse over the issue of base price.
Officially opening the Championships, the President said he was concerned about the vulnerability of rural producers and suggested the time was right for greater clarity on how the price paid by the consumer for food is divided, stating “when you know more you can make good decisions”.
“All our wishes go to those who want to see a future for the family farm,” he said. “And those who are trying to solve things, I wish them every success.
If it can’t be solved by what is on offer, it’s a beginning and beginnings are important, but more importantly, I hope at the end of the ploughing you will all know the importance of how, in fact the contribution is divided between the agent of production, the farmer, the processor, and the retailer.
""That everybody should know more, and when you know more you can make good decisions. So that is another advantage of the ploughing this year.”
He told the crowd and invited guests, among them the Garda Commissioner Drew Harris, that it should not be a case of people “paying lip service to farming” and that instead farming and farmers needed to be protected, adding: “No one is too far from the land”. He also referred to “those who do the work, who are entitled to their fair share”.
Later, he also referred to “a person who may have only one purchaser”.
“I have been concerned about the vulnerability of the rural producer and the person who in fact... really needs protection, they need transparency, protection and a fair system,” he said.
“The word ‘fair’ was there in the campaign for fair rent, so let us now have fair produce, fair treatment for everybody involved and let’s move on from that. The best way to do that, maybe what is on offer may not be the perfect resolution, but let’s make it the best beginning and build.”
President Higgins also referred to the challenges of climate change and the unpredictability of weather, praising those involved in the GLAS scheme, adding: “The evidence is there that Irish farming is responding to these challenges and Irish farming, in cooperation with the others who are responding to climate change and sustainability, can do it.”
He challenged farmers to be at the head of the race regarding sustainability, biodiversity and climate change and stressed the importance of family farming, stating that it was “keeping a way of life alive” as well as making a contribution to the public good. He said people in rural Ireland must enjoy “equal citizenship” and that people must be prepared to pay for services in rural Ireland to ensure that can take place.
He said the Ploughing was a chance for rural and urban people to come together and celebrate a shared Irishness.
Coveney popular, but rating for Ross sinks
By Elaine Loughlin
Tánaiste Simon Coveney is the most popular minister, while Transport Minister Shane Ross scores worst in the approval ratings among farmer-dwelling adults, a new poll has revealed.
The annual Irish Examiner/ICMSA farming survey reveals that the Minister for Foreign Affairs enjoys a clear lead on his Cabinet colleagues with an average approval rating of 5.44 out of 10.
His nearest competition colleague in Government is Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, who scored an average of 4.49.
Both men have seen their approval rating increase in the past year, as has Charlie Flanagan (Justice), Richard Bruton (Communications), and for Michael Ring (Rural Affairs).
While awareness of the jobs Simon Harris (Health) and Michael Creed (Agriculture) do is above average, their satisfaction ratings are below average.
Mr Harris, who has come under continued pressure in the past 12 months due to the trolley crisis, the overspend on the National Children’s Hospital, the CervicalCheck scandal, and rising outpatient waiting lists, was rated 3.69 out of 10, down from 4.32 in 2018.
The Irish Examiner poll also revealed that 90% of farmers are concerned over the impact of Brexit, and many believe they have been left in the dark on plans for a no-deal.
Coupled with this is the ongoing disquiet over beef prices, which has led to months of protests, including some at the National Ploughing Championships in Co Carlow yesterday.
Mr Creed received an overall score of 3.8, but was rated more highly by dairy farmers than by others.
Those in the dairy sector scored the minister for agriculture an average of 4.14 out of 10, compared to an approval rating of 3.65 among livestock farmers.
Transport minister Shane Ross saw a notable decline in his approval rating. He scored worst of all members of the Cabinet and received an average approval rating of just 2.8 out of 10."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/arid-30951367.html,2019-09-18 01:00:00,The future of farming - If our farmers stand alone they will lose,"The 2019 National Ploughing Championships end tomorrow evening. Ireland’s most popular outdoor event, and one of Europe's biggest, it was attended by almost a quarter of a million people last year. It is more than unlikely, hopefully, that the figure fell as dramatically as farmer confidence collapsed in the last year.
This year’s Irish Examiner/ICMSA poll, the sixth, found only 32% of farmers imagined a positive future. That ratio has more than halved in 12 months.
A year ago 66% were optimistic. Two-out-of-three have become one-in-three in what seems an unprecedented crisis of confidence even in an industry as cyclical as farming.
That implosion is a response to the known unknowns, the unknown unknowns too, of Brexit, the Mercosur trade deal, the increasingly bitter conflict between beef producers, processors and large retailers, tightening environmental controls and changing consumer habits.
Each of these issues is significant and should even two or three of them go the wrong way for farmers the sector will indeed face new realities. Even if farm lobbies exaggerate the impact of Mercosur it seems reckless to hope that farming will not be very different in a decade.
Despite that pessimism, a 216-acre farm near Bunclody in Co Wexford sold in four lots for €3.05m last week, almost €1m above the €2.3m guide price.
Even if land prices seem to be driven by sentiment as much as by commercial potential, that figure, that spectacular commitment even at a moment of exceptionally low-interest rates, seems to challenge the poll findings.
That the selling auctioneer said he had had a large number of disappointed under-bidders seeking similar land also runs counter to the poll findings. That there were 1,700 commercial exhibitors, 186 international, at Ballintrane hardly suggests an industry in crisis either.
Responding to the poll, ICMSA chairman Pat McCormack said farmers were under attack on many fronts. “The fact is that the past year has seen our ... sectors completely undermined and under attack,” adding that the beef sector was “a mess” with price-setting power firmly in the hands of retailers.
It may be of little comfort to Mr McCormack and his peers but that is no more than a version of the reality faced by the great majority of workers today. An Irish beef farmer, especially a small one, and a footsoldier worker in one of the Dublin tech campuses are both price takers and have far less leverage than they might expect when negotiating pay. Two wrongs, however, do not make a right.
Farmer pessimism is reflected in a Teagasc viability of farming assessment. It found only 11% of suckler beef farmers as viable, with 46% sustainable, and 43% vulnerable.
Economically viable means income generated can support family labour at the minimum wage, and provide a 5% return on capital held in non-land assets such as machinery or livestock.
That only one-in-10 beef farms are viable is shocking as is the hard fact that the EU income supports are the lifeblood of farming. Without them, collapse looms.
Where once land ownership was a path to a decent income now it is, all too tragically, often a chit attracting a subsidy.
The permanence of those subsidies, and how they might be leveraged to change farm practices and psychology is a pressing question.
The beef dispute showed farmers they have considerable support and that they face the same challenges as many of their fellow citizens.
Maybe that commonality could be a bridge to achieving better outcomes for food producers and everyone else struggling with the absolute power of the market.
That is why farm co-ops were set up over a century ago."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30951424.html,2019-09-18 06:55:00,Farmers risk causing ‘irreversible damage’,"By Fiachra Ó Cionnaith, Noel Baker, and Joe Leogue
The Government has warned protesting beef farmers the future of their industry is “hanging in the balance”, insisting they will cause “irreversible damage” to their families and livelihoods if they refuse to end their stand-off with the State.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and Agriculture Minister Michael Creed warned the sector is now at “tipping point” as they said the Government will be unable to stop the damage caused if it occurs during a potential no deal Brexit.
Speaking as President Michael D Higgins waded into the crisis at the national ploughing championships and as Kepak said it has “indefinitely postponed” a €6.5m beef plant investment due to the protests, the Government said the stand-off must end now.
Opposition Dáil parties said the Government has given farmers a “go with this or get nothing” deal and demanded fresh talks to save the deal from collapse.
However, despite the calls for new negotiations, Mr Coveney, Mr Varadkar, and Mr Creed insisted the deal is the only one on offer and that failing to agree it will cause “irreversible” damage to the economy.
Mr Coveney said: “I can understand farmers’ anger. Many farmers believe they have been blackguarded by factories for many years, they’re angry about that, and prices have been low now for a sustained period of time.
“But we are at a moment that is very close to a tipping point for the Irish beef industry.
“The Taoiseach and I, and others, are working night and day to get an outcome in Brexit that will protect the Irish agri-food industry and beef farmers in particular.
“And, really, I would say the continuation of the boycott effectively on meat factories across the country is, and I think we’re very close to this moment now, is potentially going to do irreversible damage to this sector.
“The people who will suffer the most as a result of that will be farmers and their families. By continuing to boycott factories we risk the loss of contracts, the loss of reputation, and potentially do permanent damage to an industry that has taken decades to build.
I’m saying this as Tánaiste of the country: The continuation of this blockade is going to do things to the beef industry that we as a Government are not going to be able to reverse.
""I would rarely intervene on this unless feel as strongly as I do about it,” he warned.
Speaking in the Dáil as it returned from summer recess yesterday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was equally clear, saying he is “deeply concerned” about the ongoing stand-off and that “anyone who cares about rural Ireland, who cares about employment” is aware the crisis “could do long-term, irrevocable damage”.
His view was repeated last night by Mr Creed, who issued the starkest warning yet by saying: “The future of the industry is now hanging in the balance.”
However, despite the warnings, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald claimed farmers are being told to sign up to a “go with this or get nothing” deal and insisting fresh talks are needed.
During a Dáil debate last night, protesting farmers continued to receive support from opposition TDs, with unaligned Independent TD Denis Naughten saying that “there is a serious lack of trust” in the discussions and Fianna Fáil TD Eugene Murphy saying that the entire stand-off can be “sorted out in 48 hours” if farmers “move a little bit”.
The farming stand-off comes just six weeks out from a potential no-deal Brexit, which risks devastating Ireland’s agri-food economy, and could play a key role in the upcoming general election and by-elections.
It emerged last night the four bye-elections — in Wexford, Cork North Central, Dublin Fingal, and Dublin Mid West — are likely to take place on a single day in the second half of November."

Mr Cummins also warned that even if the dispute was resolved today it could be a month before supply is resumed.
“I appeal to the protestors to sign up to the agreement and let it work its way through,” he said on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.
Restaurants will have to look at alternatives to beef on their menus such as chicken and lamb.
""But if you are a steak restaurant you will be in trouble from next week,"" Mr Cummins said.
“Suppliers have indicated that they will be running out of beef from next week.”
Mr Cummins said his members want to serve beef from the island of Ireland and might have to source beef in Northern Ireland.
We want Irish beef on Irish menus. We are not looking at beef from outside Ireland.
He said it was in the national interest for an agreement to be reached.
“It is time to think about the damage being done to the food industry, to the tourism sector.”
Restaurants are already considering sourcing their beef from butchers (if they have stock), which will cost more and will make margins even tighter, he added.
We are at a critical juncture in the Irish economy. Many restaurants may not be able to afford to buy beef from butchers so it won’t be on the menu.
There is also a fear among restaurant owners about how quickly supply can resume once the dispute ends.
Mr Cummins said it did not make sense for Irish beef to be sent to the UK for processing and then being brought back for sale in Irish supermarkets.
There is huge mistrust between farmers and the meat industry and when consumers see what is happening that mistrust has spread to them too, he said.
Earlier: Restaurants are warning that beef could soon be off the menu.
It is as a result of the ongoing dispute between farmers and factories.
The Restaurants Association of Ireland is warning that if protests at factories don't end soon, some restaurants won't have beef to serve customers.
Some farmers continue to block access to meat processing plants - despite a deal being reached after marathon talks at the weekend.
Beef processors have been forced to temporarily lay off thousands of staff as a result - with 355 workers at ABP foods in Cahir, Tipperary being sent home yesterday.
The Chief Executive of the Restaurants Association Adrian Cummins is concerned that restaurants will have to take beef off their menus if the blockades are not lifted soon - because there will be ""zero supply.""

https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30951546.html,2019-09-18 14:33:00,"Visits by international buyers have been cancelled due to beef dispute, Bord Bia say","The Chief Executive of Bord Bia, Tara McCarthy has said the ongoing beef dispute is damaging the Irish beef market.
Planned visits by international buyers have been cancelled and postponed as a result of the ongoing blockades at meat plants, she told RTÉ radio’s News at One.
Promotional events have also been cancelled because the product is not there, she added.
Bord Bia has been transparent with customers, she said. Customers who have been loyal to Ireland have been told that ""without a doubt"" there is a supply issue.
There is nothing our customers like less than empty shelves, and they are reflecting on their options.
Ms McCarthy said that Bord Bia is aware of some international buyers who have been looking at other options, and that the situation is not good in the long run.
There is a risk that Ireland (and Irish beef) can be substituted, and “we will then have to rebuild the brand.”
Ireland needs to be a ""regular and solid"" supplier of beef, and not ""someone who can't be depended on"".
Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, speaking from the National Ploughing Championships in Carlow, said he had been told by farmers there that the issue will not be resolved under the current circumstances. Farmers who have enjoyed a positive relationship with a processor are not in a position to supply factories because of the blockade.
The situation can only be fixed by round table discussions he said. The Minister acknowledged that price is an issue and competition law is a factor, but current blockades cannot continue to damage the Irish beef export industry, he warned."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30951610.html,2019-09-18 17:56:00,First of beef protest blockades lifted in Meath,"Pressure mounted on protesters to step down from beef factory picket lines across the country, after one such demonstration that had prompted legal threats came to an end.
A blockade at Dawn Meats plant in Slane, Co Meath was lifted this afternoon, just hours after the company issued a legal threat to Hugh Doyle, Chairman of the Beef Plan Movement.
In a letter to Mr Doyle, seen by the Irish Examiner, Arthur Cox solicitors, on behalf of Dawn Meats, had imposed a deadline of 8pm tonight for the lifting of the blockade.
They told Mr Doyle that if the blockade was not lifted by this deadline, they would hold him “personally liable for damages arising from the losses suffered by our client to date and in the future as a result of the conspiracy to which you are a party”.
“While our client’s losses are not fully ascertained, the value of the product currently being prevented from leaving the plant is estimated to be circa. €500,000. Our client’s losses are expected to be far in advance of this figure which excludes loss of sales; our client reserves the right to provide further particulars of loss in due course,” the letter stated.
A spokesperson for Dawn Meats alleged Mr Doyle had told Dawn Meat management that he could have the blockade at their plant in Slane lifted if the company increased the base price being paid for beef, a contravention of the agreement reached by meat processors and farming organisations last weekend.
The blockade was lifted hours in advance of this deadline, and in a statement issued through the Independent Farmers of Ireland the Slane protestors said they had ended their protests “in the best interests of the beef industry”.
The group said it hoped the move was the “first step” in ratifying last weekend's agreement.
“It is hoped that the farmers throughout the country will view this deal through similar eyes as those in Slane and see that although there are areas that are lacking, it is a solid foundation that can lead to positive changes,” the statement read.
“There is much work still to be done but it appears to us that the peaceful pickets have achieved all they can, and it is now time to enter the next stage of this process,” the protesters said.
Dermot O'Brien, spokesman with the Beef Plan Movement was critical of the legal threat issued to Mr Doyle.
“We want the agreement to succeed,” Mr O’Brien told the Today with Sean O’Rourke show on RTÉ Radio 1.
“But unfortunately a fresh legal threat was issued against the Beef Plan Movement and its directors. This is totally and utterly unacceptable. There is no goodwill here being extended by one particular meat processor.
“It is not right. In my opinion, this is a tactic to break up the agreement, because this agreement is a win for farmers all around this country. And we want the agreement to succeed, but maybe others do not. To issue fresh legal threats against the beef plan moment is not the way to go here,” he said.
Meanwhile, a group that claims to represent 7,000 Angus cattle farmers became the latest organisation to call for an end to the protests.
Gerry Smyth Managing Director of Angus Beef Ireland said its members are struggling to make ends meet.
“Their cattle are going over weight and fat, and moving out of specification, which means they will lose the bonuses that are typically paid for these high-quality animals,” Mr Smyth said.
“These protests have gone too far. Hard-won customers for Angus beef may look to other markets if they can’t buy in Ireland, which would do long-term damage to our members.
“No one is denying that times are tough for beef farmers, but these ongoing protests are damaging to everyone. It’s time to find a solution and allow time for the deal agreed over the weekend to try to work,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30951638.html,2019-09-18 19:20:00,"42,337 sheep came south for processing in August","There is very little change overall in the trade for lambs at factories this week, but some fall-off in attendance of factory buyers is reported at marts.
Meanwhile, the latest trade statistics show 42,337 sheep were exported from Northern Ireland for direct slaughter in the south during August, up nearly 10% from August 2018, reflecting an increased supply in the north and a stronger euro-sterling exchange rate.
Quotes of 450-460 cents/kg are offered, mainly at factories not affected by beef farmer protests. But sheep farmers say up to 475 cents/kg is being paid by processors.
There are some reports of lambs moving longer distances from farms to slaughter than usual, to factories not being picketed.
The trade was steady on Monday at marts. There were 400 head at Corrin Mart where butchers’ lambs sold for up to €56 over, with a top price of €112 for a pen of six weighing 56kgs.
A pen of 12 weighing 54 kg sold for €107, and seven weighing 53 kgs sold for €106.
Factory lots sold for up to €43 over. The top price was €87 paid for 17 lambs weighing 44 kgs, but the more general run was around €35 over.
At Kilkenny Mart on Monday, there were 450 head on offer in an unchanged trade. Butchers lambs’ sold for up to €53 over. The top price was €106 which was paid for a pen of 25 lambs weighing 53 kgs. A pen of 24 weighing 52 kgs sold for €102 and a pen of 12 butchers’ lambs weighing 51 kgs sold for €103.
Factory lambs sold for up to €51 over.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30951640.html,2019-09-18 19:25:00,Smaller plants achieved a higher percentage of the normal kill,"While the prices on offer for beef animals at the factories remains unchanged this week, the throughput has been severely curtailed due to the ongoing protest by farmers at the factory gates.
Steer prices continue to be quoted at a base of 345-350 cents/kg.
There are reports that some processors have paid higher prices, in order to get stock delivered, but it is not uniformly available, rather a case of deals being done with individual cattle finishers.
The trend in the trade for heifers at the processors is similar.
The base for the heifers isin a 355-360 cents/kg range, with some lots being paid for at a higher level.
Widespread rejection by protesting farmers of improved bonus payments negotiated over last week-end has plunged the processing sector into a very difficult situation, the resolution of which appears difficult.
Intake at the factories last week dropped to around 11,670 head, of which steers accounted for 5,180 head, and there were around 2,700 heifers.
There was wide variation from a normal kill in the throughput at factories across the country.
The main players appear to have been hardest hit, with very few stock going through some of their plants, while some of the small plants achieved a higher percentage of their normal kill.
The beef cattle supply situation appears to have worsened, rather than improved this week, after farmers rejected the outcome of the marathon week-end negotiations. Some finishers have expressed the view that the payment system was already over-complex, and the additional bonus payments agreed at the week-end has added further complexity to the payment structure.
Farmers’ demands for an improvement in the base price rather than in bonuses have placed both the processors and the farmer representatives who negotiated on their behalf in a most difficult situation.
Meanwhile, a backlog of finished cattle is building up on farms, and some finishers are coming under pressure to get cattle killed, either because they need to lighten the stocking rate on their land, or need the cash flow to meet their commitments.
Quoted prices for both young bulls and cows haven’t changed from recent weeks, with the throughput of these categories remaining very low.
At the end of October, Brexit threatens exports to the UK, which takes just over half of all the beef produced in Ireland. But there was some more encouraging recent news from the UK’s red meat market. Kantar research indicated that in the 12 weeks ended August 11, fresh and frozen primary beef and lamb sales both recorded positive growth year-on-year in England, Scotland and Wales.
Beef sales were up by nearly 5, but a reduced average retail price reduced growth in the consumer spend to 2.4% year-on-year.
Fresh and frozen primary lamb sales increased 8% in both volume and spend, good news for Irish exporters who send about one-quarter of their exports to the UK."

Pressure is mounting on beef farmers across the country to step away from the picket lines across the country after one prominent blockade in Meath came to an end.
A blockade at Dawn Meats plant in Slane, Co Meath was lifted yesterday afternoon, just hours after the company issued a legal threat to Hugh Doyle, chairman of the Beef Plan Movement.
It is understood that protesters are now meeting around the country to decide on whether or not to call off the pickets.
In a letter to Mr Doyle, seen by the Irish Examiner, Arthur Cox solicitors, on behalf of Dawn Meats, had imposed a deadline of 8pm last night for the lifting of the blockade.
They told Mr Doyle that if the blockade was not lifted by this time deadline, they would hold him “personally liable for damages arising from the losses suffered by our client to date and in the future as a result of the conspiracy to which you are a party”.
A spokesperson for Dawn Meats alleged Mr Doyle had told Dawn Meats management that he could have the blockade at the Slane plant lifted if the firm increased the base price being paid for beef — a contravention of the agreement reached by meat processors and farming organisations last weekend.
The blockade was lifted hours in advance of this deadline, and in a statement issued through the Independent Farmers of Ireland, the Slane protestors said they had ended their protests “in the best interests of the beef industry”.
The group said they hoped the move was the “first step” in ratifying last weekend’s agreement.
Meanwhile, a group that claims to represent 7,000 Angus cattle farmers became the latest organisation to call for the protests to an end to .
Gerry Smyth, managing director of Angus Beef Ireland, said their members are struggling to make ends meet.
“Their cattle are going overweight and fat, and moving out of specification, which means they will lose the bonuses that are typically paid for these high-quality animals,” Mr Smyth said.
“These protests have gone too far. Hard-won customers for Angus beef may look to other markets if they can’t buy in Ireland, which would do long-term damage to our members.
“No one is denying that times are tough for beef farmers, but these ongoing protests are damaging to everyone. It’s time to find a solution and allow time for the deal agreed over the weekend to try to work.”
The pressure has been mounting on protesters to call off the pickets after Government ministers warned that the entire future of the beef sector was now at stake, such was the damage being done by the blockades.
Yesterday, Tánaiste Simon Coveney warned that some a number of meat factories could close permanently if the dispute is not resolved soonin the coming days.
“I am really concerned that by continuing a protest and a blockade here, we could see, and in the not-too-distant future — and I mean in days — we could see irreversible damage to the Irish beef sector in terms of loss of contracts, loss of reputation, undermining supply chains in a very fundamental way, at a time when the sector is already under very significant pressure. M ony big fear here is that farm families could be the big losers here.” he said.
Mr Coveney pleaded with protesters to reconsider their position, saying and said there was “a danger here that we could see a number of factories permanently closing.
We’ve already seen a postponement of a very significant investment in terms of an expansion of a factory.
The Tánaiste also called for significant changes and the introduction of a regulator to monitor the beef processing sector.
“It’s the structural changes that we’re looking to try to create in the beef sector that will empower farmers, that will potentially set up a beef regulator to make sure that this industry is regulated with the intensity that’s potentially needed now to make sure that there’s more transparency in terms of pricing, to allow farmers to actually set up a producer group so that they can collectively negotiate price and conditions around supply with with factories in a much more powerful way for farmers.
“These are the these are the things that this deal actually allows for.”"

The decision comes after those picketing outside a Dawn Meats factory in Co Meath ceased their protest yesterday.
The blockade at the plant in Slane was lifted just hours after the company issued a legal threat to Hugh Doyle, chairman of the Beef Plan Movement.
The Irish Farmers Association is encouraging all protests to end in order to ""put the ball back in the factory's court.""
IFA President Joe Healy says progress on last weekend's deal will only be made once factory gates are cleared:
""The outcome of the negotiations has increased bonuses and it has got other commitments that will improve the farmers' lots in the future.
""We have asked members that are on the picket line to step away from it now, see what the factory does around base price, if they reduce it they know what's ahead of them,"" Mr Healy added.
Other farmers that have cattle to sell, need to be able to do so as normal."

A small number of blockades are still taking place outside beef processing plants, however a number of protests were called off overnight.
Speaking at the National Ploughing Championships in Co Carlow, Mr Creed said: ""I would ultimately ask them to step away from the blockades. I think it is time to acknowledge that there is a bigger picture here, there are farmers who want to sell cattle, there's our international reputation.
We export 90% of what we produce and it is important that we are in a position to meet those contracts and to protect our reputation so I would ask those protesting to reflect on the bigger picture.
Mr Creed said the voices of beef farmers have been heard ""loud and clear"" and they have been responded to in the deal that was struck between farm organisations and beef processors.
""I would say to listen to the farm organisations that negotiated on their behalf. In any negotiation there is some compromise, there were things that were beyond our reach in the context of those talks. But I think there are immediate benefits. ""There are structural changes that can be overseen and delivered by the task force. And I would ask them earnestly to consider where we are at now, consider the detail of the agreement,"" the Minister said."

Michael Creed has pleaded with farmers to step away from pickets claiming their voices have now been clearly heard.
While a number of protests have ended, blockades continued outside some meat processing plants with no sign of them ending.
At the National Ploughing Championships in Co Carlow, Mr Creed said it is time to acknowledge that there is ""a bigger picture here"" stressing that farmers want to sell their cattle and our international reputation is also at stake.
""We live or die by international trade, our domestic market is small, so therefore we export - nine out of every 10 cattle that get slaughtered here are exported. The majority of that goes to the UK market where we have built up over many years significant retail contracts.""
He added that there is an oversupply of beef in the European market which is ""competitive"" and ""cutthroat"" as a result.
""There are many who would willingly knock us off the perch that we have in terms of those retail partners and contracts. So that’s the space in terms of the critical issue that we face now in terms of a tipping point in this debate.""
Mr Creed said the voices of beef farmers have been heard ""loud and clear"" and they have been responded to in the deal that was struck between farm organisations and beef processors.
""I would say, to listen to the farm organisations that negotiated on their behalf. In any negotiation there is some compromise, there were things that were beyond our reach in the context of those talks.
""But I think there are immediate benefits. There are structural changes that can be overseen and delivered by the task force. And I would ask them earnestly to consider where we are at now, consider the detail of the agreement,"" the Minister said.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin also asked farmers to end the pickets but said it would not mean an end to the campaign.
""It doesn't mean the end of the crisis. There has to be very, very speedy implementation of the agreement last week and there has to be further measures and there has to be ongoing pressure to make sure that that speedy implementation happens and have a sustainable model for the beef sector and for beef farmers is developed.
I think the government was simply too slow and the minister was too slow in responding to this crisis because it wasn't today or yesterday that this emergency developed.
He said other income streams in addition to beef have to be developed to ensure the future of farming in this country.
""That relates to energy development generation, for example, it's a very poor return for those farmers with solar panels or with anaerobic digestion.
""There has to be a range of income streams in addition to the mainstream income lines,"" Mr Martin said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30951853.html,2019-09-19 19:10:00,Beef blockades at meat factories continuing despite pleas,"Blockades are continuing at meat factories across the country despite pleas from processors and farming bodies for the demonstrations to end to allow beef production to resume.
Liffey Meats said protesters remain outside its three facilities in counties Cavan, Carlow, and Galway.
“We have over 500 employees anxiously waiting to return to work, many of our 10,000 farmer suppliers who want to sell their cattle and over 400 customers throughout Europe and Ireland who are waiting on their delivery of Irish beef,” a spokesperson said.
“These blockades are having a hugely negative impact both locally and in the surrounding communities, and a lot of local businesses and suppliers to our business are suffering as a result,” Liffey Meats said.
Despite a protest standing down from its factory in Slane Co Meath, Dawn Meats had no updates on any of the blockades outside its other plants.
However it rejected social media claims it was negotiating base prices for cattle in a bid to end the demonstrations.
“Hard-working farmers need to be made aware of the fake news and misinformation that the Beef Plan are circulating on social media.
""There can and will be no side deals or negotiations on a base price to end this dispute. This would both be illegal and run contrary to the agreement that was reached in good faith over the weekend,” the company said.
On the issue of base price, Irish Farmers Association President Joe Healy said he hoped increased bonuses agreed as part of last weekend’s deal would not lead to processors ‘manipulating’ the base price to make savings.
“I would now urge the factories to re-open and to come forward with a strong base price. This would help to start the process of building some sort of trust and to get the industry up and running” he said.
In light of the ongoing job losses at factories, Siptu called on the government to make provisions to those laid off as a result of factory closure.
While welcoming the interest-free loans afforded to employees by some processing companies, the trade union said tax exemptions should apply given the circumstances.
“We understand that there may be a tax implication as a result of the loan being seen as a ‘benefit in kind’.
""However, we are calling on the Government and Revenue to waive this in this instance. These loans are being used to cover basic needs and to support workers and their families at this very difficult time,” Siptu organiser Terry Bryan said.
“Siptu members are also asking the Government to make additional funding available to workers on enforced lay-offs who are in difficulty with mounting bills and rent to pay.
""Many workers in the industry are in rented accommodation and, if supports are not made available, it could lead to many of those workers facing homelessness,” he warned."

Why is this, that such an obviously important sector is so politically weak? It’s because they have been so feebly led, by leaders with always an eye to their own future advancement, as presidents of other more lucrative organisations, or as TDs. The IFA should make it a stipulation of their constitution that any top functionary of the organisation would commit to not seeking public office for the 15 years following their presidency. That might thin out the herd, as it were.
Irish beef farmers might then get some real leadership, focused on the farmers rather than on career-making, and we might see them get a fair shake.

ABP has announced the 100 lay-offs at its plant in Cahir, Co Tipperary, which are in addition to the 355 employees who were temporarily laid off earlier this week, as demonstrations continued despite appeals for protesters to stand down.
The company said it has now temporarily laid off 1,463 staff across the country since the prostets began.
ABP said the “regrettable action” of further lay-offs in Cahir “is a direct result of the ongoing illegal blockades at the site by seven protesters”.
The company said blockades have cost local suppliers in the region of €6m, and estimated that €5m a week is being lost to the local economy in wages, cattle payments and fees to third party contractors.
Liffey Meats and Dawn Meats also reported continuing protests outside some of their factories yesterday.
Beef Plan Movement spokesman Dermot O’Brien said it backed the deal struck between farming bodies and processors last weekend, and is encouraging people to come off the pickets to allow production to resume. He said the “multi-denominational” make-up of protesters from various groups made it difficult to bring the protests to a halt.
He urged farmers who are still unhappy at the base price paid for cattle to join BPM’s Producers’ Organisation, which will have the power to collectively negotiate with processors.
Mr O’Brien said BPM is calling for a two-month amnesty on the 30-month rule for cattle, in recognition of the backlog due to the suspension of production."

Mr Varadkar made the claim after another week of beef farmer protests, repeating his view that all farmers should agree to the deal signed off on by most farmers' groups last weekend for the sake of the wider industry.
He said the Government ""appreciates the really hard time the beef farmers have had over the past year"".
The Taoiseach said ""everyone understands the difficulties they are facing"" and that there is a need to ensure farmers receive as much support as possible.
However, noting the fact 90% of Ireland's beef produce is sent abroad for lucrative foreign markets, Mr Varadkar said the major cash cow could disappear if the stand-off continues.
I appreciate, and everyone in Government appreciates, the really hard time the beef farmers have had over the past year, a situation whereby the base price has been less and production is not sustainable.
""Everyone understands the difficulties they are facing and that's why we've put €100m into income supports for farmers over the last couple of weeks.
""But I'm also really worried about the jobs that have been lost in those meat plants, and also about the future of the Irish beef industry, because if those plants don't re-open we know what's going to happen.
""Most of our beef is exported, 90% of it is, and those people around the world will just buy beef from somewhere else. We may never regain that market share. So there's a real risk the ongoing blockades are making a bad situation worse,"" Mr Varadkar said.
Asked about whether the Government is doing enough to help support farmers and end the dispute, the Taoiseach added:
""I think Government's done a lot already, €100m was put on the table to support the income of farmers, and we also have the beef agreement which is supported by the six organisations which represent the vast majority of farmers.
""What needs to happen next is for people to give the agreement the chance to work and in particular the meat industry and the meat factories agreeing to engage with producer organisations, because at the moment beef farmers are price takers."""

www.misters.ie
Once again for this week’s review I was reminded about the quality of Irish meat — and yet it seems the meat processors expect our farmers to produce it at a loss.
Mister S is from the people behind the great value Featherblade Steak restaurant on Dawson St and promises ‘all the good stuff over fire’, they don’t lie.
There is a charming Instagram story on the @mister_s_dublin feed detailing their journey from battered Curtain and Blind shop to welcoming restaurant space.
Do take a look as it is a useful reminder of how much work goes into a restaurant opening, from gutting and rebuilding a space to finding the perfect salvage wood, to designing a grill, to finding the best suppliers.
On this last point I applaud their use of the likes of Sean Hussey Vegetables, Ridgeway Wagyu in Wicklow, Castlemine Lamb and Pork and Michael Twomey butchers in Bandon.
Mister S was only open a few days when we visited and as it is walk-in only at the moment we arrived before 7pm, I advise doing similar as they are going to be mobbed.
I’m told there is an efficient queuing system which allows you to go for a drink and sends a text when your table is ready so don’t despair — I recommend nearby Anseo.
I liked the fit out — a very high ceiling, hanging bulbs, sturdy bench seats, and a relaxing dusky shade of pink all around.
The music is loud and with the high ceilings the sound gets amplified however so I wonder would some softening wall hangings help as you won’t be having relaxing conversations here.
The menu is short with five ‘Nibbles’, six ‘Smoked and Grilled’ Mains, three sides and two desserts.
I suspect as they get comfortable in their surroundings this will increase but if it doesn’t that would be fine with me.
As an Amuse Bouche the kitchen sent out filo pastry filled with rich succulent Beef Rendang (Malaysian Curry) made from burnt ends and a lemony, smoked crème fraiche dip.
Lamb Skewers Three Ways (€8) was a mix of deep fried crumbed lamb sweetbreads, lamb neck and lamb belly — the latter two are the most inexpensive lamb cuts and had fatty elements, but they were made quite magical through the simple addition of smoke and fire.
The Engineer felt the lamb needed more kick but I liked the pure, sweet meaty flavours.
Smoked Chicken (€7) had creamy rich smoky flavours and the classic soft texture you would expect, working well with a nutty Romesco; sweet Barbecued Gambas (€8) sat atop a rather puffy soft flat bread which added welcome texture.
The best of the three mains was undoubtedly the Smoked Angus Shortrib (€17) — a big meaty slab of ever so slowly cooked beef with complex smoky flavours.
Skate (or Ray as it should be called in Dublin) is the perfect fish for fire cooking, here it sat on a creamy punchy Dashi flavoured Beurre Blanc — a steal at €16.
Marinated Tomahawk Pork Chop (€15) showed just how good pork and fire mix, a densely flavoured succulent wonder.
Sides of crispy Miso Roasties and Hispi Cabbage with chunks of fried Sobrasada sausage and Feta were solid accompaniments.
There were two desserts on the night — a ‘Bubble Pudding with Salted Caramel and Banana’ which turned out to be puffy dough topped with ice-cream in a rich caramel sauce, the flavours reminded us (favourably) of a good Bananas Foster.
A Strawberry and Elderflower Almond cake topped with yoghurt was light and refreshing and cleansed the palate nicely after all the protein.
The drinks list includes a cider (Orpens), some beers (incl. 8 Degrees) and around 20 wines sourced from solid importers (eg, Wine Lab and Glug Wines) and prices begin at €28.
Our bottle of Colli Ripani Rosso Piceno (€37) from the Marches was gorgeous — silky, fruity and full flavoured and a good foil for the rich barbecue flavours.
Mister S is a joy, flavour is paramount throughout the menu, cooking is confident and assured and this is a welcoming, charming and exciting addition to a very busy street, one of the best openings of 2019.

Blockades are continuing at meat processing plants around the country as just four of the 20 pickets have been lifted.
Hopes had been raised on Wednesday that a resolution to the standoff might be in sight after the first blockade was lifted from the Dawn Meats plant in Slane, Co Meath. This was followed by the lifting of pickets at ABP in Cahir, Co Tipperary.
Yesterday, pickets at ABP Nenagh in Co Tipperary, and ABP in Rathkeale, Co Limerick were also called off.
However, blockades remain at 15 other plants as ABP announced 100 temporary lay-offs at its plant in Cahir in addition to the 355 employees temporarily laid off earlier this week.
At the ABP plant in Bandon, Co Cork, there were around six protesters at the gates of the facility yesterday morning but numbers the previous night were estimated at as many as 50. There appeared to be little appetite for any standing down of the picket at the factory.
Dawn Meats says upwards of €2.25m worth of finished beef is being “illegally refused exit” from its plant in Charleville, Co Cork, by 10 farmers engaged in a picket.
The facility, which is now in shutdown mode, employs more than 300 staff and exports beef to more than 20 countries. It hasn’t slaughtered in over two weeks.
“Continuing illegal blockades are an act of national sabotage and an affront to the very many genuine farmers seeking to make ends meet at a critically challenging time for the Irish beef industry. International beef customers are completely frustrated that for a second week in a row they will receive no Irish product and have had to source South American beef to meet their requirements,” said a spokesperson.
The agreement reached last weekend between meat processors and a number of farm organisations contained the setting-up of a task force to address difficulties in the beef industry.
The task force is to be chaired independently, with one representative from each farm organisation to attend discussions.
Beef Plan Movement spokesman Dermot O’Brien has called on Agriculture Minister Michael Creed to immediately organise the convening of the Beef Task Force and for “whistle-blowers from within the industry to come forward”.
“Farmers deserve the truth be told. BPM highlighted the importance of President Higgins’ intervention in the beef crisis this week, where he identified the fact the farm families are finding it difficult to remain sustainable,” he said.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned that 90% of Irish beef farmers’ income could be lost due to the ongoing meat factories stand-off, claiming that foreign markets will switch to other producers if the blockades continue.

A blockade at Kepak Athleague in Roscommon is the lastest to be removed and follows similar withdrawals in Cork, Kilkenny and Mayo.
It marks a further de-escalation in tensions after last weekends stakeholder agreement, with the Independent Farmers of Ireland saying it is hopeful further protests will end over the weekend.
Alison De Vere Hunt, who was among the protesters at Cahir, said demonstrators are “hopeful that a process has started to bring about reform”.
“We do not know what the future will hold but you can be assured we will not settle for empty promises and have no reservations in again highlighting our plight if necessary,” she added.
Independent TD Mattie McGrath welcomed the standing down of the protest in Cahir.
“I think the decision by the farmers in Cahir, and indeed their supporters, to step away from the factory gates, will give us all much-needed breathing space to assess and plot a way forward that will enable farmer and factory worker to be protected and that is something I very much welcome,” he said.
Earlier: Farmer pickets were removed from a number of meat plants gates around the country overnight.
Protests at factories in Cork, Kilkenny and Mayo are the lastest to end after last weekend's agreement in the beef price row.
Last night, pickets outside Dawn Charleville, Dawn Grannagh, Dawn Ballyhaunis and Kepak Watergrasshill ended.
The final protesters also left ABP Cahir while Kepak Clones has indicated they are preparing to stand down over the weekend.
In a statement, the Independent Farmers of Ireland said, when added to other protests which have stood down, it is clear the majority have decided the proposal agreed last Sunday provides the best blueprint for the future.
It adds while the proposal is not ideal, it is clear the majority feel it can provide a solid foundation for the future."

Agriculture Minister Michael Creed has welcomed the decision by the final beef blockade to stand down its protest after repeated Government warnings a failure to end the dispute could risk the future of the entire industry.
Despite the Government and five of the six beef farmer organisations agreeing to a new deal on beef prices a week ago, recent days have seen the sector plunged into fresh crisis after a small number of farmers continued their protests.
The situation led to unprecedented warnings by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Agriculture Minister Michael Creed that a failure to end the protests risked the future of the entire industry.
Over the weekend, a number of the remaining protesters stood down their meat factory blockades, with the Beef Plan Movement saying on Saturday protests had ended at Slane, Cahir, Nenagh, Charleville, Watergrasshill, Grannagh, Waterford, Athleague and Ballyhaunis.
And, after those involved in the final blockade also voted to stand down their protests on Sunday night, Agriculture Minister Michael Creed welcomed the breakthrough as a crucial moment in the controversy.
Speaking to the Irish Examiner on Sunday night, a spokesperson for Mr Creed said:
""The Minister extends his thanks to those who assisted in engaging with picket lines throughout the country over the past seven days in an effort to bring about a conclusion to the dispute.
""The establishment of the beef market taskforce is now an immediate priority with a view to implementing in full the beef industry reform agreement."""

It looks like the long-running dispute over cattle prices is reaching a resolution.
The last of the protests by farmers came to an end last night at plants in Ballyjamesduff in County Cavan and Ballinasloe in County Galway.
It is after an agreement was reached between Meat Industry Ireland and farming organisations over a week ago.
""We now expect Meat Industry Ireland to come forward and advise their members to implement the agreement and pay the bonuses with immediate effect,"" said Beef Plan Movement spokesperson, Dermot O'Brien.
Mr O'Brien said that it is a relief that business can resume as normal.
""Farmers can now go to the factories and have their cattle killed so it is all good.""
In a statement, the Independent Farmers of Ireland group says it seems last Sunday's proposal is on the point of being ratified and hopefully this will be the beginning of a new era for the Irish Beef Industry.
It says although there are still many problems that face the sector it feels it can face them from a different position than the picket lines.
It says the newly proposed Taskforce will have the power to oversee all this and the implementation of the proposed solutions are crucial."

And there is also the danger of a no-deal Brexit nuclear option making the factory gate skirmish irrelevant.
In the meantime, there is a huge backlog supply of beef cattle (over 100,000, according to processors) to process, and to store or export.
Exporting it looks challenging, because July statistics indicate there has been a year-on-year reduction of 16% in Irish exports to the UK, which takes 52% of the beef produced in Ireland. That’s a big jump from earlier statistics indicating only a 4% fall in Irish beef export volumes to the UK for the first six months of 2019, albeit with prices also down, by 6% year-on-year.
However, Ireland’s total six-month 2019 beef export volume is believed to have increased by 14%, a welcome move away from over-reliance on the UK market, if the statistics are reliable.
Improved non-UK exports may be linked to the 27% rise in beef import volumes (46% in value terms) to the massive China market, to replace the one-third of their pork production they may have lost to African swine fever.
With Argentina now sending 71% of its beef and sheepmeat exports to China, and Brazil and Uruguay also sending huge amounts, gaps in international markets, including China itself, will hopefully appear for Irish beef exports.
Market analysts believe beef demand from China will remain strong for the next three years. That can help beef processors re-connect with many customers that processors say did without Irish beef during the factory protests, and committed to alternative suppliers, for at least a few weeks.
If processors can get back that business, achieving the transformation promised by the agreement between processors, farmers, and the government, is the next challenge, for all in the industry.
For farmers, that challenge is “sweetened” by an estimated €25 million extra per year in bonuses, for which 70% of all animals processed can qualify.
Hopefully, farmers will give the agreement a chance, even though many of its big promises would take some time to materialise.
For example, a beef market task force will take some time to set up, and to examine alleged anti-competitive practices, and bring about transparency in the industry.
The task force, which will have representatives from all parts of the industry, will also consider the appointment of a regulator for the sector.
It will also take time for the Teagasc State agency to carry out a review of the beef cattle price grid with a view to seeing how it might be changed in the future.
But cattle farmers do not have to sit around and wait for these promised developments to take shape.
The advent of producer organisations gives them a ready route towards better prices for their cattle.
The Beef Plan Movement’s new producer organisation (PO), Irish Beef Producers, has been recognised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.
Government ministers have spelled out how POs could change the industry.
Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said when people control significant numbers of cattle through a PO, they have leverage, they can negotiate price and specification, and they can share risk, and plan with greater certainty.
His predecessor as Agriculture Minister, Simon Coveney, said there is not much point in beef farmers all being individual price-takers selling animals, one by one. “Farmers have the power in their hands if they organise in a way that creates a collective strength.”
He said one cannot have one PO, that would be anti-competitive, but one can certainly have five or six, where there are large numbers of farmers with a professional management team managing the sale of their produce, negotiating directly with factories around conditions and price.
He said empowering farmers to negotiate with a lot more power and weight is a necessary part of restructuring the beef sector in a farmer-friendly way."

They now rank behind Spain, Australia and Chile. French producers are not having it easy at the moment and with the vintage in full swing as I write this, most regions will be down, some over 20% thanks to extreme weather from frost and hailstones at flowering to heatwaves and yet more hail.
Don’t give up on them yet however. France can still compete at every wine price as you will have seen in some of the recent wine sales. The Lidl French Food and Wine promotion is on at the moment with a small clutch of new French wines on offer. I pick out two below but you can also try its Morgon (€12) and Macon Villages (€8.49). There are less new wines this year which is a pity and no fine Bordeaux this time. I must admit to being partial to this sale as I always pick up some sauccisson sec and tarte Alsacienne.
I also picked up some readymade croque monsieur which goes well with a glass of chilled red wine — a classic French experience though without the grumpy barman and the atmosphere of the dive bar.
Wines Direct also has a sale on this month with a 15% discount on over 60 of its French wines to mark the annual French wine harvest. Wines Direct began as a mail-order company but you can also visit it in Mullingar, Co Westmeath, or in its shop in Arnotts on Henry St in Dublin.
Besides the wines I mention below there are a few Bordeaux you should watch for — Petit Courselle red and white (€13.08), Chateau Puy Castera Haut Médoc (now €18.90); and Chateau Calon Montaigne St Émilion (€22.53). If you have a bit more to spend Chateau Sociando Mallet 2014 Haut Médoc is €50.66, down from €58 and if you are feeling very flush the rather legendary Chateau Le Terte Roteboeuf 2010 is down from €413 to €361. The 2011 costs €185.
Finally I’m sure there are some descendants of the Kings of Munster reading this so you will be pleased to know Chateau MacCarthy 2016 is reduced from €34.65 to €30.32. I’ve always liked this classical and always solid St Estephe Cru Bourgeois and the 2016 will keep until at least 2030.
Over €15
Domaine Bergerie l’Hortus, Languedoc,France — €15.66
Stockist: Wines Direct Mullingar and Arnotts, www.winesdirect.ie
Normally around €18 this is a great price for an old favourite. From the commune of Pic St Loup in the Languedoc and a supple blend of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah with blackberry fruits, aromas of spice and lots of dark fruit flavours on the palate but also a pleasing lightness of touch. A perfect Autumnal wine and a fine match for wild mushrooms.
Dauvergne Ranvier Saint Joseph 2017, Rhône,France — €23.95
Stockist: Molloys Liquor Stores Dublin
This is new to Molloys who are always worth a visit if you are passing through Dublin. Made from 100% Syrah on granite soils in the Northern Rhône this is still young so decanting will open up the flavours even more. Bright blackcurrant and tar aromas, developed and full with big dark fruits on the palate, integrated tannins and good length.
Domaine des Terres Dorées ‘Classé’ BeaujolaisBlanc, France — €17.94
Stockist: Wines Direct Arnotts and Mullingar www.winesdirect.ie
Only around 5% of the land in Beaujolais is used for whites but they are worth seeking out. Always 100% Chardonnay and generally with a better price/quality ratio than AOP Bourgogne Blanc. This is reduced from €20.50 and is aromatic and fruit-driven with ripe pear and melon aromas, a mineral core, a textured fruity palate and lingering lemon balm touches.
Under €15
Domaine des Millet Côtes de Gascogne,France — €10.41
Stockist: Wines Direct Arnotts and Mullingar www.winesdirect.ie
Gascony is a great source of fruity-fresh white wines and this is a bit of a steal at this price (reduced by 15% in the French Harvest Sale). A typical blend of Colombard and Ugni Blanc with apple and pear aromas, floral citrus notes and a spanking fresh clean finish. The Millet Rosé is also worth a look as is the tropical tinged Gros Manseng-Sauvignon blend
Les Romances Chinon 2018, Loire,France — €9.99
Stockist: Lidl
Chinon is arguably the best red village of the Loire and usually a little fuller tasting than say Bourgueil or Saumur, although it depends on the producer. This is classic red fruited Cabernet Franc with blackcurrant leaf and raspberry aromas, red berry fruits on the palate with good density and texture. This is still young so probably needs a beef or lamb casserole.
Château Roque le Mayne 2017, Castillon Côtesde Bordeaux, France — €14.99
Stockist: Lidl
Castillon is often a source of good value Bordeaux, given that it is geologically similar to its neighbour to the east, St Émilion. This château has a solid reputation in its class and this will age happily for a couple of years. Bright purple rim, black dark fruit aromas mixed with touches of smoke, textured and young but with reasonably integrated tannins."

Neither did Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
Just hours before Mr Donohoe delivered the budget, Downing St — increasingly shorthand for the zealot Dominic Cummings — leaked details of how the Johnson administration expects Brexit negotiations to collapse later this week. This latest outburst of Silly Bullingdons’ hubris suggested “Varadkar doesn’t want to negotiate… he has gone very cold and in the last week the official channels and the backchannels have also gone cold… Varadkar has also gone back on his commitments.”
As it is always naive and often dangerous to imagine that coincidence is, well, coincidental, at this level of politics, it seems prudent to ask why that leak came when it did. Downing St, and Mr Cummings too, are undoubtedly indifferent to Ireland’s budget plans, and more or less everything else about Ireland too, but it is not indifferent to an opportunity to undermine, to sow doubt among opponents. If you dismiss the coincidence argument, the timing of the leak shows that, despite all of the sunny uplands bluster, Mr Johnson’s administration realises that it is a far tighter corner than it pretends. Options are not abundant, grim outcomes loom.
Appreciating this snowballing implosion’s potential to do harm — he described it as the “most pressing and immediate risk to our economy” — Mr Donohoe detailed a package of more than €1.2bn to try to ameliorate Brexit. Further support is expected from EU coffers should it be necessary. It is hard, as Johnson and his inner circle plot openly against their increasingly supine parliament’s primacy, to imagine that extra funds will not be necessary. Mr Donohoe pointed out that domestic Brexit funds will be “borrowed money. If we do not need it, we will not borrow it. If no deal does not happen, it will not be borrowed for other purposes.”
He said immediate support for the beef sector — €85m on top of a recent €100m — is a priority, as will support for Ireland’s fishing fleet. Beef producers, who recently highlighted their distress by blockading meat processing plants said more is needed.
However, the growing constituency increasingly sceptical about the impact and sustainability of the subsidy-addicted sector will wonder — especially as, hours before Mr Donohoe spoke, the Dutch government said it would compensate farmers who shut down their farms in an bid to control nitrogen emissions.
That constituency may also be concerned that the increase in carbon taxes — just €6 a tonne — is a minimum rather than a plausible deterrent.
However, the new tax based on a vehicle’s nitrogen oxide emissions may well be, eventually at least. It will apply to new cars and used imports from January 1. The move comes alongside higher diesel and petrol prices from midnight because higher carbon taxes will add 2c to a litre of diesel and 1.7c to petrol.
It’s the first, small step in the climate collapse aversion plan that will, in 2030, bring the levy from €20 per tonne of carbon to €80. It is just the first of many such measures.
Health spending will increase by 6.3% to €17.4bn, while 1,000 frontline staff — speech and language, occupational, and disability therapists — will be hired. Hundreds of teachers and special needs assistants will be employed over the coming year, which will push the education budget to a record €11.1bn. An extra 700 gardaí will be recruited. These are positive, overdue developments even if they add, permanently, to the cost of running the State.
However, the inescapable impression, even as an election looms, is the cost of fragmentation, the almost immeasurable cost of Britain’s determination to break from the collegiality that has underpinned EU prosperity for decades. To date, negotiations have been cordial but, as the budget showed, very real damage is a probability. With friends like that…"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30956087.html,2019-10-09 20:51:00,69 acres for sale near Midleton,"The land to the east of Cork city consists of superb gently undulating ground that has supported a rich agricultural industry locally.
Much of it is given over to dairy farming, but there are plenty of pockets where other sectors are active, such as beef farming, equestrian, and even forestry in parts.
A current offering from Midleton-based auctioneers John O’Farrell & Sons features a substantial residential holding located midway between Midleton and Dungourney, a few kilometres north of the N25, where beef vies with dairy farming as the main activity.
The holding in question is a 69-acre property situated in the townland of Glenreagh, approximately 7km from both the market town of Midleton (famous also for its distillery and visitor centre), and the charming village of Dungourney, about 15km east of the M8 Dublin-Cork motorway, and 25km south of Fermoy.
The farm is being offered in two lots. One lot (Lot 2) has 68 acres with a collection of good outbuildings, and the other lot (Lot 1) consists of the house on approximately 1.3 acres of land along with some out-offices.
As selling agent Martin O’Farrell explains, the farm contains plenty of quality, both land and buildings.
“It’s good quality land,” says Martin of the property, which is being sold as an executor sale.
“And it was well farmed by the previous owner, who is now deceased. There were a number of different crops grown there over the years, so it’s suitable for any enterprise. There was corn grown there, grass, beet.
“It has road frontage onto the Dungourney road and onto the Midleton road.”
The dwelling is a single-storey house that was built in the 1950s and which has been kept in reasonably good order ever since.
It is perfectly habitable but it is in need of modernisation.
Accommodation includes three bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen and a sitting room.
At present, all the land is in grass and, as the selling agents point out, silage was last cut off it two months ago. “There are improvements that could be made to the land, but the grass is fine and fresh on it,” points out Martin. “It’s not in need of re-seeding.”
The range of outbuildings constitutes another strong asset of the holding, they are in good structural condition and will be very useful to the next owners. They include a number of sheds and outbuildings as well as a cattle crush.
The property benefits from electricity and water supplies.
There aren’t any entitlements going with it, but it’s a decent-sized property for sale in good heart, in an area where few farms of this size come to the market.
While a number of large holdings have come up in recent times a little farther northeast, into Co Waterford, and a little to the northwest in Co Cork, this particular area has been relatively starved of opportunity to buy large parcels, so there should be some strong interest on the ground.
The price expectation is pitched at a very reasonable €10,000 per acre for the land. The other lot, with the house and a couple of out-offices on 1.27 acres, is expected to fetch in the region of €120,000.
This seems about right for the overall picture, and judging by how well things have been selling in East Cork generally.
What might make a difference in the end, however, is how keen some locally-based clients will be for such a rare chunk of good farmland.
“We’ve good interest in it,” Martin confirms, “for the simple reason that there’s no other land for sale in the area and it’s a good, sound farm in a good location. There’s good local interest in it, and there’s also outside interest.”"

The Taskforce's first meeting had to be abandoned on Monday, after farmers blocked access to the Department of Agriculture.
Some farmers jeered and shoved representatives from Meat Industry Ireland.
They were unhappy the meeting was going ahead while there are still legal actions outstanding against two farmers.
Leo Varadkar says aggression is never the way forward.
""Aggression and violence is never justified and we should never stop people trying to go about their daily work,"" he said.

Situated in the townland of Michellsfort, about 2km south of the village of Watergrasshill, the farmland is in two divisions which are easily accessed and managed.
“It’s easy to get to,” says Maurice Cohalan of the property. “There’s excellent road frontage along its southern boundary.” This road frontage isn’t to the motorway, but to a secondary road which links up to the nearest M8 junction just over 1km away.
“The land quality is typical of the area,” says Maurice, “which is to say level and fertile. It’s in top class condition.”
According to Maurice, the land has been well farmed over the years, and it is currently in a mixture of grass and stubble.
The reaction to the property seems to be strong enough so far. Although there haven’t been any offers, there has been a good level of enquiries and visits to the farm, according to the selling agents.
There is a good mixture of farming activity in this part of the world, where dairying is the dominant sector, closely followed by the arable sector.
There is also plenty of beef cattle farming and a very important number of holdings involved in the equestrian sector, with some local stud farms producing horses that have left their mark in the thoroughbred racing world.
There are entitlements going with the farm (details from agents) and the quoted sale price guide is €595,000.
This puts it at roughly €12,700 per acre.
It’s certainly a reasonable expectation, given the kinds of prices that have been associated with this part of the world in recent years.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30958533.html,2019-10-21 01:00:00,Special Report: Organic farmers are leading the charge to spark a green revolution,"With the UN urging us to change our ways in the face of climate crisis, Joyce Fegan meets producers who say going organic isn’t just good for the environment — it’s also good for their bottom line.
We all need to eat and farmers need to make a living. However, the most recent UN climate report said we must change the way we use land and produce food if we are to save the planet.
The climate crisis is now impacting the ability of land to sustain human life on earth, read the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in August.
It focused on the role of agriculture production and land use and their impact on emissions and rising temperatures.
Written by 107 scientists from 52 different countries, and including 7,000 academic studies on climate change, the evidence is indisputable.
So how we do change our ways? And even before that, is there any will to?
In Ireland, agriculture accounts for a third of our greenhouse (GHG) emissions, yet just 2% of our farmers are organic — a form of farming that emits 40% less GHGs than traditional farming, protects soil health and does not use chemical sprays.
“Our membership is made up of over 1,500 farmers, growers, processors and retailers. In Ireland, 2% of our farmers are land certified organic, that’s lower than the European standard of 6%.
“Irish famers have been slow to convert. In Austria and Sweden about 20% of farmers would be organic,” said Grace Maher from the Irish Organic Association (IOA).
In Budget 2020, it was announced that €12m was being provided for the Organic Farming Scheme, a scheme that is currently closed, but which supported traditional farmers to transition to organic farming.
It was last open for one month in November 2018, when 225 farmers applied for the scheme.
This is despite strong market evidence, that there is growing demand for organic food.
“To meet market demand for organic food and [animal] feed here we’ve had to import. That’s against a backdrop where sales of organic food in Ireland have increased by 34% in the last two years. There are tremendous opportunities there,” said Ms Maher.
The IOA’s role is to certify organic farmers as the term “organic” is legally binding under EU law.
The transition to organic farming has taken Irish farmers approximately two years, during which period they received extra financial support from the State, and reduced support thereafter. In order to be fully certified, a farmer must adhere to certain standards and practices, which the IOA will inspect.
“If you’re farming organic crops this means you don’t use any artificial chemicals, so no pesticides or insecticides. So instead of spraying insecticides, organic farmers use garlic oil to repel flies from carrots for example. Others would use netting,” explained Ms Maher.
“Organic famers would also rotate, so every growing season they move crops around. It’s a different system of production. It leads to healthier soil, healthier plants and animals and healthier humans. The healthier you can make your farming system, the more resilient it is,” she added.
When it comes to animals there are also different standards to adhere to in order to be certified organic.
“For animals, if you’re an organic farmer, this means that no genetically modified feed can be used. You use organic feeds. If you have chickens for examples, your animals need to be free to range — that’s the other major difference. More space is required, so in the winter when you bring cattle inside they have more space,” said Ms Maher.
There are two key benefits to farming organically Ms Maher explained. One is economic, and the other relates to climate change.
“There are several positives for going organic. Economically, there is market demand for organic products and the price has been stable.
In terms of climate change, some farmers come in for economic reasons and then as they do more research they’ll discover that organic farming contributes to the mitigation of climate change.
“Over the long term, organically-farmed soils emit 40% less greenhouse gases than non-organically-farmed soils. It also supports biodiversity in a time when one million species are at threat,” she added.
However, Ms Maher acknowledged that agriculture is a big part of the Irish economy, but said the opportunity is there to grow our organic farming alongside conventional farming, in a way that does not harm the environment.
The Irish Examiner spoke to three large farmers who have all gone organic, noticing not just improvements to their soil and animals, but to their back pocket too.
All three said they would never go back to traditional farming.
It’s not just up to farmers to make positive changes
By Paul Murphy
Cows belching greenhouse gases (GHGs); fertilisers leading to algal blooms in lakes; pesticides affecting insect pollinators — it can sometimes seem like modern farming is incompatible with a healthy environment.
File image.
And yet, our farms are actually an integral part of the environment. As scientists we refer to them as the agro-ecosystem.
These ecosystems are strongly influenced by humans — we like to say that we manage them — but, ultimately, they are ecosystems and an integral part of the wider environment on which we depend. This is all captured in the concept of ecosystem services — provisioning services (eg food, fibre, fuel, clean water), regulating services (eg climate regulation, flood regulation), and cultural services (eg aesthetic value of a landscape, tourism).
Our food production is underpinned by these agroeco systems. Soil is a whole hidden world beneath our feet. And all of the biological and chemical and physical processes that go on in soil underpin global food production.
And, thankfully, there are ways of farming that can improve sustainability. Sustainability is defined as a system that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs — economic, social, and environmental.
But first, back to the problems and challenges — and there is no doubt that many “conventional” farming practices, as have come to dominate across many regions of the world since the green revolution (1950s), face very significant sustainability challenges.
Perhaps most pressing, and challenging, is the impact of agriculture on GHG emissions and climate change. GHG emissions from ruminants (cows, sheep, methane); from nitrogen fertilisers (nitrous oxide); from the ploughing and drainage of soils (carbon dioxide); from deforestation to clear land for agriculture (carbon dioxide and methane) — all tie our food production to GHG emissions and climate change. In Ireland’s case, agriculture accounts for a third of our GHG emissions, placing further pressure on the sector to be part of the solution.
Agriculture has also been a key driver of biodiversity and habitat loss. It is the main suspected cause of pollution in rivers in Ireland. It is the source of most of our ammonia emissions — a threat to air quality.
And, if not practiced well, it can degrade soil quality/health — something that undermines the ability of soil to support agricultural production in the long term. Many of these impacts are, of course, interrelated.
It can be difficult to grasp all of these, sometimes competing, demands. And, remember that, for a farmer, these are only one set among many other demands — the ability to earn a good living (economic sustainability) and support their family and wider community (social sustainability) being, of course, paramount.
But there are things that farmers can do to make farming more sustainable. There are a whole range of existing best management practices; some already included in regulations, such as the Nitrate Regulations, some included in voluntary schemes, others not.
There is not space here to go in to any detail, but the following is a brief, non-exhaustive list:
Reduce N (and other) fertilisers to only optimum levels
Make good use of organic fertilisers (slurries, manures)
Use clover and multispecies grass swards
Rotations and cover crops
Conservation tillage
Organic farming
Integrated pest management
Precision agriculture (use of smart technologies)
Diversification — crops and animals
Manage hedgerows and other non-productive spaces for nature
Constructed wetlands
Agroforestry
Forestry
To give just one example, in the recent DAFM-funded SmartGrass project, we found that there was potential to reduce GHG emissions from fertiliser nitrogen, per tonne of grass grown, by an estimated 90% through the use of grass-clover and multispecies (grass-clover-herb) swards, rather than perennial ryegrass monoculture.
The nitrogen that is biologically fixed by clover in these swards replaces fertiliser nitrogen.
And the good news is that environmental sustainability can go hand-in-hand with economic and social sustainability. In fact, in the recent EPA-funded AgriBenchmark project, we found that the top farmers are both more profitable and generate a lower environmental pressure (in terms of nitrogen).
These farmers were more efficient in their use of nitrogen and so saved on input costs, improving profitability, while also reducing environmental pressures.
But, it’s not just up to farmers. We need a wider conversation among all society around food and how it is produced and consumed. How much are people willing to pay for their food? How much are farmers being paid for what they produce?
This has certainly come to the fore in recent times in the beef sector in Ireland.
Ultimately, if Irish people want the clean water, reduced GHG emissions, habitats for biodiversity, cultural landscapes, etc, are they prepared to pay for those ecosystem services through the price they pay for food or through taxes and farm payment schemes?
The Common Agricultural Policy (Cap), that provides payments to farmers across the EU, is essentially a social contract.
Yet, only a small fraction, over the decades, has gone to encourage more sustainable farming. That is changing (the “greening” of the Cap), but many would argue that it has not gone nearly far enough in that direction, yet.
In Ireland, we have an excellent example of a scheme that is paying farmers to maintain habitats, biodiversity, and a unique cultural landscape, in the Burren Programme in Co Clare, that is providing a template for other schemes.
There can be a bewildering array of information and opinions in this area. Ultimately, I would argue that we should be guided by a fact-based scientific approach with a healthy degree of caution. There are unlikely to be “silver bullets” that will easily solve issues such as methane emissions from cattle, for example.
And yet, we already know many practices and approaches that work and we should be implementing them now.
It was former US president FDR that said: “a nation that destroys its soil destroys itself”.
We have soils in Ireland that have sustained farming for thousands of years by farming more sustainably, they should be able to sustain farming for thousands of more years to come.

Case Study: ‘Cloughjordan operates under an honesty system’
Cloughjordan in Tipperary is the first farm of its kind. Set up 10 years ago, it sells its organic produce to about 80 local families twice a week, who each pay a weekly subscription.
Cloughjordan is a model that could be replicated right around Ireland and further afield. Picture: Eoin Campbell.
It is what’s known as a community subscription farm (CSA).
“We have a full-time farmer, we have about 80 paying adult members, we’re feeding over 100 people per week and we deliver a harvest twice a week that people collect.
We operate under an honesty system. We deliver food to the coach house. We deliver all vegetables up in crates and you take as much as you need, not what you want.
""This happens twice a week, on a Tuesday and Friday and the subscription is €16 per adult per week in a household,” explains Eileen Brannigan from the community farm
And what would a local be likely to find at the coach house that they could use for the lunch and dinners?
“We farm over 80 varieties of vegetables, there is lots of salads and herbs and fruit. We try to create awareness around seasonal food. So at the moment there is a lot of root vegetables so carrots and parsnips, onions and shallots. We’ve developed our own Cloughjordan onion,” says Eileen.
In 2019 so far they have grown a lot of courgettes and peppers, beetroot, kale, curly kale, chard, broccoli, mixed salads like rocket, chives, coriander, sparsely, dill and tomatoes, which were late this year. There is also fruit in the form of blackcurrants, strawberries and raspberries.
There are also lots of apple trees at Cloughjordan.
“We’ve 70,000 trees in the community,” says Eileen.
In terms of how the community farm works, there are eight volunteers and one full-time and paid farmer, whose salary comes from the subscription fees.
Eileen describes the farm as very productive.
“We save a lot of seeds from our plants so we don’t have to buy them in again, and we save seeds from our own best crops too. We’ve salads all year ‘round as our poly tunnels are highly productive, and we do preserving if we have a glut,” says Eileen.
Their overall aim is develop a model for sustainable food production.
They do not use any chemicals or sprays, instead “complementary planting” is used to keep predators at bay. Flowers are planted between crop rows too. They also rotate crops to allow land to recover after its given a lot of its nutrients away.
There is also an oyster mushroom and hen business on the farm, which says Eileen, is one way of helping the resilience of the local economy.
While the farm, on a small scale is feeding a local community, on a larger scale Eileen says that Cloughjordan is a model that they hope can be replicated right around Ireland and further afield.
“It’s very, very evident we can’t keep throwing chemicals on to the land and expect nothing to happen, that’s finite. We need to farm at a smaller level and to feed people well.
“We’re providing a solution to the intensive agri-business model, we don’t deplete our soil, instead we foster the richness of the soil, therefore securing its future production,” says Eileen.
“We promote an ethical and sustainable food model that could be replicated, we’d love to reach more people and see could this be replicated around Ireland.
The farm has already proven its resilience. Last March, when Storm Emma hit, the farm still had access to fresh vegetables because their crop was “remarkably frost resistant”.
While there has always been plenty of interest from abroad, especially from Germany, in this Irish operation, Cloughjordan is getting political interest now.
Eileen sees this as a “tipping point” for the farm after 10 years, however, she does not see enough urgency when it comes to moving towards a more sustainable food model nationally.
Case Study: ‘Organic was the best decision we ever made’
Pippa Hackett runs a 200-acre organic farm with her husband and four children near Geashill in Tullamore.
With everything from beef cattle to chickens and forestry, their farm wasn’t always organic, but with better profit and an improved lifestyle, Pippa says she would never go back to conventional farming.
“We went organic about seven years ago, I personally liked the idea of rearing children on an organic farm, farming with nature and trying to mimic nature
“Financially we’re more profitable, your input costs are lower, you’re not buying fertiliser. People say you will have less output, but we haven’t found that, and we also get a premium for our produce,” said Pippa.
There are other positives to going organic that the farming family has discovered along the way. They have more time together now, and the work system is less reactive. “You’re not under so much pressure — it’s not so reactive. You plan slightly more long-term when you’re organic farming, because you’ve thought further ahead you have plans, it might not matter if weather is particularly bad, we don’t have that sense of urgency.”
In terms of how their organic farm works, they have a mix between forestry and livestock.
“We have suckler cows, which are beef cattle and the mothers rear the calves themselves up until eight months. We have about 200 sheep. About a year ago we diversified into hens, that lay organic eggs, we have a few horses and do some forestry,” she explains.
The idea behind the forestry is to contribute to biodiversity by planting native trees. Transitioning from traditional farming to organic farming is a two-year process, but Pippa said the transition period was not hard for them.
Changes they had to make, in order to get official accreditation, included farming without artificial fertilisers and pesticides, not routinely worming animals (they are now only wormed on a needs’ basis), and any livestock feed has to be from an organic source.
Pippa also explained that the welfare standards for animals is higher when you farm organically. If animals are in during the winter, for example, they must have a straw bed and they are allocated more space in a shed.
When it comes to organic eggs, hens need to have access to an outdoor space as opposed to being in a shed all their life. Confined hens, on a non-organic farm, could have their beaks clipped to stop them from fighting with one another.
Despite the two-year transition process, Pippa said going organic was the best decision she ever made.
We wouldn’t go back, it’s the best decision we ever made, it’s really ignited an enthusiasm for farming and we were losing that. It gave us control and financially we’re more secure. We still have bills to pay but they’re not at the same level as they were, it’s weight off our minds.
“We make savings in time and resources. So we’ve a bit more time to ourselves, and that’s important, quality of life has been a big change for us,” said Pippa.
As well as being an organic farmer, Pippa is a newly elected Green Party councillor for Offaly County Council and the party’s spokesperson for agriculture, food, forestry, heritage and animal welfare.
She believes that farmers are very environmentally aware and that more and more of them are “coming around to the idea” of organic farming. However, only a few farmers will consider changing without a Government scheme in place.
“Hardly any will consider it without a scheme, the scheme is crucial, the scheme was shut from 2015 to 2018, and then only reopened for a month. It’s just about political will. It could also be perceived as undermining the conventional sector.
“I don’t know why it isn’t open, crying shame we don’t have more organic farms when the potential for it is so big in Ireland.”
Pippa believes that with or without State support, or without even being an official organic farm, farmers are currently trying to do things differently.
“A lot of farmers are trying to do it differently, while not officially organic, farmers are experimenting with different grasses. They see the benefits and they different root depths bringing up more nutrients.”
She says the extra income and time that organic farming can provide, needs to be highlighted. “Time is wealth, farmers don’t even factor in their own working hours.”
Case Study: ‘I would never go back to conventional farming’
You might not know organic farmer John McHugh, but chances are his produce feeds you on a daily basis.
From his mixed farm in Portlaoise, with 160 cows, 20 acres of oats, forestry and pigs, he provides milk to Glenisk for their yogurts and milk, and organic oats to Flahavan’s for your morning’s porridge.
While his farm was profitable before he transitioned from traditional farming three years ago, going organic has seen his livelihood become far more resilient. For example, he was not affected by last year’s drought.
“January 1 2016, was the start of my conversion, I knew what I was getting into, I was eager and happy to get going with it. For me, I couldn’t get away from the conventional system quick enough because of things like the environment, the total lack of resilience in the system, climate change, economics and that whole commodity system. It was a huge mix of things,” he explains.
Going organic came after the birth of his first child, something that was a turning point for him. However, before that he had been “quite happy” as a conventional farmer.
“I was quite happy as a conventional farmer, milking 160 cows, I was always profitable and expanded a lot in the years. I never really questioned the sustainability, I never went down the rabbit hole too far.
“I was relatively happy and had belief in the system and that it wasn’t destructive. That derived from not having thought too much about it and trusting others and the establishment —kind of abdicating your power,” explains the father-of-two.
However, his turning point came like a “sledgehammer”.
“It was possibly having children. At the end of 2014, we had our first son, that did trigger a reaction, a change of thought process, and I started looking into organic. It all spiralled pretty quickly and the more I read — all of a sudden all the problems with what I was doing became apparent.
“You can draw a direct line between what I was doing and the environment,” he added.
While he did rely on external means such as vaccines and worming to ensure the health of his animals, going organic means he has taken a more preventative, rather than curative approach.
“Now I put soil first and foremost, everything goes back to the soil. You’re looking at soil health and how everything impacts that. I could see year on year, every time as I was spraying fertiliser I was killing nutrients in the soil, affecting all the beneficial fungi and bacteria in the soil,” said John.
Nowadays, he is “stock lighter”, meaning he has fewer animals. But in order to reduce his livestock, meant he had to diverge from a common human mindset — that of “keeping up with the Joneses”.
“The emphasis was on more output, which doesn’t always mean more profit, I could see this pressure to stock higher for very little reward. It’s very subtly done, it’s filtered through discussion groups — keeping up with the Joneses, that was the mindset,” sais John.
While he was profitable before he went organic, changing how he farms has made his farm more resilient.
“My financial resilience has improved, in a year like last year when there was a drought it didn’t affect me, I mightn’t get the highs, but I’m still profitable,” he said.
However, the biggest win for him comes in the extra time he has on his hands, as well as the benefit to his mental health.
I’ve a young family and it’s a much more relaxed and enjoyable way to farm. This pressure to push things to the limits is gone.
""You were pushing to breakdown and then you lose more time in the breakdown. With organic, you’re not pushing things to the last, your own mental health improves and you’ve a lot more time with a young family,” said John.
The health of his animals has improved too. His livestock is far more resilient, with “zero worming” needed and practically no mastitis treatments. Milk fever, caused by a deficiency in calcium, used to be a “huge thing”, and since he has gone organic he has had only one case of it.
So would he ever go back to conventional farming?
“Even if I was given a life time supply of free fertiliser I wouldn’t go back, that system is going to completely collapse. I want to build up this land and make it more profitable,” answers John.
His answer to fostering more sustainable farming in Ireland lies in the soil.
“The solution is treating soil right,” said John, who added that farmers have gone from “producing food” to “producing commodities”.
“Commodities are to feed an industry, not a people, and when we change that view it’s probably a lot easier than we think to feed the world,” he said.
Case Study: Gap in market led sparked decision to change
Brian O’Regan has identified a huge business opportunity that organic farming can fix.
“About 70% to 80% of all organic feed in Ireland has to be imported,” he says.
Any organic livestock farmer in Ireland needs to feed their animals organic grain. However, the vast majority of it has to be imported. This is where Brian comes in.
Originally a conventional farmer, he went organic after experiencing too many years of not having anything left over after paying the bills. Now that he has been farming organically for more than a decade, he is building a mill to produce organic feed for farmers.
“I’m moving out of farming to an organic feed mill. It is dedicated to producing organic animal feeds. We aim to create organic feed, with as much Irish organic grain as possible. Anyone who sells organic beef or dairy has to feed their livestock organic food,” he says.
His own decision to go organic predates the recession.
I’m organic since 2006 on the farm and I’ve seen the demand for organic increase ever since. All through the recession organic was growing, if you buy organic food and don’t waste it, it is no more expensive than conventional food.
“I went organic after 2005, because I’d no money left after paying the bills. Now I’m on a better price per tonne, and the price more than compensates for the yield loss once you’re fully organic,” he says.
Like many organic farmers he was spurred to change for financial reasons. However, he saw the environmental benefits afterwards.
“I did it from a money point of view at first, now I can see the environmental aspect.
“I would not go back, and I’m glad I did it. With conventional farming their costs have risen exponentially,” he says.
Brian said at the core of the transition from traditional to organic farming is “going back to basics”.
“There are no pesticides or herbicides, it’s more preventative than curative, you’re trying not to cause a problem in the first place,” says Brian, who was farming 10 years before he converted to organic.
He currently farms 50 acres of land in Ballincollig, Co Cork, and his mill will be fully up and running in about a year.
This year he grew winter barley, winter rye and a small bit of winter oats.
At the moment, his day-to-day work involves building the mill, growing his own organic feed and selling it to organic beef and dairy farmers, and buying in Irish organic grown grain or importing it, and distributing here.
However, in order for other farmers to follow in his footsteps, he believes more drive” is needed from a State level.
“I don’t think there is any real drive from the Government side.
“I don’t think there is any drive to organic production, there is a lack of support,” he added."

John Dowling owned a shop in Listowel, Co Kerry, when he was inspired by a chair his wife had had since childhood to try his hand at súgán chair making more than 15 years ago.
Súgán chairs were once a familiar sight all over Ireland and beyond; the wooden frame, made from a variety of woods but most commonly ash or larch, joined with mortice and tenon joints, is held together with a sturdy woven seat of ‘súgán’, the Irish word for straw or hemp rope.
Now, John combines working his 70-acre dairy-beef farm with making súgán chairs in the workshop adjoining his house.
As a young man, he trained as a carpenter and worked in the UK before returning to his family farm.
Rather than being a fully professional craft, súgán chair-making was something many in rural families could turn a hand to in the past, John says, standing in his workshop, where sweet-smelling piles of sawdust lie on the floor and templates for chair frames, tools and balls of twine all lie within easy reach.
“Traditionally, súgán chairs were made by the man of the house,” John says.
“The best timber they could get was often ash. They were often made for children.
“A neighbour who lived across from us made a table and two chairs when he first got married. Then they had nine children, and they raised two more, and as the children came along, he’d make another chair.
“My first introduction to súgán stools was two brothers by the name of Tom and Billy Kitt below in Curraghchase in Co Limerick. I had a public house and I sent down to get súgán stools made and they made them. That was 30 years ago.”
John Dowling, from Listowel, is very familiar with all aspects of wood, including planting, harvesting, milling, and finally carpentry. Picture: Dominick Walsh.
Renowned for their durability, súgán chairs and stools have a unique design feature that helps make them so tough: Because the seat is woven from rope, the weight of someone sitting on it actually pulls the frame of the piece of furniture slightly inwards, strengthening it.
“They’re very structural and strong chairs,” John says. “I’ve seen and been asked to repair chairs that are over 100 years old. People often bring me the chair to replace the weave.”
While the patterns of the weave and the overall design of the chairs has remained virtually unchanged over time, John says there’s one interesting difference between older chairs and the ones he builds today: Chairs in the past were smaller, not because previous generations were shorter, but because people were used to a lower seated position, “with their knees higher than their hips, which is the proper way to sit, by all accounts.”
Today, John is working on a chair for a small child; the first-born of a family he knows. There’s about a day’s work in each chair, he says, reaching fora ball of rope to begin the process of weaving the seat.
Although súgán is often translated as straw rope, in fact, it was often hemp: From at least the 17th century on, records show that hemp was grown in Ireland as a material for making sails and ropes, but growing hemp, which is a close relative of the cannabis plant, was banned by Dangerous Drug Act of 1934, and so the súgán material itself is no longer made in Ireland.
John uses sisal from Brazil, a good hemp-substitute derived from fibres from the agave plant.
“Sisal is a natural fibre too, so there’s not really much difference”, he says as he begins to weave the rope around the seat’s frame.
There are different patterns of weave found in súgán seats, and some were traditionally more common in some regions, he says.
“This is a box weave, and there’s a traditional weave for a kitchen chair, which is narrower at the back. There’s the honeycomb weave as well, that forms a pattern in the middle.”
However, regional differences can be taken with a pinch of salt, he says with a smile.
I make a chair that I call a Kerry chair, but that’s not to say there’s not someone in Co Mayo making the same and calling it a Mayo chair. There’s a lot of trial and error to the craft.
Keeping the craft alive means a lot to John, who has four children ranging in age from 16 to their thirties, and who has recently become a grandfather for the first time. In the kitchen of his house, súgán chairs take pride of place around a sturdy table of larch wood that John also made himself.
He points out one of his fabled Kerry chairs.
“That chair will be there longer than I’ll be around for,” he says.
“The Kitt brothers I was talking about are long dead and gone and it’s like a prayer that I’m still talking about them; I hope somebody will be talking about me in the same manner. It sounds morbid in a way, but I’d like to be remembered this way. I favour everything traditional.”
As well as selling his own work and repairing the chairs that people bring to him, John has given advice to more than 40 secondary school woodwork students who have opted to make a traditional chair.
John Dowling, from Listowel, is very familiar with all aspects of wood, including planting, harvesting, milling, and finally carpentry. Picture: Domnick Walsh.
“I’ve helped Leaving Cert students, sometimes with phone conversations, but some have come out to me and watched me make a chair from start to finish,” he says. “Keeping the knowledge alive is important.”
Despite a recent commission that’s his largest yet, which will see him assemble 40 chairs for a community centre, he’s dubious about whether a revival of the craft could ever see súgán chairs become as popular as they once were, in an economy where mass-produced imported furniture is readily available at a cheap price.
In traditional Irish homesteads, súgán chairs were often reserved for visitors or honoured guests such as story-tellers, he says.
“At one time, they were the most comfortable chair there was; the other option was a wooden seat,” he says.
“Times have moved on; comfort has moved on and people want cushions and foam seats.
People are walking on carpet where they walked on stone flags, or even mud floors, before. I can’t see people going back: Anything that’s really worthwhile takes time to make, but modern life isn’t cut out for it anymore.
So why is it so important to keep the craft alive?
“It’s a part of who we are,” he says. “Our ability to look back in time is being lost. The hardship that people endured mightn’t be passed on, but it made us who we are and it’s very important we remember.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30958950.html,2019-10-22 16:28:00,"Compelling business case sent to Government, as Gas Networks Ireland starts using farm gas","A shot in the arm for the rural economy, including over 3,000 jobs, and a strategic national opportunity; that’s what’s on offer to the Government from an agri-led “green gas” industry, said the Renewable Gas Forum of Ireland this week, which represents some of Ireland’s largest energy users.
The forum includes leading food and pharma companies, for whom this renewable gas is the only viable way to decarbonise.
Research conducted by KPMG for the forum has revealed a compelling business case for establishing an Irish biomethane industry based on agricultural waste.
With 100,000 beef farmers struggling to even break even, not to mind make a profit, farmers are more than ready to play their part in biomethane plans, which Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) says can reduce Ireland’s carbon dioxide emissions by one third.
GNI owns, operates, builds and maintains the natural gas network in Ireland, and is forging ahead with their decarbonisation plans, including renewable gas from farms.
Separately from this week’s Gas Forum of Ireland business case presentation, GNI has presented its plan for a combination of technologies to make its gas network carbon-neutral.
Renewable gas, mostly coming from agriculture, is perhaps the most straightforward of these technologies, with GNI also favouring compressed natural gas, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen.
Renewable gas from agriculture is a proven technology across Europe.
It comes from 600 anaerobic digestion plants (AD) plants in the UK. and nearly 9,000 in Germany.
They are typically operated by farmers and are fuelled by grass, maize, beet, and manure, producing a gas which is 50% methane and 50% carbon dioxide.
According to a European Commission assessment, Ireland has the highest potential in Europe for production of such renewable gases from agriculture.
GNI says 20% of the gas on their network could be from renewable sources by 2030.
Renewable gas was successfully injected into the GNI network for the first time earlier this year.
The biogas came from the anaerobic digester attached to Billy Costello’s 3,000-sow pig farm at Nurney, Co Kildare.
It is fuelled by pig slurry, and 2,000 tonnes of food waste per month, to generate enough biomethane to power 500 homes.
This gas was exported to Northern Ireland until this year, when Ireland’s Commission for the Regulation of Utilities Water and Energy allowed it be used in the south.
Biogas is an established renewable energy source in Northern Ireland, thanks to their feed-in tariff payment for biogas producers.
Similar support and subvention are needed for farm-based AD in the south, says GNI, which suggests the carbon tax collected from natural gas should go towards development of a renewable gas industry. The support would go directly to rural communities where anaerobic digestion plants are operating, and GNI is ready to bring the resulting renewable gas into their network.
GNI has submitted a planning application for a gas injection facility in Mitchelstown to Cork County Council, as part of its GRAZE (Green Renewable Agricultural and Zero Emissions) gas project.
The Mitchelstown facility could support up to 20 farm-based anaerobic digestion biomethane plants within a 50km radius, and once operational, would provide enough energy to heat more than 50,000 homes.
This could be a valuable alternative enterprise for farmers, especially the beef farmers whose livelihood is threatened by this year’s low beef prices.
Already facilitating Ireland’s excellent renewable energy from wind and solar sources, farmers are also ready to deliver anaerobic digestion biomethane, for a reliable natural gas supply needed alongside the intermittent wind and solar sources.
It’s therefore a project that ticks many boxes for the Government’s plans for decarbonisation, and energy from renewable sources."

Clearly the right buttons aren’t being pressed,"I don’t want to frighten or alarm you this week, but I have yet to receive a cent of my Basic Farm Payment or Disadvantaged Payment.

The wait is driving me out of my mind. It’s giving me nightmares far worse than anything conjured up by watching a Halloween movie.
Haunting dreams, the kind where the payment will never arrive, and I will vanish into a hole in the ground.
I’m like your man in the famous Psycho movie, only I don’t own a motel or dress up in my mother’s clothes. I’m howling at the moon, crying out at night for my payments.

I don’t care if it’s done by a phantom or a ghoul.
And I don’t care if it’s pressed on purpose or by mistake. Or in the words of John B Keane, if it’s done ‘accidentally on purpose’.

Well Minister, I’ll need a bypass myself soon if my own allocation of funding isn’t forthcoming. The heart won’t take much more.
And so, with my pockets as empty and dry as Dracula’s old casket, we will head to the marts, where a poor man like me has about as much business in attending as the devil has in going to mass.

“The heifer trade improved today by €20 to €30 in most cases, as a few more farmers were about in this ring.
A bit more activity from the shippers in the bull ring, but these are also quite price-conscious, and they’re back €50 on what they were spending a month ago.
“Runner numbers back today also, as it seems farmers are holding some stock in anticipation of a price rise. Runner heifers made to €660 and bulls to €840.
“In-calf suckler stock made to €1,500. Bulls over 420kgs a tough trade. A small entry of calves meet a serious trade, with an Angus bull 12 days old making €250 and a Charolais calf hit €550.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/arid-30960499.html,2019-10-30 08:00:00,"Next election, whenever it comes, may bring something unsavoury","The House of Commons is again on the edge of a general election, but not Brexit.
A British election will immediately up the ante for an election here, particularly within Fine Gael. Because the budget has been delivered, those pawing the ground will want to be off.
They also see recent polls, and Fianna Fáil’s difficulty last week, as an as-good-as-it-gets moment.
A significant issue of parliamentary procedure will be the finance bill.
Its current timetable won’t see it finished until December 10. That is too late for a pre-Christmas election and it is after the three by elections Fine Gael wants to avoid.
Fianna Fáil, under the confidence-and-supply deal, is signed up to supporting the finance bill but it is under no commensurate obligation to fast-track it and facilitate an early election.
That is especially true when the Taoiseach has already said May is the best time for a poll. An alternative would be to leave the finance bill on the floor of Dáil and call an election anyway.
That is high-stakes stuff. It is especially so when you are trying to bottle indignation about your opponents’ abuse of the Dáil voting system. That’s indignation that I think is real and has damaged Fianna Fáil.
But the problem for Fine Gael is you can’t be both a pillar of parliamentary propriety and pull the House down because you have reviewed your electoral options in light of events.
Holding an election here, on the back of a British one, faces a serious obstacle and ultimately the Taoiseach’s judgement call has to be whether he can sustain his perceived advantage in calling an election through to polling day.
To do that would require, in the tightest of political circumstances, the best election campaign Fine Gael has delivered in a generation.
The horse race, of course, is exciting. Its outcome will determine a lot. What also needs to be considered is what sort of a campaign it will be. Predictions based on past performance are doomed to disappoint.
Over the past few months, some very sober, thoughtful people who are politically well-grounded in their community have warned me that something fundamentally nasty is afoot.
They are deeply concerned the next election will be the first where outright racism and xenophobia will play a part. It has always been there, just beneath the surface, but something has changed.
My concern is that we are about to feel the difference and that will be bad for our country and deeply hurtful to those who have come to make their lives here with us.
When stuff is forced up out of the shores, it doesn’t follow any ordered route. Everything down there comes out.
There has been a great discombobulation in Ireland. Some, like me, find it exciting. I enjoy working for myself. The sort of job security I once clinged on to seems limiting now.
But I live in Dublin. I am older than those who, almost en masse, can’t get on the property ladder. I can find different types of work, that makes for very interesting variation. Essentially there are those of wildly differing income levels who are being carried forward in a new economy and enjoying the ride.
Others are insecure. They are paying exorbitant rent. They are destined to be pension poor.
For yet others, who aren’t actually doing so badly at all, it is the relativities of lost status as others overtake them that makes them sore. Whatever the canker gnawing at you, there is a sense if you stand still, shut up, and listen carefully of a dislocation that is extensive, life is not turning out as expected.
Some of this feeling is expended by people just putting their head down and trying harder. Others are part of an apparently permanently larger, if deeply fragmented, left.
But for some others, there is a need and seemingly permission to vent hate at people of different nationalities and colour.
We can no long look at Trump’s America and say that is not us. It is now. I hope I am not naive in saying I think it is still limited, but I fear it is not nearly as confined as I hoped.
Something has broken out. It is no longer said only under the breath. It is now abroad.
It is a paradox that those who are most afflicted with discontent, either personally or politically, should sometimes choose to tighten the circle further and make things more claustrophobic.
There were glimpses of some of this on the picket lines during the beef dispute. The issues were different, but feral anger is always transferable.
There was a breaking of the norms of civil protest and of neighbourliness. All the while social media, amoral platforms for everything, provide both a means of organisation and a megaphone for hate.
My concern is that one of the marks of the next election will be an open demand from some for representation for views and attitudes thither to beyond the pale.
I have no concerns about the major parties though perhaps some of them should have concerns about local candidates speaking out of the side of their mouths.
But where there is an opportunity for electoral gain, we should be very alive to the fear of it being availed of.
Sinn Féin’s Martin Kenny took a stance, and paid a price.
As someone who has lived in Dublin’s north inner city for nearly 30 years, where Sinn Féin has had a strong presence for all of that time, I can say that Kenny’s stance is consistent with his party’s over a long time.
What strikes me about the makeup of those who would want Ireland for the Irish is not that they are the poorest or the least educated. No, they are the most bitter. Their displacement can’t be explained simply by either politics or economics.
They carry something else within them.
That need to other and marginalise is in us all. It is a contagion that requires constant, always-on self-examination. It will come to the fore, I fear, in the next election. Solidarity will be required.
Regardless of party, or politics, anyone who has put their spoon into that soup must be ostracised on the ballot paper. Small votes seem insignificant on big days.
But they are extant afterwards as a mandate and justification. They shift contours and change the conversation.
In the intensity of speculation about what election will be when, we might think about what our election will ultimately be for. The choice of parties and politicians to govern will be one choice.
The content of the public conversation will be another."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30961268.html,2019-11-01 18:10:00,Q&A: Is Government the culprit as EU farmers rise up?,"Major protests by Dutch farmers have come as a shock, in one of the EU’s most successful agri-food industries. Exports from Dutch farms and agri-businesses totalled €90.3bn last year.
Twice this month, thousands of Dutch farmers drove their tractors into The Hague, their capital city, causing the country’s worst-ever traffic jams.
Farmer unrest in the EU may be spreading, with Ireland’s beef factory protests and Dutch tractors jams followed this month by hundreds of farmers from Germany and France parking their tractors at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, protests in more than 17 German cities, and thousands of farmers in France protesting in each region and department.
The likely source of the Dutch farmer protests is the country’s council of state clamping down on nitrogen pollution from combustion engines and from fertiliser and animal waste on farms.
But farmers throughout Europe are also rising up against what they see as climate “hysteria”; bans on glyphosate weedkiller (by 2023) and restriction of fertilisers; EU free trade plans (Mercosur or CETA); the $7.5bn of US tariffs on European food imports; supermarkets squeezing prices paid to farmers; and weakening of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, which hasn’t guaranteed farm produce prices since the 1990s, and which is likely to have a 5% smaller budget after Brexit.
In the Netherlands, the 11% reduction of dairy cows in 2017 and 2018, forced by the EU due to runaway phosphate pollution, was also a big shock.
An interesting analysis of the Dutch farmer protests has emerged from the country’s Wageningen University & Research, highly rated internationally for its work on food and food production.
Here is what public policy expert Jeroen Candel, assistant professor in the university’s public administration and policy group, said, when interviewed for the university’s Resource magazine.
What do you mean when you say the agriculture crisis is a classic example of government failure?
For several decades now, the government’s actions have been typified by a lack of any vision about where agriculture should be heading.
The current agricultural system in the Netherlands clearly has problems in various areas. There are issues with nitrogen, the contribution to climate change, zoonoses, food safety and so on. We’ve known that for a long while.
Yet, there’s no answer to the question of what we should be doing next with agriculture and the food system in broad terms. The government is constantly reacting to incidents and crises.
As a result, farmers continually have to deal with sudden, drastic measures, without any overarching narrative saying where they should be heading.
Why is that?
Since the ’80s and ’90s, the state has become much less interventionist, and has let the market become the primary mechanism for steering things. In agriculture, market forces have become a goal in their own right. European agriculture has been deregulated.
Farmers have to produce for the global market, which means the cost price is all that matters. I call that out-of-control neoliberalism.
You advocate a new narrative for agriculture. Isn’t that new narrative circular agriculture?
At present, circular agriculture is no more than a buzzword.
It has been in the coalition agreement for two years now, but what do politicians mean by it? What is the model that we’re aiming for? What kind of farm fits? How can you steer people towards that? How does it relate to European agricultural policy? We still need to fill in the details everywhere.
Another problem is that there are no nuances in the current political debate.
You’re either for farmers or against them. It is a case of nature versus the interests of farmers. Nature versus the economy. That’s very simplistic and polarising, whereas a more unifying discourse is actually needed.
A future vision is needed in which agriculture and nature go together.
The Cabinet wants to buy up farms near nature areas and subsidise the construction of low-emission barns?
If that is all they do, that would be a typical example of reactive policy, of quick fixes. That isn’t the answer to the question of where agriculture should be headed.
We need to see what else the Cabinet does. The minister, Carola Schouten, told the farmers in The Hague she didn’t want to halve the livestock population. So what does she want?
What is WUR’s role in creating that new narrative?
The formulation of policy is primarily a task for politicians. But we can help them as a university. Wageningen’s thinking on circular agriculture offers politicians ammunition for further developing their ideas. That is why it is so important that Wageningen nurtures and encourages this debate.
What does circular agriculture actually mean? Is it feasible and what are the views of the various disciplines? We need to engage with one another on this topic. And there’s no harm in disagreement.
Are you optimistic that far-reaching choices will be made?
I believe we are at a crossroads. To have agriculture so high up the political agenda is unique. The nitrogen crisis is what is known in policy theory as a “focusing event”, one in which an issue suddenly attracts an awful lot of attention.
That is often the ideal moment to push through major changes. This is a very exciting time. There is a sense of crisis, and the politicians will not be able to avoid making hard choices.
But those choices are only possible if you develop a vision of what you want from agriculture. The nitrogen crisis is creating a policy window, momentum that makes this possible.
At the same time, I’m afraid that a creative solution will be found to the nitrogen problem that amounts to yet another quick fix. And that is not enough. The challenges facing farming are too big for reactive policy.’
So, no one Wageningen vision on circular agriculture?
Definitely not. Wageningen has a tendency to centralise the formulation of a vision, whereas you should actually delegate it to the scientists.
Let them debate the issue. Management should facilitate and encourage this. We should accept that this might produce conflicting advice and recommendations rather than a silver bullet solution.
That is precisely the added value of scientific debate."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30962469.html,2019-11-07 15:44:00,Non-European Union markets rescue beef exporters,"Export statistics for August indicate that Irish beef shipments to the UK were down by 8% (or 1,100 tonnes), compared to last year. However, this was more than cancelled out by two other export customers.
The Philippines took 170% (or 1,200 tonnes) more than in August, 2019, and China took 340% more (or 600 tonnes). These figures confirm a 2019 trend of Irish beef exports increasing 11% year-on-year, with non-EU markets coming to the rescue, as sales to the UK fell.
Year-to-date beef imports in the UK, including August, were estimated to be down 16% in volume, and 18% in value. These figures are likely to increase, because of the shortage of Irish beef for export caused by farmer protests at factories.
Although protests at factories started at the end of July and continued to mid-September, they didn’t affect exports until September. Processors said up to 80% of their operating capacity was affected by blockades.
But in August, Irish beef exports totalled 30,900 tonnes, 8% (or 2,300 tonnes) higher than year-earlier levels, according to Irish customs data. It is in export results for September and October that the effect of protests will be seen.
Irish processing plants will need to operate at high capacity for some time to handle the backlog in beef ready for slaughter. Processors will hope that the consequent necessary recovery in exports will be helped by increased access to the Chinese market, facilitated by 14 extra Irish processing plants recently being granted access to export to China, bringing to 21 the number of processing plants with access.
How prices paid to farmers will develop is unpredictable. It was discouraging that prices languished in recent weeks, falling further behind prices in the UK, and the overall EU average beef price, despite the value of the euro falling from 94p on August 11 to 86p recently, which should have helped exports to the UK, which takes half of Ireland’s beef.
This week, IFA presidential candidate Tim Cullinan said Irish young bull prices in the week ended October 19 were 46c/kg behind the average EU price, equivalent to €165/head. He called on processors to increase all cattle prices immediately, and for an immediate focused campaign by Bord Bia to close the young bull price differential."

THERE have been countless stark warnings about the bareness of the post-Brexit UK dinner-plate, mirrored at home in Ireland with uncertainty about supply lines for imports and exports.
Wine, charcuterie, cheeses, even the British staple of the pre-made sandwich, could all find themselves off the English menu come Brexit day, it has been warned.
Threats of hunger are visceral and generate understandably emotional responses.
However, while the possibility of breaks in food supply chains are being used for political point-scoring, including Conservative MP Priti Patel’s ill-received comments that England could effectively use the threat of starvation to force a negotiation with Ireland, it has also raised questions large questions about food production and food security in a globalised economy. And not only for the UK, but for Ireland too.
Why have we become so reliant on imports for staples that we’re subject to the vagaries of the political decisions in other countries?
Ireland imports 72,000 tonnes of potatoes per year, 44,000 of these from the UK, even as less than 1% of Irish land is used to grow vegetables, according to Eurostat.
There are plenty of imported foods we can’t produce ourselves amid the €8bn worth of imports recorded by the CSO for 2017: Coffee, wine and bananas are good examples. But we also imported 13kg of apples, 10kg of onions and 7kg of carrots per person, much from England, a neighbouring region with similar climate and growing conditions. In turn, the UK soaks up 40% of our farming exports.
On top of this comes mixed messages regarding climate change: If climate change is the pressing global issue du jour, why is the EU signing trade deals to import Brazilian beef at unknown ecological cost, even as Irish farmers are protesting shrinking beef prices? Isn’t rationalising our food supply and ensuring low food miles more important now than ever before?
It seems there’s no better time to start supporting the growers and artisan food producers on our doorstep. Agri-food is still Ireland’s largest indigenous industry, according to Bord Bia, accounting for 8.4% of Irish jobs.
This autumn, Bord Fáilte’s timely Taste the Island campaign is a €1.5m effort to promote off-season domestic tourism based on the stunning array of delicious seasonally available foods produced on these shores.
Ireland’s largest county features as heavily as ever. Co Cork needs no introduction as home to countless artisan food businesses.
From those who’ve spent 40 years forging a path in homegrown industries like Irish farmhouse cheese to newcomers with recent innovations, all have adapted in times of need, perfected their delicious crafts, and now support families and provide employment by doing what they do so well.
Not only are these food businesses testament to Cork’s wonderful raw ingredients and natural resources, but also to people’s ingenuity in carving out a niche and making a living in response to changing circumstances.
Local food is not only a livelihood, it’s culture, community resilience, environmental protection: it’s the future.
Sweet deal: Exploding Tree
SHE started making chocolate when she was 12, but now Canadian-born Allison Roberts fuses her adult awareness of ethics in business with her childhood dream to produce bars that are doubly sweet: she sources cocoa for her bean-to-bar business from a Fair Trade co-operative and wraps them in biodegradable, plant-sourced packaging.
For Allison, sourcing her cocoa beans from Kuapaco-operative, in Ghana, has a two-fold advantage: Excellent flavour and the knowledge that the supply chain is free from child labour and slavery, all the way from West Africa to West Cork. Not all major producers can be sure of this.
“The beans I buy are known for their sun-baked, clay flavour and they have a warm, red, fruity taste,” she says.
“Kuapa is one of Africa’s first Fair Trade farming co-operatives. West Africa is quite a corrupt part of the world and there’s a lot of slave labour in the cocoa trade.
“A lot of wrongs are still visited there,” Allison says.
Allison converted part of her family home into a chocolate factory in 2015; the company was known as Clonakilty Chocolate, but she’s currently rebranding her range as Exploding Tree, complete with a new website.
In her home chocolate factory, she sorts, roasts, cracks, and winnows the cocoa beans to remove their husks.
The next steps in the process are grinding, adding sweeteners, and tempering and wrapping the finished chocolate.
Because she’s in charge of the whole process, Allison also opts to use Fair Trade coconut blossom sugar, instead of refined sugar, and one of her most popular bars is a milk chocolate made with goat’s milk, instead of cow’s.
Christmas is her busiest time, with chocolate Santas, gift sets, and boxed truffles added to her regular range.
As part of her rebranding to Exploding Tree Chocolate, Allison has recently redesigned all her packaging, which is now made from fully biodegradable, post-agricultural waste.
During the summer, Clonakilty Chocolate was announced as one of six West and South Cork artisan food producers to be selected for LEADER rural development funding.
While Allison is very grateful for the assistance, she says the scheme is not without flaws and comes with an “arduous amount of paperwork,” which means that she’s yet to draw down any funds, despite having invested €4,500 in a new winnowing machine to increase her production.
“It’s amazing to get some financial support, but we’re not big businesses with staff to do all the paperwork.
“I’ve been approved for funding, which is great, but I have to spend €10,000 and then I have to, through more paperwork, see if I can get €5,000 back.
“I’m very grateful, but it comes at a bit of a cost.”
Allison, who has a seven-year-old daughter, saysshe plans for sustainable growth into the future, in line with her ethical approach.
“We’re growing slowly, but I won’t ever want to export production, because then you don’t have control over it,” she says.
“I export a small quantity of chocolate. In another 10 years, I’d love a shop front. Right now, I’m based in my house and that’s great: I can do things that are slightly risky, because I don’t have massive overheads. I really like that,” Allison says.
The salt of the Earth: Irish Atlantic Sea Salt
MICHAEL and Aileen O’Neill took a leap into the unknown when they became the first Irish company to begin producing and selling artisan sea salt from their home in Lickbarrahan on the Beara Peninsula.
“We began in 2009 with a pilot project and in 2013 we converted some farmbuildings to food-grade premises,” says Aileen.
“Michael’s late fatherfirst came up with the idea, but Michael was doingconsultancy work inEngland: At first wedismissed it, but then we put our heads together to work out the basics.
“Michael is an engineer, but he was fishing for 15 years. When the quotas came, he got out of it and we needed to look for something else to do. The love of the sea was always with him, and the water here in Beara is pristine. It just seemed right.” Organically certified, the sea salt is harvested andrefined in a bespoke process that retains the salt’s trace elements, Aileen explains. The process involvesfiltering sea water andapplying gentle heat, which results in large, soft pure white salt flakes coveted by chefs for their uniqueflavour profile and sold as retail packs, both plain and with a variety of flavourings.
Although salt has always been a treasuredcommodity, both as aflavouring and apreservative, by the Middle Ages, salt was beingimported into Ireland. In prehistoric times, stones in coastal areas were carved into “pans” for theevaporation of seawater to produce salt crystals.
But in living memory,refined table salts, which have been subjected to high temperatures and processes that remove all traceelements and add chemical anti-caking agents became the order of the day.
There was no Irish sea salt industry until Michael and Aileen forged their path into the unknown, although now they’ve been joined by a handful of other artisanproducers.
All the hard work insetting up Atlantic Irish Sea Salt has paid off for the couple, with numerous awards and recognition for their craft, including a 2014 Golden Fork award — the “Oscars” for food in the UK and Ireland — for their dill pollen-flavoured salt.
Other flavours include lemon and pepper, whichAileen says marriesperfectly both with seafood dishes and white meats like chicken and pork, chilli and paprika to add a spicy kick to mealtimes, and an oak-smoked salt, which is sent to Ummera smokehouse inTimoleague for smoking.
Today, the businesssupports the O’Neill family as well as employing two people locally. “In a remote area like Beara, every job counts so that’s a huge bonus for us,” says Aileen.
The couple has four children ranging in ages from 22 to 15, and Aileen says they hope that at least one will choose to continue the family business.
In the meantime, Brexit has introduced an element of the unknown into the company’s plans to expand their export trade in the coming years.
“We just don’t know how things will go,” she says. “But we’ve always grown our business organically, so we’ll just keep doing what we do well into the future.”
It’s in the blood: De Róiste Puddings in Ballyvourney
WHEN Ballyvourney butcher Seánie De Róiste passed away, the fledgling artisan pudding and sausagebusiness he had started passed into the hands of his extended family.
But despite a recent contract with Aldi increasing the demand for their products, they say quality won’t suffer at the hands of quantity, and that they’ll stay true to Seánie’s recipes.
Jimmy Allen, his wife Máire, Seánie De Róiste’s sister, and their adult sons Cathal and Declan are now at the helm in the family business that verydefinitely runs in the blood.
“Seánie was a bit of a gas man,” Jimmy Allen recalled. “He travelled around Australia and Canada, and when he came home he opened the shop with his sister, my wife.
“Then the recession came and the multiples took over, and rural Ireland took a fair hammering and Seánie passed away, so we closed the shop.” A boost from the next generation came when Declan, who had often worked alongside his uncle, studied food science in UCC.
In 2012, the family opened De Róiste foods,determined to continue to use Seánie’s traditional recipes for puddings and sausages. Declan heads up production, while brother Cathal, who is studying accountancy, takes care of paperwork and the company’s social media accounts.
Many fans of black pudding won’t be aware that the delicacy is now often made from dried blood, due to the practicalities of collecting, transporting and storing fresh blood. And most of the dried blood, Jimmy says, isn’t Irish in origin.
De Róiste is currently the only pudding widely available in supermarkets like Dunnes and Supervalu and, most recently, Aldi, with whom they’ve signed a year-long contract, made with fresh pig’s blood. The blood used in De Róiste black pudding comes from an abattoir in Mitchelstown that only handles pigs.
“Some people are using powdered onions as well,” Jimmy says. “We get our onions from Bandon. Long ago, it was always pig’s blood, not beef, so that’s what we use.
“We went back to the old ways; Seánie’s grandmother showed him how to make the pudding. When the pig would get killed, it was the woman of the house who’d collect the blood and make the pudding. Seánie built up a big clientele and all we’re doing is continuing his work.” With a growing trendtowards veganism, is Jimmy worried that an emerging generation will be too squeamish for blood sausage?
“We’re not seeing an impact at the moment,” he says. “I imagine we will, going down the road. But the whole world isn’t going vegan overnight. We feel there’s a market there for the next 15 years anyway. We’re also going to look at developing other products and expanding our range beyond black and white pudding and sausages and the like.” As well as their classic black pudding, the company, which now employs seven additional staff as well as the family, also produces white pudding, which picked up a gold prize at last year’s Blas na hÉireann awards, and sausages that are 85% meat content.
Aid from Údarás na Gaeltachta has been invaluable in growing a business with a strong sense of pride of place, Jimmy said.
“We’re all gaeilgeoirí, and that’s very important to us. That’s part of why we keep everything as local as we can. We have to buy Irish; we don’t want to be seen buying things in when there’s perfectly good products here.”
An apple a day: Longueville House Beverages
AN ORCHARD planted 35 years ago in Mallow still produces Ireland’s only apple brandy, but the Co Cork micro-distillery has also found a market for its distinctive cider as the Irish palette veers away from sugary drinks and towards more sophisticated and drier ciders.
William O’Callaghan Sr — Longueville House is now owned and managed by his son, also William — had a unique vision for his country home; having developed a business bottling and selling casked wine, he became the first person to grow grapes in Ireland, joking that eventually the impacts of global warming would permit him to produce Irish wines.
Rupert Atkinson started working at Longueville House seven years ago, and now heads up the sales and dispatch for the historic country home’s cider and brandy production; he says the family history behind Ireland’s first micro-distillery is one that still fascinates him.
“William grew grapes for years, but he only got about two good commercial yields out of every 10 years,” says Rupert.
“But the same time as he planted the vineyards, he planted the orchards. His goal was brandy, but you have to make a cider to double-distil to make brandy. At the time, in the ‘80s, he didn’t think the Irish palette was ready for such a dry cider, so he used all of it for double-distilling.” William Sr’s 30-acre orchard of cider apples in two varieties, Dabinett apples from Somerset and Michelin apples from Normandy, are still what produces Longueville House’s beverages today.
Following his death in 2010, his son William decided to try bottling and selling the cider, reckoning that the Irish palette was becoming more sophisticated and that there may be an emerging market for a dry cider, which is more akin to a Normandy cider than the sweet ciders sold in industrial quantities in Ireland.
Rupert said their biggest challenges come from the competitive Irish drinks market and regulations that seem to favour big business over small producers.
“There are cider producers tankering in cider from Poland or England, bottling it here and they’reallowed to label it as a product of Ireland,” he said.
“And I think it’s shocking that it’s still optional in 2019 whether you want to list the ingredients on the bottle. The big commercial brands have a stranglehold on duty free.
“Cork Airport, 20 miles up the road from us, doesn’t stock our brandy even though we get asked by customers all the time if they can pick up a bottle on the way home.” Last year, 5,000 bottles of brandy and 50,000 litres of cider were produced. Longueville House employs four full-time staff in cider and brandy, but come harvest time, gardeners whose own workload has tailed off for the season are drafted in for an intensive round of picking and pressing.
This seasonal work starts in Octoberand lasts throughout November.
“Cider apples are last to come into blossom in the spring, and the last to be harvested,” says Rupert.
“We only use two natural ingredients: the juice from the apples, and the wild yeasts that occur naturally on the apples. There are no chemicals or preservatives or additives at all; we do sweeten the finished cider with fresh apple juice to lift it from a bone-dry cider to something the Irish palette responds to.”
Cream of the crop: Gloun Cross Dairy
FOR fourth-generation dairy farmer Kevin O’Donovan and his wife Liz, the key to overcoming the struggle to survive on low milk prices was to step back in time.
Rather than continue to sell their milk to a co-op, the O’Donovans decided to start afresh and do dairy in a time-honoured fashion: a local supply network of their own top-quality non-homogenised milk, sold in glass bottles that are proving a big win amid mounting interest from consumers in reducing packaging.
The O’Donovans went it alone only in 2016, and it’s been a whirlwind three years, with a high demand for their dairy products, produced from their herd of Friesians and Jersey Crosses.
As well as milk, Gloun Cross produces butter, buttermilk, and single and double cream; their double cream has picked up the Gold prize at the Blas na hÉireann awards two years running.
Recently, West Cork celebrity Graham Norton was snapped picking up a glass bottle of their milk in the SuperValu near his holiday home.
The popularity of the glass bottles, whichoperate on a deposit scheme and which Gloun Cross collects from stores for re-use, is a particular success story, says Kevin.
“Our aim was to convert people to glass,” he says. “Now it’s starting to swing to it more and more. We put both glass and plastic into some shops and there’s a lot more glass selling than plastic now.
“Glass is a niche; when we started with milk in plastic, people would go into the shops and they’d be saying, ‘that’s just another type of milk’, and they couldn’t see the difference. We had to have something special.” As well as supplying supermarkets and small independent grocers, Gloun Cross is doing a brisk trade in supplying high-end cafés, where the fat and protein content of their milk makes it a dream to steam for drinks like cappuccinos.
The O’Donovans employ three to four part-time staff as well as supporting their family; they have two children, aged 16 and 13.
“You’d be hoping the kids would want to follow you into it, but it depends on the road they want to take,” said Kevin. “There’s an awful lot of work in it to keep it going; a lot of manual work and a lot of hours. But everyone can improve on what the person before did; just because we did it doesn’t mean there isn’t more to be done.” For Kevin, whose business revolves around a perishable product, small and local are the future — and the key to a business that’s both sustainable and capable of maintaining the high quality with which the Gloun Cross name is already associated.
“Cork county is big enough for us,” he says. “We don’t want to export; people ring us for advertising in Dublin and things like that, but that’s no good to us. There’s a lot of people in Cork and if we can supply a patch of that, that’s plenty.
“We never advertised our product. Our philosophy is that if the product is good enough it should sell itself, and that’s what it’s doing.”
Blessed are the cheesemakers:Durrus Cheese
DURRUS Cheese is a venerableinstitution, developed in the first wave of Irish farmhouse cheeses in the late ‘70s, but a second generation is moving in to keep thetradition alive.
Founded by Jeffa Gill from her West Cork smallholding, the farmhouse cheese which has picked up innumerable prestigious awards probably needs no introduction to Irish chefs and foodies.
The most recent gong affordedDurrus’s small range of artisan cheeses was for Best Semi Soft Cheese at this year’s UK andIreland Artisan Cheese Awards.
Jeffa’s daughter, Sarah Hennessy, who now works full-time for the family business, saysDurrus Cheesecame about through trial and error,and through her mother’s extraordinary hard work.
“My mother had a couple of cows and she was growing vegetables and selling milk to the local dairy and keeping some back for the family; she started making cheese for the family in 1979.
“She was friends with Veronica Steele who had just started similar experiments with what wouldbecome Milleens cheese in Beara. Mum just started making the cheese, and eventually it started going out to the shops she was supplying with vegetables and into restaurants and it’s just grown little by little over the years.” A single mother, Jeffa eventually began buying in her milk from a farmer because as her cheese became more popular, she couldno longer keep up milking her own little herd of eight cows on top of making the cheese, but the business issupplied by just two farms, and for purposes of traceability, the milk is never mixed.
Jeffa, along with her neighbour Ann McGrath, who is Sarah’s godmother, still make the cheeses. Two local assistants are alsofemale. Did Durrus deliberately set out to build a matrilineal cheese empire?
Sarah laughs: “No, definitely not. Loads of people have come and go. But Mum does always say it’s a cheese a woman can make: she never developed anything big like a cheddar or a comté, because it was more difficult to lift and carry them. Everything came about because of the person making it and the environment it was being made in.” Having made anindelible mark on the Irish food scene with their trademark washed-rind cheese, Durrus expanded their range in 2009to include the easy-melting Durrus Óg and Dunmanus, a hard cheese made from raw cow’s milk, which is matured for a minimum of six months. All have won coveted prizesat Irish andinternationalfood awards.
Sarah moved back to Durrus four years ago, having managed outlets of Sheridan’s Cheesemongers in Dublin and Galway and married a Galwegian. The couple have two boys, seven and four, and Sarah says raising the children in idyllic West Cork is adefinite plus.
“As time went on, I could see a choice needed to be made about the family business and whether it would continue,” she says.
“The idea that it wouldn’t was against everything in me, so we moved back to West Cork.
“Sourcing locally and selling locally is wonderful and we’re so lucky to be able to do that. The rawmaterials we havein Ireland are of a fantastic quality,and in Cork there’sa great loyalty to Irish products.”"

Ger Dineen of Cork Beef Plan said all are welcome to attend the meetings for discussions on the autumn factory protest, the taskforce talks and the subsequent Beef Sector Agreement of September 15, and the two Producer Organisations which have been set up.
Mr Dineen said that where all farmers who join sell their animals through these Producer Organisations, “they will hopefully get a better price”.
The award-winning beef farmer revealed that he has changed his system of farming due to the slump in beef farming.
“Beef farming at the moment makes no sense, for the first time I do not know what to do with my weanling bulls and heifers this winter.
“Normally, I would finish all my weanling bulls for bull beef, but this year, I will not be finishing any of my animals, as it makes no sense to do this.
“I will lose approximately €400 on each animal if I finish them.
“This is based on getting €3.50 a kg for a 400 kg carcass. It would cost €4.60 a kg to break even, leaving no profit for me.
“You would want to be crazy to be thinking of finishing animals this winter.
“So, at the moment, I will keep my animals until the spring and see what the price is like then.""
The Kilnamartrya, Co Cork, suckler and beef farmer was the 2017 Beef Enterprise winner in the Grassland Farmer of the Year competition."

I hit Bandon mart at the closing of the calf sale, Tom was the first man I met.
“The Friesian bull is back in fashion,” he told me, with farmer buyers purchasing the much talked about, and fretted-over calf.
Bandon had 200 calves on offer and the Friesian bull calf was selling for €50-110 a head. There was good news of larger animals too. Tom said, “Quality assured cattle, with one or two movements, are selling very well.
“Farmer buyers, feedlot purchasers, were all back here today in force with prices up by €70 to €80 a head. It seems the dark cloud that had surrounded beef farming since the factory blockade, has lifted.
Farmers who perhaps wondered about their future in beef farming, and if they might ever return to the business, have returned. Good quality cattle are selling well, with prices returned to the level they were at this time last year.
In Bandon, dry cows sold from €100 under to €320 with the kilo. Friesian bullocks made from €170 to €350 with the kilo. Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks sold from €250 to €500 with the kilo. Heifers sold from €250 to €360 with their weight.

Here in Ireland, we have few persons of royal lineage. The only royalty I know of are our beef barons, fierce exciting people altogether, we never stop talking about them, and with great passion. Keeping our barons in comfort and style can be a very costly business. I wish our barons were like Prince Andrew, one of the dullest men in the world.
According to himself, he doesn’t dance, he doesn’t buy drinks, he doesn’t put his arms around people in public (he’s very careful on that front, he says). He doesn’t sweat, or at least he didn’t sweat much until this week.
And to round it off, the highlight of his life seems to be the occasional purchase of a pizza. He could well be the dullest man of all time, if his recent interview is to be believed. I wish out beef barons were happy to live on pizza and little else. Alas, it’s not so.
Now, with the factory trade in the dumps to provide for the lavish jet set lifestyle of the beef industry elite, we have only the marts to bring us some level of dependability. The marts never believed in royalty, only farmers. That’s what makes them so popular.
750 cattle were on offer at Kilmallock mart on Monday, with Denis Kirby of GVM reporting, “Our trade overall was very lively, with 113 buyers in attendance.”

Latest: Fine Gael councillor Padraig Brady, who is subject to an injunction by C&D Foods, has acknowledged that a complaint was lodged with the Garda Pulse system about threats to the management of the company.
However, he said that no report or statement was subsequently made and he called on the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to correct the Dáil record after he said on Tuesday that death threats had been received by senior management in a meat company where an injunction against blockading farmers is still in place.
“I hope the Minister forces C&D to make a statement to follow up and to bring the people making these statement to justice,” he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke.
“I want to make it completely clear that I did not make any death threat and would condemn any such threats.
“We don’t want to be branded as thugs.”
On the same programme one of the organisers of the blockade, Daniel Long, said that the Minister’s statement was “a stumbling block” as gardaí had said that there was no evidence of a death threat and farmers were aggrieved.
Names were being tarnished, he added.
“The Minister needs to go in and correct the record of the Dáil and then everybody will go home. It’s in everybody’s interests to do that.”

Mr Long said he had been part of the group that met with the Minister briefly in the lobby of the Department of Agriculture this morning.
“I implored him that this (death threat) wasn’t true. That seems to be a major stumbling block, but he was evasive.”
Another protestor Jolene Smith said that if the Minister does not meet a deadline of December 15 for beef talks “then the city will be locked down,” she warned.
She also said she had asked the Minister to have the injunctions against Padraig Brady and Colm Leonard lifted, but the Minster said that his hands were tied.
“Farmers are very angry and are calling for an apology for likening us to the thugs who beat up Kevin Lunney. We want an apology.
""The Minister is making false statements. He needs to retract that statement. He lied to the Dáil.”
Fianna Fáil’s agriculture spokesperson Charlie McConalogue said the Minister needs to explain the background as it was not “fully clear” what he meant.
Farmers continue tractor protest despite sit-down meeting with Creed
Minister Michael Creed. Picture: Sam Boal/RollingNews.ie
Update 10.40am: Farmers are refusing to leave the St Stephens Green area of Dublin City Centre.
The Agriculture Minister came to the picket line early this morning and also sat down with five of the farmers at the Department in the last hour.
Farmers had said they would remove the tractors that are causing the traffic chaos if the Minister came to meet with them but are unhappy with the outcome of the meetings.
Farmers now want the Minister to apologise for comments he made in the Dáil yesterday about the protests.
""They want an apology for the statement that was brought out yesterday,"" said Padraig Brady who is one of the farmers who met with Minister Creed.
""Now it has been portrayed that these are thugs and this is what has people revved up here.
""They don't feel that they are thugs. They feel that they had to come to Dublin.""
IFA presidential candidate John Coughlan said this morning that the protest is a demonstration of the frustration and fear felt by farming families around the country.
""While the manner in which these frustrations are being expressed can be questioned, the motivations behind them are understandable,"" said Mr Coughlan.
""What beef farmers have now is a toothless Taskforce. It failed to read the mood of farm families.
""Since its abandoned first meeting, it has failed to get the players back in the room.
""The Government is hiding behind a bureaucratic blanket, playing right into the hands of meat processors who are only too keen to capitalise on delays as an excuse to keep prices low.""
Farmers say they have no plans to end protest after speaking with Micheal Creed
Picture: Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ie
Update 9.25am: The farmers protesting in the city had said they would leave once Minister Creed met with them.
However they now say they have no plans to move.
One farmer said that Mr Creed did not answer any questions that were put to him.
""He said that he was looking into it and he was going to do this and that.
""The people on the ground are just going to have to stay here until they get results.""
Another man said that Mr Creed was asked to come out and speak with them last night but he did not speak with them until this morning when some farmers were still asleep in their tractors.
It is believed the protesters have called for more farmers from across the country to take part while there has also been fears over plans to cause disruption to the M50.
Gardaí say that Dawson St, Molesworth St, Kildare St and routes around St Stephen's Green and Merrion Square are closed to traffic.
South Circular Rd, Earlsfort Terrace, Adelaide Road and Leeson St are also closed, with diversions in place.
Gardaí have placed a barricade on Kildare Street preventing vehicles from entering.
Dublin Bus have advised passengers to expect delays on all routes this morning.

Update 8.20am: The Minister for Agriculture has met with farmers at the picket line on Kildare Street.
Part of the city has been blocked off since yesterday after dozens of tractors were parked around St Stephens Green.
Farmers are furious with Minister Michael Creed after he stated in the Dáil yesterday that death threats were made against management at C&D foods in Longford during the beef crisis protests.
Farmers say no such threats were made against the factory which has yet to lift injunctions against two farmers that resulted from the beef crisis blockades.
Minister Creed told farmers he was trying to get the taskforce up and running.
He said that there were a number of issues impeding the reconvening of the taskforce.
""We are trying to work to get a solution to that but it is not easy because people have been threatened and that's not an easy thing,"" said Minister Creed.
Commuters continue to face major traffic disruptions in the city centre.
Merrion Square South, St Stephen's Green East, Kildare Street and Merrion Street Upper are all closed to traffic until further notice.
Due to the closure of Kildare Street and Molesworth Street, a number of Dublin Bus routes have been diverted.
Full details of the diversions can be found here.

Update 6.45am A protest by farmers is continuing outside the Dáil this morning.
The group say they are highlighting the challenges in the sector and they won't leave until the Agriculture Minister meets them.
Yesterday saw traffic chaos in the area as over 100 tractors blocked routes and further disruption is likely today as more are understood to be arriving.
Gardaí say that road closures remain in effect around Dublin City Centre this morning due to a protest by farmers.
Merrion Square South, St Stephen's Green East, Kildare Street and Merrion Street Upper are all closed to traffic until further notice.
""There are a number of closures in place in the south city centre including around Stephen's Green,"" said Ruth Jephson, Deputy Editor with AA Roadwatch.
""Stephen's Green east and north are closed along with Kildare Street and Dawson Street.
""Earlsfort Terrace is closed along with Leeson Street outbound but traffic can currently use St Stephen's Green south to go from Leeson Street inbound on to Cuffe Street.

""Elsewhere, Merrion Square south, east and upper are all closed.""
Due to the closure of Kildare Street and Molesworth Street, a number of Dublin Bus routes have been diverted.
Full details of the diversions can be found here.
Red and Green Luas services are operating as normal.
Meanwhile, there was a large Garda presence outside one of the Leinster House exits last night as a tractor was used to block staff from leaving.
Edmund Graham, from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, which is not involved in the protest, says a demonstration was ""inevitable"" given the hardships facing farmers.
""After a summer of discontent at the meat factories, a deal was reached,"" said Mr Graham.
""The most important part of the deal was the taskforce and it hasn't been set up because one of the players in the meat industry refuses to lift two injunctions and this is holding up the whole show.
""They just won't engage on price with the farmers on the ground.""
Yesterday, some fraught exchanges were witnessed between protesters and politicians at the top of Kildare Street by the Shelbourne Hotel, but generally the mood was friendly.
An earlier agreement between protest leaders and gardaí to allow up to 100 tractors drive down past the Dáil on the proviso they not stop collapsed, amid angry scenes.
Opposition politicians Mattie McGrath, Michael Fitzmaurice and Michael Collins sought to secure a meeting with Mr Creed in a bid to end the protest but their efforts came to nothing.
The protest had commenced at Merrion Square but without agreement the farmers in their tractors moved in a convoy towards Kildare Street until the point where they were blocked by gardaí."

IFA presidential candidate John Coughlan said this morning that the protest is a demonstration of the frustration and fear felt by farming families around the country.
""While the manner in which these frustrations are being expressed can be questioned, the motivations behind them are understandable,"" said Mr Coughlan.
""What beef farmers have now is a toothless Taskforce. It failed to read the mood of farm families.
""Since its abandoned first meeting, it has failed to get the players back in the room.
""The Government is hiding behind a bureaucratic blanket, playing right into the hands of meat processors who are only too keen to capitalise on delays as an excuse to keep prices low.""
Farmers say they have no plans to end protest after speaking with Micheal Creed

Update 9.25am: The farmers protesting in the city had said they would leave once Minister Creed met with them.
However they now say they have no plans to move.
One farmer said that Mr Creed did not answer any questions that were put to him.
""He said that he was looking into it and he was going to do this and that.
""The people on the ground are just going to have to stay here until they get results.""
Another man said that Mr Creed was asked to come out and speak with them last night but he did not speak with them until this morning when some farmers were still asleep in their tractors.
It is believed the protesters have called for more farmers from across the country to take part while there has also been fears over plans to cause disruption to the M50.
Gardaí say that Dawson St, Molesworth St, Kildare St and routes around St Stephen's Green and Merrion Square are closed to traffic.
South Circular Rd, Earlsfort Terrace, Adelaide Road and Leeson St are also closed, with diversions in place.
Gardaí have placed a barricade on Kildare Street preventing vehicles from entering.
Dublin Bus have advised passengers to expect delays on all routes this morning.

Update 8.20am: The Minister for Agriculture has met with farmers at the picket line on Kildare Street.
Part of the city has been blocked off since yesterday after dozens of tractors were parked around St Stephens Green.
Farmers are furious with Minister Michael Creed after he stated in the Dáil yesterday that death threats were made against management at C&D foods in Longford during the beef crisis protests.
Farmers say no such threats were made against the factory which has yet to lift injunctions against two farmers that resulted from the beef crisis blockades.
Minister Creed told farmers he was trying to get the taskforce up and running.
He said that there were a number of issues impeding the reconvening of the taskforce.
""We are trying to work to get a solution to that but it is not easy because people have been threatened and that's not an easy thing,"" said Minister Creed.
Commuters continue to face major traffic disruptions in the city centre.
Merrion Square South, St Stephen's Green East, Kildare Street and Merrion Street Upper are all closed to traffic until further notice.
Due to the closure of Kildare Street and Molesworth Street, a number of Dublin Bus routes have been diverted.
Full details of the diversions can be found here.

Update 6.45am A protest by farmers is continuing outside the Dáil this morning.
The group say they are highlighting the challenges in the sector and they won't leave until the Agriculture Minister meets them.
Yesterday saw traffic chaos in the area as over 100 tractors blocked routes and further disruption is likely today as more are understood to be arriving.
Gardaí say that road closures remain in effect around Dublin City Centre this morning due to a protest by farmers.
Merrion Square South, St Stephen's Green East, Kildare Street and Merrion Street Upper are all closed to traffic until further notice.
""There are a number of closures in place in the south city centre including around Stephen's Green,"" said Ruth Jephson, Deputy Editor with AA Roadwatch.
""Stephen's Green east and north are closed along with Kildare Street and Dawson Street.
""Earlsfort Terrace is closed along with Leeson Street outbound but traffic can currently use St Stephen's Green south to go from Leeson Street inbound on to Cuffe Street.

""However, if you are heading the other way, the Kevin Street and Cuffe Street stretch is closed for those heading towards Stephen's Green.
""Elsewhere, Merrion Square south, east and upper are all closed.""
Due to the closure of Kildare Street and Molesworth Street, a number of Dublin Bus routes have been diverted.
Full details of the diversions can be found here.
Red and Green Luas services are operating as normal.
Meanwhile, there was a large Garda presence outside one of the Leinster House exits last night as a tractor was used to block staff from leaving.
Edmund Graham, from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, which is not involved in the protest, says a demonstration was ""inevitable"" given the hardships facing farmers.
""After a summer of discontent at the meat factories, a deal was reached,"" said Mr Graham.
""The most important part of the deal was the taskforce and it hasn't been set up because one of the players in the meat industry refuses to lift two injunctions and this is holding up the whole show.
""They just won't engage on price with the farmers on the ground.""
Yesterday, some fraught exchanges were witnessed between protesters and politicians at the top of Kildare Street by the Shelbourne Hotel, but generally the mood was friendly.
An earlier agreement between protest leaders and gardaí to allow up to 100 tractors drive down past the Dáil on the proviso they not stop collapsed, amid angry scenes.
Opposition politicians Mattie McGrath, Michael Fitzmaurice and Michael Collins sought to secure a meeting with Mr Creed in a bid to end the protest but their efforts came to nothing.
The protest had commenced at Merrion Square but without agreement the farmers in their tractors moved in a convoy towards Kildare Street until the point where they were blocked by gardaí."

He was one of several farmers who came to Dublin to demand better prices for cattle and the lifting of injunctions against two farmers.
“We are independent farmers who are here on a peaceful protest,” said Mr Coyle who has a farm in Arva, Co Cavan.
“I am here because my family farm is at risk. I lost money last year and I am going to lose more this year. I can't keep going the way things are and every beef farmer is the same.
“The cattle I sold dropped €200 in one month this year. They went from €410 per kilo base price to €360. That's 50c a kilo on a 400-kilo beast.”

Mr Coyle was one of the persons named in injunction proceedings by Liffey Meats that were struck out by the High Court in September.
“I have been very stressed since the last protest and did not think we would have to come back to Dublin to fight our cause again.
“I got up before 5am on Tuesday and came up to Dublin. I have to go home to work but other people are coming,” he said this morning.
Mr Coyle said he had four children and would not ask any of them to be a farmer.
“I have no other business but I am glad that my wife has an off-farm job and my family is reared. I put all of my children through college and all of them are working.”
Another protester, Jolene Smith, who has a farm in Ballyjamesduff, Co Cavan, said beef prices had collapsed.
“Beef prices are on the floor. We can't sell our cattle. We have 30 cattle standing in a field which are ready to be sold but we can't sell them at the prices that are there,” she said.
Ms Smith and her husband, Ciaran, have sheep and suckler cows. “The price of sheep is going up at the minute but it is not enough,” she said.
The couple has five children between the ages of 15 and one year and they worry about their future.
“We need action for our families; we need action for our farms,” said Ms Smith, who was one of the five farmers to met the Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed, to discuss their concerns.
""This could have been done and dusted on Tuesday night if the minister had met us then but we were stopped from going down Kildare Street to hand in our submission. That did not happen until the following morning.""
Ms Smith said there were around 50 tractors around the centre of the city. The farmers had worked with the gardaí and they were happy to leave them where they were.
“We are here for the long-haul. That is what it is looking like. Christmas is on hold and so are our lives. We sat for eight weeks outside factories trying to get an increase in our cattle prices and we are still no further on.”
Ms Smith became tearful when she talked about having around 100 sheep stolen from their farm this year. “We have had to deal with that too,” she said.
John Joe Kennedy, a suckler and sheep farmer from Ballinasloe, Co Roscommon, said he and his wife, who had an off-farm job, were paying €25,000 a year to keep two children in college in Dublin.
“We are taking a loss for our animals because we have to sell them to get the money to pay for our children's education. We can't keep going like this.”
James Roche, a dairy farmer from Tullaher, Co Kilkenny, said he was a dairy farmer who sold calves to other farmers who produce them for beef.
“I have skin in the game because I want those farmers to keep buying my calves,” he said.

Two protesters - Fine Gael councillor Paraic Brady and Colm Leonard - are subject to injunctions taken out by C&D Foods, and sources familiar with negotiations say there is a resolve among farmer representative bodies to hold off on talks until these legal threats are lifted.
The lifting of any legal threats by processors was a precondition of any meeting of the Beef Taskforce established with a view to ending the dispute over the price paid to farmers and other contentious marker conditions.
However while members of Meat Industry Ireland - the umbrella body representing the beef processors - dropped their legal threats, there has been no indication that the injunctions taken out by C&D Foods will be lifted.
C&D Foods was the subject of a takeover from Larry Goodman’s ABP Food Group (ABP) earlier this year, when ABP bought out the remaining 15% of the company’s shares.
These were held by Philip Reynolds, son of the late Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, who founded the Longford company more than 40 years ago.
While ABP’s meat processing plants are members of MII, C&D Foods is a pet food manufacturer and therefore does not come under MII’s remit.
As such, while MII agreed its members would drop legal threats in a bid to get farmers to the negotiating table, C&D Foods is not bound by such an agreement.
C&D Foods declined to comment on the injunctions when contacted by the Irish Examiner today.
The speculated cause of the injunctions was a source of controversy on Tuesday when Agriculture Minister Michael Creed alluded to alleged death threats against C&D Foods staff.
Cllr Brady denied being responsible for any death threats and condemned any such actions. He said that while there is a mention of such a threat on the Garda Pulse system, no formal complaints have been made."

They also renewed their call for the lifting of an injunction, obtained by C&D Foods against two Co Longford farmers, who had taken part in demonstrations at the plant.
Although the blockade was lifted last evening, the farmers’ protest could escalate, amid reports that some plan to disrupt the M50 motorway and target main roads on the outskirts of the city in the coming days and weeks. The delegation said that if no progress is made by December 15, farmers would be back on the streets of Dublin. The protests follow blockades at beef-processing factories over two months this summer and farmers protesting outside the Dáil.
The farmers certainly have a gripe but they are directing their protest in the wrong direction. They should be targeting the main food producers and retailers.
Disrupting traffic in Dublin will do little more than anger commuters while drawing no sympathy for their cause."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30967042.html,2019-11-28 00:00:00,"Elaine Loughlin: Little gained, and much public support lost for farmers","The motley crew that caused havoc in Dublin did no favours for the majority of farmers who rightly want a fair price for produce, says Political Correspondent Elaine Loughlin
Regardless of their plight, it is wrong that a disparate group, with no leader, vague aims, and constantly-changing red lines can hold the capital and the Government to ransom.
Beef farmers are the backbone of rural Ireland, they support thousands of other small business owners who wish to make a living outside of towns and cities, and they are also seriously struggling, there is no denying that.
Without farmers, rural Ireland would simply die, they are an integral part of what makes our country unique and must be supported.
However, it is not the job of any minister to directly negotiate with each of the country’s 70,000 beef farmers.
Accepting the demands of individuals just because they cause havoc by blocking up a city is not something that should be contemplated, nor is expecting the minister for agriculture to meet with individuals because they don’t believe they are being fully represented by farming organisations.
Giving such power to anyone would set a dangerous precedent. If farmers think they can simply rock up to Leinster House in their Massey Fergusons and John Derres and get what they want, what’s to stop a group of dissident teachers blocking off access to the Department of Education or renegade nurses from stopping traffic outside the Department of Health for a day?
The way in which the group of self-titled individual farmers conducted themselves could be described as everything from farcical to a disgrace, but it certainly did not advance their cause. The two-day blockade of Dublin’s city centre ended just after 3pm yesterday when the tractors and trailers pulled off in a plume of smoke after horse-wrangling with gardaí, ad-hoc conversations with the minister, and internal disagreements.
Tuesday morning in Dublin was already the type of wet and gloomy day that no-one wants to face into. The kind of dreary day that requires our farmers to pull on the waterproof trousers and trudge through the mud to check and feed their stock. It’s something that you perhaps don’t think about when assessing the price of your vacuum-packed fillet of beef or a roast for your Sunday lunch in the supermarket.
In Dublin, commuters were faced with the usual added journey time due to the rain, but the fact that numerous streets in the city centre were blocked off caused absolute gridlock. The tractorcade hadn’t even arrived yet.
While the rally of around 100 tractors was mainly confined to one side of Merrion Square, gardaí had closed surrounding streets as a precaution.
By mid-afternoon on Tuesday, farmers, who are well used to hammering out a deal, were negotiating with the gardaí.
It was agreed that two tractors would be allowed to drive down Kildare St, passing the Department of Agriculture and Leinster House and then they would be off. But when the mediators went back to the group of independent-minded farmers, the compromise was rejected.

The second proposal was to let the entire tractorcade drive past the main gates of the Dáil, the gardaí warned farmers not to stop and the negotiators agreed that they would file past and would then make their way home to cattle that needed feeding that night.
Again this idea was dismissed by some in the crowd which made it a non-runner.
At this stage, the gardaí were realising it could be difficult to extract the farmers as the lack of leadership and even less agreement among the protesters was becoming apparent.
The protesters parked up for the night with some sleeping in their tractor cabs. A subsection of the breakaway group took further action blocking the Merrion Square exit of Leinster House with two tractors which prevented some staff and politicians from leaving. Others made the short walk around the block for refreshments in the Shelbourne Hotel.
It was a second morning of chaos for commuters yesterday with St Stephen’s Green east and north closed, along with Kildare St, Dawson St, Earlsfort Terrace, Leeson St, and Cuffe St.
Dublin Bus was forced to make diversions on a number of routes.
Farmers had made it clear that they wanted to bring their concerns directly to the minister and then they would leave, and so shortly after 7am, Micheal Creed took upon himself to meet the protesters at the picket line.
“We need to make sure that what you are doing is not stepping back more than bringing it forward,” the minister told those assembled.
Some of the farmers handed Mr Creed a letter but protesters further along the picket shouted that it didn’t represent their views.
And so the tractors remained and a new set of demands were hatched.
This time, five representatives of the leaderless group would go into the department to smooth things out which would allow for deployment of an exit strategy.
Mr Creed met the farmers in the lobby of Agriculture House where he was handed another letter and told to ignore the first document.
A third hand-written letter was also produced for perusal by the minister just to add to the confusion and mixed messages.

There were then calls for the minister to apologise for remarks he had made in the Dáil the previous day, then and only then would the farmers retreat.
By early afternoon, many on the protest, who had only expected it to last a few hours, were growing weary, the entire thing became more like an exercise on how not to conduct a successful protest.
The lack of any coherent message or organisation was again demonstrated when one protester announced to the crowd that a motion of no-confidence in the minister would be tabled in the Dáil a 2.45pm and they would all agree to leave — when the minister was also forced to step down — at 3pm.
A quick glance at the schedule would have informed the speaker that the Dáil was not due to resume until 3.07pm at which point topical issues would be up for discussion.
And so at 3pm the protesters finally moved on, with very little gained but much public support lost.
In short, our beef farmers have a strong case to make, the beef task force must be resumed to address issues impacting those who work in a valuable industry, but who are not valued.
But the motley crew that caused havoc in Dublin this week do not represent the majority who work the land. They did no favours for the wider group who quite rightly want a fair price for their produce."

C&D Petfoods had brought the action against Fine Gael Cllr Paraic Brady and local carpenter Colm Leonard after its facility in Edgeworthstown was blockaded in September during the dispute over beef prices.
The disruption led to the company temporarily laying off 187 of its employees.
The Beef Plan Movement had said it would not attend any meetings of the Beef Market Taskforce until the two injunctions were lifted.
Dermot O'Brien, South-west Regional Chair of the Beef Plan Movement, says they are now prepared to meet as soon as tomorrow.
Mr O'Brien said: ""We want to be able to convene straight away. We're waiting a long time. We're waiting now over six or seven weeks for this to kick off.
""And we want it to kick off straight away because the beef farmers in this country are under a lot of pressure. They're not in receipt of a fair price for their product."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30967386.html,2019-11-29 13:37:00,Injunctions lifted against Longford farmers,"Injunctions preventing protesters from blockading and intimidating persons working or visiting a Midlands based pet food manufacturing plant have been formally struck out by the High Court.
The orders were secured last September by C&D Pet Foods, which is located at Edgeworthstown Co Longford against Fine Gael Cllr Paraic Brady of The Meadows, Drumlish, Co Longford, and Colm Leonard of Aughanoran Dring, Co Longford, by Mr Justice Tony O'Connor.
C&D is owned by the ABP Food Group, which is one of Ireland's largest beef processors.
Several of C&D's plants were the scenes of protests earlier this year by farmers unhappy with the prices being paid for their product.
The injunctions permanently prevented the defendants, their agents and anyone who has knowledge of the orders from trespassing at or blockading the plant, and from intimidating individuals going to and from the plant.
The matter returned before the High Court today when John Lavelle for C&D told Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds the orders previously made by the court could be vacated and struck out.
No orders were to be made in relation to the legal costs of the action, counsel said.
Patricia Hill Bl, instructed by James Staines solicitor for the two named defendants in the case told the court that the striking out was on consent.
The Judge agreed to strike out the proceedings.
Last September the company sought orders against protesters, who C&D claimed had for several days physically obstructed the plant's entrance, in support of farmers involved in the protest with meat processors.
The company claimed that if the blockade wasn't lifted more than 500 workers in the locality faced being laid off and that its business reputation would be severely damaged.
C&D claimed that despite the fact it had no role in the determination of prices paid for beef, as it mainly uses pork and chicken in its products, it has been ""tactically targeted by protesters"" because it is part of the ABP group.
C&D said it did not wish to halt any peaceful or lawful protest outside the plant.
However, the defendants and others have gone beyond a legitimate peaceful protest, it claimed before the court.
It claimed the protesters maintained the blockade by walking in continuous circles around trucks trying to leave or enter the plant.
The blockade, it further claimed, caused major disruption to the firm's business and had cost it some €400,000."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30967477.html,2019-11-29 19:30:00,Farm body claims consumers 'not paying enough for quality food',"The ""cheap food"" policy and the funding of anti-farmer publicity campaigns have been strongly criticised by the family farm organisation, ICMSA, which has also described division among farmers as ""not a healthy situation"".
Speaking to 300 delegates at the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association annual meeting at Limerick today, ICMSA president, Pat McCormack, called for a truce in the anti-farmer bashing.
He said: ""Put simply, the consumer is not paying enough for quality food. They are underpaying for the highest quality food and they have been for decades.
As a farmer, we are receiving the same price we received 30 years ago which given the increase in input costs and regulation is just untenable.
He warned that the cheap food policy is only cheap for the consumers because farmers are 'carrying' them.
He said: ""The cheap food policy was very expensive indeed for us. We get the same milk price today that our parents were getting 30-odd years ago. But every single bill we had has quadrupled at least.""
Mr McCormack said that the ICMSA is more than 98% funded by membership fees paid annually by farmer members and he called for all non-governmental organisations commenting on diet, food and farming to reveal their sources of income.
He asked: ""Are some of these NGOs being funded by the corporations busily developing synthetic replacements for natural beef and milk? If they are then I think we need to know.""
He described the over-the-top nature of some of the programming during climate change week on RTÉ as ""unbalanced"".
On climate control, he said that farmers have to play their part and they will meet the challenge but the bashing is not being helpful: ""I firmly believe that farmers will respond but I have question marks over other sectors. I am fed up with so-called experts jetting around the world from luxury hotel to luxury hotel, from five star-seminar to five star-seminar preaching about climate change but who never seem able to practice what they preach.""
He called for dairy processors to acknowledge that markets have improved by a corresponding increase in milk price, emphasising that November milk should be paid at least 31c/lt.
On beef, he said that farmers could not be expected to continue supplying beef to the factories at 30-year-old prices while meeting production costs which have more than doubled in the meantime.
The Taoiseach told the meeting that farmers are ""part of the fabric of our communities and our society"" but they have been going through a difficult period.
""I know that during the recession, this industry helped us to bounce back and I know that the last two years have not been as good and for some they’ve been very bad"" he said to the 300 farmers attending the meeting.
He added: ""The Government will work with you on these challenges and we will help you prosper and thrive. In Budget 2020 we allocated €1.6 billion to the Department of Agriculture, over €50 million more than last year. That does not include ‘no deal’ Brexit funds or low-cost loans to the sector. You are our most important indigenous industry.""
The Taoiseach said that the export value of the sector has grown by 73% over the last 10 years and now stands at a record €13.7 billion which equates to 10% of merchandise exports. The projection is to increase to €19bn through Through FoodWise by 2025.
The agricultural sector continues to make a significant contribution to employment - about 7.7% of total employment in the country.
Outside Dublin and the mid-east, the figure is between 10% and 14%. In some parts of the country, agri-food is the major employer alongside the public service and tourism.
He assured the farmers that the Government is working on alliances across Europe to ensure that the strongest possible support for agriculture is maintained in CAP Reform.
""Our ambition is to ensure that Irish agriculture continues to produce high quality, safe, traceable and nutritious food while protecting and enhancing the environment and upholding animal welfare,"" he said.
My message today is that the Government will continue to prioritise the CAP budget.
""To do so, we are prepared to contribute more to the overall EU budget if it is spent on things that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal, programmes that work and have stood the test of time like the CAP which has given Europe food security and helped to balance regional development across the continent"" he assured the farmers.""
He said that it will be necessary to make the new CAP much greener, incentivising, encouraging and remunerating farmers and industry to reduce emissions, produce green energy and promote biodiversity and its is what the consumers and taxpayers want and the right thing to do."

Most importantly, it now gives an opportunity for the beef market taskforce, which was established in September, to convene without the threat of either further legal action by processors or more blockades by farmers. We have had more than enough of both.
Two men, Fine Gael Cllr Paraic Brady and Colm Leonard, a local carpenter, had been the subject of the injunctions and all of the main farm organisations involved in setting up the taskforce had refused to attend a meeting of the new group until the injunctions were lifted. The company had also threatened to sue the men for damages, as a result of losses incurred during the blockade.
It is high time that the Government, producers, and farmers listened to each other. There has not been much listening going on of late. The tractor protest on the streets of Dublin was loud and raucous, with Agriculture Minister Michael Creed shouted down on occasions when he sought to address the concerns of individual farmers. The latest protests followed blockades at beef processing factories over two months this summer and farmers protesting outside the Dáil.
Likewise, the Taoiseach does not appear to be doing much listening, preferring to repeat the mantra that the Government has no role to play in cattle prices. Such a pronouncement is neither welcome, helpful, nor particularly accurate. It is true that the Government does not set the prices paid by producers to farmers, but it has much persuasive power with processors, particularly in relation to direct and indirect financial supports for the industry.
Neither do the factory owners appear to be listening to anyone other than themselves, while using financial muscle to dictate the price to farmers. As business people, they must realise that running any kind of commercial enterprise at a loss cannot be sustained, yet that is what they are forcing many farmers to do. There is ample evidence that beef prices are improving elsewhere in Europe, but are falling or stagnant in Ireland.
There is also the issue of the relationship between farmers and the meat industry. Speaking in the Dáil this week, Mr Creed described it as “toxic” and hoped that the establishment of the taskforce would mark a new departure. “That is because, in the long-term, it is not sustainable to have an industry survive and prosper without good relationships between the primary producers and the processors,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30967863.html,2019-12-02 12:00:00,"Farmers are willing to change, but they must be incentivised","Farmers have been criticised for not reducing agri-emissions, which are near 1990 levels. Layers of bureaucracy will be imposed on farmers over the next decade or so to cajole them into
acting.
The Draft National Climate and Air Roadmap for the Agriculture Sector to 2030 and Beyond – Public Consultation was launched by the department this past week.
It said that the agricultural sector needs to respond and “play its part in the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society for the future,” and the target is a 10% to 15% emissions reduction for agriculture.
The consultation suggests a five-pronged approach, while maintaining viable farm incomes (though fewer than a third of farms are classed as viable, according to the National Farm Survey results for 2018).
The objectives are:
1. Reduce GHG emissions from the sector
2. Increase the carbon sequestration potential of our land and forests
3. Meet our ammonia ceilings targets
4. Build resilient food production and land-use systems that meet these climate and air obligations, while also meeting market expectations
5. Communicate our progress
The report acknowledges that large swathes of the country are suited mainly to cattle or sheep production and that emissions per unit of production are low. Yet the plan insists on driving down green house gas and ammonia emission intensity.
Increasing the efficiency of the national herd by reducing the age at first calving and replacement rates can lessen the climate impact of our animal populations. Increasing the efficiency of applied fertiliser through soil management (lime, p & k), targeting 60% of slurry by low emissions spreading systems, conversion to urea-based products, and insisting clover is included in reseeding land are mentioned as ways to enhance soil fertility and nutrient efficiency.
Other suggestions are to improve beef genetics, reduce protein in livestock feeding stuffs, and increase the area of lands planted by 8,000ha per annum. Some of these will be easy wins, such as the conversion from CAN-based fertiliser to protected urea. Suggesting to farmers that they should reduce their replacement rates is patronising, as most farmers are doing everything they can to avoid animals falling out of their herd.
Equally, asking dairy farmers to improve the beef traits of their animals will only make sense to them where they will be financially rewarded.
It is more that three decades since farmers shifted away from the beefier British Friesian to the Holstein, as farmers figured the extra litres more than made up for the loss of beef value. With beef prices on the floor, there has never been less incentive for dairy farmers to focus on beef and encouraging farmers in this direction will be a hard sell.
Encouraging farmers to finish their animals sooner will reduce the quantity of methane produced over the animal’s lifetime, but farmers on poorer land typically allow their animals to grow into size and adopt a low input approach, feeding silage for two winters and little meal and finishing animals at 30 months. This is more profitable for their land type.
Farmers will adapt to whatever rules are imposed on them, but government must provide the appropriate incentives.
Farmers are receptive to change, with nearly 269,000 hectares of land included in the GLAS low input permanent pasture scheme and a 14,000 hectares under bird cover.
Given that farm incomes are low, government should ensure that additional costs and regulations will not affect farm profits and that more intensive, predominantly full-time, farmers are not vilified out of existence.
Farmers should consider how the additional regulations may affect their business and how that may translate into lower stock rates, or additional farm running costs (such as soil sampling and milk recording), or capital costs (such as slurry equipment) and factor this into their medium-term projections.
The department consultation is open until January 10th, 2020."

The group called for an immediate and significant price increase to the amount they are being paid for beef products.
Today marked the first meeting of the Taskforce, which was forced to adjourn proceedings two months ago following a confrontation between farmers and meat industry representatives.
IFA President Joe Healy said they wasted no time in setting out their position for a price increase today, but walked away from the meeting empty-handed.
He said: ""All farmers wanted from today was news of a price rise. We didn't get that, so that's disappointing. When it was mentioned (by) the Meat Industry Ireland representations that there should be a price rise in the short term, we want that immediately. Farmers need it immediately.""
The senior director of Meat Industry Ireland said he would inform processors of farmers' calls for an immediate price increase.
Cormac Healy says the taskforce must meet for further discussions in the New Year, and for ""many more meetings to follow through on the actions in the beef sector agreement.""
EARLIER: Lack of progress at Beef Market Taskforce 'will return farmers to the picket line', says IFA Presidential candidate
The Beef Market Taskforce is to meet this morning, two months after it was originally due to happen.
It was due to meet in October but was called off due to protests, while last week hundreds of farmers took to the streets of Dublin, grinding parts of the city to a halt.
Farmers and representatives of the beef industry are expected to meet today to discuss the ongoing issues regarding the price of the meat.
They have nearly 40 actions to carry out on a range of issues and they include cattle prices which is top of the list for the Irish Farmers Association as they claim farmers are getting depressed prices at the factory gates.
They want the Agriculture Minister Michael Creed to attend the meeting which is due to begin at 9am.
IFA Presidential candidate, John Coughlan said the Beef Market Taskforce has 20 days to save farmers €20m.
He said the taskforce must immediately deliver a fair base price for beef farm families and address the meat industry’s failure to honour the Irish Beef Sector Agreement of September 15.
He claimed that Irish beef farmers have lost €60m to date and are set to lose another €20m by the end of the year ""if the Taskforce does not hold beef factories to account"".
Mr Coughlan said that lack of progress will lead to further unrest in the beef sector, prolonged protests and growing uncertainty for Ireland’s 75,000 beef farmers.
Ahead of the meeting Mr Coughlan said: ""The work of the Beef Market Task Force has been long awaited. Irish beef farmers have placed huge trust in the group's commitment to ensure the implementation of the Irish Beef Sector Agreement reached at September’s beef talks that brought an end to over two months of farmer protests at beef factories across the country.
Any failure to progress tangible solutions for beef farmers will return farmers to the picket line and lead to further protests in Dublin as we approach the Christmas period.
""The Taskforce meets today with the challenge of securing a fair profit margin for beef farm families. The future of beef farming in Ireland is heavily compromised by the disproportionately high percentage of profit taken by beef processors and retailers.
“It is an utter disgrace that the Taskforce’s failure to hold the meat industry to account on the Agreement of 15 September has resulted in a loss of €60 million for Irish beef farmers. The Taskforce has 20 days to save beef farmers from losing a further €20 million.
“We need a Taskforce with teeth and not just another talking shop and I again call on the Taskforce’s Chair, Michael Dowling to show real leadership and secure tangible progress.
“I have set out seven key actions which are central to the future of Ireland’s beef industry and the ultimate success of the taskforce. We need to work together, progressively and collaboratively to achieve these and to secure the future and livelihood of over 75,000 farmers and families who are depending on the success of this Taskforce. Failure is not an option.”"

The Irish Farmers' Association began the protest at 7am this morning, blocking access to delivery trucks.
Responding to the demonstration, Aldi said it is ""extremely disappointed"" by the protest.
""We welcomed the resumption of the Beef Taskforce this week and have engaged openly with farmer representative organisations on the beef issue over recent months,"" a spokesperson said.
Aldi said that it has a policy of open communications with all of its stakeholders, including the IFA.
""To be very clear, Aldi received no request for engagement on this issue from any member of the IFA leadership, no communication about specific concerns about the mechanics of the beef market, including age specification, and no warning of any grievance the IFA had before this morning.""
The supermarket said it is fully committed to co-operating with the taskforce and has met with one of the representative groups, the BPM, as recently as last week to further update its position.
""As part of our preparations for the Taskforce, we have initiated research on a wide range of beef products to determine a number of issues.
""Our work also includes a complete review of procedures and processes with our suppliers to ensure we are meeting all customer and market requirements.""
Aldi will report back through the Taskforce and intends to play a fulsome role in the process.
""Any action outside of this process is short-sighted and not constructive.""
The supermarket said that all of its fresh meat, including beef, is 100% Irish and Bord Bia assured.
No Aldi stores have been affected by today's demonstration.
Reacting to the blockade IFA Presidential candidate, John Coughlan, said the Government needed to realise that for farmers, the Beef Taskforce is the equivalent of national pay talks.
Speaking at the farm blockade in Naas this morning, Mr Coughlan was critical of the listless attitude of Government to the process, saying farmers need more that a shrug of the shoulders from Government.
He pointed to a lack of urgency in making meaningful progress to date, saying the sense of drift was doubly damaging given the ever-widening price gap between what Irish beef farmers are being paid versus their international equivalents.
“All the parties to the talks, including the meat industry, are saying they want a deal. If so, why are we not all in a room right now looking to agree one? The lack of urgency is staggering. Farmers do not need a stop-start talking shop, they need action. The only people who benefit from delays are meat barons who are pocketing the additional margin which independent analysis shows is in the market.”
Farmers at the site said they are protesting over beef prices and say that they are fighting for their livelihoods.
""I left this morning at around 5am to be up here so I could be at home working as well,"" said one man.
""I had to get someone in to cover me for the day. It's not that easy to get cover for the day at short notice.
""I would much rather be at home farming but we have to come out and defend our incomes and defend our futures.""

The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) is mounting the blockade for 12 hours claiming retailers need to address the poor price farmers are paid for their cattle.
They are demanding an immediate beef price increase.
The president of the Irish Farmers Association (IFA), Joe Healy, is calling on the meat industry to increase the amount paid to beef farmers.
“This is the first of many protests,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.
The gap between what Irish farmers are paid per kilo and what their UK and European counterparts are paid is widening said Mr Healy.
In recent weeks the beef price index indicated an increase of a difference from 17c to 20c per kilo with European farmers and an increase of 45c to 50c with UK farmers, he added.
Some of our members see neighbouring Northern Ireland beef farmers getting close to 50c a kilo more.
He called on Meat Industry Ireland to pass on a price increase to farmers.
The Beef Task Force meeting held earlier in the week had left farmers feeling insulted.
“There was no Minister there, no retailer. Meat Industry Ireland came in with nothing to offer. The best we could get from them was that they would consult with their members.”
Mr Healy said there needs to be an immediate increase in the amount paid to farmers.
Talk about green shoots in the industry were of no benefit to farmers, he said.
Also on Morning Ireland a truck driver attempting to make a delivery to the distribution centre clashed with protesting farmers saying “I’m not robbing your money, I’ve a day’s work to do. Have you no cattle to mind?”
The driver said he knew the farmers were struggling, but that everyone was struggling.
""You’re stopping us get paid.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30968642.html,2019-12-05 14:00:00,‘Agri-bashers’ one of the targets as farmers strike back,"Last week, more than 10,000 farmers with 5,000 tractors made their way from across Germany to Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate for a protest rally.
Who would have thought that farmers, on which the EU spends almost €60bn per year in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), would take to the streets in such numbers?
It took only about 100 tractors driven by protesting farmers to snarl up the traffic in Dublin.
If enough farmers take to the roads of Europe in their tractors, the continent could grind to a halt.
That has happened already in the Netherlands.
On Tuesday, October 1, more than 2,000 farmers took to the Dutch highways on their tractors, in a slow procession toward the country’s capital, The Hague.
Some drove their tractors along the North Sea beaches that lead to the city.
The Dutch motorists association ANWB said the tractors, along with bad weather and accidents, made that Tuesday the busiest ever morning on the nation’s roads, resulting in more than 1,000km of traffic jams.
Also last week, disgruntled French farmers were in Paris, attempting to use 1,000 tractors to block off access to the city.
It used to be only the French farmers who mounted disruptive protests, but it’s happening everywhere now.
Earlier in the autumn, Ireland had the beef factory protests.
Farmers from Germany and France parked their tractors at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, there have been protests in more than 17 German cities, and thousands of farmers in France protested in each region and department.
These protests will continue.
Next Tuesday, representatives of the European livestock sector will unite for a “flash action” at the EU institutions in Brussels.
The protesting farmers have had various grievances, including free trade agreements they say put them at a disadvantage; regulations which hinder their performance (including glyphosate bans planned in the next few years); and the low cattle prices in Ireland.
In the background are always the ups and downs of food markets; setbacks such as the Russian embargo, Brexit, and the Airbus tariffs on European food exports to the US; and CAP red tape.
There are dramatically reduced numbers of young farmers entering the sector in the EU to meet such challenges.
Perhaps the one grievance that unites farmers across the EU is what they condemn as “agri-bashing”, being blamed for climate ills, or perceived public hostility toward farmers, particularly from those who criticise their use of pesticides and treatment of animals.
Farmers feel they are the easy target, instead of the use of fossil fuels which accounts for almost 37 gigatons of the total 49 anthropogenic (human-caused) gigatons of greenhouse gases (GHG) per year.
Many “agri-bashers” state that food production globally causes one quarter of all green house gas, but they seem to make no allowance for agriculture and forestry globally soaking up as much carbon equivalent as they emit.
Methane from livestock is seen as the arch-enemy, but new World Meterological Organization data shows methane in the US was plateauing between 1999 and 2006 as expected, mostly because methane only stays in the atmosphere about 12 years.
However, methane started rising again after 2006, and the suspected cause is large-scale fracking extraction by the fossil fuel industry.
Agri-bashers do not seem to take such facts into account.
As a result, there is a risk that farmers will rebel, and their contributions to the environment could be lost.
To continue applying green practices, farmers deserve some sort of public recognition. Better understanding is needed of farmers’ decisions to adopt sustainable practices.
Those decisions are mostly based on the financial benefits, costs and risks of introducing environmentally friendly practices, but public recognition plays a role too."

Retailer Aldi has said it is “extremely disappointed” that farmers have protested at its distribution centre in Co Kildare - but demonstrators have warned the picket is the first of many to come.
The Irish Farmers’ Association has accused retailers of “hiding behind factories” and failing to do what they can to address the prices paid to beef farmers.
Speaking at the picket line at the Aldi regional distribution centre in Naas, IFA President Joe Healy warned they would protest outside more retailers until their price demands are met.
“This is the first of many protests,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.
The 12 hours demonstration followed a meeting earlier this week of the Beef Task Force - a body that was established to address the issues that prompted farmers’ protests at meat processing plants around the country.
However the IFA said the meeting did little to assure them that their core demand of higher prices paid to farmers would be met.
“There was no Minister there, no retailer. Meat Industry Ireland came in with nothing to offer. The best we could get from them was that they would consult with their members,” Mr Healy said.
The IFA’s National Livestock Committee Chairman, Angus Woods, said that the gap between what Irish farmers are getting for beef compared to their UK and European counterparts.
While the meat plants are at the table with farmers and the Department in the Beef Task Force, the retailers and the food services sector are nowhere to be seen.
""They are hiding behind the factories and are trying to dodge their responsibility for low prices for prime meat and the unacceptable delays in increasing prices to farmers,” Mr Woods said.
""Without a positive move on prices across the industry, protests and disruption will continue,"" he said.
In a statement, Aldi said it “welcomed the resumption of the Beef Taskforce this week and have engaged positively with farmer representative organisations on the beef issue over recent months”.
“Aldi has a policy of open communications with all of its stakeholders, including the IFA.
To be very clear, Aldi received no request for engagement on this issue from any member of the IFA leadership, no communication about specific concerns about the mechanics of the beef market, including age specification, and no warning of any grievance the IFA had before this morning.
“Aldi is fully committed to co-operating with the Beef Taskforce and met with one of the representative groups, the Beef Plan Movement (BPM), as recently as last week to further update our position. As part of our preparations for the Taskforce, we have initiated research on a wide range of beef products to determine a number of issues. Our work also includes a complete review of procedures and processes with our suppliers to ensure we are meeting all customer and market requirements.
“Aldi is a proud supporter of Irish beef and all of our fresh meat, including our beef is 100% Irish and Bord Bia Assured. This is a cornerstone of our commitment to our customers.
""We remain committed to reporting back through the Taskforce and playing a fulsome role in the process. Any action outside of this process is short-sighted and not constructive,” the retailer said.
Meanwhile, Leo Varadkar has said it “doesn't seem fair” that Irish farmers are getting a lower price for their beef than their European counterparts.
Speaking on Thursday, the Taoiseach said things have gotten worse for farmers and said he does not see any real justification for Irish farmers being paid less.
“Things have actually deteriorated. We find out that Irish farmers are getting a price for beef at the factory gate that is lower than the European average and that doesn't seem fair to me,” he told reporters at Dublin Castle.
“I think we need to give the beef taskforce a chance to do its work. But I don't see any reasonable justification as to why Irish farmers should be getting a lower price in the European average when only a few months ago they weren't getting European average,” he added."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30968644.html,2019-12-05 18:00:00,There were always rebels and rebellions...,"Hello again. Maybe it would not be a bad idea to forget about turkey stuffing and jingling bells for a while, and apply yourselves instead to a surprising pure Irish historical reality. OK?
Ye need a diversion anyway and it is to be found here as always for you faithful regular readers.
I doubt if even the most fractious of you, and the best informed on political matters, will be able to take factual issue with what follows here, as we trudge down the centuries that have shaped our lives and times.
Accordingly, I attach my aging right auricle to perhaps the sharpest side of my tongue, which often tries to adhere to my left cheek, as I state that beyond reasonable doubt, even the ferocious raiding Vikings, in their era, failed to impose themselves on the Irish race, only being able to control a narrow coastal strip we know as the Pale.
Centuries later Cromwell attacked us fiercely but still failed to subdue the natives.
King William of Orange might have won the affray at the Boyne but he, too, never beat us down afterwards.
There were always rebels and rebellions. The dreadful Black and Tans, in their time, failed too and generated the fighting that created the Irish Free State in jig time, and our independence across three of the Four Green Fields ever since.
Is that again not a fragment of the pure truth?
Now, consider the incredible achievements of Minister Shane Ross in the modern era. Without firing a single shot from a Mauser or rifle of any kind, in just a few years in Leinster House, Minister Ross has taken total control of all rural Ireland outside the old Pale.
His policies, especially in relation to driving habits on what were once busy country roads, have saved thousands of country lives, maybe including yours and mine.
We need to retain our driving licenses to continue to exist in some fashion in rural Ireland, and the strict new Ross regulations, especially in relation to drinking and driving, or, more recently, increased penalties for speeding offences, means, quite properly I’m certain, in the interests of all country citizens, that the majority of our roads are eerily almost empty, especially once the business day is over.
And that is not the half of Minister Ross’s almighty success in putting manners on us rural dwellers. A lateral development due to our fear of losing personal transport, has led to the closure in recent years of hundreds of country public houses all along the Wild Atlantic Way and beyond.
Those were the pubs where we peasants were wont to congregate, sing rebel songs, drink far too many pints of porter for our own good, and loudly complain about government policies, especially in relation to prices for farm produce like beef and lamb and, indeed, seasonal flocks of turkeys and geese.
Nowadays, as you travel (carefully and soberly, for God’s sake) through the countryside, everywhere the For Sale signage swings and rusts outside the shuttered frontages of the pubs which, even up to the recent past, were the arenas in which our rebellions against political bosses frothed over the pints along the bar.
Is that not once again a folkloric class of a fragment of the purest of truths?
The lads who used to line up along the bars of the isolated country pubs, now trading no more, are not grateful enough, in many cases, to the farsighted Shane Ross’s tactics which have certainly saved many of their lives and certainly their driving licenses for cars, tractors, and farm machinery.
I’ve heard critics of the current policies suggesting that a significant percentage of those lads, afraid to venture out to the pubs as of yore, now are sitting at home, often alone and lonesome and depressed in themselves and drinking far more alcohol bought in slabs in supermarkets and off-licenses in the nearest large town, than they would ever have downed in what used to be their country pub, now closed a mile or two down the twisty back roads of the parish.
I’ve even heard it suggested forcefully enough that the statistics of the sharply reduced road fatality figures achieved by Shane Ross could also be related by somebody smarter than me to an apparently rising level of rural suicide rates amongst such decent folk.
Judge for yourselves.
There will always be critics out there. For myself, with my tongue still trying to adhere to my cheek, I would like to thank the mighty rural ruler for saving my driving license to date, and maybe even my life, on motorways that seem to get faster as I get slower, and for quietly succeeding in achieving the feat which defeated King William of Orange, Cromwell in his day, and the Black and Tans. Maybe that is the pure truth.
Ye can return now to getting the turkey ready for the big day or hanging up the Christmas lights and the tinsel decorations. I’m away to the pub for the rest of the night."

Farmers are blockading the Lidl distribution centre in Charleville in Cork this morning, and it comes after a protest in Kildare yesterday.
The blockade in Cork started at 7am this morning, and will continue until 7pm tonight.
IFA President Joe Healy says with the way prices are at the minute, they have no other choice but to protest.
""This will continue and we have to get a price increase because our farmers can't take any more of it,"" said Mr Healy.
""Last Monday week, the IFA handed a letter in to Meath Industry Ireland and handed one in to the Minister for Agriculture and it was on the back of the first Price Index from Bord Bia that showed the gap between Ireland and the UK and the EU.
""And that was demanding an immediate price increase. Then, eight days later there was no movement.""
John Coughlan, Munster Regional Chairman of the IFA, organised today's protest in Cork.
He is a beef farmer and he said that the current prices are having negative impact on his livlihood.
""The impact that it is having is that every animal that I have slaughtered this year, I have lost up to €150 each which to me is between €15-18m.
""We need to get the returns from the European market back to Irish farmers.""
Eamon Corley, co-chairman of Beef Plan Movement, believes farmers, retailers and factory owners all need to be part of talks.
""I do think we need all the supermarket chains to be involved in the taskforce and we also need the factory owners moreson than Meat Industry Ireland,"" said Mr Corley.
""Meat Industry Ireland have always said that they can't talk about price but price is the big issue.""

He highlighted that Irish beef farmers have lost a staggering €60 million to date due to the meat industry’s failure to honour their commitments, with farmers set to lose another €20 million by the end of the year if a price deal is not agreed.
“We have 20 days to save €20 million. Every day that passes without progress, farm family livelihoods worsen.
""We need a new dynamic, because where we are is clearly not working,” Coughlan concluded.

The IFA has accused retailers of “hiding behind factories” and failing to do what they can to address the prices paid to beef farmers.
Speaking at the picket line at the Aldi regional distribution centre in Naas yesterday, IFA President Joe Healy warned they would protest outside more retailers until their price demands are met.
“This is the first of many protests,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.
The demonstrations follow a meeting earlier this week of the Beef Task Force - a body that was established to address the issues that prompted farmers’ protests at meat processing plants around the country.
However the IFA said the meeting did little to assure them that their core demand of higher prices paid to farmers would be met."

“The company is at a complete loss to understand why Joe Healy, the outgoing IFA President, pursued a course of irresponsible, disruptive and illegal action at retail distribution centres this week.

The 10c price increase will help shorten the gap of up to 50c between what farmers in Ireland get paid per kg compared with their UK and EU colleagues.
Prices have steadily slipped since 2017, and there are fears among farmers the domestic beef industry is at risk. This is because an increasing number of farmers can’t afford to be beef farmers anymore.
The ABP Food Group said in a statement that it will increase the base price of cattle for deliveries from next Monday.
But in making the announcement, the company - which is one of the country’s largest meat processors - condemned the decision by the Irish Farmers Association to protest.
Today’s protest, led by IFA President Joe Healy, was the second at major distributors. The first was at Aldi's plant in Co Kildare and today’s was held at Lidl’s distribution centre in Ballyhea, just outside Charleville.
That lasted throughout the day from 7am. Farmers are annoyed that more than eight days ago, they demanded an increase in prices in a letter to Meat Industry Ireland and the Department of Agriculture but nothing happened.
Joe Healy said:
We are doing this to get a price increase back to the Irish beef farmer. They have to get it because they cannot continue otherwise.
He declined to comment on the price rise until he had seen it in writing.
Dairy and beef farmer Harold Kingston, chairman of the IFA’s Cork Central branch, said: “I get about €800 per head of cattle at the factory. Two years ago, I could get around €1,000. There is something wrong when you have to sell something at less than what it cost you to produce in the first place.
“Part of the problem is that food is too cheap and is used as a loss leader by the supermarkets to get you in to buy all the other products, like washing powder and shaving blades. The odd thing in all of this is that we know how much farmers make on cattle sales, and we know how much people pay for their meat. What we don’t know is what the meat processors and the retailers are making on the meat. It’s like the Fourth Secret of Fatima.”
For its part, ABP said:
The company is at a complete loss to understand why Joe Healy, the outgoing IFA President, pursued a course of irresponsible, disruptive and illegal action at retail distribution centres this week.
“The Beef Task Force met on Tuesday and Joe Healy and the IFA were fully aware that market indications pointed towards a cattle price increase in Ireland. This was reported extensively.
“Joe Healy is also aware that cattle prices are quoted on a Friday and the timing of this stunt was motivated by competition for membership between traditional and new farm organisations. The price paid by ABP for cattle will always be determined by the prevailing market conditions and those conditions have recently improved.
“ABP can confirm, as was indicated on Tuesday at the Beef Task Force, that it will increase the base price of cattle for deliveries from next Monday.
A Department of Agriculture spokesperson said: ""Farmers should be paid the maximum price that the market will allow. Positive engagement through producer organisations and the Beef Market Taskforce is the best way to progress farmers interests."""

More than 50 farmers travelled from their farms around Munster to protest at Lidl’s distribution centre near Charleville, Cork yesterday. Many greeted each other like old friends.
Some were veterans of the Meat Movement protests from earlier in the year. Indeed, some had fresh memories of protesting outside nearby Dawn Meats.
Two large bales of straw were duly dropped into position on either side of the entrance to the massive grey-coloured plant, leaving just about enough room for a car to pass through.
A cattle trailer, which would later double up as a meeting room sheltered from the elements, was positioned at the far end of the main gate.
Among those protesting was Charleville IFA chairperson Gay Cagney — a beef farmer who has seen her profits vanish in the past two years, from €3.90 per kg in November 2017, to €3.20.
She determinedly clutched a folded sheet with prices down through the years written on it in biro. She unfolded it carefully for reporters and pointed to each figure.
Farmers demanding a fair price for their beef outside the Lidl distribution centre in Ballyhea, Charleville.
“There it is in black and white,” she said, jabbing the figures with her index finger.
“In 2017, I got €3.90. Now I get just €3.20.
“I have about 130 cattle I rear from calves for between 16-24 months before I sell them.
“Although I will pay around €150 for each one of them, I will easily have paid around €1,000 in feed and veterinary bills.
I am lucky if I break even now but I no longer make any profit and this situation can’t go on. This is a government problem, but it will soon become a problem for the people in the shops.
“If we can’t make a living out of it, we’ll just follow many of our colleagues and get out.
“And what people are witnessing now is potentially the beginning of the end of the Irish beef industry.”
Her sentiments were shared by her colleagues.
Every now and again as they talked quietly among themselves huddled round the flames coming from a fire lit in an old upturned petrol drum, a huge truck would pull up.
Few words were exchanged by either parties.
Farmers at the protest which began yesterday at 7am and lasted throughout the day.
The trucks came every 30 minutes to an hour, slowing down as they approached the entrance, their drivers staring at the farmers.
Most truck drivers just parked up at the side of the road, flicked on their hazard lights and got on the phone to their boss before moving off eventually.
There has been no sign of the hostility that happened between a driver and farmers at a similar protest earlier in the week outside an Aldi in Co Kildare.
But at around 11.30am, gardaí moved on the driver of a large truck and trailer that was parked across the road from the entrance.
Officers then drove into the Lidl plant and parked up at the entrance, inside the blockade, before leaving the area around 30 minutes later.
From the farmer’s point of view, there were few other highlights during the day.
Morning rain gave way to afternoon sunshine, passing cars beeped their horns in support and farmers took it in turns to help direct traffic while trucks turned.
Trucks queuing up outside the Lidl distribution centre in Ballyhea, Charleville, where farmers were protesting.
Even the announcement on RTÉ’s One O’Clock News that Larry Goodman’s ABP Food Processors was going to increase the price was greeted with muted interest.
Although details were sketchy at 1pm, sections of a press release from the company later appeared on the internet.
An IFA official read it out to farmers gathered around the fire at the gate.
And as each paragraph was read out, they considered what was said.
IFA president Joe Healy, who was at the protest, was described in the statement as “outgoing president”.
“Jeepers,” said one farmer. “They had to get that in there that he is ‘outgoing’.”
Another laughed at the phrase used by ABP to describe the protest as “needless and irresponsible”.
“Paying a fair price for beef for a start would mean we wouldn’t need to protest in the first place,” he said, turning to the nods of acknowledgement from his colleagues."

The latest 12-hour blockade is taking place outside Tesco's main distribution centre in Donabate, north county Dublin.
Tesco have said that today's action is regrettable.
Products are usually driven from this hub - which is the size of 10 football pitches - to Tesco stores across the country.
But since 7am, a group of around 30 farmers have stopped any trucks getting in or out.

""We've had enought of it,"" said one farmer.
""We're not going to sit down and take this anymore. The abuse of farmers is over.""
Today's demonstration is part of the long-running dispute over beef prices.
On Friday, one of the largest beef processors in the country, ABP, announced it would increase the base price it pays for cattle from today.
But the IFA says the suggested rise of between 5 and 10c a kilo isn't enough.
The organisation says more protests will follow unless there is a significant price increase.

The Irish Farmers Association has accused retailers like Tesco of ""hiding"" behind meat factories in the ongoing beef price dispute.
IFA President Joe Healy has said the current situation cannot continue.
""The retailers have kind of got away scot-free in all of this and they've a major role to play in what is without doubt a dysfunctional food chain,"" said Mr Healy.
""The farmer is the price taker. We see the retailers and we see the processors make huge profits and the farmers struggling to survive.

""The farmers are selling at up to 50c and more below the cost of production. And that's not sustainable.""
Today's action is the latest in a series of blockades staged by the IFA over beef prices.
On Thursday, the IFA staged a blockade at the Aldi distribution centre in Naas, Co Kildare.
That was followed by a protest outside Lidl's centre in Charleville, Co. Cork.
The long-running beef price dispute saw ABP - one of the largest beef processors in the country - announce that from today the base price it pays for cattle would increase.
But the IFA says what is been offered is between 5 and 10c a kilo - which it hass described as ""paltry"".
The organisation wants a substantial price increase for farmers or more blockades, like the 12-hour one getting underway this morning, will follow.

Protesters say their actions, which have effectively shut down three distribution centres over three days so far, should continue because price rises don’t go far enough.
And the Irish Farmers Association says they will carry on until they get price parity with British and EU markets. Their farmers are being paid between 0.20c and 0.50c more per kg for beef than farmers are paid here.
The Tesco central distribution centre in Donabate, Co Dublin, became the latest target for the farmers’ protest yesterday. The action, which started at 7am, is part of an ongoing farmer campaign for increased beef prices.
As with two similar protests last week, it lasted 12 hours. The second protest, outside Lidl’s massive distribution centre in Ballyhea, near Charleville, north Cork, last Friday, led to Larry Goodman’s ABP group agreeing to raise prices. At the time, the base price at factories was €3.45 for steers and €3.50 for heifers while this week’s price has increased to €3.55 for steers and €3.55 for heifers.

December 9, 2019
But IFA president, Joe Healy, said yesterday these rises are still “over 0.50c off” the British price as their market continues to strengthen: “It is clear, based on market increases, that the factories including ABP could have increased cattle prices some weeks ago, but they did not. Instead, they pocketed the increases for themselves and refused to pass it back to farmers.”
And he said that “unsustainable discounting” of beef products at stores like Tesco “puts downward pressure on beef prices”. He also said it is “an insult to farmers and the work they do”. And he added: “The IFA will continue with our action until we have a substantial price increase.”
Tesco had beef online yesterday at prices per kg ranging from €5.99 for their Finest Certified Irish Angus beef round roast to €17.74 for ribeye Angus steak.
A Tesco spokeswoman said: “At Tesco, we have always maintained a good working relationship with the IFA, so (yesterday’s) action at our distribution centre is regrettable. Tesco is one of the biggest supporters and purchasers of Irish food and drink globally. We are proud that all our own-label fresh beef, pork, lamb and chicken is 100% Irish and Bord Bia approved.
""All Tesco own-label fresh beef is sourced through processors, who agree prices directly with farmers. The price customers pay for beef products in our stores is not related to the price farmers receive from the processors. As a business we pay for any price promotions we run. Tesco supports the Beef Taskforce and agrees it is the correct mechanism for resolving challenges in the beef sector.”

The Beef Task Force, which first met at the start of Dec, was set up after the beef blockades ended in Sept. It is designed to be a forum for all interested parties to air concerns so solutions to these concerns can be met through some form of consensus.
At the meeting earlier this month, there was a call for an immediate rise in the base price paid for beef.
Emerging from the meeting all of the leading farming representative organisations said there is an urgent need for the base price paid for cattle to increase. This was made by Irish Cattle & Sheep Farmers Association, and it was backed by the IFA, the Beef Plan Movement and the Irish Creamery milk Suppliers Association."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30969519.html,2019-12-10 09:37:00,Farmers continue protests with blockade at Musgraves in Kildare,"Farmers are continuing their campaign for higher beef prices with a protest in Kildare this morning.
The Irish Farmers' Association has blockaded the Musgraves Central Distribution Centre in Kilcock.
It follows a similar demonstration in Dublin yesterday, as well as two in Cork and Kildare last week.
IFA President Joe Healy says beef farmers should not accept the current beef price on offer from the factories.
Mr Healy said: ""[The] very clear message to the retailers is, they're part of a very dysfunctional chain that's not passing back a viable margin to the beef farmers.
""And we want the retailers to get a clear message to the beef processors, that a significant price increase has to happen and happen immediately.""
John Coughlan, who is Munster Regional Chairman of the IFA, has said farmers deserve better.
""Every euro that goes into farming in rural Ireland contributes €4.30 to the local economy,"" he said.
""That is critically important to rural Ireland. Our beef exports have increased 64% in the last nine years.
""That's on the back of the green, clean image that we Irish farmers produce beef under.
""There are 75,000 beef farmers in Ireland. A third of them earn less than €8,000 a year."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30969621.html,2019-12-10 16:53:00,Investigation underway following theft of beef carcasses,"A cross-agency investigation is underway following the theft of beef carcasses which has raised fears unsafe meat will enter the market.
Food businesses have been alerted after a container with a consignment of beef - the hind quarters from 36 carcasses - was stolen from a Northern Ireland food business.
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) said it is working closely with the Local Authority Veterinary Service, the HSE, An Garda Síochána and the Food Standards Agency Northern Ireland following the theft.
The authority warned there is a possible risk to public health if the carcasses are not processed properly. Some of the carcasses came from animals over 30 months of age - meaning the vertebral column must be treated as specified risk material.
“There is no way of knowing whether beef purchased from unregistered sources adhere to food safety requirements around cutting, storage and handling,” said Dr Pamela Byrne, chief executive, FSAI.
“Proper cutting, storage and handling of beef at all times is a critical element in food safety management. As such, we are urging food businesses and consumers alike to be vigilant against purchasing beef from unregistered sources at any time,” she said.
Meanwhile, farmers continued their protests today over the prices paid for beef.
Members of the Irish Farmers’ Association mounted a 12 hour blockade of the Musgraves Central Distribution Centre in Kilcock, Co Kildare, following similar demonstrations at Tesco, Aldi, and Lidl centres.
IFA President Joe Healy said the latest Bord Bia Beef Price Index shows evidence of a growing gap between Irish prices and export markets, and that factories have enjoyed an improvement in beef market prices.
“The facts are the factories held back on these market price improvements to farmers over the last five to six weeks and the Bord Bia Price Index proves this,” Mr Healy said.
Irish farmers should be getting a higher price for their stock, supplies are tightening and farmers should hold out for more.
The IFA has said EU Commission beef price data shows that cattle prices in the UK have increased to the equivalent of €4.13/kg, which is 52c/kg or €187 per head ahead of Irish prices.
“This level of a price gap is unsustainable and Irish cattle prices have to rise further, immediately,” Mr Healy said.
“We don’t have to wait for ""price-setting Friday"" as stated by ABP. Factories should increase prices today and we are driving home the message to retailers 'Tell your suppliers to treat farmers fairly',” he said.
Mr. Healy said farmers were also angry that SuperValu was promoting a ‘save 33%’ offer on Irish beef at the weekend.
“This unsustainable discounting ends up being paid for by farmers,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30970050.html,2019-12-12 13:52:00,"Asking price of €7,500 per acre in West Cork","As one travels east in West Cork, the quality of land and depth of soil generally increases.
The craggier tracts tend to be located farther west and in areas where the land is higher.
The area around the coastal village of Leap features a lot of fertile pockets, and whenever any parcels of land come on the market, there is usually a good degree of interest from a variety of sources.
Such is the case with a 26.5-acre residential holding that’s newly listed with Clonakilty-based auctioneer Henry O’Leary.
The farm is located in the townland of Tullig, approximately 7.5km inland from Leap village, 8.5km from Rosscarbery, and 14km from Clonakilty.
Cork Airport is 60km away.
The land quality varies within this holding, as selling agent Henry explains: “There are about 15 acres of it that is excellent, level, easily worked land. And then there’s about 11.5 acres that would need reclamation.”
The area where the work is required to bring it up to a good standard is mainly in the western boundary of the property, at a point where it backs onto an established forestry plantation.
“The location is quite central,” Henry points out.
“The main N71 route is quite close to the property, so it’s easily accessible.”
Access to the land is via a public road. From there, an internal roadway leads to the remainder of the fields and to the house, which is in a derelict condition, in a setting surrounded by trees.
“Access to the property is easy,” says Henry.
“It has road frontage to the right of the lane, probably about 100m of it.
The better land and the farmhouse are tucked away at the end of the lane. The house is quite discreetly located.
Small to medium sized holdings such as this one can often generate strong interest because they attract bidders from various quarters, not always from a strictly farming background.
The old farmhouse is derelict but its existence provides the possibility for someone to get planning permission to build their own home.
“The interest in it is quite varied,” says Henry. “We have some interest in it from people who want to use it as a hobby farm and as a base for a family home and I also have some local farming interest.”
It is an area dominated more by dairying, but there are other farming sectors here too.
However, one would suspect that a buyer from the milk sector will be the most likely to purchase it.
“There’s a lot of dairying in the area, but there’s also sheep and beef farming here.”
The asking price of €200,000 (€7,500 per acre) is probably a good reflection of what it is worth, with its particular location and mixture of land quality.
With brisk interest, it shouldn’t hang around on the market for too long, one would imagine. The only question will be to see what kind of farmer buys it, whether a full-timer or a part-timer looking to build a house here.
“It’s a realistic price guide, and it should be achievable,” says Henry.
“It’s hard to predict what way it’s going to go, because it fits quite nicely into both categories, as an extension to an existing holding or it would be a fabulous hobby farm for someone who wants something different.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30970643.html,2019-12-15 22:08:00,IFA to set to name new president following lengthy campaign,"Tomorrow, the Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) will name a new president after a lengthy campaign which came to a conclusion last Friday, December 13.
Lucky for some, including the man who will succeed outgoing president Joe Healy, the Galway man who has steadied the ship after the ructions in late 2015 that pitched the country’s largest farming representative body into national controversy.
The IFA national count will take place at the Castleknock Hotel in Dublin tomorrow and the new president will take up office at the annual general meeting in January.
The vote, which also selects the IFA deputy president, has taken place and is truly a representative poll, with almost 1,000 IFA branch meetings, from Arainn Mhor Island off Donegal to Bere Island off Co Cork, held between November 25 and December 13.
The big question now is who has secured victory — John Coughlan from the Buttevant branch in North Cork, Tim Cullinan from the Toomevara branch in North Tipperary, or Angus Woods from the Barndarrig branch in Wicklow.
‘I will be taking the fight directly to the factories’
Tim Cullinan
Tim Cullinan has beenfarming in Toomevara for more than 40 years across dairy, beef, tillage, and pig farming. He cites his 15-year track record in IFA committees and county roles and the results secured, such as leading the negotiations on the nitrates derogation and securing bonus payments for the quality of Irish pigmeat.
He also said he has battled with the Department of Agriculture on what he said were “unfair inspections that cost North Tipperary farmers €1.2m” and that he also negotiated a €140m compensation package for farmers on the dioxin crisis.
His campaign rhetoric has hit a harder edge than his competitors. He stated that “unsustainable” cattle prices would be his first priority if elected, adding: “I will be taking the fightdirectly to the factories.”
He is also demanding that factories negotiate directly with beef finishers and wants the €100m Beam Scheme be reopenedimmediately. There are also calls to “cut the red tape” and more generous CAP payments to suckler, hill and lowland farmers, as well as improved milk prices.
According to his campaign literature: “I’m requesting Teagasc to produce a report showing Ireland’s unique grass-based dairy system produces less methane emissions than any other country in the world.”
He also wants there to be a “radical overhaul of IFA’s structures” to include new, elected committees.
Yet, despite striking a harder note in his campaign, unlike his rivals for the top job, Mr Cullinan was not front and centre at the recent protest actions at retailers and told the Irish Examiner.
“I will be straight with you, I don’t think it’s an opportune time to be protesting at retailers up to the Christmas period,” he said.
He believes discussions with processors are key to achieving the fair price of €4 a kg, adding: “I don’t think protesting at retailers is the way to do that.”
He is also aware of the possibility of a mass exodus of suckler farmers when existing schemes end next year but says those farmers need to be kept in the industry, believing the Government should be compensating farmers for maintaining the “carbon sink” or grassland and for their role in “keeping rural Ireland open”.
He also said if elected he would be putting Teagasc under pressure to do more research in relation to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.
He stressed that he was the only candidate with a hard plan on how to restructure the IFA, noting how other organisations such as Beef Plan have sprang up in recent times, threatening the IFA’s role as the main representative body for farmers in the country.
“The IFA has been around for a long number of years, the IFA’s business is lobbying on behalf of farmers, and it’s time for change now again,” he said.
‘Increase farm incomes and secure fair prices’
John Coughlan
John Coughlan is a dairy, beef, and tillage farmer who, alongside his wife Ann, and children Michael and Helena, runs a farm on which they are milking 100 cows, finishing more than 100 cattle, and growing cereals.
With 25 years of experience as an IFA campaigner, he’s filled multiple roles, from Munster IFA vice president to county chairman, livestock chair and environment chair of North Cork IFA. He has also featured on the organisation’s CAP project team.
On his campaign leaflets, he points to achievements such as a 33% cut in import tariffs on ammonium fertilisers, the €100m beef fund amount secured on the Beam scheme, and the 26% rise in compensation for farmers affected by gas infrastructure developments.
His campaign manifesto, ‘Securing the Future of Farming in Ireland’, hits many of the themes outlined by his rivals, and all are agreed that this is a perilous time for the industry and one marked more recently by increasingly militant actions.
Listing his priorities, he said he wants to increase farm incomes and secure fair prices and boost supports so farmers can secure their full schemes and entitlements, but he also said he wants to “reform the IFA to get it back working for farmers” as well as securing that elusive contract between farmers and meat processors. He also wants to drive a farmer retirement scheme while encouraging younger farmers.
Earlier this month, he found himself in the middle of the Charleville protest.
“The beef market has been moving ahead right across Europe,” he said. “It’s not over yet and it will convince the retailers that there has to be a change of mindset. Retailers do normally discount fresh food in the lead-up to Christmas and we are ensuring it does not happen.”
As for a possible suckler exodus next year, he said the IFA must ensure that those schemes are “maintained and reinvigorated” as the sector is “critical to rural Ireland”.
“It would be a job for IFA to ensure those supports are maintained,” he said.
Regarding climate change and agriculture’s role in it, he argues that, from a European point of view it can’t be looked at as a country-specific issue. If Ireland is an efficient producer of beef in terms of carbon output, then it is better to maintain that than allow imports into Europe from South America.
“As a nation, agriculture is producing over 30% of our carbon but that’s because we don’t have the heavy industries the rest of Europe have,” he said. “It’s a cheap way of attacking agriculture.”
He said a previous retirement scheme did work and would work again if introduced, as many farmers, far from the image of being slow to let go, would release the reins if they were financially secure to do.
“One of the real issues is the fact that food products have been devalued over years, consumer spending is less than 9% of income on food,” he said. “That is an issue for those of us producing that food.”
‘I will defend farming against unfair attacks’
Angus Woods
Angus Woods, the IFA Livestock Committee Chairman since 2016, farms full-time with his family at Rathnew, Co Wicklow, where they operate a mixed enterprise farm with beef, suckler cows, sheep and barley.
He has also served as president of the European Commission’s Civil Dialogue Group on Animal Products and vice chairman of the COPA Beef Group and is a member of the EU Commission’s Meat Markets Observatory Group. On top of all this, he has represented Ireland with distinction as an international rower.
The youngest of the three candidates, he has referred to his work on the €100m Beam scheme and his efforts in securing €40m of additional money for a suckler cow support scheme as well as an increase in live exports, including exports to Turkey.
He also cited the significant reduction in the department levy on calf exports and what he described as the “naming and shaming of factories engaged in illegal trimming”.
As for his priorities, he said he would work to secure the CAP budget and, as outlined by his competitors, focus on boosting incomes.
Part of that would be a demand for a sheep welfare scheme payment of €30/ewe and a quality assurance bonus of 30c/kg, market transparency when it comes to livestock prices, and maximum inclusion of Irish grain in feed compounds and Irish spirits.
“I will defend farming against unfair attacks under the banner of climate action,” he said.
In October, Woods was re-elected chairman of the EU Commission Civil Dialogue Group on Animal Products.
He said: “I look forward to continuing to drive the agenda on behalf of farmers at the highest levels in Europe.”
In an interview with the Bray People in September, he looked back at his younger days as a rower,including winning selection for the 1989 junior World Championships while still in sixth year at King’s Hospital secondary school.
He also won an IFA scholarship to the agricultural college at Gurteen, while in the boat he went on to represent Ireland at the senior World Championships — early European experience — although he described the difference in preparation between the Irish team and the defending champions, Italy.
“They went to Saint Moritz to train while we went to Galway, where we were blown out of it for four weeks,” he said.
He still rows on the Liffey every Sunday morning and told his local paper: “We do need activities outside the farm gate to keep the head right. I am totally immersed in agriculture, so for me to have breakfast every Sunday morning with a bunch of non-farmers who throw a different slant on it is good.”
As for the top job, the man yet to celebrate his 50th birthday said: “It is a young person’s game and it is demanding.”"

It is calling on the Agriculture Minister to hold an immediate meeting of the Beef Market Taskforce to hold them to account.
The IFA said the Bord Bia price index shows Irish prices for beef are now behind the European and UK prices.
IFA President Joe Healy said farmers may ""blockade"" retail distribution centres again, depending on what happens at the meeting.
""Everything is there to do in the future, we had the blockades last week, nothing is off the table,"" he said.
""We will give an opportunity to the beef taskforce to meet this week and see where we go from there."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30970753.html,2019-12-16 15:30:00,Supply backlog expected to affect beef market for first quarter,"Last week’s resounding election victory for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party brought good news for the Irish beef industry.
Currency markets reacted, with sterling reaching its strongest levels against the euro since 2016.
Sterling weakness since the UK Brexit referendum had dramatically reduced the euro value of Irish beef exports to the UK market, which takes about half of our production.
A further strengthening of sterling in 2020 could lead to a more optimistic outcome for Irish cattle prices, said Teagasc experts in their Outlook 2020 Economic Prospects for Agriculture report.
They forecasted a moderate 2020 increase in Irish cattle prices, in the form of the Irish beef sector agreement bonuses announced in September.
But they assumed the euro-sterling exchange rate remaining at the mid-November 2019 level.
Now, sterling's strongest rally in over a decade means the moderate increase expected in Irish cattle prices may be exceeded in 2020,  and cattle farmers can take heart from currency experts who suggest further gains for sterling are likely.
However, Teagasc experts see over-supply depressing cattle prices in the early months of the year, due to the current backlog of cattle persisting for the first quarter of 2020, adding to the large supply for slaughter.
And the higher average price predicted by Teagasc for finished cattle across 2020 is unlikely to have a major impact on calf, weanling and store cattle prices.
The Teagasc prediction is that prices for weanling and store cattle will pick up by 2% in 2020. Calf prices are expected to continue on their downward trajectory.
For the year as a whole, no change in overall Irish beef production is forecast, despite the small reduction in stocking rate on suckler farms in the BEAM scheme.
Teagasc experts predict a 6% decrease in overall feed expenditure on cattle farms in 2020.
Cheaper fertilisers, but slightly higher contracting charges, are predicted to reduce total expenditure on pasture and forage 3-4% for Irish cattle farmers in 2020.
While the top one-third of suckling and finishing cattle farms often earn positive net profits, most persistently fail to cover their costs of production with the value of output sold.
The Outlook 2020 forecast is for net profit to improve slightly on suckler farms but, on average, to remain negative.
Net margins in cattle finishing are forecast to decline to a negative average of €60 per hectare. However, these predictions may prove pessimistic if, along with further sterling strengthening, growth in beef exports to China could contribute positively to beef prices and incomes.
In the longer term, with milkers now approximately two-thirds of the cows in the EU, dairy beef will increasingly dictate trends in the industry, noted Teagasc experts."

Next October sees the completion of the first BDGP scheme and, with very long delays on any CAP reform, it may well be the case that there is no replacement scheme for those involved in the current one.
GLAS may be in the same boat!
With the current beef climate, it is anticipated that the end of the BDGP for many suckler farmers may also accelerate the reduction in the national herd.
I have recently spoken to a few pedigree beef breeders who tell me that sales of bulls for next spring’s breeding season have been unusually slow.
Many suckler herdowners buy bulls well in advance of them going to work, but this seems not to be happening right now.
If you intend to use a stock bull next spring, the right thing to do is still to get any new bull onto your farm well in advance of the breeding season.
That way, the bull can settle in and acclimatise to the disease pressures and environment unique to your farm.
You can then take control of his parasite control and vaccinations.
2019 difficulties
This year can only be described as another extremely difficult year for Irish beef producers.
When I attempted last December to predict what 2019 had in store for us, I couldn’t have foreseen how bad it could get.
For the whole year, prices for finished cattle, stores and weanlings have been very poor, which has hugely eroded farm incomes, yet again.
Processors and retailers have way too much control in our industry and, as a result, we have seen constant unrest since the summer.
The large multiple retailers continue to treat Irish beef producers with contempt by coaxing consumers into their stores with below cost selling of our quality beef.
We are not even close to being in the same ball-park on price versus our EU and UK counterparts.
Legislators must implement a groceries order, preventing below cost selling.
It must gall every farmer to hear the TV and radio ads leading with half-price and one-third-off meat offers, day after day.
The retailer doesn’t take the hit for this discounting!
I can’t predict that the next decade will be known as the roaring 20s for beef producers, all I know is that we are entering more challenging times, and our consumers, and retailers, had better appreciate us soon, before we are gone! There are markets out there for our produce, and all we ask for is a fair and equitable proportion of our animals’ value at sale.
Looking after our own
Of course, there is lots that can be done around our own farmyards to help control costs and improve productivity, but the sales price of our cattle is the biggest strain on our bottom line.
It is, I am sure, of great frustration to many of you to see the farm organisations constantly having a go at each other, when unity is what is required right now. We have seen new bodies appear over the last 12 to 18 months, but they have done nothing to instil confidence in them.
It seems that some of them are full of egos, and have become self-preservation societies.
The message from grassroots farmers is, “get your acts together or, get lost”. We also need to stop blaming other enterprises for the beef price, and stand together.
All farm enterprises need to stand together, we need each other for survival.
As this is my last beef article for 2019, I would like to wish all readers a very happy Christmas and a prosperous 2020. Thank you for all the feedback, both positive and negative, via email and when we meet at shows and on farms.
It is much appreciated."

With our chestnuts starting to roast on an open fire, our faces aglow, and even our meat factories raising their price in honour of the big day, God bless us everyone, things really couldn’t get any better.
The only substance missing is the snow, snow falling all around, and old Shaky Stephens dancing with Santa Claus.
And there was I, and you too probably, thinking that our meat factories were run by covetous old cranks who couldn’t give a toss about you or me.
But they do give a toss!
They do!
They have tossed us a shilling of an increase on steers, my lad, God bless us everyone.
A shilling of a Christmas bonus. A shilling that will most certainly be put to good use purchasing gifts and presents for family and friends.
A shilling that would surely warm the cockles of any heart.
So I ask you, I plead with you, I beseech you, to raise a glass in honour of the Work House, sorry, I mean the meat factory. The place that exudes generosity. The place, my dear friends, that has made our life and indeed our industry what it is today.
It really does bring a tear to the eye, excuse me while I blow my nose.
But celebrations aside, we must get back to reality.
We must get back to real business. Just because it’s Christmastime at the meat factory, we can’t lose the head entirely.
Back in the real world, at the cattle mart, this week we see numbers remaining high, with prices to match. It’s as straightforward as that.
We will start with Geraldine Walsh of Clare Co-Op Marts, who gave us this report after last Thursday’s cattle sale in Ennis.
We had a good entry of stock on Thursday, with almost 700 on offer. The trade for store bullocks was very strong, up €20/head on last week. Cows and heifers similar to last week.
“A good entry of aged bulls averaged €1.48/kg. A top call of €1,540 was paid for a Hereford bull of 992kgs.
“We had plenty of customers for all stock.”
Looking at the more recent sale of weanlings and sucklers at Ennis mart on Tuesday, Ann Keane of Clare Co-Op Marts reported, “We had a bigger sale than expected on Tuesday, with over 300 head on offer.
“Overall, the trade finished up on a positive note for the year-end.
“A very mixed run of suckler stock topped out at €1,490.
“Runner heifers made to €745 and runner bulls to €770.

I was talking to a farmer in recent days, a former calf rearer, and he told me he will not get back into calf rearing until he can get one of them much talked about free calves, and a bag of milk replacer thrown in for good measure,
Well it looks like he will have to hold tough for another spell for the free calf. In Bandon on Monday, free calves (or Friesian bulls) were selling from €10 to €130 a head, with stronger runner type ‘free calves’ selling up to €360.
The mart had 230 calves on offer, but no free ones yet.
Looking at the bigger animal, dry cows here sold from €250 under to €400 over the kilo. Friesian bullocks sold from €130 to €355 over the kilo.
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus steers sold from €240 to €545 with their weight. Continental steers made from €300 to €550 with the kilo.

The name is Kiwanuka, Michael Kiwanuka.
Prior to this year, this 32-year-old musician would have been best known for his song ‘Cold Little Heart’ on the Netflix series Big Little Lies.
He also had a cameo on Danny Boyle’s tribute to the Beatles music, Yesterday.
Kiwanuka is the London-born son of Ugandan parents who spent his early adulthood as a session musician before doing his own thing.
In September, he released his third album, Kiwanuka.
Album of the year in the A-Z compiler’s humble opinion.
B – Byrne, Gay
The news filtered through on the afternoon of November 4. Gay Byrne was dead at 85.
His illness was well known and he was no spring chicken, but for anybody over 40 it was difficult to fathom.
For 37 years, he had hosted RTÉ’s flagship TV show and, for much the same span, RTÉ Radio’s mid-morning programme.
He was an excellent broadcaster whose status was elevated further because of his timing.
He arrived when TV was a pup and was at the helm of debate in a country that had a lot of catching up to do.
He was uniquely at home with heavy current affairs or light entertainment and had that most vital broadcaster’s tool, a good ear.
Such was his timing and excellence that RTÉ has been valiantly trying to replace him ever since, but it can’t be done.
Byrne’s impact on the country was summed up two years ago on radio by poet Brendan Kenneally: “You encouraged Ireland to open up, to face the ghosts of darkness, let them rip, express the secret heart in sun and ice and rain. You gave us words, ideas, music, song. Often you made us laugh out loud and long. Beneath it all, you searched for what is true.”
C – Crown, The
The third series of the saga of the British royal family began in November.
The great mystery is the popularity of a series about the royal family in this decidedly Republican jurisdiction.
The new series, by general consensus, did not live up to expectation or the standards of the first two.
One reason for this is possibly the closer it comes to modern day, the less artistic licence that can be taken.
Still, the latest season did introduce new actors in the roles of Queen Elizabeth II and her wayward sis, Margaret, respectively Olivia Coleman and Helen Bonham Carter.
The big plan is for six seasons, but at this rate the makers might want to take another look at that schedule.
D - Direct Provision
The system of housing asylum seekers was rarely out of the news during the year, which marked the 20th anniversary of its introduction.
In that time, more than 64,000 people have passed through the system.
Currently, there are about 6,000 living in 37 centres across the State.
A number of protests took place during the year against the proposed siting of a new centres in various towns.
The most prominent of these was in Oughterard, Co Galway, in September where locals mounted a picket at the former hotel earmarked for asylum seekers.
At a public meeting to discuss the proposal, Independent TD Noel Grealish referred to asylum seekers as “spongers”, setting off a political backlash.
Yet, within weeks, the plan to locate the centre in the town was abandoned.
There has been constant speculation that nascent extreme right-wing individuals have been able to infiltrate protests but this has been consistently denied.
As of now, the system is destined to remain in place, but pressure to ensure that living conditions must meet the most basic standards is bound to continue.
E – European Elections
The European and local elections took place on May 24.
Sinn Féin lost two of its three seats in this jurisdiction and the Green Party picked up a couple of seats.
These changes reflected the contrasting fortunes of both parties, but there is caution as to whether this is a harbinger for next year’s general election.
The other big news was the victory for the Bonnie and Clyde — or should that be the Torvill and Dean, or maybe Kelly and Astaire — of Irish politics, Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.
The duo from the Independent Alliance contested seats in Dublin and Ireland South respectively, and both won comfortably.
Daly’s victory was widely predicted, but Wallace’s wasn’t.
Their respective elections robs national politics of two individuals, who, in their own unique styles, had a major input into holding government to account since 2011.
F – FAI
On St Patrick’s Day, the reign of King John began to unravel.
The Sunday Times published a story that FAI chief executive John Delaney had the previous year given a loan to the association.
On the face of it, close but no cigar.
Except Mr Delaney went to great lengths, including a last-minute injunction appeal, to stop the story.
A thread was pulled that day.
There followed a drip, drip of revelations about the extent of the damage that had been done under Delaney’s rule of the association.
By December, the financial mess the FAI was in was finally revealed by the Government, insisting there will be no bailout.
In 2014, when Johnny boy ruled the roost, the Sunday Independent made an online documentary about him entitled John The Baptist.
The great and the good worshipped at his feet, including Denis O’Brien, who told the programme: “John Delaney could run anything. John Delaney could run Uefa easily.
""He could run Fifa as far as I’m concerned, certainly better than Sepp Blatter, and more honestly.”
G – Grace, Brendan
The funnyman died on July 9.
His death would have been deeply mourned by the wider community beyond his family at any time, but there was special poignancy in this.
Grace had, until days before his end, been involved in a warm and gentle TV documentary in which he was promoting a choir for people with dementia, the Forget Me Nots.
The doc went out as scheduled in September, transmogrifying into a warm tribute to the deceased.
H – Hong Kong
The protests began on June 9. At issue was a new law that allowed for extradition to the Chinese mainland.
The protestors feared that this would interfere with judicial independence and crush dissent.
Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 but has since enjoyed certain autonomy and rights which are denied those in mainland China.
Pretty soon the protests were met on the streets of Hong Kong by pro-government protests, and police violence.
By September, the Hong Kong legislature had withdrawn the extradition bill but the cat was out of the bag.
Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against any push for separatism in Hong Kong, saying any attempt to divide China would end in “bodies smashed and bones ground to powder”.
The protests are taking place against a background where some democracies — including the US — are drifting towards autocratic rule.
In Hong Kong, they have lived under a form of benign autocracy for over twenty years and they’re getting nervous.
Lessons to be learned.
I – Irishman, The
“It is what it is.”
So went one of the best descriptions of a contract killing, issued by Joe Pesci’s character in this, one of the best movies of the year.
They came together for one last hurrah, Scorcese, De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci.
The movie is thoroughly modern in that it was financed by Netflix and uses technology to de-age the septigenerian stars over the course of the three-and-a-half hour reel.
The Irishman is based on a death-bed memoir of Irish-American hitman Frank Sheeran, who claimed he was the man who shot union leader Jimmy Hoffa, a crime that sits just below the assassination of JFK in terms of American conspiracy and folklore.
It’s definitely worth a watch, particularly as it’s now on Netflix, where it popped up four weeks after its cinema release in October.
Hot tip for the Oscars, with the most likely gong going to Pesci for a career defining role.
It is what it is. The movie, that is.
J – Julian Assange
Remember him? On April 11, the Australian founder of Wikileaks was ejected from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had been living for eight years.
Assange had sought asylum there after attempts to extradite him to Sweden on charges of sexual assault.
He claimed the changes were trumped up as a ruse to make it easier to extradite him to the USA.
Assange’s work had exposed American foreign policy, particularly in Iraq, in all its gore and torture.
Since April he has been held in Belmarsh prison in London, initially serving a sentence for skipping bail and now on remand awaiting a hearing on a US application to extradite him. His health is seriouslydeteriorating.
“He’s locked up twenty two or three hours a day,” his father John Shipton told the Irish Examiner on a visit to Ireland in September.
“Because those in it [the prison] are treated like terrorists, that’s what Julian is being subjected to.”
K – Katie Taylor
On November 2, the Wicklow fighter became a two-weight world champion when she defeated Christina Lanardatoue in the Manchester Arena for the WBO junior welterweight title.
She added this to the lightweight titles she retains and has now gone 15 fights undefeated since she began her professional career in 2016.
“Thank you so much for your support,” she said after the Manchester win.
“Making history again, breaking boundaries again. I’m a two-weight world champion and the best is yet to come.”
L- Love Island
In terms of reality TV dross, this is about as low as you can go. Young men and women are placed on an island.
They couple, they decouple, the audience sees how they get on, who is likeable, who is not, who is likely to get into bed with whomever else.
Irish TV has not sunk to that level yet, but interest in the fifth season of Love Island last May and June was feverish because of two of the contestants.
Maura Higgins from Co Longford was one of the favourites because she got on with so many of the islanders, but Greg O’Neill, a former rugby player from Dublin, emerged as the male half of the winning couple.
Both Maura and Greg were over there representing d’oul country and it was only massive.
When it was all over, they both came home to heroes’ welcomes.
Their achievements were spoken of in some quarters in the same breath as those of Katie Taylor and the fabulous O’Donovan rowing brothers from Skibbereen.
Truly, the world has gone mad.
M – Meat protests
The pickets began on July 28 at the gates of ABP in Cahir Co Tipperary.
Those picketing did so under the banner of the Beef Plan Movement, a group that might be described as the continuity Irish Farmers Association.
Their beef is with the meat processors and retailers, who they blame for the low prices paid to farmers.
By August 9, the meatindustry agreed to sit down for talks. An agreement of sorts was reached, but many farmers remained unconvinced as to the outcome.
A second wave of protests began in early September.
The culmination was a tractor rally in the centre of Dublin which began on the evening of November 26. It brought the city centre to a standstill and rural Ireland to the townies.
One farmer stood on his Massey Ferguson and addressed the assembled.
“We need every man and woman here to get on the phone, to get everyone that they can, every tractor that they can,” he said.
“We are not backing down. Get on the phones. We’ve started this and we’ll finish it.”
They did finish it the next day after further reassurances that their grievance will be examined in detail.
The issue appears on one level intractable but for many is a symbol of how some sections of society are being left behind while others thrive in the current economic climate.
N – Nancy Harris
It was good year for this young Irish, London-based playwright, the sharpest around at the moment.
In the autumn, she had two plays opening in Dublin and London simultaneously.
The Beacon had the pulse of a murder mystery in a very Irish setting while Two Ladies focused on two first ladies, from the US and France.
“Plays are kind of cool now,” Ms Harris told the Irish Times in September, “which they really, really weren’t when I was in Ireland. There was no interest.”
O – Old order consolidating
Tipp came back to win their first hurling all-Ireland since 2016 with performances that rarely dipped below captivating.
In men’s football, Dublin continued the county’s march towards world — yes, world! —domination, winning a historic five-in-a-row football titles.
Debate has raged as to the advantages enjoyed by a city state where Gaelic games are now mass participation sports.
On November 30, the rest of the country breathed a sigh of relief when Jim Gavin announced he was handing back the reins of the team to the county board.
Those who grasp at straws are hoping that in the absence of Gavin’s shaman like presence the dubs will slide.
Keep dreaming. Or praying.
Dublin also won the ladies title to complete a three-in-a-row and Galway won the camogie championship.
P – Paris trial
On May 27, Ian Bailey went on trial — in his absence — at the paglias de Justice in Paris for the murder of Sophie Toscana Du Plantier.
Ms Du Plantier’s badly beaten body was discovered on December 23, 1996.
Mr Bailey had been a suspect but the DPP repeatedly ruled there was insufficient evidence to bring him to trial.
The French do things differently. Under an ancient law concerning the deaths of French citizens abroad, they put him on trial.
Over five days, the trial developed into something of a farce.
French detectives gave opinions that he was guilty which was recorded as evidence.
One friend of Sophie’s gave evidence that, 20 years after the killing, she remembered something Sophie had told her about an Englishman in the weeks before her death.
Just two witnesses from west Cork gave evidence. Others were asked at short notice to appear at the trial.
Mr Bailey was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison.
His extradition was requested — for a third time — three weeks after the trial ended.
He was arrested on December 16 and bailed after the High Court endorsed an arrest warrant.
Q – Quinn Industrial Holdings
On September 17, Kevin Lunney, an executive with Quinn Industrial Holdings, was kidnapped near his home in Derrylin Co Fermanagh.
He was brought across the border and badly beaten by a gang who told him to resign his position in the industrial company.
The incident was the latest, and by far the most serious, in what appears to be a campaign against the company and its principles.
QIH rose from the ashes of the Quinn Group which went bust following the economic collapse in 2008.
In the outrage that followed the assault, Seán Quinn came forward to emphatically deny he had anything to do with incident.
Other executives — most of them one-time protégés of Seán Quinn — pointed out that the police had been ignoring the incidents that culminated with the assault on Mr Lunney.
There has since been arrests and charges laid against a number of individuals.
R – Russia, From, with love and affection for The Donald
On March 22, Robert Mueller submitted his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election to US attorney general William Barr.
The Mueller investigation had hung over poor Donald for two years as he spat and fumed that everybody was out to get him.
In the end, Mueller found that there was no collusion that met a criminal standard of proof between the Trump camp and the Russians in the presidential election, but the report was a little less clear cut on whether the president had obstructed justice.
“NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION KEEP AMERICA GREAT” the president tweeted.
The use of capital letters to emphasise the importance of a statement is a tactic that is very familiar to primary school-going children.
S – Shane Lowry
On July 21, Shane Lowry won The Open, his first major.
The tournament was held in Royal Portrush, Co Down, making it a home win of sorts.
Even for those of us who know little about golf and rarely follow it, this was something to savour.
Lowry is one of the most popular sportspeople in the country, modest yet determined, globe-trotting yet never straying far from his Gaelic football roots and family in Co Offaly.
“This feels like an out-of-body experience,” he said on the eighteenth green after claiming victory.
“I can’t wait to wake up on Monday morning and find out what it’s going to feel like then.”
Later that week, there was a huge homecoming in the town of Clara, a fabled place more accustomed to welcoming back All-Ireland winners or the odd Taoiseach.
T – Thunberg, Greta
Named as Time magazine person of the year, Thunberg has become both a driving force and symbol of the young generation destined to bear the burden of climate change.
In November last year, the then 15-year-old gave a Ted Talk in which she set out her agenda.
“I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism,” she said.
“That basically means I only speak when I think it’s necessary. Now is one of those moments.”
In mid-August, she sailed across the Atlantic to attend the UN Climate Change summit in New York.
Her high profile and straight talking has attracted criticism from world leaders, including the autocratic Russian leader Vladimir Putin and man-child Donald Trump.
After the teenager won the Time award, Trump felt compelled to issue the following tweet: “So ridiculous. Greta must work on her angermanagement problem, then go to a good old-fashioned movie with a friend. Chill, Greta, chill.”
Trump was understood to be of the opinion that he should be Time’s person of the year, as he was when he was elected in 2016.
U – UK election. Boris is the man
On December 12, the UK went to the polls armed with a Hobson’s choice for the next prime minister.
Boris Johnson has been fired from jobs in politics and in journalism for telling lies.
He led a fraudulent campaign in the Brexit referendum.
It is unclear how many children he has or whether he even acknowledges parenthood in some instances.
He lied repeatedly in the campaign and ran away from any interview that threatened to even prick beneath the surface of his projection as an amiable buffoon.
His brilliant election slogan — ‘Get Brexit Done’ — was a patent fraud.
Brexit will be with the British people for years to come.
He romped home in the election, winning a majority of 78 seats, the biggest Tory victory since Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp in 1987.
That he won and won so big, after a decade of deeply unpopular Tory austerity says all that needs to be said about his opponent, Jeremy Corbyn.
V – Varadkar, Leo
Twas the best of years and the worst of years for the Taoiseach.
On October 10, he flew to Liverpool to try to talk sense into Boris Johnson about Brexit.
He succeeded where most said he could only fail.
The bones of a deal came out of their chat and within weeks Brussels had nailed it down.
That deal has survived the chaotic House of Commons and the Brexit election and will now, in all likelihood, be implemented.
Varadkar received many plaudits for his input.
Then, as the year was closing out and Leo hoping to sail towards next year’s election as the man who saved Brexit, the Murphys raised their heads.
The Wexford by-election saw Fine Gael candidate Verona Murphy go off reservation with comments about asylum seekers and people without homes.
Then, in early December, it emerged that Cork North Central’s Dara Murphy had been effectively double jobbing in Europe while drawing his Dáil salary and expenses.
Both Murphys did damage to Leo, but particularly Dara.
W – World Cup in rugby
Never was so much expected of men in green.
They had beaten the All Blacks. They had ascended to the top of world rankings.
They even started the campaign in Japan on September 20 with a win over Scotland that had serious intent written all over it.
And then… things went pear shaped.
The effervescent Japanese loaded into these pretenders and knocked them back on their heels.
It was a wake-up call but the alarm was just put on snooze.
The inevitable end came with defeat the All Blacks in the quarter finals.
Then, to add insult to injury, Joe Schmidt — who did huge things for Irish rugby — published a book that was high on emptiness and low on insight.
The tome has been critically panned as a rush job.
X – XR, the common abbreviation for Extinction Rebellion
The non-violent civil disobedience environmental group (there’s a mouthful) had its first full year in 2019.
In this country, it got out of the starting blocks with a few protests and then the big one, Rebellion Week.
This took place on the week beginning October 7 with a colourful march around Leinster House and Government Buildings.
The week was flagged as one in which mass protests might bring parts of the city to a standstill to force everybody to sit up and take notice of the planet’s degradation.
It didn’t work out like that.
This was a rebellion that is occurring while most of the world walks on by.
Still, as things get worse the organisation is now in place to turn up the heat, so to speak.
Y – Yellow Vest Movement
Throughout the year the yellow vests, or des gilets jaunes, movement in France protested at economic and political conditions on a near weekly basis.
Emmanuel Macron did row back on proposals to hike up the price of fuel, but the unrest is still out there.
It is effectively the French expression of the turbulence in political life that has swept across the globe.
There are insiders, mainly in the cities, who are flying, and there are outsiders, mainly outside the cities, who struggle irrespective of healthy economic statistics.
Z – Zinedine Zidane
The former French midfield general and successful manager returned to the helm at Real Madrid on March 11.
“I have recharged my batteries,” he said. “I’m ready to coach this great club again.”
Zidane was brought back to halt the slide that had begun the previous year.
Far more importantly though, he’s a great man for Zs.
As such, he has got the A-Z out of a hole this year as there was no other Z around to speak of.
Go easy in the new year.
Stay in by the wall and trouble won’t find you."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30972689.html,2019-12-30 04:40:00,State Archives: Suspected fraud at Goodman-owned meat unit,"Suspected fraudulent activity at a meat packing unit owned by Larry Goodman was discovered in March 1989 just two months after gardaí had been alerted by the Department of Agriculture that the beef processing group was facing penalties of more than IR£1m for breaches of rules governing EC financial supports for the beef industry.
An investigation by Customs officials into the operation of Anglo Irish Beef Processors between September 1986 and February 1987 found Goodman plants in Cloghran, Co Dublin and Christendom, Co Waterford had made overstatements of the weight of meat which resulted in incorrect declarations being made for EC funding.
At the time, beef processors were entitled to EC financial aid in the form of export refunds to allow high price products compete on lower price world markets with payments of up to IR£2,500 per tonne as well as financial supports for the storage of such goods.
State papers show a senior official has sought an undertaking from Mr Goodman as the chief executive of AIBP in January 1989 that there would be no further false declarations as well as an explanation for such breaches.
However, they also reveal that Harbour Police at Dublin Port uncovered activity at a Goodman-owned facility — Eirfreeze Cold Store — two months later during which 63 carcasses were found to be falsely graded using a fake stamp as well as being classified without the required supervision of a Department of Agriculture inspector.
A secret Garda file showed around 20 men who travelled from Co Louth had arrived at a checkpoint in Dublin Port on March 4, 1989 and claimed they were going to work on containers in a compound run by a road haulage firm.
They asked a security guard at the compound not to tell the Harbour Police that they had gone instead to work in Eirfreeze.
Two Department of Agriculture officials who were called along with gardaí to the site ordered all work on the premises to cease after they discovered freshly stamped ink on the meat.
The file showed gardaí were concerned about “the unsupervised handling of meat operations in the plant by management” as well attempts to conceal the work carried out in the facility by outside staff drafted in on a weekend evening.
A memo prepared on the incident for the Minister for Agriculture, Michael O’Kennedy, noted: “It would appear there was an attempt to upgrade the beef by the unlawful application of what purported to be an official stamp.”
It added:
Upgrading of the beef quality could involve commercial misrepresentation of beef to the detriment of the overall trade.
Files reveal four out of six containers owned by the AIBP group which were opened in Dublin Port two days after the incident contained beef with stamps that could not have been applied by Department of Agriculture officials.
One civil servant claimed the Goodman’s group suggestion that it was an entirely commercial matter with no implications for the State overlooked the fact that the country’s classification scheme for meat was in danger of being undermined.
Other documents show, then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey was concerned about making a particular reference to export credit insurance in a proposed speech to the Dáil in April 1989.
A confidential memo noted AIBP had at the time categorically denied allegations that some of its beef exports to Iraq which were insured under the scheme were not of Irish origin as required — a controversy which would eventually lead to the establishment of the Beef Tribunal in 1991.
However, it also observed that the Department of Agriculture had documentation which suggested beef from Northern Ireland had been exported under the scheme."

To rub salt in the wounds of our beef farmers, the top-rated region in the rankings was Northern Ireland.
Compiled by the Livestock and Meat Commission in Northern Ireland, the EU deadweight cattle prices league table for the week ending December 8 showed farmers in the North getting 397.7c/kg for R3 heifers, up 14.4c in a month.
However, across the border in the south, farmers were getting only 350.4c, down 1.2c from a month previous.
The average price across the EU was 370.3c.
Aided by sterling currency gains, Northern Ireland jumped from sixth place in the league table to No 1, while prices south of the border stayed in ninth place, as in the previous month.
However, the R3 heifer price in Ireland fell further behind, to about €65 for a 330kg carcase less than the EU average, compared to a differential of only €56 a month earlier.
The farmgate R3 heifer price allows a useful comparison between deadweight cattle prices across the EU, according to the Livestock and Meat Commission in Northern Ireland.
Their league table revealed a huge differential of €156 for a 330kg carcase north and south of the Irish border, which widened from €105 a month earlier.
Despite the beef price gap, imports from the south for direct slaughter in the north were not increased, with less than 300 prime cattle and only about 90 cows going north per week in mid-December, similar to previous weeks.
While the southern Irish price fell, the average R3 heifer price in the EU increased by 1.9c/kg, to 370.3c/kg, boosted by strong increases in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, but also by upward movement in Italy (plus 3c/kg), France (plus 2c/kg), and Spain (plus 4.9c/kg).
But R3 heifer prices fell in Luxembourg (by 13.7c/kg), Germany (0.5c/kg), Austria (3.1c/kg), and Denmark (1.2c/kg).
The year just ended has been “exceptionally challenging”, particularly for our top beef producers, said Teagasc director Professor Gerry Boyle, before Christmas.
“I cannot think of another year in recent times where our best-performing beef producers have had such a difficult situation,” Professor Boyle told the Oireachtas Agriculture Committee.
Teagasc director of research Dr Frank O’Mara told the Committee that the current issue regarding dairy calves is more a beef price issue than a dairy calf issue.
If the price of beef was €4 or €4.50, then there would be no problem selling all the calves born in the country.
“The problem is we have a major profitability problem for every beef animal.”
And Professor Boyle said, “We all know that, prior to the introduction of the dairy quota, 80% of beef was sourced from the dairy herd.
“The percentage is now 60%, but it is growing.”"

Hopefully, New Year hostilities will not break out in the sector in the meantime, but that cannot be guaranteed.
Tensions in the sector were obvious at the inaugural meeting of the taskforce on December 3.
And farmers’ patience has been tested further by the mid-December price comparison which showed that a heifer was worth €156 more (for a 330kg carcase) north of the border, a huge differential which widened from €105 a month earlier.
On December 3, the task force chairman requested and received a re-affirmation from stakeholders of adherence to a peace clause in the September 15 sector agreement, and that all relevant issues would be brought in the first instance to the task force for resolution.
However, two day later, IFA president Joe Healy led a protest at the Aldi distribution centre in Co Kildare, followed over the next 10 days by similar protests at the distribution centres of Lidl, Tesco, Musgraves, and Dunnes Stores.
Meat Industry Ireland jumped into the fight straight away, accusing IFA of an irresponsible and completely unjustified illegal blockading stunt, and not giving the task force due time to address the many actions in the beef sector agreement.
The flare-up clearly demonstrated the knife-edge potential for continuing low prices for beef cattle to trigger disruption in the sector, and the possibility even of a repeat of the early autumn blockade for over a month of beef factories.
Without a significant price increase, farmer organisations remain under pressure to act.
Newly elected IFA president Tim Cullinan has made that clear, saying the priority for the first month of his presidency is the beef crisis: “Factories have to realise if they want a beef industry in Ireland, they will have to pay for it.”
The Department of Agriculture is examining why the expected increase in the composite beef price didn’t occur, following the application of the September 15 sector agreement bonuses.
To make matters worse, processors enforced carcase weight restrictions and penalised for heavier cattle.
They indicated to the taskforce on December 3 these were pre-existing weight restrictions previously applied in a flexible manner, but enforced in December — apparently regardless of the inevitable backlash from farmers.
Farmer organisations also told the task force of difficulties with processors on producer organisations.
And the taskforce view expressed, that there should be no discrimination against farmers who participated in the autumn protests and more recent protests, also pointed to underlying tensions, even though processors rejected any claims of discrimination against protesters.
All told, there was little sign on December 3 of the task force developing a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector, in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability, as hoped for by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed.
He promised timelines for implementation of agreed commitments, and nothing less may be needed to keep the peace.
On December 3, the task force noted the gap between Irish and EU beef cattle prices, and the consensus amongst farm organisations that market trends indicated the price should increase.
The task force also noted the processors’ view that some price improvement should arise in the short-term.
That materialised the week after, with the R3 steer price increasing by about 4c/kg and the R3 heifer price gaining about 4.4c.
However, the glaring price differential revealed between farms in Northern and Southern Ireland proved processors have a long way to go to restore peaceful relations with cattle farmers."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30973449.html,2020-01-03 17:00:00,Stephen Cadogan: Why dairy beef incentive could be such a valuable incentive,"The dairy beef production incentive which ICMSA has called for would be a rare item of good news in the beef sector, if Agriculture Minister Michael Creed were to go along with it.
It could be good news for dairy farmers also, if they want more farmers to take on the rearing of the increasing population of dairy calves, or dairy heifer contract rearing.
Farmers are needed to take on both of these tasks for the rapidly expanded dairy industry. Without a beef (or veal) outlet for surplus dairy calves, or contract heifer rearing to take the environmental pressure off heavily stocked dairy farms, the milk sector could face increasing problems.
ICMSA President Pat McCormack said sufficient markets are needed in the spring for calves, in order for the dairy sector to remain sustainable. That means the live export market must remain open for dairy-bred beef calves, and there must be support for farmers willing to rear the beef cross calves here in Ireland.
Mr McCormack said dairy beef has been demonstrated to be the most profitable beef production system, albeit returns are still low in all parts of the beef sector, leaving farmers under very significant financial pressure.
Hence the ICMSA suggestion that beef cross calves from the dairy herd be subsidised to the value of €150 in two payments, at 6-10 months and at slaughter. The calves would have to be sired by a beef bull with good beef characteristics, and ICMSA also recommended that farmers be allowed to exit the BDGP scheme early without clawback of payments, in order to enter their proposed dairy calf scheme.
Such a scheme could be a saviour for the very small group of top beef farmers who have been consistently capable of profitable rearing and fattening, until they were set back by the challenges of 2019, due to low prices for their cattle.
These farmers tend to be larger-scale producers operating to a high level of efficiency. They should be prime candidates for dairy calf to beef, or dairy heifer contract rearing.
According to Teagasc director Professor Gerry Boyle, the vast majority of beef producers do not generate a profit margin, and survive on what is left of their single farm payment after the losses are counted.
The failure of many suckler cows to produce a calf per year is one of the profitability problems (and the calving frequency is worsening rather than improving), further exacerbated this year by the slump in beef prices.
A very large group of part-time farmers are involved in production of beef. Some of them are exceptionally efficient, but they are hindered by time constraints. Perhaps some of them will give up loss-making beef farming, to concentrate instead on their off-farm work.
A significant proportion of beef farmers are elderly, and find it very challenging to manage their herds, not to mind try new enterprises like dairy calf rearing or dairy heifer rearing. They are unlikely to be receptive to the new technology which plays a big role in advancing every farm enterprise.
The Teagasc plan for them is to tailor measures to help them maximise retention of their single farm payments.
Teagasc director Professor Boyle says expansion in dairy can be leveraged for the benefit of other farmers, particularly traditional dry stock farmers, and Teagasc is promoting a number of initiatives in that respect, but is aware of the challenge in communicating such opportunities to farmers.
Teagasc encourages traditional dry stock farmers to look very closely at the possibilities in heifer rearing, for example, for a more continuous level of income, and at rearing dairy calves. But it is challenging, because beef sector demographics do not encourage people to embrace change, says Professor Boyle.
He noted that leadership played a big role in the expansion of the suckler herd in the 1990s, and the beef sector needs similar leadership now.
As it stands, the sector is poorly prepared to take on the increasing number of dairy calves coming on the market, to be reared as beef animals.
That is why the dairy beef production incentive which ICMSA has called for could be such a valuable incentive."

Supermarket retailers will attend the Beef Market Taskforce, along with farming organisations and meat processors.
The Individual Farmers of Ireland says it will hold more protests in the capital next Wednesday if there's no progress.
Joe Healy, president of the Irish Farmers Association, says a beef price increase needs to be agreed today
""Pre-Christmas there the IFA had blockades outside the distribution centres and that was to get a message across to the retailers that farmers, beef farmers in particular, need an immediate price increase to try and become viable,"" he said.
""The current prices, which are over 50c under the cost of production, isn't viable.
We have to do all that's in our power to ensure that there is an immediate price rise.
""The price index has shown that there is a large gap between the price Irish farmers are getting and what those in the markets across Europe that has taken 90% of our beef are getting so we need that immediate price rise,"" he added."

Exports were up 7% on the 2018 figure, despite an “increasingly complex” trade environment.
When exports of non-edible agri-food sector goods worth €1.5bn are included, total agri-food sector exports in 2019 amounted to €14.5bn.
Dairy exports grew more than 11%, despite a weakening in some of the key commodity prices.
With farmer protests heavily curtailing exports of beef and sheepmeat for a number of weeks, and weakening demand in key markets, there was a 1% decline in the value of meat and livestock exports in 2019, to €3.98bn.
African swine fever’s effect on the global animal protein market led to a record high in Irish pigmeat export value.
Prepared food exports grew 12%.
“It has been a transformative decade of extraordinary growth for Irish food exports,” said Bord Bia CEO Tara McCarthy, launching the Export Performance & Prospects Report for 2019/2020, yesterday.
She said the UK remains a key destination for Irish food and drinks exports.
However, 2019 was the first year that more exports went to the rest of the EU than to the UK, as global diversification and broad-based growth gathered momentum for exporters.
An Irish Farmers’ Association spokesperson said: “Let’s not forget where this export story starts. Farmers need to see the benefits of this growth. The new 2030 strategy must include targets on farm profitability as well as industry targets.”
Key drivers of export performance included global consumer spending remaining strong; increases demand for proteins globally; Brexit uncertainty curtailing GDP growth and business confidence in the UK; and the weakening euro improving competitiveness for Irish exports internationally."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30974450.html,2020-01-09 10:54:00,"Michael Creed: Farming sector best served by a coherent, cohesive approach - not blockades","Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has described some of the beef industry lobbying groups as ‘flying columns.’
“Holding one or two meetings at a central location nationally, does not a national organisation constitute. We have established farm bodies, we have relatively new established farm bodies, as well, but we also have these 'flying columns' so to speak ,” he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny Show.
The Minister acknowledged the difficulties in 2019 for the beef sector.
“That's undoubtedly the case, if you look at figures published yesterday by Bord Bia, the out turn for 2019, the prospects for 2020, it does acknowledge that was a particularly difficult year.
“However, I would say that we're at a really critical juncture in the context of the agricultural sector looking to win friends and influence people, the agricultural lobby has been widely recognised over many years as being a predominant lobbying group and an effective one.
The real danger is with fracturing of that strength in terms of its lobbying capacity, the advent of the ‘pop up’ farmer organisation, which was the hallmark of 2019, a series of strikes by independent, previously unheard of organisations.
“We had a situation, for example, in the beef protests in late 2019 where we've had three iterations of a single organisation claiming to be a legitimate national organisation.
""I would make the point that bringing that kind of response and tactic to the centre of Dublin and blocking up the business of the city does not help us in the context of bigger issues that we need to deal with in terms of climate, in terms of a whole host of issues out there, the CAP reform, a host of issues that need addressing, securing additional resources.
I would strongly hold the view that the lobbying capacity and the dividend from that for the farming sector is best served by a coherent, cohesive approach rather than what we saw in the back end of 2019.
The Minister rejected an analogy between minimum pricing for alcohol and the price of beef.
“There is a market reality, and the market reality determines the price, what I do and what my role as I see it is, where the market is in difficulty in returning a fair income to farmers, then the State steps in a supports them with income support, it's not a price support, and that's what we did in 2019 in terms of making available an additional €120m.
“I've always said we need to have maximum transparency, we need to have the maximum level of engagement with retailers, with processors, and farmers and perhaps take a leaf out of the play book of the dairy industry who have a very sophisticated level of engagement with their suppliers, this industry will not survive except the modus operandi for engagement between the various players improves significantly.
I have regular engagement with established farm organisations on a continuous basis, that is the way that we should proceed and that's the way that farmers and their lobby groups have delivered over many years.
Mr Creed agreed there needs to be transparency about the breakdown of who gets what for a kilo of beef.
“Commercial sensitivities are one thing, but having a sustainable engagement with your primary producer is critical - the transposition of that directive is part of that.”"

The holding is all in pasture, in one division, and is located in the townland of Ballinaltig, near Kildinan.
It is just west of the M8 Dublin-Cork motorway and has some excellent road frontage onto the R639, which used to be the N8 main Dublin-Cork road, before the motorway was constructed.
For pieces of good land of this size, there is always going to be interest.
With its convenient location at the heart of a very vibrant agricultural area (dairying, beef farming, tillage farming, and the equestrian sector, are all well represented locally), it makes for either a good prospect for some small-scale or ‘hobby’ farming or an easily-accessed addition to an existing unit.
According to the selling agent, Michael Barry of Fermoy-based Dick Barry & Sons, this is a straightforward piece of land that will be of interest to a wide variety of clients,
“The land is sound and level,” he says. “It’s laid out in one field and has a stream on the lower boundary.”
The property is roughly mid-way between the villages of Watergrasshill (to the south-west) and Rathcormack (to the north), approximately 4.5km from both.
There is a cattle crush and a gathering pen on the property and, the selling agent says, it is being offered by private treaty.
The price guide is €150,000, or just short of €8,600 per acre.
It’s certainly an enticing price at that level, which is below what a lot of top-quality land would fetch in the in area.
But whether land is being sold at a public auction or private treaty, it isn’t where one starts but where one finishes that counts."

Tonight the ICSA president Edmond Phelan said the major retailers attending the Beef Taskforce “gave no coherent indication that the 30-month rule is as important a requirement in the Irish market as processors would have us believe”.
“While all the retailers agree that Quality Assurance was of paramount importance, retailers are not as rigid on the issue of 30-months as we had been led to believe. There were also varying and diverging views on other in-spec requirements including the four movement rule and the 60-day residency requirement on the last farm,” he said.
“This tallies with the results of a poll commissioned by ICSA and conducted through RED C which found that just over 12% of respondents – or less than one in eight – indicated a preference for beef from animals of under-30 months of age, while country of origin and quality assurance was a consideration for 89% and over 90% of respondents respectively.”
Mr Phelan said the retailers were told that current prices paid to beef producers fall “way short of what is required”.
It has been made crystal clear that beef farmers cannot continue to produce at below the cost of production. To this end, we are pleased that the retailers have agreed to co-operate further with the price composition study.
Aldi was one of the retailers represented at the talks, and the company’s Group Buying Director John Curtin said it “is fully committed to making a constructive contribution towards the work of the Beef Taskforce and the future of the Irish beef market"".
“The retail sector only accounts for 6% of the beef produced in Ireland and does not determine the market price of Irish beef. Aldi is committed to ensuring we will always offer our customers the very best in Irish beef,” he said.
Ahead of the talks, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed described some of the beef industry lobbying groups as ""flying columns"".
“Holding one or two meetings at a central location nationally, does not a national organisation constitute. We have established farm bodies, we have relatively new established farm bodies, as well, but we also have these 'flying columns' so to speak,” he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny show.
He said that the agricultural lobby has been widely recognised over many years as being a predominant lobbying group and an effective one.
“The real danger is with fracturing of that strength in terms of its lobbying capacity, the advent of the ‘pop up’ farmer organisation, which was the hallmark of 2019, a series of strikes by independent, previously unheard of organisations,"" he said."

They expect 400 tractors to converge on the capital, as part of their campaign over beef prices.
The protest gets underway at 2pm at Merrion Square.
However, gardaí have said that the protest will will impact on traffic from 10am when road closures will come into effect.
Kildare Street
Molesworth Street
St Stephens Green South
Merrion Square West/South/East
Merrion Street Upper
Gardaí said that the following arrangements will also apply:
East bound traffic on Kevin Street will be diverted up New Bride Street
St Stephens Green North and East will only remain open for public transport from 2pm
From 12pm - when tractors start to arrive in the capital - gardaí said that traffic delays are expected on the main arterial routes into Dublin City Centre.
These include the N2, N3, N4, N7 and N81.
Gardaí said that bus corridors will not be impacted and that they are advising commuters to avail of public transport where possible.
The guards added that they are continuing to liaise closely with those organising the protest and traffic updates will be provided on the @gardatraffic Twitter account."

A similar protest in November led to part of the capital being closed off for more than 24 hours.
This one is set to last two days. Individual farmers are taking part in the demonstration as part of their ongoing campaign over beef prices, carbon tax and other issues.
Dublin is not the only European city to have seen such protests in recent times. In October more than 2,000 Dutch farmers in tractors caused a 1,100km traffic jam in The Hague in protest against claims that they were largely responsible for a nitrogen oxide emissions problem.
A further, smaller protest was carried out in December. Nearly 600 of 16,000 dairy farms in the Netherlands have had to close following the introduction of strict phosphate controls there.
While the Irish farmers may not win many friends outside of their own community through their action on the streets of Dublin, the reality is that they would not be protesting were it not for the fact that they are being paid a price for their cattle that is well below the cost of production.
The beef taskforce was intended to address this issue but according to farmers’ spokesperson Daniel Long it is a “talking shop”.
Yet a talking shop is exactly what it should be, so long as those talks reach a conclusion that is fair to all."

Over 100 demonstrators, protesting against beef prices, spent the night in their tractors in Dublin's City centre.
They want a meeting with the Taoiseach this morning with some saying they won't move until he speaks with them.
Individual Farmers of Ireland spokesperson, James Geoghagan said if they are unhappy with Leo Varadkar's response, they will step up their action.
He said: ""We're actually having another meeting outside the Shelbourne...after that, we will be deciding on the next action.
""We have asked for a meeting with Leo Varadkar for the morning, we have been on to his personal assistant so we're waiting for them to come back.
""If a meeting goes ahead...and we're happy with the outcome we might call off the protest, otherwise we will be escalating the protest."""
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30975868.html,2020-01-16 15:50:00,"Export supply of fresh organic Irish salmon ceased in the final two months of the year, due to jellyfish and planktonic ‘blooms’","Next to beef, the seafood and pigmeat export sectors had the most drama in 2019.
The supply of fresh organic Irish salmon ceased during the final two months of the year, due to jellyfish and planktonic ‘blooms’ in a number of fish farms.
But the strength of the sector enabled it to overcome the effective shut-down of supplies, with Irish salmon exports in 2019 increasing in value by about 14%, despite ending abruptly as environmental and animal health issues forced shutdowns for the final two months.
Mortalities in certain oyster growing areas also impacted on supply towards the end of 2019.
Nevertheless, Ireland’s seafood industry delivered a story of growth in 2019, as overall export values increased by 6% to €605m.
And the end of the year also brought some good news, with Bord Bia saying the confirmation in December of quotas for 2020 included a significant (40%) uplift in Irish mackerel, albeit with a 15% prawn quota decline.
The pigmeat sector had even further-reaching drama last year. According to Bord Bia, it would be difficult to overstate the impact of African swine fever (ASF) on international markets and supplier confidence. A major supply gap has emerged, largely a consequence of the disease hitting key production centres in Asia.
The impact on China, the number one global pigmeat producer, has been particularly severe, with the country forced to liquidate some 130m pigs or 40% of its national herd by last September.
The decision by Chinese authorities to increase pork imports to more than 3m tonnes in 2019, at least 40% more than 2018, has been a catalyst for pig price rises.
In Ireland, pigmeat prices started the year under pressure, but rebounded strongly as the year progressed, with record returns achieved in some instances as the year ended.
This market uplift was reflected in the export figures, with a 13% pigmeat value increase from €835.5m to €941 making it one of the star performers, at 7.2% of our food, drink and horticulture exports.
It’s the first time ever that Irish pigmeat exports have approached the €1bn mark.
This included demand for Irish pigmeat more than doubling in China, from €73m to €151m, for a record-breaking 82,000 tonnes, our second most important export market after the UK (which took 53% of our exports).
Our pigmeat did well in the home market also, with lower imports in the face of the exceptionally strong international demand due to ASF. Irish consumption of pigmeat is high, at 27.9kg per capita.
Due to the huge damage to production by ASF, many consumers in Asia will have to switch to alternative meat proteins in the short to medium term. Irish beef and sheepmeat exporters can hope to capitalise, on top of the record pigmeat exports."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30975869.html,2020-01-16 16:00:00,"Beef exports fell by 7%, partly due to farmer protests at meat processing plants","The resilience and dedication to sustainability and world class quality of Irish food producers was acknowledged last week by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed.
He was greeting the news of a stand-out 2019 performance by the food, drink and horticulture industry, as exports reached €13bn for the first time.
The IFA responded: “Let’s not forget where this export story starts.
“Farmers need to see the benefits of this growth.
“The new 2030 strategy must include targets on farm profitability as well as industry targets.”
It was a reminder to those celebrating the export success that farmers won’t be taken for granted.
As well as supplying the raw material, they had an extra starring role this year.
It was noted in the Export Performance & Prospects Report published by Bord Bia that “frustration among farmers at lower returns was expressed through protests at a number of meat processing plants during August and early September. These effectively closed the country’s beef processing facilities for a number of weeks, impacting on the supply capability of exporters, and resulting in a sharp decline in the value and volume of Irish beef exports”.
The export of beef, including offals, fell 7% in 2019, from €2.4bn to €2.2bn.
With farmer protests heavily curtailing exports of beef and sheepmeat for a number of weeks, and weakening demand in key markets, sheep and sheepmeat exports also fell by 7%, from €315m to €294m. Sustained pressure on prices in Europe due aggressive supply from the UK also hit our sheemeat exports.
The reason for the factory protests by farmers was noted in the Bord Bia report.
“On average, R3 steer prices in Ireland and the UK fell by 7% compared to 2018, while R3 young bulls were 5% lower on average across the EU-15. Depressed pricing impacts directly on farm income”.
Obviously, all is not happy in the Irish beef sector, our largest Irish meat and livestock export category.
The Bord Bia report referred to challenging marketing conditions in 2019 as a result of increasing price competition and sluggish demand in major markets.
There was a 0.9% fall in the volume of beef consumption in the EU, and a further 0.8% decline is expected in 2020.
But this is mirrored in falling supply, with a 0.9% reduction in EU28 beef production in 2019, and a 0.7% decrease expected in 2020.
And the growing opportunity on non-EU markets, Asia in particular, can compensate for weakening EU consumer demand. The EU increased beef exports 8% in 2019, and a further 5% increase is predicted in 2020. Bord Bia also expects opportunity for Ireland’s grass-fed, quality beef in the US. But the Brexit situation remains complex and unknown.
What about the Irish beef farmer situation?
The 2019 statistics indicate marginally increased income, largely the result of lower feed costs, and the exceptional aid provided by the Department of Agriculture (BEEP and BEAM). So, how secure is the beef industry, depending as it does for raw material on farmers who in turn depend on income handouts from the EU and the DAFM?
Are these farmers happy to rely on the promise made by Mr Creed this week of a doubling of the BEEP scheme to €40m in 2020, which could compensate for farming the land at a loss?
Or will the expected slight decline in the cattle supply this year help to lift prices towards farmer profitability?
On the other hand, Brexit difficulties in 2020 could accelerate the 2019 fallback of 15% in the value of Irish beef exports to the UK (down 11% in volume). On such questions depends much of agri-food’s 10% share of Irish exports, 7.7% of employment, 21% of industrial turnover; and 23% of manufacturing industry turnover.
“Bord Bia is resolutely focussed on delivering sustainable growth for Ireland’s largest indigenous industry”, said the food board’s CEO, Tara McCarthy. Sustainability is also Mr Creed’s catchword, but it remains to be seen if his promised extra BEEP funding will keep beef farming sustainable, from the point of view of a sustainable level of profit for farmers.
Food, drink and horticulture exports have grown by 67%, or €5.5bn, since 2010.
But there’s a danger that more beef industry disruption could end the winning streak in 2020.
In 2019, dairy was the exports star, growing more than 11%, despite some key commodity prices weakening.
This took dairy to a 34% share of food and beverage exports, compared to 30% meat and livestock, 18% prepared food, 11% alcohol, 5% seafood, and 2% horticulture.
The introduction of tariffs by the US on EU imports in October disrupted the Irish dairy and alcohol industries, and presents a significant challenge for Ireland’s butter, cheese and cream liqueur producers in particular as they plan for the year ahead.
However, some stocking forward in the US in anticipation of the tariffs, may have helped exporters in 2019, for example in the butter trade, which grew 13%. And overall, it is expected that the positive trend in dairy exports will continue into this year.
If specialised nutritional powders are excluded, Irish dairy exports grew in value by 17.6%, and in volume by 12%.
According to Bord Bia, “Much of the credit for the 2019 performance rests with the industry itself and the central dynamics in the year’s performance may be identified as continued growth in domestic milk production, an intensifying industry focus on development of new markets, and an enhanced portfolio of value added products and customer focused applications.
The export sector of most interest to many farmers is livestock, even if it is worth only 4% of meat and livestock exports. Live cattle exports in 2019 continued the pattern of 2018, a significant increase in numbers, but matched by declining value terms. As a result, the live animals trade fell back 3%, to €167m. It included a strong increase in export of calves, which are of course of lower value than adult animals. In 2019, prices for export calves slumped 13% compared to 2018, while prices fell 9% for weanlings, 8% for stores, and 6% for finished animals.
Bord Bia noted the maximum of 13,200 calves which can be landed per week this spring from Ireland, set by capacity at two lairages in Cherbourg for a total of 4,400 calves at any one time.
Increased demand in 2019 pushed poultry exports up 5%, to €306m.
The UK takes 71% of our poultry exports, so Brexit will be an important factor this year, along with keeping avian influenza at bay.
Irish sheepmeat exporters will expect a return to growth in 2020.
When non-edible items such as live horses, animal foodstuffs, forestry and amenity horticulture, animal hides and skins, are added to edible exports worth €13bn, our total agri-food sector exports are estimated at €14.5bn, going to more than 180 markets worldwide (34% to the UK, 35% to other EU markets, and 31% to non-U markets, after a four-fold increase in the trade to Asia)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-30975923.html,2020-01-17 00:10:00,Old beliefs destroying our world: Our aversion to change is a real threat,"There is a recognition that it is time to reconsider principles we have, for generations, regarded as rational, enriching, progressive and inevitable.
The accelerating concentration of material security and opportunity — wealth is too simple a word for this regression — and climate change are primary consequences of ambitions now seen as unsustainable.
Yet, we remain in thrall to them. Any Dáil candidate brave enough, over the next 22 days, to suggest alternatives to our social and economic development conventions risks being dismissed as a crank.
This cultural discomfort with challenge, though not uniquely Irish, chains us to a process with predictable outcomes, fewer and fewer of which are positive.
A plan on how Cork City might be developed is under consideration. It will feature discussions on the vexed issue of student accommodation.
There is a significant deficit which means very high rents which are, ultimately, a tax on education.
There are plans to build more accommodation but these will sharpen the relationship between colleges and communities.
Swathes of suburbia have been swamped by student accommodation and residents’ quality of life has diminished.
Developments will not reduce rents unless student numbers are capped and that is unlikely.
These developments will further challenge hotels struggling with the impact offering vacant student accommodation to summertime tourists.
The number of international students at our colleges has increased dramatically.
Last year the sector had 14,412, an increase of 27% since 2016, far outstripping the 5.4% increase in Irish students.
It would be wrong, stupid, and hypocritical to point an accusatory finger at this tiny, welcome cohort because of planning failures.
Nevertheless, that rate of growth, one that ensures higher rents, points to the belief that third-level growth can be infinite irrespective of location — or governments’ refusal to decide how colleges might be funded.
That refusal also jeopardises valued institutions’relationships with host communities.
Tractor protests in Dublin point to another conflict that will not be resolved unless we embrace difficult change.
Those farmers protested over poor beef prices and have a cast-iron case but their world is under new scrutiny.
Not least because we export 90% of the beef we produce and 90% of dairy products yet absorb 100% of the ugly environmental costs of production.
That imbalance will lead to fines in the hundreds of millions, money that would be far better spent helping farmers adopt while averting climate chaos.
That dairy exports doubled to €4bn since milk quotas ended in 2015 shows the scale of the problem.
It is also unacceptable that many in the sector do not recognise this problem as a problem.
Essentially, we have sacrificed a good environment to win exports yet many farmers remain unprofitable and rely on subsidies — surely the epitome of unsustainability.
These are examples of inflexibility, social and individual, that exact a heavy price yet any candidate promising change proportionate to these challenges is unlikely to succeed.
Will we in a few years time then blame those we elect for not delivering real, redemptive change?"

Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy gave one unequivocal answer at the launch of his party’s social housing policy in Dublin. Does he want to stay on as minister in his current portfolio? Wait a beat.
“Yes.”
“It’s important that we continue with the plan that we have,” he said before discussing the “important reforms” introduced under his aegis.
It’s a far cry from an overheard soundbite attributed to the Minister last November at an ESRI conference on the housing market. “This has been the year from hell,” Mr Murphy was overheard saying. But then if a week is a long time in politics, two months is an eternity.
Takeaway 2:
Fianna Fail's Justice spokesman Jim O'Callaghan put forward the party's big idea to fight gangland crime today when he said his party would bring in legislation to allow in evidence the opinion of a chief superintendent that an individual was involved in organised crime.
He said this would beef up 2009 legislation that allowed evidence from a senior garda that a criminal gang existed. Asked about the constitutionality of such a measure Jim said he was confident it would pass muster.
The smart money says it won't. Either Fianna Fail's manifesto will promise a referendum on the matter or it will go to the dusty shelf where redundant headlines reside.

Michael Healy Rae's fundraising appeal to help pay for his election expenses shows no sign as brotherly love as fellow TD Danny isn't getting a cent of it.
The appeal by the younger brother is in the form of letter to supporters written on Oireachtas headed paper.
It enclosed two raffle tickets at a price of €30 each (€50 for two) for a draw to help fund posters, canvas cards, advertising “and all that goes with funding a General Election” .
However, big brother Danny will have to find other ways to fund his campaign according to Danny’s son, independent councillor Cllr Johnny Healy Rae.
“It’s just Michael,” the young councillor said adding he was not criticising the raffle but wanted to make clear that his father Danny was not involved and would not benefit.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-30976152.html,2020-01-17 20:00:00,Daniel McConnell: Protest by renegade farmers was a disgrace,"Legitimate protest is one thing, but this week, a small group of renegade farmers crossed a line.
At lunchtime Thursday, as I was crossing the Liffey river on the train, a most startling sight greeted me.
As we approached Pearse Street station, I gazed up Westland Row to see the seemingly never-ending line of tractors as they were beginning to leave Dublin City Centre.
By my estimate, about 100 tractors in single file were proceeding toward Dublin Port, escorted by members of An Garda Síochána. All normal traffic was stopped to allow this procession take place.
Protesting at the low prices being paid by meat-producing companies for beef, the rogue group of farmers feel unloved. Not backed by the main farming lobby groups, the so-called Individual Farmers of Ireland, felt they had to inflict considerable disruption on Dubliners yet again.
So once at Dublin Port, rather than clear off having held the city centre to ransom for more than 24 hours, they decided to stage a further protest there. Only after serious disruption was caused there, did the farmers make their way to the M50 orbital road where they proceeded with a go-slow protest at rush hour.
One only needs to look at the video clips posted on Twitter by RTÉ reporter, Laura Hogan, to see the level of disruption caused.
All the while facilitated by An Garda Síochána, despite the considerable inconvenience caused to thousands of commuters.
It was a disgrace, and was totally unwarranted and completely futile.
And it must be remembered that this was the second time this group of so-called independent farmers brought their protest to the streets of Dublin. When they came to the capital in November, they dug in for more than 24 hours, despite the total chaos they caused to thousands of ordinary Dubliners.
Having initially gathered on Merrion Square, the farmers repeatedly reneged on agreements with Gardai as to how their protest would take place.
A deal to allow a small number of tractors move from Merrion Square to St Stephen's Green was broken when a steady procession of tractors moved en masse, causing chaos to commuters. When they were blocked by gardaí at the stop of Kildare Street, the chaos of the group was laid bare.
As I stood there for several hours, senior Gardai made repeated offers to so-called leaders of the protestors as to how to end the protest while allowing them their right to make their point.
An offer was made to allow one tractor down Kildare Street. This was accepted by farmers but then rejected. Another offer from gardaí would have allowed all tractors down Kildare Street but they would not be allowed stop. Again, this was agreed but again it was rejected.
All of a sudden there were demands for Agriculture Minister Michael Creed to come out and meet the protestors and for a letter to be accepted. As day turned to night and to dawn, Creed eventually made his way to the barrier and spoke to assembled farmers in a bid to end the impasse.
Despite bowing to their bidding and meeting the farmers, some protestors were angry that he did not meet the 'right' farmers.
Later, five delegates handed a letter to Mr Creed in the lobby of the Department of Agriculture on Kildare Street outlining a number of issues. Other protesters shouted that the farmers the minister was talking to did not represent them and this letter was not the real letter of protest.
Eventually, amid promises to convene a beef taskforce, the protest was ended and the farmers headed home.
While the initial protest in November could be justified as they had a purpose in seeking a meeting with Creed, this week's protest had no such legitimacy. They were not there to protest at the Dáil as no politician was there — they are all out canvassing for re-election. They were not protesting to the Minister of Agriculture.
With no clear aim or objective, the misguided protest only served to place an intolerable burden on the ordinary people going about their day.
Speaking about their tactics, organisers from the Individual Farmers of Ireland group said they did not want to block the motorway completely but they wanted to leave their mark on Dublin. They certainly did that.
Gardaí defended their handling of the situation by saying their main objective in dealing with the protest was to ensure the safety of the public:
""An Garda Síochána has a role in ensuring that peaceful protests can take place, and also in preventing injury and protecting life. We respect people's right to peaceful protest and will facilitate same.
Gardaí attend protests to facilitate free movement of traffic and to prevent any breaches of the peace. Gardaí are tasked with preserving law and order, without fear or favour, and with ensuring that people can go about their lawful business, including having access to their workplace, and that peaceful protest can also take place.
Be that as it may, just how is it acceptable that 100 people with their tractors are allowed bring a capital city to a halt, not once but twice in less than three months?
If this was a group of students, or nurses, would they have been given such latitude?
Far from being neglected, farmers are a largely protected species in this country, to be handled with care by the political system and State authorities.
For example, according to published figures, the highest-paid recipient of direct payments under the Common Agriculture Policy in 2018 got a whopping €323,000, the second-highest got €229,633 while the third got €221,510.
I accept this is not the same for all clearly, from the discussions I had with farmers on the barricades, some are really hurting.
Family farm income fell 31% for dairy farmers, compared to 2017; 21% for cattle rearers; 11% for other cattle farmers; and 21% for sheep farmers. For tillage farmers, family farm income in the survey increased 18% from 2017 to 2018, a recent Teagasc survey showed.
Whatever the merits or demerits of CAP, it is a very extensive system of support from taxpayers which few, if any, other industries receive. In Ireland, direct payments to farmers amounted to almost €1.8 billion last year.
One could argue that with farming accounting for 8% of employment and 10% of total exports, such supports are merited and they are.
So strong is the farming lobby, that despite clear evidence that the national herd is way too big and should be reduced in size, the political system refuses to grasp that particular nettle.
Time and time again, a key tenet of the farmers' argument is that rural Ireland is dying.
It is not. As the economist Dan O'Brien pointed out last year, rural population has been on the up for almost half a century. He wrote: “What we know from the census is that the number of people living in rural areas, defined as a place outside a conurbation of at least 1,500 people, has increased by more than a quarter of a million over the past 20 years.""
“That is worth repeating: 1.75 million people live in rural areas, up from 1.5 million in just 20 years. In 1971, rural Ireland’s nadir, the population living in the countryside, villages and small towns was 1.4 million,” he said.
These shameful protests by a small group of farmers have more to do with inter-factional rivalry within the farming lobby seeking to outdo each other than it did about farming welfare.
It is not tolerable that a small, renegade group of people be allowed cause such disruption multiple times without consequence.
No one will deny that there are genuine issues affecting the price of beef or the agricultural sector generally, but the protest this week was a bridge too far."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30976749.html,2020-01-21 14:06:00,Poll last autumn showed Fine Gael support slumped to 25% among beef farmers,"How can election candidates secure the votes of beef farmers?
In last autumn’s 2019 Irish Examiner/ICMSA National Opinion Poll, analysis of the responses of beef farmers showed their support for Fine Gael had fallen to 25%, having averaged nearly 34% in the previous four years.
“Don’t knows” among these livestock farmers were up to 30%, from a 25% average.
Three out of four of the farmers polled said they were in the livestock/cattle business.
At least two out of every three farmers in the country has a stake in the beef business, and the poll indicated they are now the farming sector whose votes are “in the wind”.
For the 2019 poll, staff of the Behaviour & Attitudes market research company conducted face-to-face interviews with 501 farmers (and farm-dwelling adults) at seven agricultural shows around the country, from August 11 to 25.
This period coincided with beef factory protests by farmers, which led to closures and layoffs.
Not much has changed in farming in the meantime, with low prices for beef cattle still very much the big problem.
The lack of progress in the beef sector, from the farmer’s viewpoint, could accelerate the decline in support for Fine Gael revealed in the poll.
In the poll, 86% of farmers said the Government was too Dublin-focused, and 82% said all political parties do not properly represent rural Ireland. Whether such sentiments will affect farmer voting patterns in the general election on Saturday, February 8 remains to be seen.
Maybe this kind of thinking will simply reduce the turnout of farmer voters, usually one of the groups most committed to this vital part of the democratic process. In last autumn’s poll, 84% of farmers said they voted in the previous election, compared to 81% in 20198, and 90% in the 2017 poll.
Overall, the poll showed 29% support for Fine Gael last autumn, compared to a high of 40% in 2017.
From 2015 to 2019 in this poll, support for Fine Gael averaged 34.4%.
Support for Fianna Fail averaged 24%, trending upwards from 2015’s 19% to 25% in 2019.
Last autumn, support for Independent/Other inched upwards to 8%, and the only other category to increase was “don’t knows”, reaching a very significant 28%, having varied from 20% to 26% in the previous four years.
Of course, the story on an opinion poll day could be very different on the general election polling day, when those “don’t knows” have to make up their minds. Of the 420 (out of 501) in the poll who said they voted in the last election, 47% said it was Fine Gael, 28% for Fianna Fáil, 7% for Independents, 4% for Sinn Féin, and 2% for Labour. That election was in February, 2016.
In the preceding 2015 Irish Examiner/ICMSA National Opinion Poll, farmer support was 38% for Fine Gael, 19% for Fianna Fáil, 12% for Independents, 4% for Sinn Féin, and zero for Labour.
Matching up opinions and eventual voting actions would suggest the two main parties and the Independents largely shared the support of the 21% “don’t knows” in the 2015 poll.
With “don’t knows” now increased to 28%, there may be more at stake than ever for election candidates when they canvass farmers.
Another interesting result in the 2019 Irish Examiner/ICMSA Poll was that only 56% saw a vote for the Green Party as bad for rural Ireland. Other poll results indicated that farmers are becoming more committed to climate mitigation. For example, only 10% strongly agreed that they don’t believe in climate change. One in three agreed that they will plant more grant-aided forestry for climate mitigation.
Why then was there such as low satisfaction rating, of only 2.88 out of 10, for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan in the political party leader section of the poll?
The hard decisions on how to go about climate mitigation are no easier for farmers than anyone else, and the poll indicated that the Green Party leader may have to come up with a new plan for fitting farmers into the way forward, in order to lift his rating, which was the lowest of five party leaders.
Average satisfaction ratings for the other leaders ranged from 4.68 for Fianna Fail’s Micheál Martin; to 4.6 for Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar; 3.49 for Labour’s Brendan Howlin (the only one of four party leaders with both 2018 and 2019 ratings whose rating improved from the previous year); and 2.99 for Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald.
In last autumn’s Irish Examiner/ICMSA National Opinion Poll, analysis of the responses of beef farmers showed their support for Fine Gael had fallen to 25%"

This constituency is likely to be a microcosm of the national picture for the general election.
This is farming country and the successes (or otherwise failures) of Agriculture Minister Michael Creed will, in part, influence voters, aswill geography in the three-seater. Cork North-West stretches from the borders of Kerry and Limerick right in towards Cork City.
There is huge pressure on Fianna Fáil to hold its two seats for Aindrias Moynihan, a returning first-time TD, and Michael Moynihan, the party’s chief whip.
“For Fianna Fáil to be in government, it has to win the second seat here,” said a party figure candidly.
However, while Fine Gael only had one TD here since the last election in 2016, it stands a real chance of taking back a second seat, once held by Áine Collins. If her supporters back John Paul O’Shea, Creed’s running mate and a former Independent, the cumulative vote could swing a victory in both the north and the south of the constituency for Fine Gael.
Many constituency activists admit this is a head-to-head between the two major parties and, unlike most other constituencies, other groups and candidates are seen as a very long shot forin wresting one of the three seats from them.
This may explain why there are just eight candidates running this time.
Nonetheless, neither of the two big parties are taking the race for granted, and instead are talking up being underdogs, a tactic that often helps get the vote out.
There are disadvantaged pockets in Gaeltacht areas here, including Muskerry, but overall unemployment is low. A lot hinges on the farming sector, multinationals, and the road infrastructure linking other counties and, of course, Cork City.
One of the biggest demands is the Cork-Limerick motorway, the M20, which has got the green light under the Government’s Project Ireland 2040. Work on the long-promised €300m Macroom bypass, expected to cost , is also under way.
Both of these projects go towards supporting commuter and the bigger towns in the constituency, including Ballincollig and Macroom, as well as market towns such as Kanturk, Charleville, and Newmarket.
Another problem is the lack of housing in Ballincollig, as well as demands fora third secondary school in the town. With a young and growing population, this community may not backthe incumbents, as there are also concerns about Garda services for the town.
Fine Gael sources also admit that families have complained about the lackof special needs services, including supports and resources for St Joseph’sFoundation, which helps those with intellectual disabilities and is based in Charleville.
All eyes in farming households are focused on the upcoming Common Agriculture Payments deal and what it could bring for the beef and dairy sectors. However, there is also frustration among farmers, after the handling of the fodder crisis and the latest beef price war with factories.
And it may seem impressive to be on the national and international stage, as the AMr Creed has been, but Fine Gael sources privately worry whether Fianna Fáil’s work on the ground at home will beat them.
“It is all very well to be out in China signing [beef] deals, but you are leaving the back door open at home,” confided a party insider.
Observers in Cork North-West say first preferences will be crucial.
This is for a There are a number ofreasons for this. With such a small field of candidates, there will be little or no surplus votes, and few transferswith such a small field of candidates.
Moreover, it really is a dogfight between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that will likely mirror a national trend and indicate whether Leo Varadkar’s party will get a third successive term or whether the winds of change will put Fianna Fáil back into Government Buildings.
On the campaign trail with Ciaran McCarthy of the Social Democrats in the Cork North-West constituency.
In general, while many would agree that Cork North-West has moved away from its conservative profile, this election will be an old-style dust-up between the traditional two big parties.
Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, the Greens, and Aontú are fielding candidates, but they are unlikely to will not get the votes needed for a seat.
Expect the fight for the third seat to be in the north of the constituency between John Paul O’Shea and Michael Moynihan, with votes in Charleville seen as key to a win.
In conclusion, Cork North-West is on a knife-edge and whichever party tips the scales and gets that second seat not only adds to their leader’s tally, but denies their opponent an extra TD. This makes it is a key battleground in Election 2020."

That’s certainly true of farmers, with Fianna Fáil’s Jackie Cahill, TD, spokesperson on food and horticulture, recently saying, with some justification, that farmers feel the whole world is against them.
However, farmers and their families are also benefiting from unemployment being at a 13-year low.
About half of the country’s farmers, including the majority of beef farmers, also have off-farm work, and their family members are also benefiting from the current positive business conditions, and improving wage levels.
The election comes on the heels of months of protests by beef farmers.
The protests are widely seen as having backfired badly, with blockades nearly closing down processing, but leaving a huge backlog of cattle which has increased supply levels ever since, leaving farmers without market scope to demand higher prices.
Next up came eye-catching tractor protests in Dublin, but they seem to have been overplayed also, turning Dubliners against farmers.
But now comes the best chance of all for farmers, with an election bringing a protest vote opportunity.
How will they use it?
With up to 100,000 farmers depending to some extent on the beef market, the promises by the different political parties of help for this sector are likely to have a considerable bearing on the election outcome in rural areas.
Beef farmers rely heavily on the off-farm jobs which economic growth makes available, but they are also justified in looking for an end to the low beef prices which make the farming part of their very long working weeks unprofitable.
For them, proposals like the Green Party’s ban on live exports to non-EU countries, and phasing-out all live exports of unweaned calves, will probably be “red-line” issues which will get very little support from them
Many believe that climate change is losing out in the election debate and in voter intentions to issues such as health, housing, tax, and welfare. However, it is a sore point with Irish farmers, not because they don’t want to take part in climate action, but because they feel they are scapegoated for a global problem caused at least 80% by use of fossil fuels.
This seems doubly unfair to farmers, because they work under the restrictions of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy which has been oriented towards environmental issues for decades.
The proposals for the next CAP envisage 40% of its spending aligned with environmental protection and climate action.
Already, Irish farmers face increasing control over their use of artificial and organic fertilisers, pressure to breed more efficient livestock, plant more forests, and manage soil and grassland better.
How does a sector of the population which feels “the whole world is against them” vote? Some may not bother to vote, however that is certainly not typical of farmer voters.
It will be interesting instead to see if they react by voting to put more farmers in the Dáil.
Nearly 20 current TDs, or about one in eight, can claim backgrounds in farming.
Farmers may take advantage next Saturday of any opportunity to increase those numbers. That could be yet another surprise element in an election which is proving unpredictable.
There are a few candidates with strong-looking farmer credentials who are given little chance of success.
But if farmer voters opt in a big way for candidates who knows at first hand what farmers are going through, they could get enough preferences to affect their constituency outcomes, if not get elected themselves."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30981367.html,2020-02-12 16:29:00,Kingmakers: The independents who could help the bigger parties form next Government,"While several independent TDs are keen to be part of a new coalition government and see their election promises implemented, they are biding their time as the bargaining begins.
A number of non-party TDs told the Irish Examiner that they are “absolutely” open to talking with others about how to progress their election wish-lists.
New or expanded groups for parliamentary speaking rights are also being formulated ahead of the 33rd Dáil sitting for the first time next week.
Former MEP Marian Harkin, elected for Sligo Leitrim, said she is “absolutely” interested in being involved in government.
“I don't like the phrase kingmaker. After being in the European Parliament for 15 years, it was all about compromise there.
My interest would be rural-focused, to try and drive policy changes to the regions.
The TD, who was previously in the Dáil in 2002 and set up a technical group for speaking rights, said she is currently in talks with other independents about options.
“You are either relevant or you risk being irrelevant. How do you deliver? The best way is by being part of a grouping that has a common cause or platform.”
Ms Harkin is close to fellow independents Denis Naughten and Michael Fitzmaurice, two returned Roscommon-Galway TDs who are seen as contenders for coalition talks.
Elsewhere, returned Donegal TD Thomas Pringle, a member of the group Independents4Change, said it is “incumbent” on deputies on the left to try and put together an administration. However, the group has not yet been in contact with Sinn Féin, which is currently leading formation talks.
Mr Pringle said his priorities for ""change"" are housing, health and rural Ireland.
""We need to get away from the market-driven response to these issues, which is what Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil did for years.""
A key player in any talks with independents could be returned Galway East TD Sean Canney. He is the only returned independent minister from the last coalition.
I will talk to anybody who has an interest in talking to me.
""It is important we have a stable government, not for months but for the next three to four years,” said the former Independent Alliance member.
His priorities, if he was part of a pact or coalition, would include tackling the housing crisis as well as the setting up of a pricing regulator for beef farmers.
Cathal Berry, a former army commander elected as an independent for Kildare South, is also being watched as a potential partner for coalition after campaigning about low pay for soldiers.
Elsewhere, the existing Rural Independents group from the last Dáil met and is considering whether it will support anyone.
Member and the returned Kerry TD, Michael Healy-Rae, told the Irish Examiner: “I have an open mind. The concerns I have include health and housing. But you have to also balance a budget. It is very difficult for a party to promise anything.”
Cork South West returned TD Michael Collins is also being touted as a contender for coalition negotiations. But Mr Collins has an extensive wish-list including a dedicated ministry for fishing, a rural resettlement programmes and resources for Bantry Hospital.
Both he and Mr Healy-Rae initially held talks to be in government at the start of the last Dáil with then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny, but they decided against going into power."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30983815.html,2020-02-24 21:00:00,Investors wonder whether meat substitute firm is more than a mere flash in the pan,"After the NASDAQ stock exchange closes in New York on Thursday, a company called Beyond Meat will report its fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results.
The company was the 2019 sensation in the global food industry.
Shares in Beyond Meat were first offered to the public at $25 in May, 2019. The demand was such that the share price hit $65 at the end of the first day of trading, making it one of the best performing first-day share launches.
But the price shot up to $235 four months later. Last week, it was about $120.
Whatever about Beyond Meat’s future, it has already created many millionaires. Private investors have been able to fully realise their profits by selling the shares.
And early $25 investors in the maker of plant-based meat substitutes were able to begin selling their shares for $100 at the end of October.
That was the month Beyond Meat reported its first quarterly profit.
In its first eight months as a public company, it became more valuable than long-established American food companies with billions of dollars of sales.
Last July, the stock market valued Beyond Meat at $13.4bn. It’s worth about $7.3bn now.
People who invested in the share last October have recently been looking at 50% capital gains, if they wanted to cash in.
The company reported a profit of $0.06 per share on revenue of $92m in the third quarter of 2019 (250% up on the previous quarter).
Stock analysts say it probably needs a fourth-quarter revenue of $65.6m to $75.6m to maintain its share price, and must boost 2020 revenue to about $500m.
Rapid year-on-year revenue growth was driven by distribution deals with major restaurant chains.
There are many reasons why the stock market performance of Beyond Meat has shaken up the food world… and the farming world.
Are investors betting billions on the end of beef farming?
Has the American food industry become the new darling of investors with billions to put into start-up firms?
There’s any amount of private money waiting to get in on the ground floor of start-ups ahead of lucrative offering of shares to the public.
Or is the plant-based alternative food sector the latest speculative bubble to follow the Dutch tulip mania, the bull market of the Roaring Twenties, and Japan’s bubble economy of the 1980s?
Supporters of the speculative bubble theory need only point at the world’s rising consumption of real meat.
In Beyond Meat’s home market, the US, consumption of beef and other real meat has risen steadily since 2014.
This suggests the animal protein trend is bigger than the plant-based protein trend.
Despite rising concern about climate change and the environment, global meat consumption increased in the decade to 2017 by an average of 1.9% per year.
The Irish beef industry, looking over its shoulder at Beyond Meat, will be glad to hear that beef sales in its main market, the UK, still look strong, with 86% of households purchasing beef in 2019, compared to 87% in 2018.
Lifestyle choices like vegetarianism and veganism, and their well-financed lobby and activist groups, are not having much effect, certainly not enough to support Beyond Meat’s $13.4bn valuation.
Not all in the food industry are happy with the stratospheric financial performance of the company.
It’s a worry for some that it has blown other lucrative food fads out of the water.
For example, those who had invested to take advantage of the clean label or “natural” consumer trends have been taken by surprise.
Surveys indicate that 91% of US consumers believe food and beverage options with recognisable ingredients are healthier.
They want additives and synthetics removed, and recognisable ingredients used, that are minimally processed. As a result, “clean label” products proliferate in the shops.
Consumers are also interested in products whose supply chains are “clean.”
But that 20-year trend around increased transparency and simplicity in food ingredients seems to have evaporated, with the advent of fake meat.
A lot of processing goes into meat substitutes.

Beyond Meat does not use GMO ingredients, and it is soy free and gluten free. Nor does it have heme, the GMO-derived ingredient used by Impossible Foods, the main market rival to Beyond Meat, to add flavour and texture.
Impossible Foods inserts the DNA from soy into yeast and ferments it, to make heme in high volumes.
Beyond Meat says it uses a combination of beet powder and annatto to get the beefy red colour for its burgers.
Other ingredients in the processing mix are protein from peas, mung beans, fava beans, and brown rice; fats from cocoa butter, coconut oil, sunflower oil, and canola oil; minerals such as calcium, iron, sodium chloride and potassium chloride; beet juice and apple extracts for flavours; and carbohydrates from potato starch and methylcellulose (a plant fibre derivative).
Many in the food industry are closely watching for any signs of the plant-based movement running out of hype, which could be followed by a steep sales slump for meat alternatives.
This could happen if previous consumer concerns return about nutritional value, unfamiliar ingredients and processing.
Meanwhile, progress in the scientific understanding of climate change could also undermine one of the foundations under plant-based meat — the notion that veggie burgers are the best route to saving the planet.
Many believe that is ill-informed, that methane from ruminants is not a very significant contributor of greenhouse gas, that rising methane comes instead from shale gas fracking.
But there’s billions in smart money riding on plant-based gaining more and more momentum, and that it will be followed by equal success for laboratory-based, cell-cultured meat and animal products, which some investors in the food industry are banking on.
Japan’s SoftBank Group has led a $161m investment in cell-based meat producer Memphis Meats.
Other Memphis Meats investors include Cargill, one of the world’s biggest grain companies, alongside Bill Gates and Richard Branson.
Bumpy voyage for firm exploring new food industry territories
Ireland’s livestock industry is understandably worried by the rise of plant-based “meat”.
But probably not half as much as the investors who have bet millions on this trend.
Consider, for example, the people who have bet heavy on Beyond Meat.
According to leading business news provider CNBC, if you invested $1,000 in last year’s stock market launch of Beyond Meat, your investment would be worth nearly $4,500 this month — a total return of around 345%.
That’s a 25 times better return than the US stock market in general.
The producer of plant-based meat substitutes became a popular choice for those who aim to avoid eating chicken, beef and pork, in some of America’s biggest fast food chains.
In the first week of January, Beyond Meat’s share price surged 12.5% after its rival, Impossible Foods dropped out of a deal with McDonald’s.
If a partnership between Beyond Meat and McDonald’s expands, the alternative meat company’s shares could rise to new heights.
Beyond Meat shares had soared 163% on its first day of trading.
But a disappointing earnings report three months later sent the share price sliding nearly 15%, in a slump which continued until January 2020, when the launch of the Beyond Sausage at the Dunkin’ chain restaurants boosted the share.
Starbucks announcing plans to sell more plant-based items also helped investors.
There was a setback on January 28, when bankers JPMorgan downgraded Beyond Meat stock, saying its share price recovery was due to unreliable media speculation.
But investors are hanging on in there, betting on forecasts that the alternative meat industry could win 9% of US market share by 2040.
They were encouraged by KFC saying it will offer plant-based “fried chicken” in Tennessee and North Carolina, starting in March.
But the Tim Hortons chain of coffee and doughnut shops removed its limited-edition Beyond Meat products from locations in Ontario and British Columbia.
The Denny’s restaurant chain said in January it will extend availability of the plant-based Beyond Burger from its Los Angeles locations to other restaurants across the US and Canada.
The same day, Beyond Meat’s shares went up 4.4%.
What new shocks for investors could today’s fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results for Beyond Meat bring?"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30985725.html,2020-03-04 15:00:00,"Below-cost sale of Irish beef should be banned, report recommends","The report notes the beef sector is faced with a combination of negative forces including CAP reform, Brexit, European Union and global beef market conditions.
A ban on below-cost selling is recommended in an Irish Farmers Association report on the beef sector.
It also calls for the appointment of a retail regulator and warns that unsustainable discounting should not be allowed as it is not in the interests of farmers, processors or consumers.
The report, by economist Jim Power, notes the beef sector is faced with a combination of negative forces including CAP reform, Brexit, European Union and global beef market conditions and the proposed Mercosur trade deal.
The negatives list also includes environmental considerations, the weak position of beef producers in the domestic supply chain, and the growth of beef animals from the dairy herd.
Irish suckler beef production is challenged, according to the report, which says policymakers have to decide if it is a sector worth supporting.
Mr Power said if stronger support is not forthcoming, many existing operators will go out of business.
This would have very negative consequences for economic and social life in large swathes of rural Ireland, the natural landscape, and agri-food exports, he said.
Maintaining the CAP budget in real terms with extra payments for further environmental asks on farmers is also urged in the report, which also calls for a full investigation into competition in the beef sector.
IFA President Tim Cullinan said the report demonstrates the number one factor all farmers in 2020 has to be the fight for a fair CAP budget."

The 24th of this month is the closing date for offers on a 42-acre residential holding near Tipperary town.
According to selling agent Matt Ryan of Tipperary-based auctioneers Matthew Ryan &amp; Son, this is a very attractive farm that will suit a number of suitors:
“Yes, it’s a very nice farm. It has a nice three-bedroom bungalow residence and there’s good quality land on the holding. It’s all in grass and it wouldn’t really be suitable tillage ground, more suitable for a dairy or beef enterprise.”
The property is located in the townland of Soloheadbeg about 2km from Tipperary town and within easy commuting distance of Limerick City, which is about a 40-minute drive to the northwest.
Limerick Junction railway station is a 10-minute drive from the farm.
There is good road frontage with the holding, which isn’t conducive to being split into lots. According to the selling agents, the land is well sheltered and fenced and the buildings are in good condition but in need of some modernising.
“The bungalow is in good condition,” says Mr Ryan. “It just needs a bit of modernisation. It’s an executor sale here and the house was built in the 1970s. There are new PVC windows and doors and it’s slightly elevated above the road so it has some good southerly views.”
Accommodation in the house includes three bedrooms, sitting room, living room, study, kitchen, bathroom, utility room and hallway. The outbuildings consist of a three-column hay barn and four out offices.
The property was used as a dairy farm in its heyday but has been leased for a number of years.
“A small section of the land has been reseeded in recent years,” says Mr Ryan, emphasising that the land has been well cared for.
“The interest has been reasonably good,” he says of the reaction of the market so far. “Mainly, it’s of interest to farmers considering an add-on to an existing holding.”
Price expectation is €500,000 (€11,900/acre) to €525,000 (€12,500/acre)."

The power void left by February’s general election has been instantly filled by the looming horror and scale of the coronavirus health crisis.
Rejected by voters, a caretaker government with one eye on the exit has had to do an about-turn and shuffle back into the ministerial corridors. The election left a stalemate. Suddenly, outgoing Fine Gael ministers have been thrust right back into their seats, filling the void amid the dire need to protect the masses.
The coronavirus has given the outgoing coalition, even with ministers who lost seats, fresh authority and a mandate to steer the country through this most uncertain time. For the moment.
Equally, as Fine Gael and rivals, Fianna Fáil, compete for control of the next government — new coalition talks will begin next week — both parties will be strangely assured by the fact that the peril posed by the virus could give the next government a clean slate.
Both parties admit that the virus will necessitate the use of billions of euro to support business losses, unemployment, frontline health staff, and an inevitable slowdown in the economy.
Virus fighting is first and foremost on the minds of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. After that, the government pot will be substantially reduced from what was forecast in the election and, crucially, from what was promised. Those election promises could become redundant.
Nonetheless, there will — after some time — be other priorities, beyond coronavirus.
Fianna Fáil figures say the same priorities from the election result — where there was no clear winner — will be on their agenda during coalition talks with Fine Gael.
These will be housing, general health reform, climate change, and the cost of living — and in that order.
Fianna Fáil wants to beef up the powers of the Land Development Agency, a body charged to deliver landbanks for the building of 150,000 new homes.
This deeper role would see the LDA go after public lands and those owned privately. Tough compulsory purchase measures could even be put to a referendum.
Crucially, Fianna Fáil supports the implementation of the Kenny report, from the 1970s, to put a cap on the price of land sold for housing.
“Kenny is back on the table; the concept of ensuring land is not treated as a commodity,” said a party source.
Building needs to be fast-tracked, say party figures. Department lands need to be submitted for housing planning; more capacity is needed in Bord Pleanála to deal with submissions, while there should be a preferred list of building contractors, according to the party.
Affordable homes will also remain a priority for Fianna Fáil in any new coalition.
“We need to invest in urban centres, rather than sprawl,” explained a party source, referencing the Fianna Fáil election promise to build thousands of low-cost homes.Fine Gael wants recognition of its housing programme, despite the homelessness crisis.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin at the count centre in Cork last month.
Both parties will heavily lean on Sláintecare, the cross-party-backed blueprint for the health service for the next decade, which proposes resourcing and reforming services.
However, Fine Gael’s promise to substantially cut income taxes will also be a bone of contention in talks.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had promised, if returned, that he would increase the higher rate of tax threshold from €35,300 to €50,000. But Fianna Fáil isn’t enthusiastic.
“They [Fine Gael] climbed down on this before, after failed promises to scrap the USC. They will have to climb down again. Nobody beat me at the doors over tax in the election,” said a senior Fianna Fáil figure. Instead, tax needs for the self-employed could be a happy medium for both parties to tackle
And then there is the cost of living. Fianna Fáil will argue for bigger insurance and mortgage-rate cost cuts. Fine Gael is also concerned about affordable childcare.
For the latter, divesting themselves of their achievements (or even failures) in power could be a tough ask.
Varadkar said as much in a letter to party members last week about the opening of the coalition talks with his rivals. Any government involving the two parties would have to include a policy platform that “builds on and protects” progress made by the last two Fine Gael governments.
These were keywords and may yet become a stumbling block between both sides. Especially as Fianna Fáil is adamant that the incumbents recognise “the beating from the electorate” and the need to overhaul policies in housing and health.
If not, voters could reject both parties even more next time, said the source: “Otherwise, we will be going back to the Dáil [after the next election] in a mini-bus, if those issues are not dealt with and they [Fine Gael] won’t be far behind in one.”
And this, even amid the virus emergency, will be at the back of the minds of negotiators when the rival parties sit down and talk together, next week."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30988529.html,2020-03-17 21:30:00,Our good name as the green food island will be valuable in an ever more volatile market,"Food production from farm to fork is rightly being treated as an essential service, and is therefore spared the worst of the Covid-19 restrictions.
But it seems inevitable that the industry in Ireland will be significantly affected by the pandemic.
Somewhat predictably, beef and lamb processors were first to blink, cutting prices this week, which were already low in the case of beef.
Dairy co-ops showed more consideration for their members, largely maintaining unchanged prices for February milk.
However, with 300-400 deaths per day in Italy this week due to Covid-19, and fears that the pandemic could trigger severe recessions (some experts have even warned of unraveling of the eurozone), it may be advisable to go into survival mode.
The pandemic outcome could arguably be worse than the Great Recession of 2008. That was caused by a financial shock in the US and European economies.
Now, the entire world faces a downturn across all sectors of the economy, with “social distancing” meaning less economic activity for nearly everybody in the world, working less, investing less, and spending less.
As an essential service, food production will not be the worst hit sector.
Member states have been asked by EU leaders to facilitate transport across borders, including transport of food and live animals, as well as medical equipment.
This is important for a big food exporter like Ireland, because border restrictions by many member states had slowed up logistics.
At home, the SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Loan Scheme is in place, co-funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), to make working capital available to impacted firms, including food businesses.
Agriculture Minister Michael Creed has asked EU Agriculture Commissioner Wojciechowski to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation is available in response to any emerging market disturbance.
The DAFM is taking necessary steps to ensure producers and processors can continue to operate effectively and keep supply lines open.
Keeping food and other processing facilities operational, ensuring that payments and commercial activities that protect farm incomes can continue, and that fishermen can land fish and place them on the market, are among DAFM priorities.
It is also committed to ensuring animal related matters such as payment processing, TB testing, animal welfare inspections, animal identification and passport issuing, BVD testing, controls at livestock marts, and animal export certification can continue, to enable farming to operate.
The DAFM is also committed to providing necessary services, for meat and milk plants, marts, breeding establishments, feed manufacturers and suppliers, egg suppliers, suppliers of animal medicines and other agri-products, and in fisheries harbours.
Michael Creed urged Irish consumers to be sensible in the shops, and to remember that Ireland is one of the most food secure countries in the world, feeding multiple times our population, across the globe, with strong supply chains.
So Ireland is spared the worry about having enough food, a real enough threat in countries heavily dependent on food imports.
Our food industry’s task now is to continue as a reliable supplier to such countries.
Our good name as the green food island will be valuable in a consumer market which is even more volatile than ever as pandemic worries increase.
Already, some Italian agri-food companies had received cancellations in export orders, since the start of the country’s devastating Covid-19 outbreak.
Google Trends data has revealed interest in cuisines from China and Italy, the two countries hardest hit by Covid-19, has plummeted."

The fast-food chain said all their outlets in Ireland and the UK will close by 7pm on Monday following similar closures in other European countries.
The move puts further pressure on beef farmers here. One in every five McDonald's burgers sold in Europe is of Irish origin. The food giant is the largest purchaser of Irish beef by volume, buying 40,000 tonnes each year from 18,000 different Irish farmers.
IFA President Tim Cullinan said that despite an increase in beef sales through supermarket sales, the closure of McDonald's is a big blow to the sector.
""Unfortunately, it is reflective of what is happening across Europe where closures have had an impact on the food service sector,"" he said.
He wrote to the European Commissioner for Agriculture last week pointing out that the Commission needed to stand ready to support the EU beef market.
“The Irish beef price is already well below the cost of production for farmers. They cannot sustain any further cuts,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30990476.html,2020-03-27 09:40:00,Pig processors offer €1.84 to €1.88/kg with €1.10 per kg deadweight,"All the main Irish pig processors cut their price for this week by another 4c/kg, quoting from €1.84 to €1.88/kg, with €1.10 per kg deadweight on offer for sows.
As with other farm products, consumer demand has switched to retail from foodservice, resulting in a demand surge for liquid milk and minced beef, for example (partly due to panic buying).
Processors supplying to retail benefit from extra demand, if they can source supplies and get product to stores.
But processors servicing foodservice markets are left with high stocks on hand to divert elsewhere.
Uncertainty of sales and payments will filter back to put pressure on revenue and cashflow for farmers and for manufacturers.
It’s not clear how the pandemic may affect the cost of pig feed.
Global wheat markets declined in February and the first half of March, then rallied on hopes that lower prices will increase trading.
With much maize used to produce ethanol, and the disincentive to use ethanol when crude oil prices are low, maize prices have remained low.
Global grain supplies are strong in the medium term outlook, at least until more is known about spring planting progress."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30990478.html,2020-03-27 09:48:00,Processors very cautious about quoting forward for cattle,"The beef trade has been hit by Covid 19, in one of the most unpredictable market situations for some time, across the world.
The closure of McDonalds restaurants in Ireland and the UK (Supermacs, Subway, Nando’s, Krispy Kreme and Starbucks are among others to close in Ireland this week) is serious for the beef sector.
It was inevitable that there would be an impact for cattle finishers.
The result was an immediate general price cut of 5c/kg for steers and heifers at the factories.
It is difficult to get a base price quote above 360c/kg for steers anywhere in the country this week.
Some processors are reported to have hinted to finishers there will be a base of 355c for steers before the end of this week.
Prices for heifers weathered the storm slightly better, with a general base of 365c, and some sales reported at a base of 370c/kg.
But as pressure on the market intensifies, heifer prices may come under the same pressure as steer prices.
Processors are left relying on the supermarket trade, and home cooking consumers, after catering closures.
They were very cautious this week about quoting forward for cattle.
As processors assessed the situation, with orders for beef reduced or cancelled almost daily, they were not inclined to give finishers any assurance on prices for more than a day or two ahead.
Prices for young bulls are running at around 10c behind steer prices.
Having tightened over the previous two weeks, cow prices steadied this week.
Up to 300c/kg is achieveable for O-grade cows, P-graders range from 260c for plainer types to 280c-290c/kg for better quality lots.
The intake at factories last week was 37,898 head, more than 2,000 head higher than the same week last year.
All categories were up on last year, with the exception of young bulls, down by 1,600 head, at 2,698 for last week."

I was sorry to hear the news that Tiger Roll won’t be racing in Aintree this year.
I know some might say that the world has bigger fish to fry these days, rather than to be concerned with a horse running in the Grand National.
But I don’t know about all that kind of talk.
Yes, it’s true the horse race had to be cancelled, but it’s important too that we don’t lose sight of all the little things in life that cheer us up. I remember the excitement last year, with the build up to the race, and more so when Tiger Roll romped home ahead of the pack.
I was sitting in my old jeep having a break from work, and chewing on a sandwich, while listening to the race on the radio. His win made my day. I didn’t have money on the horse, nor do I know the animal personally.
It was just a bit of happy news. Something cheerful to occupy the mind for a while. A success story I hoped could be repeated this year.
It’s important that we don’t lose sight of those little bits of good news in life.
This sense of doom and foreboding that is enveloping the world at the moment is not good for the head.
Especially the heads of the young. It’s OK when you reach middle age to have a certain amount of doom and foreboding in your diet, a bit like bran or fibre, it’s probably necessary to keep a fellow on the straight and narrow. But you don’t need a mountain of it every day.
If you can find an avenue at the moment that brings you a little happiness, head down that avenue. It’s not a crime to smile.
It hasn’t been outlawed yet, even if our quest for toilet roll has overtaken our interest in Tiger Roll.
Of course, the announcement earlier this week that McDonald’s is to temporarily close its fast food restaurants is good news for nobody. Especially beef farmers like ourselves who are so dependent on the likes of McDonald’s.
And on Tuesday, the news that mart sales are to be suspended was another blow.
But we must remember that these closures are only temporary. People haven’t gone off beef, they have only gone off each other. When this virus business blows over (which it will), I believe beef will bounce back to where it belongs, on top.
Who’s to say that those who now frown on beef, won’t turn back to it in droves, when they realise the nutritional and health giving benefits it offers?
Beef (and steak in particular) are superfoods.
Staying with beef, and the marts, for the last time until April 19, at the earliest.

Following discussions with farm organisations across the EU in recent days — specifically, our sister farming associations in the European Milk Board — we are now plainly at the point where we have to accept that there has been very serious market disruptions across the EU arising from the coronavirus pandemic and policy measures at EU level will be required to allow farmers and processors to adjust to the current market uncertainties.
The announcement last week that McDonald’s is to close its chain of restaurants across Ireland and the UK has merely underlined the writing that was already ‘on the wall’. In the context where one-in-five of all burgers sold by that food services chain right across Europe are sourced in Ireland, the ‘knock-backwards’ effects will be immediate and substantial.
What’s encouraging, in this present atmosphere of anxiety and unprecedented dislocation, is the determination of authorities, at both State and EU level, to go at the problems and their seeming willingness to utilise the lessons learned so expensively a decade or so ago. The first and most important of those lessons was the need to step in quickly and decisively, with both the determination and funds, before an economic fall becomes an economic collapse.
We can start from the point where there has been a surge in sales at retail level in recent weeks and this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future — if not at the very high levels seen last week. Food service has seen a dramatic drop and, again, the period of recovery at this stage remains uncertain. What has emerged ‘front and centre’ over the last week is the importance of food security in the EU and the hugely important role played by farmers in producing high quality and safe food across the EU.
Certain markets and companies — particularly those supplying food service — have taken a hit and it is essential at this stage that the EU intervenes to ensure that the farmers and processors are supported in order to maintain this critical production going forward and for as long as the crisis applies. ICMSA believes that implementing the following specifics will have practical benefits and also signal to the wider and worried population that the Commission is across the issues involved in getting food from the farmers to the consumers.
With transit across borders becoming more difficult, food products and materials associated with food production should be considered ‘essential good’ under the Commission’s proposed ‘green lanes’, which gives priority to certain products in freight transport. It is absolutely essential that the normal flows of food materials are maintained across and outside of the EU.
Private Storage Aid Schemes (PSA) should be made available for dairy and other products to allow the strategic management of food stocks from the forthcoming peak production period.
The rules in relation to farm schemes, including inspection requirements, will have to be reviewed and simplified to ensure that payments are made to all farmers at the specified time and that the maximum advances allowable are made.
Low interest loans should be made available through the European Investment Bank to secure the long-term sustainability of farms and food processing businesses.
The EU Commission must ensure that there is no opportunistic cutting of farmers prices by unscrupulous processors or traders of food produce and decisive action should be taken if such price cutting takes place.
There must be an immediate suspension on all imports of beef into the EU as those imports specifically target the steak cuts that must be retained for EU production.
The EU is facing a major health crisis and there can be no adequate response without all links in the food supply chain playing their role and taking their responsibilities seriously. Farmers are ready right now and all we need is the EU to implement simple and specific measures aimed at ensuring that we can continue to deliver high quality food to EU and global consumers through this fraught period.
ICMSA welcomes the Croatian EU Presidency proposal for a joint approach by Agriculture Council Ministers on this matter and it would be important that Ireland supports such an initiative and that these kind of specific measures are introduced without delay to ensure stability in the Agri-food sector.
It’s important to remember, even in the midst of such stress and worry, that whatever happens Irish farming can feed Ireland and anyone else within reach that needs food. We produce enough food every year for 50 million people and that’s why — apart from the obvious ‘frontline’ staff — it’s critical that we keep our farmers and food processing staff healthy and working. On a personal note, I’d ask everyone to look after elderly neighbours and each other. Wider society and communities are discovering — or perhaps, re-discovering — the wisdom and strength of the ‘Meitheal’ system that we farmers never forgot.
We’ve got through bad times before, we’ll get through this and we’ll get through it together."

During the first two months of 2020, about 4,100 cattle went north, for further production on farms in Northern Ireland.
Of these, 80% were females, most of which will be used in the suckler and dairy herds as replacements.
The 3,288 female cattle imported from the south compares with only 2,055 head in the same time frame last year.
There has also been an increase in the number of male cattle imported, from 216 head to 816 head. Of these, 660 animals were aged over 42 days, up from 173 head in the same period last year.
These animals will predominantly be intended for further production and eventual slaughter in Northern Ireland processing plants.
Some major processors in the North are unwilling to process these cattle, because of more limited market outlets for non-UK beef, and others may apply price penalties."

Meat Industry Ireland (MII) Senior Director Cormac Healy said MII has communicated these market issues to all the stakeholders and to the Government. “While traditional market supports [intervention and Aids to Private Storage] may not work in this case, other forms of support must be brought forward by the European Commission without delay,” said the processors' spokesman.
He said meat processing is continuing today across the country, albeit at reduced levels. “Processors, particularly in beef and lamb, are under pressure to maintain throughput levels, given the loss of the important food service market channel,” he explained.
Significant protective measures and protocols are in place for all staff, farmers and service providers.
“Meat processing is essential to continuity of food supply in the domestic, European and international supply chains and to facilitate orderly movement of animals from farms,” said Mr Healy.
He said continued operations are only possible due to the incredible commitment and efforts of staff at meat plants, of farmers and hauliers, and all service providers to the industry.
He urged all involved to work with the new guidelines and protocols in operation at meat processing facilities, and stressed the importance for companies to ensure that every possible measure is taken to protect all those working and engaged in the meat sector."

Farming group Beef Plan said it would be an important step in ensuring food supply chains are maintained during the current pandemic.
Yesterday Tesco announced it would continue paying processors the same price it paid for beef in January, pre-Covid-19.
Beef Plan's Dermot O'Brien said it is now time meat processors reverse recent price reductions paid to farmers.
""Since Tesco made the announcement we expect other retailers to follow suit,"" Mr O'Brien said.
""We would appreciate now that it is meat processors instill confidence in the supply chain,"" he said.

The Government issued the warning as it holds discussions with the EU on how best to support the sector.
A helpline has been set up for farmers to get information on supports available.
60% of Ireland's beef exports are for food services.
Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said demand has been badly hit abroad:
""Food services, fast food joints, restaurants, hotels, and to be honest that has virtually collapsed across all of our major markets,"" he said.
""So there is a real challenge there. There has been some consequent increase in the retail side but not at an order of magnitude that would compensate for what we are losing in those markets.

But “serious devaluation of finished livestock prices, as key market channels and certain EU markets are effectively closed, and the mix of sales through retail outlets is skewed heavily towards lower value cuts” was the main market impact identified by Irish beef processors due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Market analysts said hide sales are falling fast.
Some abattoirs are making space to store hides longer than would normally be expected, hoping for prices to recover.
However, this can have a detrimental impact on hide quality, and hides or skins might end up with a disposal cost rather than a market value.
Unmanageable build-up of hides can adversely affect abattoir operations.
The hide market had already been under pressure for some months, but Covid-19 concerns pushed prices lower.
Many sheepskins were already worthless even before the Covid-19 pandemic."

However, the ying and yang of these things may offer some unexpected opportunity too, especially for beef farmers.
Argentina’s beef shipments to the EU have stalled as coronavirus disrupts global food supply chains. That, unfortunately, may be situation for some time to come.
Argentina’s beef exports hit $3bn in 2019, and 9% of that came to the EU despite the objections of European farmers. Our beef exports fell by 1% last year but still hit €3.9bn. Those figures — €3bn as against €3.9bn — tell their own story about contrasting production cultures.
Weaker demand in the UK hit Irish beef prices and led to an overall market decline of 7%. Britain’s beef market is worth €990m to Irish producers.
The gap left by Argentina’s unfortunate difficulties will be, even temporarily, filled by someone if they can overcome the difficulties stymieing South American producers.
As the idea of ying and yang underlines, as one door closes another usually opens."

The supply chain of food and beverages can and must be preserved intact so that it can continue to feed the population, writes Ray Ryan.
A huge logistical operation is taking place to ensure the country’s multi-billion euro food and beverage chain is kept open during the virus pandemic.
It involves farming and fishing families, processing workers, hauliers, veterinary surgeons, retail and service sectors, Government departments, and State agencies.
The sector is Ireland’s most important indigenous industry. It comprises of 137,500 farms, accounts for 173,000 jobs and has around 700 companies.
It exports to 180 countries and has the capacity to produce enough food to feed 40m people.
Last year, exports of Irish food, drink, and horticulture products reached a record €13bn, with an added €1.5bn in non-edible goods, including forestry and animal feedstuffs.
It was, therefore, no surprise that the Government deemed it an essential service and allowed it to continue operating — with strict biosecurity and other protocols in place.
Keeping food on supermarket shelves at a time of public health anxiety and unprecedented retail demand is a priority for the sector.
Agriculture, food, and marine minister Michael Creed has announced a range of supports, including an increase in the Calf Investment Scheme from €1.5m to €4m.
He said the economic impacts of the crisis on agricultural and other commodity prices are only beginning to be felt, and are likely to become severe.
“For many families, this impact will be compounded by the loss of off-farm employment.
""I am asking the food industry to do whatever it can to support its thousands of farmer suppliers at this time,” he said.
Mr Creed said he had urged the European Commission to deploy the full range of supports available to ensure agri-food and fisheries can best serve the needs of society during the crisis with the minimum possible economic impact.
Jerry Long, president of ICOS, the co-ops umbrella body, said the food chain also includes feed, fertiliser, fuel and veterinary suppliers, animal movement, milk recording, artificial insemination, milking machine service and repair, as well as hardware and other outlets.
With co-op stores moving to a call-and-collect model, increased emphasis is being placed on delivery direct to farm, and all farmer communications are going towards phone and email only.
The supply chain is one of the tightest in the economy, he said, and it can and must be preserved intact so that it can continue to feed the population.
However, the closure of livestock marts caused a major dilemma for farmers trying to see their cattle and sheep.
There were many calls alternative safe trading arrangements.
Mr Creed has since issued guidance to marts on a limited range of essential services that comply with Government guidelines and do not require people to assemble.
These include measures to facilitate calf sales and the weighing of livestock, and online or brokerage services, subject to strict operating procedures.
ICOS said the decision will alleviate the current economic burden on farmers seeking to trade animals and will also ensure that calves can be bought and sold within the now-peak calving season.
Irish Farmers Association president Tim Cullinan, who also welcomed the move to facilitate marts, said all sectors are facing massive challenges, but the beef market is in turmoil and is in urgent need of significant measures.
The dairy industry is also bracing itself for a particular challenge, with the peak milk-production season looming just as the impact of the virus is predicted to reach its highest level.
Mr Cullinan said with proper co-operation and contingency planning he was confident the country’s dairy co-ops will continue processing all milk during the crisis.
Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association president Edmond Phelan called for extra funds from the European Central Bank in addition to Common Agricultural Policy supports.
“The closure of marts, coupled with serious volatility in the beef and lamb market, will play havoc with the cashflow on many fronts at a time when money will be needed for fertiliser, meal, diesel and, shortly, for first cut silage”, he said.
Fianna Fáil agriculture spokesperson Charlie McConalogue said the fact that Ireland exports 90% of its dairy and beef places a gigantic challenge in the present climate that will require direct and other supports.
As the sector responds to the crisis, Teagasc has now called for an increased focus on farm safety.
Meanwhile, the country’s network of rural shows, traditionally held from May to October, has been greatly disrupted. Balmoral Show has been postponed until August 19-22, and this will be kept under review.
Bord Bia, which has cancelled the Bloom gardens and food festival in Dublin, said an event of that scale requires many months of preparation involving a range of multi-disciplinary teamwork.
“This decision will be disappointing for many, and Bord Bia would like to pay tribute to the growers, designers, contractors, exhibitors, and sponsors who have worked so hard on this year’s event.
“We know that gardening can be of benefit to people’s mental and physical well-being during this difficult time.
""Bord Bia will be here as a resource with tips on planting and gardening at home for everyone from the complete novice to the many loyal Bloom attendees, who feed their passion for gardening at the festival each year,” it said.
The Irish Shows Association, which represents over 120 events on the island every year, is regularly updating a growing list of events not going ahead.
Shows already cancelled include Bandon, Belgooly, Charleville, Dungarvan, Newmarket-on-Fergus, and Tullamore.
The ISA, whose board will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks, said it will abide at all times by the advice of the Government and the public health authorities.
“Cancellation is not an easy decision to take for any show committee,” it said.
“We will be sorry to lose these events from our calendar in 2020 and look forward to welcoming them back in 2021.”"

The containers are sitting in clogged ports like Qingdao, above, in eastern China. In China and many other trading countries, port staff didn’t return to work to unload cargoes because of Covid-19 quarantine measures. As early as mid-February, about 10,000 refrigerated cargo containers containing meat were stuck in Chinese ports, according to a Beijing-based meat importer, about twice the usual level. Picture: STR/AFP via Getty Images
The beef market deteriorated further this week, with a further 10c/kg wiped off the prices paid at factories.
The second consecutive week of nosediving prices for steers and heifers has cut the return to finishers for a 350kg carcase by €70.
Processors say demand for beef on the export markets has weakened significantly, and the prices they paid in early to mid March are no longer justifiable.
The consequences for finishers has been another plunge into loss-making territory.
After their extremely difficult trading situation throughout last autumn, finishers hope for and badly needed an upturn in the spring.
Instead, the situation has only got worse, with the cheque from the factories shrinking every week.
Both steers and heifers are being quoted for this week at a base price of 340c/kg,with processors unwilling to pay more than the quoted price for any stock, other than those which had been purchased forward last week.
Finishers trying to negotiate deals going forward are now finding it difficult to get any commitment from factory agents on price for more than a couple of days in advance.
Finishers expect that supplies of beef cattle will tighten in the coming weeks, but fear the effects of panic selling by those who either need the cash or fear prices will fall further.
The intake at factories last week dropped to 30,731 head, which more than 5,000 head behind the same week last year. Steers accounted for 11,261 and heifer 9,389, both down more than 1,000 head from the 2019 figures.
Young bulls totalled 2,479 head, which is just over half the supply for the corresponding week in 2019. Cows at 5,660 are down 1,000 head from last year.
Prices for young bulls have followed the steers and heifers, with a drop of 10c/kg to a base of 330cs/kg for R-grade.
Cow prices have slumped by 20c/kg compared to a week ago. The P-grade cow price has slipped to 230c-235c/kg, with O-grade making 240c-250c/kg this week. Sellers are finding it difficult to get above 280c-285c/kg for better quality R-grade cows."

The Easter Saturday drive to Westmeath has never been a long journey, especially when there is so much to see.
The 1,100-acre Gigginstown Estate, famed for its bloodstock as well as its livestock, is owed by Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary.
Gigginstown House is home to the O’Leary family.
The opportunity for those interested in purchasing top class Aberdeen Angus bulls or heifers is still very much on the cards, even though the trip to Westmeath is off the agenda, due to Covid-19 restrictions.
Yesterday I spoke to Gigginstown manager (and West Cork native) Joe O’Mahony to find out more. I began by asking how the sale differs this year, and what is on offer for those interested buyers.
“As you know, Denis, the annual sale can’t go ahead as normal, but we are selling at home from Gigginstown by appointment,” Joe explained.
“Catalogues have been printed as usual, and can be viewed online at gigginstownhouse.com or on the Irish Aberdeen Angus website. Pictures and videos of the animals are also online on our Gigginstown Angus Facebook page.
“We have 30 bulls for sale ranging in age from 18 months to 24 months, with a mix of bulls to suit breeders, dairy and suckler farmers.
“The bulls are well grown for their age and have a high dairy beef index figure, which should help the sale of potential calves or stores in the future.
“Fifteen heifers are being offered for sale, ranging in age from 15 months to 24 months. These are a mix of maiden, in calf, and some on the point of calving. Potential buyers can make viewing appointments by phone to allow us facilitate people under current government health requirements.
“At the moment, we are experiencing a strong demand from all parts of the country, as farmers are preparing to buy in advance of breeding programmes. And due to the lack of mart sales nationwide, we hope to be able to find an animal suitable to their requirements.
“All breeding stock are priced according to age and quality.”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30993797.html,2020-04-12 18:10:00,Why live exports and beef industry hit hard by pandemic,"Live exports have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a comprehensive Bord Bia report published last Monday.
Along with the disruption of cattle mart closures, falling demand for livestock for export at the end of March substantially reduced the loads shipped, especially for calves destined for the Netherlands, and there were significant price reductions also.
The Bord Bia report identified the main problem for beef exporters as carcass demand imbalance, with retail demand mostly for lower value cuts such as mince, diced, or stewing, but low demand for steak. This is exacerbated by availability of low-priced South American steak in Europe, which Bord Bia said is having a big impact on sales of Irish beef in Europe, with prices falling as much as 66% for some cuts and markets.
Logistically, deliveries to both the UK and Continental Europe were proceeding to plan, but the issue of container availability for exports to Asia remained a big concern.
More than two million containers were left idle due to Covid-19 disruption, mostly due to Chinese ports operating at less than 50% capacity in recent months.
The container shortage has also affected Ireland’s dairy exports, with Bord Bia saying, “scarce and expensive equipment” was the main supply chain challenge since the start of the year.
Bord Bia cited reports that over 20% of sailings from China to Rotterdam had been cancelled which, along with container shortages, increased the cost and logistical complexity of exporting to Asia, with freight rates up as much as 200%. The situation was easing with greater availability of refrigerated containers, but increasing compulsory quarantine of ships for up to 14 days will add to constrains on equipment, manpower, and repatriation of vessels and containers back to European ports.
However, despite Covid-19 disruption, Bord Bia said feedback from the dairy ingredients sector was more positive. “The hit to foodservice is counterbalanced by a very significant surge in retail demand. Butter and cheese packers are performing extremely well
and in the shadow of peak production and output. There is significant movement of stocks evident as retailers rally to keep shelves full.”
In contrast, mid-tier consumer dairy companies exposed to foodservice in the UK and Ireland have faced a dramatic drop off in orders, according to the food board.
One example from a soft cheese manufacturer is a drop from 45 tons produced weekly to seven tons in one week.
Producers with multiple markets are trying to keep up with distributor demands from markets with varied results.
Bord Bia said sales of Irish and UK lamb stalled in the last week of March, due to the UK lockdown, and French retailers and foodservice pursuing a policy of sourcing French product, as their market weakened.
“There is concern from industry regarding cash flow and late payments for orders filled earlier in the year,” said Bord Bia sources.
Retail sales of pigmeat remained strong in Ireland, but foodservice sales have almost halted, with secondary processors supplying foodservice starting to lay off staff, and worried about potential bad debts and key customers not reopening.
There is also limited cold storage capacity in the pigmeat industry.
Demand internationally is building, but the lack of shipping containers is hampering ability to fill such orders.
There is strong retail demand for poultry, estimated to be up 30-40%, and expected to be up 20% for the year. But foodservice sales are down 50% and falling further. There are no logistical issues for exporters to the UK, but container availability hampers International exports.
Value-added lines are temporarily suspended across the poultry industry, according to Bord Bia."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30993796.html,2020-04-13 18:05:00,Farmers willing to invest in a sexed semen lab,"Three out of four Irish dairy farmers are willing to support the establishment of a sexed semen laboratory in Ireland, in order to reduce the number of unwanted male dairy calves, according to a survey carried out by NUI Galway and Teagasc.
The survey result reflects farmers’ worries about markets for the increasing number of dairy calves not required as replacements in the herd.
Last December, allegations of killing of unwanted dairy bull calves on farms surfaced nationally.
These were dismissed by Agriculture Minister Michael Creed, who said the number of male dairy calves disposed at knackeries decreased in 2019.
He emphasised the low death rate of only 2.5% of all calves on Irish farms, before six weeks old, and the good health reputation of Irish calves exported to the Netherlands and Spain.
He also introduced the Calf Investment Scheme to help farmers manage increasing dairy calf numbers. There was a strong farmer response to the scheme.
However, the Covid-19 pandemic has now damaged veal markets to the extent that farmers fear calf exports could decrease, creating extra pressure on heavily stocked dairy farms.
In response, Minister Creed increased the Calf Investment Scheme budget from €1.5m to €4m.
Using sexed semen for breeding dairy replacements (including 100% sexed semen if using Jersey genetics) is one of the recommended ways of reducing unwanted dairy calves, so it is not surprising that 75% of the dairy farmers in the NUI Galway/Teagasc survey said they would be willing to contribute a few euros per dairy cow for establishment of a sexed semen laboratory in Ireland,
Such a laboratory would help in the work to increase the conception rates with sexed semen, which are lower than with conventional semen.
The survey, carried out earlier this year, was funded by the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, to explore farmers’ breeding decisions, calf marketing strategies, and attitudes in relation to the dairy industry and animal welfare.
The 450 farmers who responded to the online survey are larger in scale than the typical Irish dairy farm, having an average of 132 dairy cows.
Most respondents said that the major stumbling block to more widespread use of sexed semen is the low conception rate.
Price, and the genetic quality of sexed semen, were further down the pecking order, when it came to reasons for the low uptake.
Asked why they would agree to pay a small fee for establishment of a sexed semen laboratory in Ireland, the main reasons given were:
* to increase availability of sexed semen from top EBI dairy bulls.
* the potential reduction of calves that are killed early.
* and an improvement in the Irish dairy industry’s reputation.
Farmers in the survey revealed that a small proportion of calves (4%) were sold for processing.
In March, the intake per week of young veal animals in Irish beef processing plants reached its highest weekly intake on record, nearly 4,000.
Respondents’ calf mortality rate averaged 4%, 80% said they have expanded their calf housing since milk quota abolition.
Over two fifths of respondents (41%) indicated that they can house all of their calves at any one time.
Just one tenth of those surveyed reported that they could house only half or less of their calves at any one time."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30993985.html,2020-04-14 18:53:00,Coronavirus: Bord Bia details the huge task facing our food industry,"Smithfield Foods, one of the largest meat-processing companies, warned the US is perilously close to the edge in terms of meat supply, after it had to close its Sioux Falls, South Dakota pigmeat last Saturday, until further notice, when hundreds of its 3,700 employees tested positive for Covid-19.
Little if any effect on production of raw material, nor on processing, but huge disruption beyond the farm and factory gates, was the challenge described when Bord Bia issued its Covid-19 Response Plan for the Irish food industry this week.
Just how bad things could get was seen in the United States last week, when Smithfield Foods had to close its Sioux Falls, South Dakota plant until further notice.
The plant had to be closed last Saturday after hundreds of its 3,700 employees tested positive for Covid-19.
It is one of the largest pork processing facilities, with 4-5% of US pork production.
The company warned the closure of this and other plants across the industry pushed the US perilously close to the edge in terms of meat supply, with severe repercussions for many in the supply chain, first and foremost farmers who would have nowhere to send their animals.
It’s a plight that could be repeated worldwide because the US is not at the top of the rankings for cases of Covid-19 per million.
Earlier this week, the US was estimated to have 1,770 cases per million.
Large counties with higher incidence were all here in Europe, including Spain (3,690 cases per million), Switzerland (2,980), Belgium (2,685), Italy (2,638), and France (2,095).
The statistics depend on how much testing was done in each country, for example, Iceland was estimated to have over 5,000 cases per million, but this can be attributed to the testing of 10% of their population, far higher than anywhere else in the world.
Still, the figures illustrate the threat to the food industry and other industries, posed by Covid-19.
That’s why minimising the risk of the disease to their employes is such an important part of the huge task facing the food industry.
Bord Bia said all Irish dairy processors have risk mitigation plans and strict protocols with all milk collectors in place along the supply chain, with farmers advised accordingly.
All non–essential workers must work from home.
Nor had Covid-19 a material effect yet at production level on Irish beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, or poultry (although value-added poultry lines were suspended),
However, Bord Bia said breweries were making difficult decisions around human resourcing, given the labour-intensive nature of their work, often in smaller spaces.
And labour is a big issue among Bord Bia clients in edible horticulture, with the reduced availability of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe a big concern.
Production and processing are not significantly damaged in the Irish food industry.
However, there is chaos beyond the farms and the processing plants, due to the Covid-19 pandemic effects on markets and logistics.
Most food sectors are trying to adjust to the loss of foodservice sales, counterbalanced by a very significant surge in retail demand.
This could be a nearly impossible task for some companies, even though Bord Bia says it has found grocery chains in Ireland are without exception open to helping Irish suppliers as much as they can.
Most have enacted improved payment terms for the short term, and agreed to work closely with Bord Bia to identify new Irish suppliers.
Still, the market shift from foodservice to retail has left our beef exporters hit by low demand for steak from foodservice, and from price-conscious retail consumers, while competing with low priced South American steak being sold in Europe.
So Irish steak prices paid to processors have plummeted, and they are unable to sell a lot of the carcase, which has to go into cold storage.
Of course, our dairy and beef industries depend 80-90% on export markets, and the big problem there has been the pandemic interfering with international logistics.
Even if demand were to jump overseas, due to local food industries being closed down by Covid-19, it is debatable if Irish companies could get product to them, to meet the demand.
This is mainly because of the lack of refrigerated shipping containers internationally.
That problem stems mainly from China.
Every country and company was trying to break in into the huge Chinese market with their foods.
But the downside of that is that Chinese ports have been operating at less than 50% capacity over the last months, as the country dealt with its Covid-19 outbreak.
The ports lockdown left more than two million refrigerated containers sitting idle. (The lack of supply is exacerbated by rising demand in some countries for use of these containers as morgues.)
More than 20% of sailings between China and Europe have been cancelled, according to some reports.
The imbalance of container distribution and the reduction in shipping availability has increased the cost and logistical complexity of exporting to China and other parts of Asia, with freight rates up as much as 200%, according to Bord Bia.
Such are the problems beleaguered food industry chiefs have to deal with.
And there are plenty more in the background, not least concern in the industry regarding cash flow and late payments from the worst-hit sectors of the food industry, such as the closed down foodservice sector.
Arguably, foodservice outlets face the biggest challenges of all, having had to close indefinitely across Europe and the US.
Only a small percentage of revenue losses are expected to be off-set by home delivery, still in its infancy in most countries.
The projected lockdown monthly loss in revenue before VAT, for the foodservice sector, is €2.4 billion for Germany and France, and €4.5 bn for Italy and Spain.
Another worry in the background for the food industry is limited cold storage capacity, to cater for market upsets, or for surplus food storage schemes which might be financed by the EU.
In its report, Bord Bia has done a comprehensive job of outlining the challenge; the guidance, supports and initiatives available from Government and State Agencies; and advice to guide the difficult decision making for these challenging times.
Bord Bia recommends financial management actions to manage food businesses through the crisis.
Companies are advised to continuously assess supply chain strengths and weaknesses.
Welfare and safety at the factory floor level is emphasised, an escalating concern as a consequence of Covid-19.
The workforce is described as the greatest asset of many companies, but also one of the largest expense items, and due to demand having been turned off with such speed and ferocity, some businesses have to reduce payroll costs, or avail of one of the Government’s new Covid-19 schemes for employees.

Earlier this year, NUI Galway and Teagasc conducted a survey of Irish dairy farmers, funded by the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, to explore farmers’ breeding decisions, calf marketing strategies, and attitudes in relation to the dairy industry and animal welfare.
The 450 farmers who responded to the online survey are larger in scale than the typical Irish dairy farm, having an average of 132 dairy cows.
Are farmers supportive of a change in dairy calf markets?
Three quarters of the surveyed farmers are concerned about the reputation of the Irish dairy industry.
In contrast, when asked if they are responsible for producing calves for the beef industry, farmers’ opinions are divided, with similar proportions agreeing and disagreeing with the statement.
The welfare of their animals is important to most Irish dairy farmers.
Moreover, the vast majority felt that they had nothing to hide in relation to calf treatment, as 85% of those surveyed indicated they are willing to explain to consumers what they do with their dairy calves.
Most respondents said that low conception rate was the major stumbling block to more widespread use of sexed semen.
Price and the genetic quality of sexed semen were further down the pecking order, when it came to reasons for the low uptake.
However, most of the surveyed farmers would put their hands in their pockets and contribute to establishing a sexed semen laboratory in Ireland.
The survey findings reveal that 75% of farmers would be willing to contribute a few euros per dairy cow to support the establishment of a sexed semen laboratory in Ireland.
The availability of sexed semen from top EBI dairy bulls, the potential reduction of calves that are killed early, and an improvement in the Irish dairy industry’s reputation, are main reasons why farmers agree to pay a small fee.
How did breeding decisions and calf marketing look like in 2019?
Over 50% of the calf crop born in 2019 on the surveyed farms was sired by a Friesian bull, and about a third of the calf crop was sired by a beef breed.
The Dairy Beef Index was used by 40% of respondents, who focused on selecting beef AI bulls that were easy calving, short gestation length, and with good carcass traits.
While just over one quarter (26%) of beef calves were reared on respondents’ farms, the balance was sold.
In terms of first movement from the farm,  approximately one third were sold direct to other farmers, over a quarter were sold through the mart, and 12% were sent for live export.
A small proportion of  respondents’ calves (4%) were sold for processing.
What about calf welfare?
Respondents’ calf mortality rate averaged 4%, and 80% of them reported that they have expanded their calf housing facility since milk quota abolition.
The housing available on respondents’ farms was generally adequate for  seasonal spring calving herds, with the average respondent able to house over 80% of calves on the farm at any one time.
This minimises the risk of overstocking caused by a delay in the sale of calves.
Over two fifths of respondents (41%) indicated that they can house all of their calves at any one time.
Just one tenth of those surveyed reported that they could house only half or less of their calves at any one time.
Teat and bucket feeding systems of calf rearing predominate.
Only 15% of respondents use an automatic calf feeder.
Despite the labour-saving advantages of once-daily feeding, the vast majority (87%) of respondents who manually rear their calves, feed them twice daily."

Japan’s attempt to ramp up production of its Wagyu beef was badly timed, with the Covid-19 crisis hitting sales of such luxury foods hardest.
Japan aimed to meet to meet soaring tourist demand for the succulent, perfectly marbled beef, and eventually, to build an export market. Instead, the country’s cold-storage facilities are filling rapidly with the meat, which commands prices as high as $500 a kg in more prosperous times.
The Wagyu expansion plan depended on Tokyo’s 80,000 restaurants being busy, and on tourist numbers continuing at 2019’s level of more than 31m. And with the Tokyo Olympics only a year away, Japan’s agriculture ministry decided last summer to double its Wagyu beef output to 300,000 tonnes a year over the next 15 years.
But Covid-19 struck, and the Japanese government declared a state of emergency last week.
Apart from supermarkets, pharmacies, and others providing critical services, many businesses in Tokyo, Osaka and the five other prefectures for which the emergency was declared, will stay closed until May 6 in line with the government’s request for people to stay at home and limit social contact.
The Liberal Democratic Party’s Agriculture and Forestry Committee has proposed that the Japanese government issue vouchers that people can exchange for free Wagyu beef, and some other foods. Supermarkets will help, by offering Wagyu beef at a special price of 20-40% below normal rates.
But pandemic measures have devastated sales of Wagyu and of other luxury foods for which Japan is famous, such as sea urchin, crab, and tilefish."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30994253.html,2020-04-15 20:37:00,235-240c/kg base price offered for steers and heifers,"Sold through Dowra mart in Co Cavan last Saturday,these four Charolais cross store heifers of 490kg sold for €1,100 each. (€2.24 per kg).
The challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic were the last thing the Irish beef industry needed, after its blockades in 2019, an autumn of low prices, and a very weak 2020 start to the beef trade at factories.
It is easy for farmers to blame processors for the latest collapse in prices being paid for beef cattle.
But they are up against a drastic reduction in demand for prime beef cuts in particular and falling prices across all beef markets, as part of the Covid-19 fallout.
No one can foretell where it will bottom out, even the experts cannot predict when life will return to somewhere near normal again, and the trail of destruction left in the wake of Covid-19 will be with us all until that time.
We can only live in the present, but for beef finishers, the present is not a good place, price-wise.
There is no doubt now that spring beef finishers, the farmers with the most costly beef to produce, are taking a financial hammering.
Markets have continued to weaken, and prices have come back further at the factories for this week.
There was a sharp drop in the kill at factories for the shorter Easter working week, falling to 27,124 head, compared to 35,627 for week 15 last year.
Steers accounted for 11,182, with 8,203 heifers and 2,445 young bulls.
All three categories were well down compared to the same week in 2019.
The base price for steers is in a range between 235 cents/kg and 240 cents/kg for stock meeting the in-spec criteria.
Processors are more cautious about forward pricing of stock, which worries finishers that the lower end of the price range could be the best on offer within days.
The base for heifers is slightly stronger than for steers, at 240 cents/kg, but anyone trying their luck for extra is up against a stone wall.
For finishers with out-of-spec animals, particularly steers, whether that is on grade or weight, the penalties are heavy.
The reality is that processors are not showing much interest in buying cattle over the preferred weight, or of less favoured grades, and they are pricing such animals at under 300 cents/kg.
Young bulls are equally out of favour with the factories, and priced accordingly.
Given that they were not included in the categories to qualify for higher in-spec bonuses, in the 2019 review (and therefore are limited to a 12 cents/kg bonus on the grid), in general the prices on offer have dipped to at least 18 cents/kg less than the equivalent steer grade.
Demand for minced beef is weathering the lockdown storm best, and this is reflected in the more stable price pattern for cows at the factories.
Prices for R-grade cows are in a range of 265-285 cents/kg, with Os at 255-265 cents/kg, and Ps from 220 cents/kg to 250 cents/kg, depending on their weights."

Beef finishers have warned they cannot wait for help until the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on April 27, as base prices for steers and heifers fell this week to 235-240 cents/kg for in-spec cattle.
Prices for out-of-spec animals are under 300 cents/kg.
IFA National Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden confirmed that many farmers are being turned back by processors who cannot take their livestock.
Bord Bia has confirmed that carcass demand imbalance is a big problem for beef exporters.
It is due to retail demand being mostly for lower value cuts such as mince, diced, or stewing, but low demand for steak.
That leaves processors with much of the steak cuts from each carcase having to go into storage to wait for a market, because the foodservice market is closed down — or selling at steak prices reduced as much as 66%.
Also having a big impact on sales of Irish beef in Europe, according to Bord Bia, is the availability of low-priced South American steak in Europe.
Shipping container availability for exports to Asia remains a big concern also for beef exporters.
Meanwhile, Covid-19 market setbacks, along with cattle mart closures, threaten the vital export trade for over 200,000 calves per year, mostly from dairy farms.
The Dutch market for veal, a crucial outlet for Irish calves, has deteriorated due to closure of restaurants.
In the Netherlands, calf prices declined by €30 per head in a fortnight, as veal producers experienced delays in moving the cattle approaching eight months of age, and ready for veal processing.
Irish calf exports to Spain held up better, possibly because calf sourcing from Italy had been restricted.
There are better prospects for live export of older cattle, with shipments scheduled for Turkey and Algeria in the near future.
File image.
There have been several shipments to Libya, taking 5,600 animals to-date this year.
A consignment of 2,900 young bulls recently went to Turkey.
A consignment of finished cattle is being assembled for Algeria.
As the dairy and beef industries wait for meaningful EU market support, help for fishermen from Brussels has moved closer.
For most fishing fleets, sales opportunities are extremely limited. Prawn sector markets in the UK, France and Spain collapsed.
For the whitefish sector, the Irish retail market remains open, but many boats are tied-up, on the advice of sales agents. Whitefish processors continue at full capacity.
Imports of seafood, mostly salmon and cod, continue at normal levels.
EU ambassadors have agreed the EU Council’s position on a proposal to help the sector.
Expected measures at EU level include support for temporary cessation of fishing co-financed up to 75% by the EU; support for temporary suspension or reduction of aquaculture; support for storage of fishery and aquaculture products; and increasing eligibility for storage aid to 25% of annual quantities."

Unfortunately, it isn’t that simple.
Irish Heart Foundation dietitian Sarah Noone says it is a myth that you can boost your immune system through diet or supplements, and good hygiene and social distancing continue to be the best means of avoiding infection.
She has warned against peddling of misinformation around nutrition and the immune system, and notes that the European Food Safety Authority has not authorised any claim for a food or food component to be labelled as protecting against infection.
She says the only way to truly boost the immune system is through vaccination, but there isn’t a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus yet.
However, a diet that includes enough energy and a variety of nutrients, and lifestyle, are important for immune system support.
Most of us in Ireland need additional vitamin D, which mostly comes from sunshine, but is found naturally in oily fish and egg yolks, and is added to foods like fortified breakfast cereals, fortified milks and spreads.
Vitamin D supports bone health and the immune system.
So we should try to spend some time outdoors in the sunshine.
Getting enough sleep, avoiding too much alcohol, not smoking, and hand hygiene, also support your immune system.
Equally important are physical activity and stress management.
One of the most important dietary aspects for the immune system is to eat enough calories.
But putting yourself under pressure in an attempt to have the perfect diet only causes stress that can damage your immune system.
Despite this level-headed Irish Heart Foundation advice, many eminent doctors working against poor diet and obesity are taking advantage of the pandemic to sell their message.
British cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, who has long campaigned against sugary and ultra-processed food, scored a publicity coup recently when Barnet Hospital in north London went on social media to thank Krispy Kreme for delivering 1,500 doughnuts for staff.
Malhotra and other leading doctors, nutritionists, and dietitians condemned the hospital for advertising one of the ‘junk foods’ blamed for obesity, which they said is associated with poor coronavirus outcomes.
Dr Malhotra has called for public health messaging to be urgently updated in the light of Covid-19, to ensure people eat nutritious whole foods, in an attempt to reduce risk and subsequent death rates from the virus.
Malhotra said, “The general public need to be told immediately by official sources to cut out sugar, refined carbohydrates, and junk food, and switch to a whole food diet abundant in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, dairy and plenty of protein from pulses, fish, meat, and eggs, to improve their health within weeks, to help protect themselves if they contract the novel coronavirus.”
He suggested the health message should be to “eat real food, protect the NHS, and save lives.”
Harley Street nutritionist Kimmy Pearson said, “Associations between our health status and the extent to which Covid-19 is likely to affect us are becoming increasingly apparent.
There has been the tendency to tip toe around the issue of obesity, with clinicians hesitant to point it out to their patients for fear of repercussion and accusations of fat shaming.
“While this is without doubt a very sensitive subject, which must be handled with care, the current pandemic highlights the very real fact that overlooking the seriousness of excess weight is costing lives.”
A switch to healthier diets is definitely in the air, at least in the UK, the single most important market for our food production.
And it could be beneficial for Irish food exporters.
Our beef exporters will be particularly conscious of the healthy food message in the UK, especially after a 2019 in which they saw a 15% fall in the value of beef exports to the UK, to €990m.
Export volumes, at 265,000 tonnes, were down 11%.
The UK still accounted for 47% of Irish beef exports, compared to 52% in 2018.
It wasn’t just Irish exporters who were hit.
Analysis by The Grocer magazine, the premier weekly magazine for the food and drink retail sector in the UK, indicated that three of the 10 fastest-falling products in their 2019 Top Products listings were meat products, with significant value and volume losses for beef, bacon and sausages.
The fresh meat category lost a staggering £184.6m of sales, it was estimated.
This was attributed to reduced consumer confidence, trading down to cheaper cuts, and unsuitable weather for barbecue meals, among other other factors.
The question now is could our meat industry do better, if consumers become more health-conscious.
Meat-free was one of the 10 fastest-growing categories in 2019; but how will that fare, with highly processed foods getting a black mark from whole food proponents such as Dr Malhotra?
The Grocer magazine said the fastest-growing food category in the UK in 2019 was chocolate, with sales growing by an estimated £183.5m (almost exactly matching the £184.6m loss of fresh meat sales).
Chocolate could lose out, in a move to healthier eating.
Next in the list of categories estimated to have the fastest-growing sales in 2019 were rolling tobacco, spirits, carbonated fizzy pop, and bagged snacks.
Their sales increased by a total of about £750m.
It is clear that if the UK turned to healthier eating (and gave up smoking, also associated with poor Covid-10 outcomes), big gaps could open up in the food and drinks market for products with a healthier image.
Also gaining sales were dairy-free brands, sports and energy drinks, lager, and the only proven healthy item, vegetables, with sales up £54m, attributed mainly to price inflation.
The data on last year’s winners and losers in the food and drinks market shows how fickle consumers can be.
It is possible they will have developed a completely new attitude to food and drink by the time the Covid-19 pandemic becomes manageable.
Ireland, with its healthy food production image, may be well placed to satisfy the demands of newly health-conscious consumers."

It followed Tyson, the largest US meat company, warning that the food supply chain is breaking down.
Last week, about a third of US pork processing capacity and 14% of beef capacity was closed.
The White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80% of US meat production capacity could shut.
With one fifth of global meat exports coming from the EU, and no big EU plant shutdowns yet (although there are difficulties, including in Ireland), some in North America are looking towards Europe for supplies.
McDonald’s Canada has said it will start importing beef.
The US food supply shock will strengthen the case for better aid for the EU meat industry, following disappointment at the beef private storage aid scheme for only about 4% of a single month’s production in the EU.
With less meat available, US grocery stores and consumers are bidding up the price of the available supplies.
Wholesale beef prices have jumped to levels not seen in at least a decade.
As Covid-19 made its way across rural America, it forced meatpackers to close their plants due to employees falling ill.
Supply chain disruptions followed, until large amounts of meat in cold storage can be accessed (sufficient only for two weeks), and bulk products converted into portion sizes for retail.
Meanwhile, Brazil, the world’s No 1 exporter of chicken and beef, saw its first major closure, a poultry plant owned by JBS SA, the world’s biggest meat company.
Meat businesses are also affected in Canada.
Some pig farmers in the US midwest and eastern Canada have started to euthanise pigs because the slaughterhouses are closed — or lose $30 to $50 per pig they manage to sell.
The US Department of Agriculture is setting up advice to help farmers with “depopulation and disposal methods” for animals.
The US, Brazil, and Canada together account for about 65% of the global meat trade.
“During this pandemic, our entire industry is faced with an impossible choice, continue to operate to sustain our nation’s food supply, or shutter in an attempt to entirely insulate our employees from risk,” said the Smithfield Foods meat company.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union said at least 20 workers in US meat and food processing have died, and 5,000 meatpacking workers have either tested positive for the virus or were forced to self-quarantine.
John Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods, in full-page advertisements in three national US newspapers, said: “Millions of animals — chickens, pigs and cattle — will be depopulated because of the closure of our processing facilities. The food supply chain is breaking.”
Meanwhile, the EU beef industry waits for implementation of the €25m Aids to Private Storage (APS) for 25,000 tonnes to be stored for three to five months. This is less than 4% of a single month’s production in the EU, and its usefulness to stabilise the market will be further diluted by the reduced value of frozen cuts, in particular of steak meat, and potential detrimental supply impact on the trade when stored meat returns to the market.
In a statement yesterday, Meat Industry Ireland said the level of APS aid “goes nowhere near” what is required to cover the costs associated with freezing, storage, financing and also the collapsed market value of the cuts.
“Also, all of the cuts from the hindquarter must go into storage. There is no flexibility to sell those cuts that can find an acceptable market price at present and to only store unsaleable cuts.
“A €25m market support measure, even if availed of, for the entire EU beef sector will have negligible impact. It falls well short of the support needed to address the scale of market disruption that has been caused by the loss of the food service sector across the EU. This market channel accounts for over 30% of overall Irish beef exports and 60% of our high value steak sales. The scale of carcase imbalance is unprecedented.
“As long as the food service sector remains shut down across the EU, the carcase imbalance will continue. More significant sector supports will therefore be needed.”
The more positive news for the beef industry, in Ireland at least, is that the co-op marts may be allowed return to a limited marts auction process, while ensuring compliance with all necessary measures against the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
If the initiative proceeds, only buyers and sellers could attend, by appointment, and social distancing would be rigorously adhered to during the process.
The proposals are intended to ensure animal welfare, to maintain the supply chain, to ensure continuity in the national herd and to avoid any glut in the trade of animals while allowing for essential economic activity to take place, said the co-op marts.
There are also some signs of big foodservice users of beef returning, such as Supermac’s which has reopened about a dozen restaurants where social distancing can be safely observed.
Prices paid to Irish beef farmers for cattle were unchanged this week (see report on page 4), not surprising in view of the recent near 40% fall in processing throughput.
Farmers looking to the live export markets for relief have welcomed recent consignments of 2,900 young bulls shipped to Turkey, and finished cattle exported to Algeria. There have also been 5,600 animals exported to Libya to-date this year.
But total live exports so far in 2020, are about 15% lower than for the same period in 2019. There was a significant slowdown in calf shipments, severely disrupted due to Covid-19. All markets reported reduced calf demand."

Tim Cullinan, IFA president.
IFA’s priority in dealing with the challenge of Covid-19 is about safeguarding farms, and safeguarding farming.
I will set out later in this piece what is needed to support farmers through this crisis. Before I do, it’s important to remind ourselves what we have to do to stay safe and mind our health.
The tragedy in Co Clare last week brings farm safety front and centre. We would normally talk about this in advance of the school holidays, but these are not normal times.
With children off school at present and with some older ones helping out on farms, we are seeing the very best of the Irish farm family model at work during this crisis to keep the food supply chain moving.
However, this also increases the need for total vigilance regarding farm safety.
A farm can be a wonderful place for children, where independence and responsibility are fostered. The Irish family farm is at the centre of our food supply chain, the security of which has never been more important.
However, it can also be a dangerous place where the unthinkable can happen in a matter of seconds.
Review safety measures on your farm
Now is a good time to review your farm safety and ask is there a safer way?
Child safety is essential. Talk to you child about safety on the farm.
Ensure minor injuries are avoided at this time. When the health service is challenged, it is particularly important to avoid any injuries on the farm.
High risk time on Irish farms
With children off school due to the coronavirus, this is a high-risk time on Irish farms. Use these points to protect children on the farm and from the coronavirus.
Restricted movements means avoiding contact with other children, this is essential at this time.
Have a safe and secure area for children to play.
Where children are not in a secure play area, a high level of adult supervision must be provided.
Children must not be supervised by their grandparents at this time. People who are 60 years of age and people over 75 are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus.
With increased machinery activity on farms keep children away from dangerous places.
Keep children away from dangerous animals, especially cows with calves.
Do not allow children under 14 to operate tractors or self-propelled machines.
When children have to be carried in the cab, it must be fitted with a properly designed and fitted passenger seat with seat belts. (Sources HSA, IFA)
In terms of protecting themselves, it’s crucially important that farmers take all necessary precautions to reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19. It is important that farmers follow all hygiene and self-isolation protocols and keep up to speed with HSE advice.
For many who are unfortunate enough to contract the virus, it will lead to relatively mild illness, but for some it may be more severe.
For any farmer who is unable to farm, it’s important that someone can step in to assist. IFA has devised a dedicated ‘Plan B’ document, which helps farmers compile the essential information that would be needed where someone else has to step in to run the farm if the farmer contracts Covid-19, or has to go into social isolation.
This document is available on IFA’s dedicated Covid-19 Hub, which contains up-to-date information on topics such as health and safety, banking and tax and social welfare.
Let me return to the impact of the crisis on farming.
The package announced by EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski last week will not be nearly enough to support agriculture, particularly beef farmers, through the current crisis.
I held a meeting via teleconference of European farm leaders with the Commissioner through the European farmers’ umbrella body COPA.
While the Aids to Private Storage (APS) Scheme is an acknowledgement of the problems facing the sector, the funding won’t be sufficient.
The financial crisis for beef finishers as a result of the COVID-19 beef price collapse is so severe that a much more substantial financial package involving market supports and direct payment aid is required.
The food service market has collapsed and this has had a very damaging effect, given the export orientation of our beef production.
I am concerned that the EU Commission appears to be taking agriculture and the food supply chain for granted. Farmers and all those in the chain have been working very hard to keep food on the table, but beef farmers are now in crisis and dairy markets are under severe pressure,
We believe the increased cost of storage, for beef and dairy product, has not been adequately taken into account in the scheme.
We need our Agriculture Minister Michael Creed to push for a significant increase in the Commission allocation. It was important that the Taoiseach raised the need for further EU support at the European Council meeting last week.
The Government must also look at its own resources to help beef farmers. State aid limits have been increased which would allow them to step in and help beef finishers in particular, who are being wiped out financially at current prices.
IFA has put detailed proposals to Minister Creed and the Department of Agriculture to immediately introduce a direct payment aid scheme for beef finishers, utilising unused funds from last year’s BEAM scheme
IFA engages with community to combat Covid-19
In addition to the work we are doing on behalf of our members, IFA has joined forces with other organisations and associations on initiatives that benefit its members and the wider community.
We are a leading member of the Government’s “Community Call” initiative which brings together state and voluntary resources to combat the effects of Covid-19. Each local authority has a dedicated helpline and IFA is part of the official community support network in each local authority.
We worked with FBD to establish a fund for farmers unable to carry out farm work due to COVID-19, a €500 Farm Relief Service voucher will be provided to assist in keeping farms operational during this busy period
Mental Health Ireland, IFA and Teagasc have partnered to co-host and co-deliver information and resources for farmers during the month of April. Entitled ‘Farming Resilience’ the aim is to support farmers and their families through the challenges being posed by COVID-19. The service will look at some practical evidence-based ways to support personal and business resilience.
I have been very impressed with the spirit and solidarity shown by farm families at this time. I would encourage everybody to maintain their efforts to get to us beyond this crisis."

Every time a fisherman dies, it brings families right back to the day they lost their own loved ones to the sea.
Rosaleen Coady was one of those when the Alize sank, taking the lives of Joe Sinnott and Willie Whelan.
Her husband Stephen died almost exactly a year before her son Pat died in the Pere Charles tragedy in 2007, and her father-in-law Paddy died in 1985.
Stephen had also been a close friend of Joe.
“Joe and Willie’s deaths brought a lot back to me,” she said.
“Joe and Stephen were such good friends and they used to go round together years ago.”
Like so many others, she went down to the Hook Head to offer the families help and support as the search continued for Willie’s body.
At one point she saw two women alone together as they looked out to sea.
They were, or so she thinks, Willie Whelan's step-mother Margaret and Willie’s wife Mandy.
“I wouldn't have known them or seen them before but I could tell they had lost someone,” Rosaleen recalled.
“I went up to Mrs Whelan and I introduced myself. I said who I was and I gave her a hug and I said ‘please God, he'll . . .”.
Her voice trails off and she stops talking.
After a pause, she continued: “‘Please God, he’ll be found’, I told them.”
He was eventually found but for those like Rosaleen who have no grave to visit, the closest they have to one is the sea itself.
Like the Whelans and the Sinnotts who had all stared out to sea in the days after the Alize sank, she too faced out there when the Pere Charles sank on January 10, 2007.
Pere Charles: The trawler sank in January 2007. The boat’s crew of five were fishing for herrings south of Hook Head with another trawler. Picture: PA
The boat’s crew of five were fishing for herrings south of Hook Head with another trawler, the Suzanne G.
The Pere Charles had landed two catches, while the other boat had landed one.
They were both heading back about a mile apart to Dunmore East when disaster struck.
At around 6pm, the Suzanna G received a VHF call from Pere Charles’ skipper Thomas Hennessy.
He said: “She has breached on me. Stand by” moments before the boat disappeared from view.
As well as the 30-year-old skipper, crewmen Andrei Dyrin, 32, Pat Coady, 27, Billy O’Connor, 52, and Pat Hennessy, 48, all died.
Although the wreck was located on the seabed two days later, no bodies were ever found.
It is one of the worst fishing tragedies in living memory and happened just hours before, at about 3am on January 11, the Honeydew II, sank with the loss of two lives about three miles South of Ram Head.
Although the wreck of the vessel was discovered on the seabed about a year later, the bodies of 39-year-old owner-skipper Ger Bohan and crew hand Tomasz Jagla, 31, were also never found.
Now when Rosaleen looks out, she imagines her son looking back at her, smiling up at her.
“I smile back at him,” she said.
I see him out there. This is strange for somebody to say but my peaceful place is beside the water.
“I will sit down there for ages just looking out.""
Asked if it was always like that, she replies: “At the beginning, I could hear a melody in the distance.
“There were times when I would paddle out towards the spot. I would walk out too far but at the time I felt I was being drawn into the sea.
“There was another time when I used to go down to the harbour, down to the quay and I would look down at the water and I would have often seen his face.
“He’d be looking up at me, struggling. That is gone now.”
It was while she was in the middle of arranging a mass for the first anniversary of her late husband Stephen’s death that she found out about Pat’s death.
A veteran fisherman, Stephen had been an engineer in one of the UK’s biggest fishing fleets based in Newlyn, Penzance, Cornwall when he was killed in a quay-side accident on Friday, January 13, 2006.
And at the time she got the call about the Pere Charles, her son was - as far as she knew - no longer a fisherman.
Although he had been fishing since he was 16, and had been a skipper, he had effectively quit and not fished for four years.
And when he did quit, he told his mother he didn’t want to miss out on his newborn daughter Toiréasa’s upbringing.
And, other than the birth of his daughter, he had had good reason to quit, having twice before cheated death.
Pat had skippered a boat out of Kilmore Quay that had taken on too much water and he had been forced to send a Mayday.
The boat was about to sink when he and his crew were rescued by the RNLI.
In the second incident, he had slipped overboard while helping bring a haul of fish on board the boat he was on.
After more than 30 minutes of struggling in the sea trying to reach a lifebuoy thrown to him, Patrick was brought on board and then rushed to hospital after the boat landed.
“And what did he do when he was discharged?” Rosaleen asks.“He went back down the next morning and went out to sea.”

However, he eventually quit and he got a job driving a digger but work dried up and he asked a skipper he knew to let him know if there was any work available.
He was called the next day and off her went, aboard the Pere Charles.
Of the moment her phone rang, she recalled: “I got a phone call. 'What's wrong', I asked. Has it happened again?
“I asked ‘It’s happened again, hasn't it'?
“(The caller) said ‘I am sorry, Rose. It’s Patrick.
“And I said ‘No, it can’t be Patrick’.
“And he said ‘No, I'm really sorry. He got offered a trip out on the Pere Charles and he went’.”
When asked how she felt when she got that call, she pauses.
There is a brief silence, during which there is a sharp intake of breath and then she sobs quietly as if she has just taken that call all over again.
“I felt empty,” she begins.
“I felt drained. I felt numb, for days. I had to stay in England for a few days before I got home because I literally couldn't move.
“I couldn't do anything. I said to myself ‘come on Rose, you have gone through this twice before, come on, you can do this’, but I couldn't.” \A philosophical woman, her life has taught her the importance of just taking life as it comes and making the most of it.
Hold your loved ones as tight as you can and no bickering, and no squabbling and all the things that families do,
“When they're gone, they’re gone, and there's no way you're going to get them back”, she says
And for those finding physical distancing hard, she has this to say: “I have lost my son, my husband and my father in law.
“I’m going to be physically distant from them forever. But after all this is over and done with, people will be able to hold their loved ones again.
“So until the restrictions are lifted, just deal with it and get on with it - because it will all end.”
It is very difficult. You don’t really cope’

Caitlin Uí Aodh barely remembers what exactly happened in the 26 days it took to retrieve the bodies of those who died in the Tit Bonhomme tragedy.
She remembers being in a daze, and looking back, she still doesn’t know how she managed to cope.
Her husband Michael Hayes, the boat’s skipper and owner, was one of five to perish.
The boat left Union Hall, Co. Cork on Friday, January 13, 2012 with a crew of six to go fishing.
But after experiencing technical difficulties during the trip, it returned to Union Hall in the early hours of January 25..
The sea was very rough at the time and the boat broke up after getting stranded on Adam’s Island on the way into Glandore Harbour. As well as her husband, crew members Kevin Kershaw, Wael Mohamed, Attaia Shaban and Saied Ali Eldin also perished.
Although the Marine Casualty Investigation Board investigation into the tragedy suggested crew fatigue played a part, evidence at the May 2013 inquest from the sole survivor disputed this.
Abdelbaky Mohamed, whose brother died in the tragedy, said there was no particular pattern to their work aboard the 21-metre boat.
But he said: “When there was fish, we worked, when there wasn’t, we had time to rest.”
Caitlin is still very active in the fishing industry despite the painful memories it holds.
She owns a trawler, The Dearbhla and has turned the Iasc Seafood Bar in Dungarvan she opened just days before Covid-19 restrictions were suddenly announced into a takeaway.
It’s so popular that people are prepared to wait up to an hour for their order to be ready.
Fishing has been in her family for as long as she can remember. Her grandfather fished, as did her father and her brothers and cousins.
But while she knows only too well how hard the work is, it’s something she feels many forget when they buy fresh.
“It is a long shift and it's a lot of hard work,” she said.
“It is a huge amount of hard work. I remember being in a shop recently to buy some fish because my own boat was at sea. There was a woman there looking to buy some fish and when she was told the price, she exclaimed ‘My God, that’s expensive’.
“I turned to her and told her that if she was at sea for 10 days in the cold and the wet, she wouldn't think that was expensive.
“I wonder how many times people give a second thought to how much work goes into producing that carton of milk, that tub of yoghurt, that bit of beef or bit of fish.
Maybe we need to think more, understand more and ask more and become a little bit more in tune with what life is about.
“A lot of people probably wouldn’t even know that the Irish fishing industry goes to sea, that there are young lads out there all year round, fishing.”
She is one of the many people in the community who know what it is like to lose a loved one to the sea.
And it is this experience she has brought to her role as chairperson of the charity, Lost At Sea Tragedies.
Founded by retired Dunmore East fisherman Noel McDonagh, it was set up to help families emotionally and financially in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy.
The charity was also set up in 2013 to promote safety at sea and raising awareness in the fishing community.
On coping with a fishing tragedy, she said: “It is very difficult. You don't really cope.
“There was a drawn out process involved in our case.
“We were very very very lucky because a huge amount of support from the local people from fishermen all over the coast. We got support from people locally in Union Hall.”
She said she was in a ""frozen state"" during the 26 days it took to retrieve everybody.

“It is very hard to explain what goes through your mind. I don't think anything goes through your mind.
“I think you go into survival mode. You are in a sort of frozen state and you remain like that.
“It is a coping thing. When shock hits you, you go into that shock and you remain in that shock, for a long, long time afterwards, in that place that you go to. It helps you, it surrounds you and it helps you cope.
“You don't feel and you don't hear the same as normal people. It is just a coping thing.
“It is something you look back on. I look back on it now and think how did I do that?
“How did we as a family actually do that for so long over so many days, for so many nights. You don't do it until you're there and then you just get on with it.”
She said even though a long time has passed, it still feels like yesterday.
“You can still find yourself back there especially if you hear of something or somebody else or another accident and myself and the kids get drawn back to it.”
She knows the tragedies change the people they leave behind, and her own tragedy changed her.
You wake up and realise life is just very, very precious. And that this is something you need to appreciate, no matter what is happening around you.
“You only have one chance at life. Being here wasn't something you asked to happen and when you go, you won't pick that date.
“It'll just come when it is time to go. So I feel no matter how bad things are, I really do appreciate every day.
“It is part of what I am now. I look at life as very, very precious and everything we do and learn is important.”
Joe and his son chatted by phone. An hour later, the Alize was gone

Despite nearly drowning when he was 16, Willie Whelan had a lifelong love of the sea.
And as well as being ‘fearless’, his heartbroken father Joe also remembers an upbeat, jovial man who lived every day as it came and who didn't worry about anything.
The son he remembers is the 41-year-old fisherman who was one of two to die when the Alize trawler sank off Hook Head, Co Wexford on the night of January 4.
Also to die was Joe Sinnott, the 65-year-old father-of-four who had trained Willie and was like a father to him.
They had been fishing for scallops along with two other trawlers in the same area.
To this day, nobody knows why the 12-metre boat, which had been completely rebuilt five years ago at a cost of around €500,000 and was in ‘pristine’ condition, sank.
Some believe it was hit by a freak wave.
Others - like Joe Whelan - believe nobody will ever know what happened to the boat, which had been due back into nearby Duncannon Harbour to unload its catch around 11.30pm.
The tragedy is the latest in a long line of harrowing reminders about the perils of being a fisherman in an industry some fear is slowly dying out.
With more and more fishing families quitting the industry as the national fleet has deteriorated over the past ten years or so, it had become much harder to earn a living from it before Covid-19 came along.
But since then, it has become almost impossible for many fishermen to survive.
The price of fish has plummeted as European markets for fish have collapsed with the closure of restaurants all over Europe.
Such is the impact of Covid-19 on the industry and the rest of the country that it is sometimes easy to forget the lives lost while getting fish from the sea to the supermarket.
All around the coast, there are areas associated with more than 50 fishing tragedies in recent decades.
But the area between Hook Head and the Saltees Islands is as notorious as any of them - so much so that part of this small stretch of Co Wexford coastline is known as the Graveyard of a Thousand Ships.
At least 18 souls have perished in the past 18 years alone, but the record of wrecks goes back to the 1600s.
Few ever see the light of day again, and as the Alize now too lies in its place in the dark surrounded by the debris that spilled out from during its nighttime descent to the sea bed, few ever want to see her again.
Meanwhile, back on dry land, both men are sorely missed by their grieving families and friends.
“We are struggling at the moment, with losing a son,” Mr Whelan said.
""Every time you get out of bed, you are thinking about him. I just can't get it out of my mind at the moment.
Everybody is very depressed and we are finding it very hard to keep going every day. We miss him. We miss him a lot.
He says his son knew nothing else other than fishing and he had had a lot of experience.
Mr Whelan thinks the pair had 65 years experience between the two of them.
“Joe was a gentleman,” Mr Whelan said.
“He'd been fishing with Willie on the boat for about four years and they had fished together for about six years on another vessel. They were like father and son.”
January’s tragedy was not the first time Willie had been in an accident.
He was just 16 when he was forced to abandon ship on a trawler and had to be rescued from his life raft by a UK coast guard helicopter.
“It was frightening at the time,” Mr Whelan recalled. “He was two hours on a life raft.
“But a week later, he went straight back fishing. He had no fear on him. He loved the water and that was it.”
He last spoke to his son at 8.45pm on the night he died.
Mr Whelan had missed a call from him while he was at mass and he returned it when he left the church.
“He was in great form,” he recalled.
“I remember joking with him about him not realising I would be at mass when he called. We had a great conversation about how good the fishing was.
“There was no hint of anything wrong.”
While on a drive around the coast line with a friend of his that night, Mr Whelan rang his son again at 9.45pm but there was no reply.
He didn’t think anything of it.
From the Hook Peninsula where he had made that call, Mr Whelan could see three sets of lights of three trawlers in the distance.
Around the time he was leaving “the Hook” to go home, his other boat - the 24-metre Willie Joe was on her way back inland and would pass by the Alize fishing at around 10pm.
“Everything was normal,” Mr Whelan said.
“The Willie Joe was passing by the Alize and they were going to unload first and then the Alize was going to follow.
“The weather wasn't flat calm but it was reasonable and there was nothing to get excited about.”
Mr Whelan arrived home at around 10.15pm but just 20 minutes later, he was called by the Irish Coast Guard.
Maggie and Joe remember their son Willie as a jovial, positive man, and Joe says the whole family is struggling with his loss.
“They said the Alize was in trouble,” he recalled.
He called a friend of his who lives about 4km from the Hook Head lighthouse and asked him to quickly drive down and see how many lights were out at sea.
As he did, he was hoping against hope that there would be the three lights of the three trawlers he had seen just 45 minutes earlier.
“He drove out to see if the lights were there,” he said.
“I was on the way to The Hook myself when he rang me back and he said ‘I am sorry Joe, there are only two lights out there’.
“In the space of 40 or so minutes, the boat’s lights were gone.”
About an hour after the boat’s Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) was activated, the Irish Coast Guard helicopter based at Waterford took off to go to the Alize’s help.
The reason for the length of time it took before taking off is that Irish Coast Guard helicopters are on a 45-minute notice to respond every evening from 9pm.
As it approached the area where the boat went down, the first light the crew of the R117 saw in the dark from their cockpit was from the EPIRB.
And then they spotted Joe Sinnott from the light on his lifejacket.
He was winched out of the water but pronounced dead at around 2.30am on Sunday morning.
He is believed to have died of hyperthermia.
It would take a further 20 days for Willie to be found.
“Waiting those 20 days to find him was torture,” Mr Whelan said.
“Two of his brothers were out searching for him in the sea and another one was going along the coastline with hundreds of people.
“Everybody was so good to us, you couldn't thank people enough.”
To this day, he has no idea what happened.
“The boat was 120%,” Mr Whelan said.
“She was absolutely fantastic. Everything was up to scratch. If anything broke down, he would replace it straight away.
The boat is still at the bottom of the sea, she is not in anybody's way and we don't really want to see her anymore either.
“I would like to know what happened but we never will know, I don't think.”
About a week after he was buried, his brothers returned to the sea.
“You have to go back,” Mr Whelan said.
“We have to carry on - for the bank, and to make a living.”
Of that living, he says he and his sons were doing well before Covid-19.
“The weather was bad for a long time,” he said.
“That was the only thing that I could see wrong with fishing before Covid-19 but despite that, we were making a living and paying our way.
“Covid-19 has struck us badly and we will get through it all right.
“But it is going to be a struggle for a while.”
Echoing widespread dissatisfaction with the government among the fishing community, he said not enough is being done.
We are an industry that is left behind all the time. If you take the farmers, they only have to whistle and they will have a subsidy.
“I don’t mean any disrespect to the farmers because they are right when they can get it.”
Of the son he fondly remembers but misses deeply, he recalls him as “always a jolly man” who would never worry about anything.
“He wasn't a worrier,” he said.
He took every day as it came.
“If there was a bad week’s fishing, he would always be the one to say that next week would be better.
“He always had a positive outlook.”
Among his happiest memories of his son was his marriage a year ago to Mandy.
“He was so happy getting married, but he was always a jolly fella and we always have good memories of William.
“He was never a fella to be in bad humour. He was always very obliging. You wouldn't have to ask him a second time to do a thing, he was that type of fella.
“It is always the good ones that go, isn't it?”
‘It just goes to show, you can never depend on the sea’
Fisherman Jimmy Devlin - one of the few still fishing at the moment.
One of Jimmy Devlin’s claims to fame is finding a human skull in his nets.
But nowadays, the Wexford fisherman - who “caught” the skull when skippering the Willie B in April 2010 - would happily settle for a less headline-grabbing catch any day.
Speaking over his satellite phone while out fishing recently, he was despairing at catching enough to make the fishing trip he was on worth his while.
The interview with the veteran skipper was a brief snapshot of what the industry is like for many of the few fishermen still fishing at the moment.
“It is a pretty nerve-wracking time right now,” Jimmy, whose uncle Joe Sinnott died when the trawler Alize sank in January, told the Irish Examiner.
“The vessel I am running is burning 2,000 litres of fuel a day and this trip is going to be a total waste.
“The weather is not fine enough for us to go out to the deepwater and there is no guarantee of what you are going to get even if you get out there.
“We have had a lot of north-east winds which are killing the fishing.”
At the time of the interview, he was despairing at only catching two half boxes of fish as he fished about 40 nautical miles south-east off Kilmore Quay.
“That’s not good,” the 53-year-old said.
I need at least four boxes of fish every three hours at the best of times and at the best of prices to keep the vessel going and for everybody on board to make a wage.
As things stood at the time, neither he or any of his crew stood to make any money at all after food, other expenses like insurance and fuel were paid for.
In a number of cases recently, the most a crew ended up taking home was a fish supper.
And whatever other crews eventually make, they won’t know for around two weeks how much they will get.
This is because for most fishermen, they have to wait until all a boat’s costs are covered and the fish they caught sold before they get paid.
Away from the mechanics of trying to earn a living is the heartache the Wexford/Waterford fishing community still feel over the Alize sinking in January.
Few are untouched by the tragedy.
“I was only working 30 miles away when the Mayday call went out that night,” Jimmy recalls. Joe was a real lover of the sea.
“It's like a drug for the person who has got the feel of the sea.
It is devastating. We all had a great belief that night that Joe and Willie would have been found because it was like their religion that they wore their lifejackets.
“There are both well-seasoned men, they had fished all their lives, they were well seasoned. And that vessel was top-class. Inside there wouldn't even be a bit of dust.
“You couldn't believe the condition of that boat and that's why we just don't understand what happened.
“It will go down as a mystery.”
He added: “It just goes to show you can never depend on the sea, you can never trust water.
""You can never trust it.”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30997820.html,2020-05-05 21:00:00,Economics 101 for farmers - Most farmers pay little heed to market prices,"What are the long term implications for farming arising from the Covid-19 pandemic?
Will beef prices remain flat indefinitely, will milk prices hold up, and are their opportunities for farmers to diversify?
Predicting the future is a guessing game, but if you can analyse the trends, and predict consumer behaviour, you’re a step ahead of the competition.
It may come as a shock to you, but the vast majority of farmers pay little heed to market prices. Most farmers carry on their normal farming business as best they can, and take whatever price they are given; after all, prices remain largely outside of their control.
But farmers should be aware that the collective supply of their product is what dictates the price they get.
Basic economics tells us that a collective reduction in supply on a global level will result in an increase in prices, for a constant level of demand.
So, for farmers, the answer to poor beef or dairy prices is to reduce production. This has to be done on a global level, or displacement occurs, with production shifting to economically more efficient regions.
Economic signals we are given from the market are sometimes misinterpreted, and often flatly ignored.
In fact, the economic signals we are given can sometimes lead us to do the opposite to what we should be doing. For instance, dairy farmers facing poor milk prices will often try to expand their milk production, making up for reduced margin per litre by increasing the litres produced.
This rush to recover profits by producing additional milk only compounds the price problem.
Thankfully, as a nation of (predominantly) low cost milk producers, we can play that game and win because, ultimately, other producers in different areas of the world cannot afford to expand milk production profitably.
The signals we have been getting from the beef industry over the past three or four years are clear and unambiguous. There is virtually no profit to be made from beef enterprises at the prices being paid, except by the very best farmers, on the very best land.
The average suckler to beef farmer made €30 per hectare excluding premia in 2018, with the average suckler to weanling farmer losing €62 per hectare. Calf to beef farmers fared somewhat better, at €142 profit per hectare excluding premia.
These figures are against a backdrop of average beef prices of €3.81 per kg for 2018, compared to current prices of only around €3.40 per kg plus bonuses for R3s.
As farmers, we trundle on from one year to the next, for most of us there is relatively minor change in the way we operate. But the prospects of cheap competition and subdued demand are a harsh reality that we must bear, given the upheaval in markets over the past few months.
Defining this reality will help us prepare for it.
Over the long-term, market returns will recover. Nothing fixes low prices better than low prices. In other words, low market returns will over time cause a drop in production, whether through attrition or changing enterprises. Farm economics is after all a cyclical affair.
Meanwhile, positive demand for animal proteins from milk and beef, due to African Swine Fever affecting the pig industry, has progressed into India. The pig population in India is estimated to be over 10 million, one of the top 10 in the world.
Closer to home, bird flu is affecting egg supply, which is another important animal protein source.
On the animal feed side, the fall in oil prices and in demand for fuel will naturally lead to a diversion of maize corn from ethanol production. Ethanol is frequently blended with fuel, as part of renewable and green credential commitments.
A by-product of ethanol production is distillers grains, a high protein cattle feed.
As ethanol production dries up, availability of distillers grains as a protein based feed option has evaporated.
Diversion of maize direct to feed production rather than for ethanol has led to a fall in US maize prices, from over $180 per ton in August 2019 to as low as $122 last week.
Soyabean meal prices spiked at the end of March, as demand for alternative proteins to distillers lifted. Prices had been trading around $320 as recently as February, and shot up to $370 before falling now to about $310.
These low grain prices are generally not good for Irish farmers, as cheap grain translates into low costs for US and South American feedlot type beef and dairy producers.
In the meantime, each of us must assess our own farm financial position, and determine what actions we need to take in the short and long term.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-30998051.html,2020-05-06 20:00:00,More and more farmers fleeing beef production,"It’s May and the supply of finished beef animals has tightened, as is the norm for the season.
But what is not the norm is that prices have not yet increased, even by a cent.
With the shorter May Day bank holiday working week, the intake of stock this week would be expected to fall further.
However, with most processing plants operating at less than the full working week on a regular basis currently, the impact of the bank holiday will be negligible.
The intake held steady last week at 25,964 head, slightly higher than the previous week, but back by 5,600 head on the same week in 2019.
There were 9,923 steers, only slightly down on 2019, while heifers at 8,193 head were back by 1,500 on last year, and cows at 4,278 head were back by one third on 2019.
The supply of young bulls continued to trail the 2019 level, at 2,480 head compared to 3,884 head in the same week last year.
There is no difference in price for stock which had been bought forward from last week, and the going rate for this week.
The base for both steers and heifers has become firmly set at 340c/kg.
The word on the ground is that there is nothing to be got by way of a top-up on that for steers, with hard sellers coming up against a stone wall defence in most cases.
Some finishers are finding it a shade easier to get a few cents/kg extra for top quality heifers, but a base of 345c/kg is being achieved only by a few.
The processors‘ defence is that markets are weak.
That is not much consolation for finishers measuring their losses, which again has dented any confidence which remains within the depleted beef production sector, from which more and more are fleeing.
It is very hard to blame them for becoming despondent about a future in beef.
The intake of young bulls has been running at around half of last year’s level, and the prices on offer trail steer prices by 5c-10c/kg. The base for R-grade is 330c-335c/kg.
There are reports that processors are willing to give some latitude on price penalties for over-weight.
There has been slight hardening of cow prices, with the best of the R-grade cows hitting 290c-295c/kg for this week, and a few exceptions of finishers reporting up to 300c/kg secured for R-grade cows.
Prices for O-grade cows are in the ranging 260c-275c/kg range, while better quality P-grade cows are making up to 260c/kg, and prices range back to around 250c/kg."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30998135.html,2020-05-07 11:05:00,Study finds farmers could suffer €1bn hit from Covid-19,"Research released by the Irish Farmers Journal today reveals that Ireland's farming industry could lose up to two-thirds of its annual income because of Covid-19.
The study, carried out by UCD Professor of Agriculture and Food Economics, Michael Wallace, at the end of April shows that the pandemic will deliver the biggest ever income hit on the sector.
It finds that beef prices to farmers have already fallen by up to 17%, while dairy commodity prices have fallen by as much as 21% since Europe went into lockdown.
Under Professor Wallace’s moderate forecast, in which prices would remain similar to current levels, the average 78-cow dairy farmer would lose €24,000, or 37% of their income for the year.
An average 23-cow suckler farmer would lose €2,300 or 26% of their income, while beef finishers would lose €3,000 each, or 19% of their annual income.
The study examined the long-term disruption to hotels, cafes and restaurants of the virus and its impact on consumer sentiment, and found that the farming industry could take a €1bn hit.
CSO figures show aggregated farm incomes range from €1-€1.5bn a year, excluding subsidies.
Even in a scenario where prices stabilise at current levels, the impact on farm incomes in 2020 is forecast to be close to €600m, with income from dairying falling €320m and from beef production by €250m. In a severe case, dairy farming could take a €560m hit, while beef could be hit by €430m.
The danger for farmers is that the recovery from the coronavirus lockdown will be slow and lingering. Such a scenario would see the impact on farm incomes rise to €1bn, the study finds."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30998365.html,2020-05-08 10:48:00,Independent TD: Farmers under severe pressure with Covid-19 and livestock prices,"Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice says farmers are under severe pressure at the moment.
He says: ""With the price of livestock at the moment, beef especially and sheep, which most of these people that get farm assist come from, it is very difficult for them at the moment.
""In my own opinion, the Covid payment was badly handled by Government where farmers don't appear to be classed as the same as everybody else.""
Low-income farmers received nearly €69m under the social-welfare scheme Farm Assist last year.
Nearly 6,000 people received the payment, which is capped at €203 a week.
More than 1,000 were in Donegal, and there were also high numbers in Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Cork and Monaghan.

The National Ploughing Association (NPA) confirmed the cancellation of Europe's largest outdoor event but said it still hoped that there would be an opportunity to run ploughing competitions behind closed doors.
Almost 300,000 people and some 1,700 exhibitors attended last year's event in Ballintrane in Carlow which was also set to host this year's event.
NPA managing director Anna May McHugh said it was ""a tough day"" but that the ""writing was on the wall"" given the large number of people that attend the event annually.
We had an executive meeting yesterday (Thursday) afternoon and everybody's conclusion was the same that in the interest of public health and safety, it just wasn't an option. We were in touch with the Department of Agriculture and received all the various documentation that was available to us and the writing was on the wall really for us.
""When you think of the Leaving Cert in question and the GAA in question and all of those things, the Association could never live with the risk that if we had brought a second wave of the disease into Carlow, into the region, or spread it around the country. That's not something we want to be responsible for,"" she told RTÉ's Seán O'Rourke.
Ms McHugh said the economic impact of losing the event was in the region of €45m to €50m but stressed that this was a bigger issue than finances.
""The Ploughing is 90 years old next year and we are about the people. We have always been about the public, about the people that exhibit and take part. It's a tough day on our exhibitors because the economic impact of one ploughing event is in the region of €45 to €50m so that's huge.""
""We are having to write to exhibitors this morning that we are just hoping to get an opportunity to sell their wares this year. That's heart wrenching,"" she said.
Ploughing Championship cancelled due to Covid-19
This year's National Ploughing Championship has been cancelled.
Europe's biggest outdoor event was due to take place in County Carlow from September 15 to 17 but it has been called off due to Covid-19.
Organisers say that they still hope that there will be an opportunity to run the ploughing competitions behind closed gates.
The loss to the economy is reported to be around €45m.
Yesterday organisers met to consider whether the event could go ahead within social distancing constraints.
Almost 300,000 people attended last year's event.
Meanwhile, Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice says farmers are under severe pressure.
He says: ""With the price of livestock at the moment, beef especially and sheep, which most of these people that get farm assist come from, it is very difficult for them at the moment."""

The IFA says up to 60,000 farmers will benefit.
It comes as the EU's agriculture ministers meet by videolink later to further discuss supports for the sector.
IFA president Tim Cullinan says while farmers still need more help, there are some signs a recovery is on the way.
""Hopefully what this will do is bring confidence back into the beef sector again,"" said Mr Cullinan.
""So already we are seeing some green shoots across Europe since the end of the lockdown across Europe.
""Some of the food services are starting to open back up again which is reflected in the price of beef here already.
""Obviously we want to see more of that.""
Mr Cullinan while there are signs a recovery is on the way, additional support is needed.
""We are looking for a compensation package for beef farmers, a direct payment of up to €100 per animal that was slaughtered since the onset of Covid.
""We are negotiating a package for farmers with the minister at the moment because it has been a very difficult winter for those particular farmers."""

Unfortunately, the next ship that was supposed to be sailing for Algeria with finished bulls tomorrow has been cancelled.
Why has this been allowed to happen? Who was asleep at the wheel? With marts forced to sell online, or not at all, the system is in turmoil right now.
Hopefully as restrictions ease then the mart trade can get back to some level of normality ASAP.
As we approach the middle of May, all stock have sufficient grass and grazing conditions are excellent. In general, grass quality is very good, however heading dates are upon us and grass sward management is much more difficult as a result.
The mix of heat and showers over the last three weeks has really driven on growth and a surplus now exists on most beef farms.
I would highly recommend that at this time of year, you should walk your farm twice per week to assess grass supply and to help make grassland management decisions sooner rather than later.
From talking to clients around the country, it is apparent that there is a significant moisture deficit and rain is badly needed to maintain growth.
The cold and harsh days and nights since last Sunday have slowed growth significantly, but the forecast beyond this weekend looks warm but with little or no rain.
Many are overestimating the volume of grass in paddocks at present as Dry Matters are lower than in recent weeks. I have recorded dry matters of 13% to 15% on grazing swards in the last week at home.
When finishing advanced stock and in order to keep costs down that lower covers are being grazed at all times. Covers below 1500Kg DM/ha are highest in digestibility, energy and sugars meaning optimum intakes and performance can be achieved.
In order for grass to supply top quality feed it must also be kept up to date with the required amount of fertiliser.
Are swards good enough, or do they need reseeding? Pure swards are obvious when growth is good.
Increased supply
As was the case last year, there are suggestions that there will be a significant number of extra finished cattle going for slaughter off grass once we get to October and November. Perhaps heavier cattle should be pushed earlier to avoid this increased supply in the backend. Don’t try to push cattle though unless they have been fully grown first.
Top quality grass will be capable of giving 0.75 to 1 kg live weight gain per day on finishing cattle, depending on animal breed and sex, whereas the target gain for beef type continental stock should be of at least 1 kg for heifers and 1.2 to 1.3 plus for steers, per day. A good response can be achieved from finishing cattle at grass by supplementing with just 2 kg meal per day.
This is provided that excellent quality grass is available at all times. However, if top quality grass is not available, it will be necessary to feed higher levels to heavy heifers or steers that are close to finish. The volume of meal needed will also depend on the breed and sex of the animals being fed.
At this time of the year finishing cattle off grass quickly has many advantages, in terms of stocking rate, profitability and work load. All of this must stack up economically.
Do the maths on your stock and their potential performance versus kill out percentage and price available. An extra 0.4kg over the next 90 days for example would mean an extra 22-23kg of carcase on a continental steer. That would be worth approx. €75-95 per head depending on price, grade and bonus payments. 2kg per head over 90 days would cost approx. €45-€50.
Slightly better margin, animals slaughtered earlier allowing you to be compliant with nitrate regulations easier and or allow you to re stock earlier.
Any concentrates to be fed on grass to heavy cattle will need to be high in energy and low in protein in order to get the final cover of fat on stock quickly.
Include native barley and oats as this will achieve target fat cover quickly. Avoid feeding fillers in any mixes as they are of no advantage in a good finishing diet.
The inclusion of a digestible fibre such as hulls or beet pulp may be advantageous depending on the volume of meal being fed on grass. Always include a good quality beef mineral all the way to slaughter through, feed, licks or in water.
The beef trade continues to be extremely difficult. Unfortunately, the next ship that was supposed to be sailing for Algeria with finished bulls tomorrow has been cancelled."

The world’s disarray brings into view the disharmony of the meat industry.
The huge numbers of animals bred for beef are compounding the damage we are doing to our environment at an unsustainable rate, while contributory carbon emissions are leading to global warming and rising seas.
The mass killing of defenceless animals is barbarity. How can anyone look them in their eyes and not begin to question why? The pain and torture inflicted on these docile animals is termed humane, but it is slaughter. They are killed so we can make cottage pies, steaks, sausages, and hot dogs. Even the entrails and tongues are eaten. What do the slaughterhouses do with the cows’ sad eyes?
People’s colons are but graveyards for decaying animal parts.
We’re told to eat dairy because it will make us grow up big and strong, but perhaps the hormones pumped into the animals are making us sick. Surely, people realise how quickly a calf grows over the typically six months it is milk-fed? This might explain human conditions such as acne, rosacea, spots, and blood clots, cardiac arrest, lumps in the breast, and all the rest.
How can we be so numb to the pain of another living being? A cow is not a beef wellington — it’s a brother, a sister, a mother; a fellow Earth dweller. I wish I’d stopped eating meat much sooner. Eating healthy veggie burgers, soya, or Quorn won’t leave a mother forlorn.
God created all the animals, just as he did you and me. He gave us senses to live harmoniously beneath his big blue sky: To smell, to touch, to see, to be. All sentient beings have a right to live freely. Cows show love and understanding, they make bonds and connect, they communicate (but people are oblivious to it). They can recollect and show intellect, feel pain and fear. They give us so much that they should be revered. Sadly, the opposite is often the case. What’s worse is there is absolutely no need for us to slaughter them and we have absolutely no right to take their precious lives.
So, please try to live cruelty-free and help curtail the rising seas. Lower your cholesterol! Try vegan or vegetarian; it really doesn’t matter if you’re an octogenarian. Work out: You’ll be amazed at how good it feels. You may even start to feel a deep compassion that’ll never go out of fashion. Live kindly. Be nice. Protect biodiversity and our environment. Protect what’s right.
Nothing on this planet is more violent than the meat industry, but, ultimately, the killing comes down to your food choices.
Be a voice for the voiceless animals.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-31000400.html,2020-05-19 16:00:00,Financial advice for farmers: Irish land price follows the economy,"The annual SCSI/Teagasc Land Market Review and Outlook 2020 was published recently, providing an in-depth analysis of key agricultural farmland market trends in 2019, and a predicted outlook for 2020.
The review has insights on agricultural land values and rents, and views on anticipated agricultural land market activity in 2020.
It is compiled by members of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland who are auctioneers, valuers and chartered surveyors operating in the land sales and rental market.
Their findings suggest a fall in agricultural land prices across the country of about 6% on a national basis, from an average of €9,346 per acre in 2018 to €8,823 per acre in 2019.
Within the regions, the variance in land prices was more pronounced in Munster, with a 9% drop in prices from €10,622 in 2018 to €9,719 in 2019, whereas the Connaught-Ulster region experienced only a modest price fall, of 1%.
The Review and Outlook, which also has contributions from Teagasc, highlighted that the output prices for several important agricultural commodities declined significantly.
On an annualised basis, the output prices for milk dropped more than 5.6%, beef and lamb prices were also lower in 2019 relative to 2018, finished cattle prices declined by approximately 6% relative to 2018.
In 2019, cereal prices were much lower at harvest time relative to harvest 2018, down by between 25% and 30% for barley and wheat.
It’s clear that the 2019 fall in agricultural commodity prices was correlated with the fall in agricultural land prices. The report highlights that Covid-19 is a new, negative shock to the economy which is likely to reduce profit margins in all farm enterprises.
When this report was published, it was too early to assess the extent of that Covid-19 profit margins reduction in any detail.
However, the SCSI/Teagasc report underlined that the impact on food production, and agriculture by association, should be a lot less than other sectors.
It remains to be seen if lower farming profits will continue for the remainder of 2020, or whether prices might edge up as economies restart.
The report includes a long-term land price and land rental series compiled by Smith Harrington, a firm of chartered surveyors and estate agents founded in Meath in 1870.
This record of 1,286 land sales and 54,406 rentals which occurred primarily in Meath and surrounding counties shows that, over the last 50 years, the price of an acre varied from €290 in 1970 to over €20,000 in 2007, at the height of the Celtic Tiger, before falling to between €9,000 and €10,000 in recent years.
The rental price rose from about €40 per acre in 1970 to over €200 in 1979, and then plateaued at €100-150 in the ’80s and ’90s until it rose to €170-190 from 2012 onwards.
Looking at a graph of these Irish land price trends, it is easy to see the price pretty much followed the trajectory of the economy.
As the economy boomed, following accession to the European Economic Community in the 1970s, agricultural prices increased at an exponential rate.
Land prices fell dramatically in the early 1980s, following the oil crisis and a hike in loan interest rates.
Land prices pretty much plateaued for the next decade or so, into the mid 1990s.
In the 15 years or so from the mid-1990s to 2008 (the Celtic Tiger era), land prices increased significantly, fuelled by falling interest rates, availability of credit, and demand for land from those who sold for development.
Then, land prices dropped sharply again, before plateauing in the last 10 years.
The big question now for both buyers and sellers of land is what will happen to land prices in the coming years.
On the supply side, there is an expectation that much more land will become available in the next decade or so, given that approximately one third of Irish farmers are aged over 66.
Economic modelling suggests that a large increase in supply should result in reduced land prices.
However, it is also important to examine the demand side of the equation.
In the 50-year Smith Harrington trend, the demand side for agricultural land is correlated to the economic health of both the overall economy, and the economic wellbeing of farmers themselves (which deteriorated in 2019).
Currently, reduced farm productivity, which negatively affects profits per hectare, and the loan repayment capacity of commercial farming in turn, is likely, due to additional regulations and restrictions on output, mostly linked to climate mitigation.
This is likely to be the case especially for dairy farmers who are currently availing of the nitrates derogation.
On the flip side, such farmers may be more anxious than ever to scale up in order to maintain their current production levels — therefore adding to demand for land.
But such demand for land is more quickly translated into a demand for rented land that for purchased land, which explains why land rental prices have steadily increased over recent years.
Apart from the impact from climate mitigation, it is now more than probable that the UK will leave the Customs Union at the end of 2020, which might cause severe disruption, and might reduce the market returns available to Irish farmers, especially for beef, if tariffs are imposed in the absence of a trade agreement.
Indeed, 63% of respondents for the SCSI/Teagasc report believed that Brexit was deterring sellers from selling in 2019, and 73% believed Brexit was deterring buyers from buying.
Meanwhile, Covid19 will be negative shock for financial institutions as a result of a default in some business loans arising from the pandemic, which is likely to feed in to a reduced appetite for lending.
The overall consensus points to lower land prices in 2020, mostly due to reduced profitability for farmers."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-31000637.html,2020-05-20 12:45:00,Why are you now free to buy a telly and not a bullock?,"Last Monday saw an easing of Covid-19 restrictions, much to the delight of all.
You can now go about easily replacing that broken washing machine.
The worn out dishwasher too can get the road, a replacement can be purchased without fear or trepidation.
Or buy a 55-inch TV from any one of a million electrical retailers, all open and happy to let you wander in and browse for the TV of your dreams. Happy days.
Alas, you still cannot walk into your local cattle mart with cheque book in hand to purchase a bullock.
The powers that be forbid such a simple action.
In order of necessity, it seems a new telly takes precedence over our livestock industry.
Why are you now free to buy a telly and not a bullock?
Why are our marts not allowed to open under the strict health guidelines that are in place?
Why is so little being done to support and reopen our marts?
Yes, we have online auctions, but an online auction only caters for the IT (information technology) brigade, the younger crowd who make up about 1% of those who go to the mart.
The online mart does not cater for farmers like you and me, who grew up in marts listening to auctioneers like Jack McGraw.
An online sale is not even close to the real thing.
A bit like online dating, the online mart could bamboozle you with flashing lights, mesmerise you with its myriad of fancy numbers.
In the finish, leaving a fellow feeling out of touch, dejected and all alone.
I need an online mart about as much as I need a broomstick, or a prod of an 8-inch needle.
To be fair to our marts, they are doing Trojan work in providing farmers with online and tender services, to sell and buy cattle.
But they shouldn’t have to do this.
As an agri-business, they are entitled to much more.
It’s clearly now a world of massive TVs for the multitude, and narrow minds when it comes to the beef farmer. And so to the marts we go, beginning with Monday’s online auction sale of cattle at Kilmallock.
In the last week, the mart has sold over 1,000 cattle online, to 178 buyers.
Prices were up at all sales, indeed they were “on fire” according to Denis Kirby of GVM, with up to €3.27 per kg paid for cattle.
At Kilmallock’s Monday sale for bullocks, top stock made up to €2.47 per kg.
On Wednesday, dry cows sold to €1,330 a head or €2 per kg.
Heifers hit €2.58 per kg on the same day.
On Friday last, up to 500 calves were sold at the mart. Denis reported that calves “were in huge demand, with up to €470 paid for strong calves, and young ones making up to €350.”

At the mart’s organic sale on Saturday, 100 cattle sold for up to €1,250 a head or €3.27 per kg, overall making it one of the dearest organic sales ever held at the Limerick mart.
At Kilmallock, all cattle must be pre-booked, anyone wishing to view cattle must make an appointment to do so.
All clients should make sure to register their details to view sales and purchase cattle by logging on to the livestock-live.com website.
Of course our hope throughout the ongoing Covid-19 saga is that our marts will eventually reopen, if only by degrees.
I read with great fascination an article in last Saturday’s Irish Examiner that got me thinking dummies in the marts could be the way forward, when they reopen.
The article stated that a restaurant in faraway America had placed dummies at various tables, to give the impression of a bustling trade.
The proprietor said, “When we needed to solve the problem of social distancing and reducing our restaurant’s occupancy by half, the solution seemed obvious, fill it with interestingly dressed dummies.”

Yes, normality left the building when the coronavirus arrived.
Earlier, when marts had to decimate numbers in attendance for social distancing, I noticed that the hustle and bustle of a busy mart was sadly missing.
To my mind, there is nothing like a busy mart to get farmers’ fingers bidding, and cattle moving.
As our marts hopefully return to some class of normality, would it not be a good idea to install a few ‘interestingly dressed dummies’ to help with filling the ranks?
One rugged, bespectacled dummy could even have a camera strapped around his neck, to look like myself.
As long as the dummies do not interfere with the bidding process, write rubber cheques, or frighten the cattle with their dead stare, what harm could they do?
It’s just a thought for down the line.
Macroom mart uses marteye.ie to great effect
Next, Macroom mart, where it was all go on Thursday, for their first online sale.
The sale was run through the marteye.ie website, another popular choice these days for marts anxious to connect with buyers and sellers.
Mart manager John O’Mahony was pleased with how the sale went.
“The sale was a great success,” John said.
“We had a handy number of cattle on offer, with good demand for all types of cattle.
“Cattle in general are a good trade, with plenty of people looking for cattle for grass.
“We will be continuing with it next Saturday.”
Clare Co-op Marts next, and a report on three online marts sales at Ennis mart, beginning with the mart’s first online cow and calf sale, which took place earlier this week.
“We had a full clearance here on Tuesday,” Geraldine Walsh of Ennis mart reported.
“Calves were a fine trade. Charolais bull calves made up to €325, Angus bull calves made up to €295 with Hereford bull calves making to €255.
“Suckler cows with calves at foot sold for up to €1,430.”
The mart’s first online sale for cull cows, aged bulls, and heifers, was held on Thursday.
Geraldine Walsh gave us the following report following from that sale.
“There was a great trade for cull cows, with over 40% of them bought by people not present to view stock before the auction.
“Friesian culls made €1.20/kg to €1.50/kg and continentals made to €1.96/kg.
“Some good store heifers available, and these made to €2.44/kg.
“It must be said that the online sale proved very popular and both regular and new customers competed very well.”
And at the mart-s other online auction on Friday, it was bullocks taking centre stage.

“It proved quite a success, with almost a complete clearance.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-31000918.html,2020-05-21 16:00:00,"Tough year for farmers revealed in analysis of 2,548 sets of accounts","Farmers want to reduce their carbon footprint, with 93% willing to take action to achieve this, via initiatives such as renewables, carbon capture and storage, and use of alternative fertilisers.
Nine out of 10 say carbon tax collected from the agri-sector should be ringfenced for farmer support, and 70% would support grant aid to use more sustainable energy on their farms.
The support for environment initiatives, despite viability worries for many farmers, is revealed in the annual farm report compiled by ifac, the farming, food, and agribusiness professional services firm. The report includes the views of almost 1,500 farmers, and analysis of trends from 2,548 sets of ifac clients’ farm accounts.
John Donoghue, chief executive of ifac said: “Each year, our report gives us a snapshot of what it’s like to be an Irish farmer. It’s certainly not easy being a farmer in 2020. The whole industry has been hit by a very challenging period and, just like last year, many farmers are increasingly worried about the future.
“Brexit is still looming and the impact of Covid-19 is now evident across some sectors.
“A predicted fall in milk prices and markets being put on hold is affecting dairy farmers. Beef farmers have been hit with the temporary closure of major Irish buyers, less beef being produced, and confirmed Covid-19 cases at meat-processing plants.
“What’s clear this year is that farmers have a long, tough road ahead. Many sectors will need new plans, and many farmers will need the continued support of their external advisers, with specialist sector knowledge, to help them on this journey.
“At ifac, we will continue to anticipate their needs and provide the advice and support needed to help them face the challenges ahead. For example, in response to last year’s report, we focused on growing our succession advisory team, and we developed a new technology-aided management service, called FarmPro, to help our clients improve farm viability, make better decisions, and more profit.”
The 2020 survey confirms that about 50% of farmers are concerned about their farm’s future, and 90% of those surveyed have no definitive farm succession plan in place, with 33% avoiding this issue because they think their business is not viable enough, and they would not encourage the next generation to take it on.
The report reveals an average dairy farm net profit, before other farm income, of €948 per hectare in 2019, up from €804 in 2018. The average net profit for the top 25% was €1,735/hectare last year.
But the average beef farmer lost €101/ha, before other farm income (€116 in 2018). The average net profit for the top 25% was €251/ha last year.
The average sheep farmer lost €144/ha. But when other farm income is included, a net profit of €337/ha was achieved.
The average tillage farmer made a profit of €153/ha, and €591 when other farm income is included.
Half the farmers surveyed don’t prepare cash-flow budgets, mostly because they don’t have enough time, or the required financial ability. Just over half started contributing to a private pension plan in their twenties. But 22% have no household personal life cover.
To look after their mental health and wellbeing, farmers favour exercise, talking to others, participating in discussion groups, eating well, having interests outside of farming, taking breaks and holidays, and having regular health checks.
But almost one in four don’t do anything for mental health and wellbeing."

Improvement in cattle prices at beef factories over the past fortnight was fully maintained this week, with further slight increases reported as achievable for some categories of stock.
Although the stronger price has brought an increase in the intake at the factories, up by more than 1,000 head last week, some processors remain under pressure to get sufficient stock.
Traditionally, the later weeks of May, and early June, see prices reach their peak for the year. It is the time of the year when the supply of yard cattle dries up, and before cattle fatten off grass.
That traditional trade pattern has returned, following the dismal spring trade.
Farming conditions have been excellent for late April and throughout May, which should mean that fat cattle will come off grass early, but the numbers likely to become available over the coming weeks are unpredictable.
The exodus from beef finishing to dairy farming has continued in 2020, with many fairly hardened beef producers deciding that the sector was no longer sustainable, and opting to change.
How that trend will affect the supply of finished cattle for the factories is also unpredictable.
Quoted base prices for steers firmed up this week, at 355c/kg in general, with some deals at up to 360c/kg being reported, particularly in factory areas where supplies have tightened most.
In general, around the country, processors are very interested in supplies, and are reluctant to leave suitable stock behind, which has placed finishers in a stronger position to bargain hard.
The general run of heifer prices is on a base of 360c/kg. Most of the stock are trading at this level, but deals at up to 10c/kg more are reported for larger, choice lots.
The trade for cows has hardened, with prices stronger this week for the poorer grades in particular.
This trade is driven by the improved market for manufacturing beef.
Better quality P-grade cows are reported to be making up to 290c/kg, with prices ranging back to a shade over 270c/kg for plainer P-grade.
O-grade cows are comfortably hitting 300c/kg at the top, while up to 320c/kg is the general run of the trade for Rs, some of which are making up to 10c/kg above that this week.
Prices for young bulls are slightly improved, with Rs generally at 355c-360c/kg.
The intake at factories increased to 26,911 head last week, which was 6,000 less than a year ago.
Steers at 10,525 were similar to last year, while heifers at 7,342 head were short by 2,300 head, and young bulls at 2,561 were down from 4,065 in 2019."

Possibly the most striking feature of this farm, according to Giltinane, is the rarity of the overall package:
“Yes, it’s a real rarity to have a large holding of quality on the market... It’s a good dry farm and you’ve all the facilities there – a twenty-unit Dairymaster milking parlour and cubicles for about 160 cows.”
The range of facilities is impressive, with the parlour featuring a swing arm and diversion and an automated feeding system.
There is a 10,000 litre Mueller bulk tank. Other buildings include a shed with 100 cubicles and three automatic scrapers, an open-pit slurry store (measuring 80x30x6 feet), a shed with 100 cubicles and central feed passage and slatted tank (110x33x12 feet), a walled silage pit (100x80 feet) with slatted effluent tank, a beef shed (26x10 feet) with 3 bays and 6 bays of straw calving area and another shed with 24 cubicles and a tank (40x12.6x10 feet).
The main dwelling house dates from the early 1990s and is an extended quality dormer residence with six bedrooms and is built, according to joint selling agent John Flynn “on a lovely sight, with fine views”. The old original farmhouse is a single-storey building with two bedrooms located in the middle of the farmyard complex and is suitable for an on-site manager.
“It’s fronting onto two roads,” says John Flynn, “and it’s top-class grazing ground – all laid out in paddocks with farm roadways and water accessing all paddocks.
The price expectation for the entire holding is in the region of €10,000 per acre with a separate guide of offers in excess of €200,000 for the main dwelling and two or three acres, depending on how demand evolves.
A very important incentive is the fact that it comes with entitlements worth €18,400/year. For those interested in even more acreage, there is an additional 38-acre land parcel in the nearby townland of Enniscouch for sale from the same source with €4,500 of annual entitlements."

Over €13,000 per acre expected for prime land overlooking Blackwater
The fertile lands in east Cork and west Waterford that overlook the River Blackwater, at its most dramatic locations close to where it enters the sea, have long been renowned for their quality.
This is evident to the eye as you drive through the area, and see the multitude of big houses that have lasted long after independence in this part of Ireland, standing testament to the attraction and the profitability of the land here.
Large and medium-sized blocks of land have been rare to make an appearance on the market of late, so there should be a good deal of interest in a 90-acre residential parcel that has just come up for sale with Youghal-based auctioneers Noel Mackey &amp; Sons.
The property is located in the townland of Ballyknock, Co Waterford, approximately 4km from Youghal on the Tallow road.
The lands are all in grass, and on an elevated position with fine views of the Blackwater Valley back towards Youghal, as well as of the broad, spectacular estuary of Munster’s premier river.
“It’s a prime holding,” says selling agent Noel Mackey. “It consists of top quality land that would be suitable for all types of farming activity.”
This area mostly has dairy farms, but also well represented locally are the beef and equestrian sectors, with a number of important stud farms located close to this property.
“It would be mostly dairying around the area,” says Noel, “but it would be suitable for tillage or it would be a good cattle-fattening farm too.
“And there are some good stud farms not too far away.
“It’s nicely laid out in good sized paddocks. There’s a lot of road frontage going with it too, with access from two roads, the main Youghal-Tallow road [R634] and another side road.”
The farm is currently being used for dairying and is well maintained.
“There’s a single-storey residence which is in need of total refurbishment, and you have a number of outbuildings. There’s a three-column hay shed with lean-to buildings and some stone buildings with the old house.”
The price guide for this farm is €13,500 per acre, a reasonable expectation given how recent local sales went."

Earlier this year, we were all wondering when the rain would stop. Now we are all wondering when it is going to rain again.
Apart from the rain we got last Thursday and Friday, May has been exceptionally dry. The dry spell is starting to cause difficulties for many beef and dairy farmers around the country.
Grass growth has slowed dramatically on many farms.
The north, east and midlands seem to be most hit.
Unfortunately, much of the growth seems to be pure stem, as swards are beginning to head out due to stress from the heat and moisture shortage.
As a result, many are now very short on grass, and animal performance is suffering. It is becoming very obvious in some dairy herds that a drop in yield is due to poor intakes, and lower butter fats are occurring due to poor fibre supply/digestion. It is easier for dairy producers to identify this poor performance, as they have regular milk collections and quality results.
But if they are having these issues, beef animals are also under pressure, for fibre and energy supply.
As growth slows down and grass supply start to diminish, many different solutions are being implemented on farms to bridge the grass shortage. The most important thing to do is to begin stretching available grass, while you still have grass to stretch. The longer you delay intervention and keep hoping for rain, the bigger your deficit will be.
Options
n Increase meal or re-introduce meal.
n Graze some second cut silage ground. Obviously, this is only possible where an early first cut was taken.
n Zero grazing.
n Feed silage or other available forages.
n Consider liquid fertiliser as a means of getting nitrogen into the soil to utilise any remaining moisture available below the surface.
Not every option listed is a possibility on all farms.
Select the option which is the most efficient from an animal performance point of view, while also being cost-effective.
For those anticipating a drought on their farm, it is essential that grass is managed very carefully. Try to slow the rotation, if growth has slowed. This will involve feeding additional ration to those already being fed, and introducing some ration to other stock.
It may also require feeding of round bale silage, if it is available, to slow down the rotation. Whatever happens, it is only the end of May, so don’t leave animals run out of grass before you start thinking about what you will do to feed them.
Feeding batches to stretch grass
Creep feeding of suckler calves will help to reduce grass demand.
Many weaned dairy-bred calves on grass are getting little or no meal; upping meal or re-introducing meal will save grass.
Starting to feed meal to forward stores on grass will slow down the rotation while getting animals used to meal before being pushed for finish. Some may need to consider bringing in cattle intended for slaughter later in the year. Commencing the finishing period a little earlier will take the pressure of the grazing platform.
Thankfully, the beef price has started to increase, so there will be better returns than earlier in the year for feeding cattle.
Silage saved and more to make!
Most have saved their first cut, or soon will do so.
The dry spell has provided ideal conditions for silage. However, that same dry spell is now resulting in slow growth in second cut silage crops. Fields cut for first cut in early May are now only a few weeks from harvesting, but have not yet bulked up. Recent first cut fields have very little grass in them and many are still yellow, which may result in less bulk, and late second cuts, if we don’t get rain soon.
Fertiliser spread after recent first cuts is still sitting on the surface, while slurry if applied has not washed in and is caked on the stubble. This may lead to a shortfall of silage on some heavier stocked farms.
Fly control
The forecast for the next week to 10 days is for a lot of very warm weather.
During any very warm spell, insects are going to be more common, meaning more irritation for cattle.
If animals become affected by this, you may need to treat stock for external parasites. Regular treatment will be necessary. Pay particular attention to recently dried-off, autumn-calving suckler cows, and consider applying a fly/lice treatment to their udders as well as on their backs."

Yesterday it was temporarily suspended after a 14-year-old cow was found to have 'atypical' BSE, or 'mad cow disease'.
A report is currently being carried out by the Department of Agriculture on the matter.
Beef exports to China were forecast to hit €120m this year.
Edmund Graham from the ICSA hopes it can still be reached despite this setback.
He says: ""The big volumes of beef that was expected to go this year was great and we didn't get held back by an outbreak of the Covid and things were just slowly starting to get back to normal.
""Where we were starting to move beef again to China and this has happened so it has slowed the whole thing down again.
""So hopefully there won't be too much of a delay."""

With half of Ireland’s beef going to the UK, it should be good news. However, our beef shipments to the UK are falling. This trend continued in March, when the UK’s imports were down 8% year-on-year, to 23,500 tonnes.
The latest trade figures show imports for the first quarter of 2020 total 61,800 tonnes, a reduction of 11% compared to last year.
However, the value of UK beef imports during March was down only 4%, supported by a 4% rise in unit prices.
March shipments from the UK’s largest supplier, Ireland, fell by 6% on the year to 19,300 tonnes. Imports from the Netherlands fell 45%, to 900 tonnes.
Imports from Poland increased 9%, to 1,500 tonnes.
Lower imports from Ireland may be related to throughput, which was down 4.5% for 2020, up to mid-May. The 666,738 cattle processed in Ireland up to May 16 was 31,000 head behind the corresponding period in 2019.
Up to mid-May, live exports, at 149,978 head, were 23% behind the same period in 2019.
All markets have reduced demand for calves, as the trade for finished animals for beef and veal has deteriorated, due to Covid-19.
Calf exports to the Netherlands have been particularly disrupted, with only 181 shipped there in the week ending May 16, out of total live exports in that week of 5,001 animals, including 2,500 calves shipped to Spain."

Beef prices are holding steady at factories this week.
But the beef sector is awash with rumours that prices are about to come under pressure, and the short run of improved prices may be about to come to an end.
The strongest definite indicator so far is that getting to the higher level of prices paid in recent weeks for either steers or heifers has become close to impossible this week.
Also, for the third consecutive week, cow prices have slipped.
The cow price is often the barometer for trends in prime beef prices.
Meanwhile, excellent farming conditions for April and May are already delivering cattle off the grass.
It has been the earliest season for grass-finished cattle in a number of years, after the driest spring in nearly a century and a half in some areas of the country.
The lack of rain may yet disrupt the beef supply, if drought conditions spread.
The strongest market positive is that increasing demand for beef on the home and export markets, which lifted prices for cattle at factories in recent weeks, has continued.
However, as the supply of beef cattle increases (and demand may fall if a summer heatwave continues), there will be less pressure on processors to get sufficient cattle to meet demand.
There was a further sharp rise in intake at the factories last week, which has eased any pressure on requirements aiding the tightening in prices.
The supply increase was confirmed in the past week, with the total kill topping 31,000 head for the first time in weeks, although it was still 3,700 head less than the same week last year.
Steers dominated last week’s supply, at 10,349 head, a few hundred head more than in 2019, with heifers at 9,162 head was just shy of the 2019 level.
The supply of cows continued strong at 8,203 head while young bulls at 2,779 head were well back on 2019.
The overall intake year to date is now down by 40,000 head on the corresponding period in 2019.
Quoted steer base prices have generally settled on 355 cents/kg, with up to 360 cents/kg being paid on a sizeable percentage of the kill for this week, some of which had been bought forward last week.
Finishers say they are meeting a stonewall refusal to pay over 360 cents/kg this week for steers.
Heifer prices are level with steer prices, but with a shade more leeway at the top, which is delivering up to 365 cents/kg base to hard sellers.
Young bulls are priced at 5-10 cents/kg under steer prices.
Prices for cows are hardest hit, making it very difficult to reach 300 cents/kg for good quality Rs this week, while prices for Ps are in a 260-270 cents/kg range."

Many farmers are under pressure at the moment.
While the weather has been beautiful, its effects are beginning to bite, more especially for dairy farmers and tillage farmers.
The cost on a medium-size dairy farm, of 100 cows, is over €2,500 per month, where supplementary feeding is 3kg/day ahead of normal.
Some farmers in drier areas have racked up a month of extra feeding, and the prospect of another month or two of supplements is likely, as farmers try to build up reserves of grass.
The hidden costs of the drought, though, are concealed in lower production, and more importantly in costs to come next winter.
While first cut silage was taken out in excellent conditions, the prospect of a much reduced second cut is upon us, due to minimal regrowth, and diversion of fields which were set for cutting to grazing instead, as farmers try to keep grass ahead of animals.
Within view of the popular beaches at Garretstown during the recent fine weather, John Fielding has to make hay while the sun shines. Picture: Denis Boyle
Equally, tillage farmers face a less than certain coming few months.
Some spring barley in our area has started to push out the final leaf, marking the end of stem growth.
Plants are clearly stunted, and at only around half of normal height.
After a horrendously wet winter, the winter barley crop yield might also be reduced by slug damage, and by failure of crops to tiller well in February and March.
The forward prices for UK wheat, at €160 per tonne, a benchmark for our cereal prices, remains slightly ahead of harvest prices last year.
At current levels, the expected drop in yield of straw and grain is unlikely to be offset by the marginally higher prices on offer.
Tillage farmers will perhaps be able to take advantage of stronger than normal demand for straw, as dairy and beef farmers will look to supplement existing excellent quality silage with feeding straw during the winter.
Some livestock farmers will also look to bolster stocks of fodder through whole-cropping barley and wheat.
All is not lost though, for either sector.
By working together, tillage farmers may come to the rescue of livestock farmers, and derive additional income for themselves, through growing winter fodder such as rape, redstart, or ryegrass in drought-stricken areas.
Should the weather undergo a meaningful change in the next week or so, a lot of ground can be made up on farms.
From a finance perspective, being caught in a drought can leave a farmer financially stretched.
It is important to examine:
- what the likely financial impact for you is so far this year.
- to quantify what extra costs will be incurred for each week from here on in.
- and to see what impact will these extra costs have on your plans for the year.
Having quantified the impact as best you can, you are able to decide whether you have the savings and resources to trade through this difficulty without adjusting your spending plans.
Or, alternatively, do you need to make adjustments to your spending, to ensure you have enough profits left over to cover household costs, farm bills, and loan repayments.
Each farmer can tailor their own individual plan to suit their own circumstances.
For instance, some farmers might make very simple changes, such as holding off on planned reseeding, so they don’t lose out on valuable grass growth this year.
Others might decide to reduce cattle numbers, this is especially the case for dairy farmers carrying a mix of dairy and beef who can offload bullocks or beef heifers earlier than normal.
Others might need to take more aggressive action, such as holding off on planned construction, or restructuring debt by taking an interest-only break.
You must take whatever actions you need to remain as profitable as you can, but also to remain solvent and liquid. Remaining solvent means having more assets than liabilities.
For the vast majority, that’s not an issue.
Remaining liquid means having the capacity to pay bills as they fall due.
At this time of year, most farmers often have more debt (creditors) than money owing to them, but usually this corrects itself as the year goes on.
A lot of costs are incurred upfront, and it takes a while for production to kick in, whether that’s milk supply or the grain harvest.
If, having incurred these extra costs, you can’t see the numbers stacking up so that you will be able to clear your bills as you would like to, then you need to take action.
Fundamentally, the priority at the moment is keeping food ahead of cows and cattle, but don’t lose sight of the bigger picture.
Assess what actions you need to take to feed your animals in the short term, what actions you need to take to ensure you have enough fodder for the winter, and what actions you need to take to be able to finance these costs.
Help is available from fellow farmers and trusted advisors."

“There are about 30 acres of good land in this property,” says Tom. “The rest of it would be low-lying summer grazing land. It has nice views of the River Shannon and it’s very close to Montpelier.”
This is at a point where three counties meet, with the land located in Limerick but having boundaries with both Tipperary and Clare (across the Shannon which runs along the farms north-western boundary).
The guideline figure is for offers in excess of €300,000. At an average price per ace of €6,250, this represents a very good opportunity to purchase land in this part of the world. It’s very much accessible from the M7 Limerick-Dublin motorway and in a tourist-oriented and agriculture-oriented part of Ireland.
Yes, it’s well located and it’s also beside Montpelier and O’Briensbridge, which are leafy areas famous for its fishing scene.
There are no entitlements going with the land, where the local farmer sectors are dominated by a mixture of beef farming and dairying."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-31004377.html,2020-06-10 12:00:00,Laws of economics and EU's wooly Farm to Fork aspirations,"The word ""ORGANIC"" written in vintage metal letterpress type sitting in a wooden drawer.
If dairy, beef, pig, sheep or tillage farmers were told the EU has a plan to increase their production three-fold, many of them would decide it’s time to get out of the business.
Anyone operating in any kind of business knows that the market is unlikely to absorb a 300% increase in supply without the business becoming unprofitable, due to prices falling in response to over-supply.
However, that is the prospect facing organic farmers, in the EU’s Farm to Fork proposal for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system.
The Farm to Fork Strategy sets targets to transform the EU’s food system, including a reduction by 50% of the use and risk of pesticides, a reduction by at least 20% of the use of fertilisers, a reduction by 50% in sales of antimicrobials used for farmed animals and aquaculture, and reaching 25% of agricultural land under organic farming (compared to 7.7% now).
Not even dairy farmers, our most profitable sector, would welcome an EU plan to treble milk production.
It would even put off dairy farmers in other parts of the world, because the EU is the world’s largest food exporter.
As for our other main farming sectors, cattle, pig, sheep or cereal farmers would be running for a place to hide if the EU intended to treble their production.
There are a number of laws of economics that organic farmers will have to beware of, in the EU’s plan to increase the hectares they farm three-fold (which probably means a 300% produce supply increase, unless the EU limits the farmers’ production in some way}.
The main law of economics is that when supply goes up, price falls.
Other proven laws indicate that existing fans of organic food probably already buy all the organic food they can eat, and cannot buy much more, even if prices are lowered.
There are unlikely to be organic food fans among that large consumer segment that is very price sensitive, and tends to buy whatever is cheapest.
The majority of consumers are “somewhat” price sensitive. They will buy some foods at high prices, but they will buy increasingly more at lower prices. They will have to be persuaded to eat organic.
There are laws of economics on the farms as well as in the supermarkets.
For farmers newly drafted into organic farming by the EU, there’s an even bigger commitment than for the average non-organic farmer.
For example, to increase production of non-organic beef, you first have to raise cattle, build sheds, or acquire more land.
The farmer has to be confident enough to take the gamble that by the time he has more cattle to sell, prices will still be sufficient to generate profits.
The same applies to new organic farmers, on the double, because a two-year conversion period is required before a farm is given organic status.
As well as trebling organic farming by 2030, the Farm to Fork Strategy is designed to reduce use of pesticides by 50%, use of fertilisers by at least 20%, and sales of antimicrobials used for farmed animals and aquaculture by 50%.
The question arises: will it be harder to market organic food, when non-organic farming is being cleaned up to this extent, bearing in mind that the pesticides, fertilisers, and antimicrobials had all been proven by scientists to be safe, and bearing in mind that annual testing shows very little dangerous residues in EU foods.
None of these troubling questions are allowed intrude on the EU’s Green Deal, Biodiversity Strategy, and Farm to Fork Strategy, because they are as of yet only the typically wooly aspirations which 27 member states could be expected not to object to.
It’s all about a plan for fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food, bringing together nature, farmers, business, and consumers for a competitively sustainable future. Who could object to that?
The only mention of markets is that sales of organic food are set to continue growing.
The EU says organic farming needs to be further promoted, because it has a positive impact on biodiversity, it creates jobs, and attracts young farmers.
Consumers recognise its value, says the EU, and more needs to be done to shift to this type of farming.
In addition to CAP measures, such as eco-schemes, investments and advisory services, and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) measures, the Commission will put forward an Action Plan on organic farming.
This will help Member States stimulate both supply and demand for organic products.
It will ensure consumer trust and boost demand through promotion campaigns and green public procurement.
This approach will help to reach the objective of at least 25% of the EU’s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030, and a significant increase in organic aquaculture.
However, such measures sound like the standard financial support offered by the EU and other developed nations to reduce the risk of farmers not being able to make a profit, and going out of business, because prices are too low.
Nevertheless, the target to reach 25% organic land in Europe by 2030, and other elements of the EU Biodiversity and Farm to Fork strategies are welcomed by IFOAM EU, which represents more than 210 member organisations across the organic food chain.
The organisation said that the EU target for organic land is a landmark decision in a transition towards agroecology.
IFOAM EU called on the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to even raise the level of ambition, and make the CAP an effective tool to incentivise and help farmers to transition, rewarding them for their contribution to public goods such as the preservation of natural resources.
“A reformed CAP, a solid action plan including quantitative time-bound objectives, and a dedicated budget, will be a good basis to increase organic land and reach the target for 2030,” said IFOAM EU."

A suggested decline of 26% in farm incomes is dramatic.
A decline of 57% could be described as catastrophic.
However, these recent projections by a Teagasc team of Covid-19’s impact on Irish agriculture were not forecasts.
Instead, the projections calculated what could happen, not necessarily what is most likely.
They was based on scenarios or assumptions like “if milk prices were to decline by 10%, 15%, or 20% compared with 2019, as a result of the virus”.
Economics was once christened the “dismal science”.
This honour may now have been taken over by the climatologists, but dire warnings are still typical of the economics profession.
But how likely are any of these scenarios to be fulfilled?
More than five months into 2020, we can look at the data on prices and output for these five months for guidance.
What has happened to prices so far?
The average price received for R3 steers for the first 21 weeks of the year was €3.59 per kg, 10c or about 3% lower than the same period last year.
Up to week 12, prices were sometimes higher and sometimes lower than last year.
But, from week 13, coinciding with the Covid lockdown, 2020 prices (up to week 21) have consistently been about 7% under 2019 levels, despite the number of cattle slaughtered at meat plants being 5% lower this year.
Teagasc economists looked at three scenarios of Covid-19 effects on farming. The implications for farm income were all negative, ranging from about 22% to 54% declines compared to 2019, and from about 26% to 56% declines compared to pre-Covid forecasts for 2020 farm incomes.
Over the 21 weeks, the average 2020 price was 7% higher than in 1919.
Lamb slaughterings in the year to date were 5% higher than in 2019.
There was no early evidence of a Covid-induced fall in sheep meat prices.
Instead, the gap between 2019 and 2020 prices widened in recent weeks.
The average price of pigmeat in 2019 was €1.65 per kg, boosted by a deficit in the world marketplace caused by African swine fever in China and elsewhere.
In 2020, the average price is €1.84, but it fell as low as €1.64 for the last week of May.
The latest price slump is almost certainly Covid-induced.
Milk prices in March and April were respectively 3% and 4% below those of 2019.
There are no indications in the futures markets for dairy products that traders expect substantial falls over the rest of the year.
While the coronavirus is an unprecedented event, and may yet have substantially greater impact (for example, if there is a “second wave” of infection), there is little evidence to date that the dire consequences in terms of price reductions envisaged in two of the Teagasc scenarios are likely to occur.
However, their third scenario may not be too far off the mark.
That considered the outcomes for farmers if:
n Cattle sheep and milk prices fall 10%, compared to 2019 (R3 steer price €3.23 kg exclusive of Vat; heavy lamb at €4.15/kg exclusive of Vat).
n Pig prices gain 13%.
n Grain prices gain 10% for wheat, barley price unchanged.
n Sales volume of cattle and sheep declines by 4% relative to forecast volume.
n Young cattle prices decline 10% relative to 2019.
Those changes would be enough to reduce farm incomes 22%, according to the projections by Teagasc economists.
Unfortunately, it’s a far cry from the forecasts of 2020 farm incomes made by Teagasc economists last autumn.
They predicted stable milk prices, and milk output up 5%, with lower feed and fertiliser prices helping to boost family farm incomes on specialist dairy farms by 9%.
Teagasc economists predicted finished beef cattle prices up by 4%, helping to increase incomes on cattle rearing farms 2%.
However, an income decline of 2% was seen on other cattle farms.
Sheep prices were expected to remain stable, with costs to fall, leading to an increase of 7% in incomes.
A 15% increase in incomes was expected for grain growers, due to a 5% increase in prices, and lower input costs,
After autumn weather prevented sowing of winter wheat and barley, projections were revised early this tear to a 10% wheat price gain, a 20% decline in cereal production, and a marginal decline in incomes.
Pig farming have proved the most unpredictable.
Prices were expected to average €2.15 per kg in 2020, but have instead slumped into the €1.60s.
The forecast record pig farm incomes of 2020 currently look a remote possibility.
Such are the risks of economic forecasting.
That was then.
We are now in an altogether different market and economic situation worldwide, arising from the effects of Covid-19 on employment, incomes and consumer sentiment.
No one, and certainly not economists, can say if we will have a benign result from this virus, with the country back to relative normality by October, or whether there will be a further lockdown later in the year.
Eamonn Pitts says the 2020 farm income outcome won’t be as dramatic or catastrophic as envisaged in two scenarios considered by Teagasc. But their third scenario may not be too far off the mark. Unfortunately, if it materialises, it could reduce the incomes of Irish farmers 22% this year"

A client was recently going through his costings on a building project with me, and his reference to cocktails of the alcoholic variety left me bamboozled.
I wasn’t sure what drinking spirits with mixers had to do with his costings, and doubted sincerely that turning to alcohol would speed up the project, until the penny dropped, and I realised his reference was slang for value added tax.
His comments have prompted me to cover some key Vat principles that are often overlooked by business persons, and indeed by private individuals and farmers, which can leave them surprised by a big Vat bill.
Firstly, farmers are pretty unique when it comes to Vat, in that they can remain unregistered for Vat, or can choose to register, and in doing so, claim back Vat on purchases used in their business, and pay Vat on their sales.
An unregistered farmer can reclaim Vat on fixtures and fittings, building work, roadways and fencing, but cannot claim back Vat on movable goods, repairs, or day-to-day consumables.
Instead, such farmers are compensated with a flat rate farmers addition top-up to their sales price.
In my experience, as a broad rule of thumb, tillage farmers are predominately better off registered for Vat.
Beef farmers are also generally better off registered for Vat, albeit the administrative costs can make registering not worthwhile, and dairy farmers are predominantly better off remaining unregistered.
Of course, each farm is different, and what’s good for one may not be good for another.
Equally, choosing the right path might vary at different phases of a business lifecycle.
For example, it might be better to be registered for Vat for a while, when incurring a lot of otherwise unrecoverable Vat costs, and then to deregister at a different phase.
As a side note, there are rules which seek to limit the advantages of swapping in and out of Vat registration with impunity.
The “normal” rule that applies to most other businesses is that when the annual turnover in any 12-month period exceeds €37,500, in the case of services, or €75,000 in the case of goods, then the business is obliged to register, and charge and remit Vat as appropriate to Revenue.
For farmers, the registration thresholds needn’t be adhered to in respect of the supply of the majority of farming goods, but must be adhered to in respect of the supply of agricultural services.
Therefore, for example, a farmer supplying agricultural contracting services is obliged to register for Vat, once his turnover exceeds or is expected to exceed the threshold of €37,500.
There is a little wriggle room on that figure, thanks to yet another rule!
Once a farmer is obliged to register for Vat, as a result of exceeding the services threshold, then he or she is obliged to account for Vat on all supplies.
In practical terms, this means that a farmer supplying contracting services totalling more than €37,500 in any 12-month period is obliged to register for and account for Vat at the appropriate rate on all of their sales.
So, a farmer, engaged in beef farming, for example, and also providing agricultural services for a consideration exceeding €37,500, must register for Vat, and account for Vat on cattle sales and contracting sales.
Indeed, a farmer carrying on two separate trades, and who is registered for Vat in respect of one trade, must also register for Vat in respect of his farming trade.
For example, a part-time beef farmer also works as a Vat-registered, self-employed mechanic.
He must register for Vat in respect of both trades.
Apart from exceeding the thresholds for the supply of services or goods as described above, other rules can also make it obligatory to register for Vat.
These can include instances where an otherwise unregistered farmer acquires goods in excess of €41,000 from another EU state, or where the farmer acquires a new means of transport from another EU state.
For example, an Irish dairy farmer, who is unregistered for Vat, buys a second-hand tractor from the UK.
The price of the tractor is €60,000 inclusive of UK Vat of 20%.
He trades in his old tractor for €30,000 to the dealer, and writes out a cheque for a net figure of €30,000.
In this instance, the Vat unregistered Irish farmer has neglected his duty to register for and properly account for Vat.
What should have happened is that the Irish farmer registers and obtains an Irish Vat number solely for the purpose if the import; and quotes his Irish Vat number to the UK dealer — at which point the UK dealer charges the farmer an ex-Vat price of €50,000, less the trade-in of €30,000, meaning the farmer writes a cheque to the UK dealer for €20,000.
At the point of import, the farmer pays Irish Vat at 23% costing him €11,500.
So the total cost to the Irish farmer under this arrangement has been €31,500, which of course is more expensive than what he initially thought it was going to cost him.
But them’s the rules.
The reason behind this rule is to prevent unfair competition allowing consumers to effectively shop in the EU country with the cheapest Vat rate, to the detriment of their own domestic economy.
Similarly, private Irish individuals who purchase new means of transport in another EU state, and bring such a vehicle back to Ireland, must pay Irish Vat at the point of import into Ireland.
For example, an Irish person buys a lovely new yacht for personal use in Luxembourg, and sails home to Ireland, thinking he’s saved himself a packet.
The Vat rate in Luxembourg is 17%, versus our 23%.
Unfortunately, the yacht buyer will get a sinking feeling when he discovers that not alone has he paid Vat in the wrong country, but that he must also pay 6% more than what he had expected.
The upshot is that Vat is tricky stuff, it’s always a good idea to check out whether you’re on the right side of the law."

Reduced beef cattle prices and a 15 to 20% per cent reduction in beef processing in late March, April, and May, have prompted Agriculture Minister Michael Creed to announce a €50 million support scheme for beef finishing farms.
The scheme received cabinet approval this week.
But the details of how it will help farms severely impacted by the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have yet to be agreed.
Minister Creed said his Department will engage with beef industry stakeholders in relation to the details.
The proposed scheme must also be submitted to the EU for state aid approval, but this should not present any problems, with eight member states having already benefitted from a new temporary state aid framework, putting in place specific schemes for agriculture totalling about €1.23 billion.
However, it could take many weeks for the scheme to be finalised, submitted to the EU, and approved in Brussels.
Since Covid-19 restrictions came into place in late March, through to late May, the prime beef cattle throughput at plants was significantly behind what would be expected at this time of year.
During this ten-week period, 215,066 prime cattle passed through plants, a reduction of just under 37,000 head, or 15%, compared to the corresponding period in 2019.
Cow throughput in beef plants followed a similar trend in the ten weeks to May 30, falling 20% behind the same period in 2019.
Covid-19 not only reduced prime cattle and cow processing, but also depressed prices.
And the resulting backlog of cattle on farms is likely to depress prices further.
Minister Creed said, “I urge all actors in the supply chain to recognise their interdependence and work collaboratively towards our shared objective, a beef sector which is economically, environmentally and socially sustainable.”
“I have now made over €200 million in new money available specifically to beef farmers over the past two years on top of the €300 million under the Beef Data and Genomics Programme.”
Minister Creed also announced that a video conference meeting of the Beef Taskforce is planned for the end of June.
IFA President Tim Cullinan welcomed the announcement by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister Creed of the €50m direct payment package for beef farmers.
He said, “The details of the scheme and the small print will be very important.
He said IFA was due to meet with the Department of Agriculture next Monday to progress the scheme details further”.
IFA Livestock Chairman Brendan Golden also welcomed the beef package, saying finishers took a severe financial hit this spring.
“As a major beef exporter, Ireland was hit much harder than many other countries.”
He said finishers have been set back €200 per head, compared to pre-Brexit and pre-Covid prices."

A steady trade at unchanged prices is the general summary of the beef market at factories this week, with supply and demand reasonably balanced.
Intake rose considerably in recent weeks.
After trailing the corresponding weeks in 2019 for the year to date, the weekly 2020 in June has overtaken last year’s figures.
But the 2020 intake to mid June remains down 40,000 head compared to 2019.
The intake of young bulls is back by 36,000 head and heifers are down by 7,000, while steers are up 10,000 head.
Re-opening of some food services in recent weeks has boosted beef demand, and more restaurants are expected to open in coming weeks as easing of the Covid-19 restrictions continues.
Quoted beef cattle prices for this week remain at a base for steers varying between 355 cents/kg and 360 cents/kg.
It seems to be getting a bit more difficult this week to negotiate for the higher end of that range, the percentage of stock being purchased at the 355 cents/kg base is increasing.
The base for heifers has settled at 360 cents/kg in general, with some achieving a base of 365 cents/kg.
R-grade young bulls are generally making 350 cents/kg, with the intake hovering around half of the same 2019 week’s level, and processors penalising for overweight animals.
The buzz around the trade this week is the increase in the supply of finished cattle, and cows, crossing the border to be slaughtered in Northern Ireland, to benefit from stronger prices.
The Livestock and Meat Commission in Northern Ireland said live imports for direct slaughter in May totalled 1,655, 89.4% ahead of May 2019. Th LMC said there was a strong increase in the number of cattle imported from south of the border for direct slaughter in the first week of June, to 714 prime cattle and 325 cows up from 463 prime cattle and 130 cows in the previous week. It was the third consecutive for an increase in imports from the south for direct slaughter. Bord Bia have confirmed more animals going north for more favourable market conditions.
This has contributed to pressure on processors in the south to maintain their prices.
The slight recovery in the trade for cows over the past couple of weeks has been maintained.
Heavy R-grade cows are making 300 to 310 cents/kg this week. O-grade cows are ranging 280-285 cents/kg, and the prices for the average P-grade starts at around 270 cents/kg."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-31005618.html,2020-06-17 09:00:00,Gerard Howlin: Governing on a wing and a prayer,"If you need to know the costings of the Programme for Government agreed on Monday, you can’t afford it. Gone are the days when politicians campaigned in poetry but governed in prose. What is intended now brings the Government to lyrical heights. We are on the cusp of the Ireland de Valera spoke of in his 1943 Saint Patrick’s Day address: “The home of a people who valued material wealth only as a basis for right living"".
We are a people “satisfied with frugal comfort” who “devoted their leisure to the things of the spirit"". The Programme for Government makes perfect sense if read as a spiritual aid, not an economic plan.
By any rational measure, it is a plan that is unaffordable. It is unfunded. However, some essential safeguards are built-in. From 2022, tax bands and allowances will be indexed. There will be no tax increases except on carbon, sugar and plastic. There is yet another commitment to rejig the Local Property Tax. Indexation, however, costs about €600 million a year, at least. There is a commitment to abolish the 3% USC surcharge on incomes over €100,000 which is a snip at €130 million a year.
Add in backsliding on the old-age pension eligibility increase to 67, and you have a billion a year, every year, right there. This will bear down on spending, unless funded by borrowing. But on borrowing, we will somehow move back towards a balanced budget regardless.
Deficit reduction, plus no tax increases except on carbon, sugar and plastic = spending cuts. If there aren't spending cuts, tax increases, broken promises or a combination of all, then there is only borrowing left. At some point, there will be an unpleasant reckoning. But that is in the future. For now, unfunded and uncosted, the Programme for Government, floats ephemerally in the ether.
Ideologically it is a win for the Greens. Economically it is a backstop for Fine Gael. Politically those clambering aboard from Fianna Fáil believe it is a life raft. There is only a single hinge joining it to any credible framework. Economic growth must be swift and strong enough to close a dangerously widening budget deficit without the need for spending cuts or tax increases.
To state that the Programme for Government is not an economic plan, is not opinion. An actual plan is, in fact, separately provided for. But in the future. First off, there will be a ‘July Jobs Initiative'. It seems to be a short-term initiative to the end of 2020. It will particularly focus on tourism and hospitality, retail, entertainment and the arts, construction. But in October, comes the big one. It’s called the National Economic Plan and will chart our long-term recovery.
With apologies for the turgidity of the detail, the Programme for Government is actually the prayer, in the wing and a prayer required for this government to get off the ground.
The real plan comes in October. The difference is that, what was agreed this week and is on its way to newly empowered party members around the country, is a list of things we think we would like to do. The October plan, is the list of the things we actually will do, because we 'found' money — mainly borrowed — to pay for them.
Readers of this column might recall last week some fretting about the unaccountable power of party members, to hold a domino-style set of plebiscites, to second-guess our general election. I am happy to report that, based on careful reading of the document sent to them, all the real decisions are reserved for the government that will take power after they ratify the project in principle. There is almost no danger the eventual outcome will bear much resemblance to what is proposed. That’s my analysis, not a value judgement.
If Fianna Fáil’s success is simply being there, and the Greens' to have set the tone, Fine Gael’s is to have set the terms and conditions. Indexing tax bands, is both a colossal cost in itself and a highly effective means of shutting down new spending. It is about greenbacks not the green agenda. It takes care, and shows cause, with those who that party will want to vote for them. It is hiding in plain sight, apparently its full consequences not seen. Its costs will bear consecutively with the commitment to rein in borrowing, and that will make the difference between the things we aspire to, and what we can actually afford.
Some of what is aspired to is changed patterns of farming. Watch carefully for sharp elbows between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to avoid the agriculture portfolio. It may replace Health as the new 'Angola'. Before the next minister arrives there is a looming Brexit. A comprehensive deal by December 31 seems a pipe dream. A partial deal is the best that can be realistically hoped for. In any event, dislocation for the food sector is imminent. That could be further bad news for an already depressed beef sector. And that’s not to mention changing consumption patterns. As a commodity, dairy may have plateaued and farming is ultimately tied to the price of commodities. In tandem, there will be a heightened need for environmental delivery. So far, so good. We are all for that.
Except, it must be paid for. The current GLAS scheme gives participating farmers about €3,500 each.
But there is talk now of reinstating the former REPs scheme, which was more popular and delivered more too. So it might. It cost more than €10,000 per farm. And that was then. Clean isn’t cheap — unlike promises.
Purposeful vagueness is a political skill. In the years between the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive, acting occasionally as government press secretary I had to learn smooth, soothing lines and deliver them to a sceptical media with solemnity. Sceptical media is now in short supply. There is groupthink in the concerted enthusiasm of many for what is intended. That should be a warning for those entering into it. You cannot exit by the door you entered. And some will not find any exit ever. The purposeful vagueness in the Programme for Government seems sufficient to achieve its aim, of delivering a government. It is that government which will then take the real decisions at a future date.
Those decisions will have context. Some like Brexit and Covid-19 are largely outside its control.
Others, like the parameters it sets itself, are intended to forcibly shape its ultimate objective. It would be the greatest mistake to confuse that ultimate objective with promised delivery of any specific plan. As de Valera said of Saint Patrick he came “promising happiness here no less than happiness hereafter"". So it is in the Programme for Government.

Farmers were generally supportive of this week’s bid to form a new Government.
A commitment to appoint a food ombudsman was welcomed by IFA President Tim Cullinan. He said, “The potential for farmers to contribute to our climate targets through the production of renewable energy must be something the new Government embraces. Farmers are keen to play their part, but to date have been excluded.”
But he warned that the Climate Change Bill will have to take account of the benefits that farmers and agriculture provide in carbon sequestration, and must recognise the cyclical nature of methane in emissions.
ICMSA President Pat McCormack said farmers are reassured by the tone of several of the Programme for Government clauses dealing with agriculture.
The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society (ICOS) said the Programme for Government is welcome in the context of the urgent need to have a stable Government in place to reboot the economy, as businesses start to reopen and with a cliff-edge Brexit still a distinct possibility.
“The document recognises the agri-food sector as Ireland’s most important indigenous industry, which is critically important.”
“The co-operative approach, as a business model can make an important contribution to supporting the rebooting of the economy.”
“The commitment to an average 7% cut in greenhouse gas emissions per annum, equating to a 51% reduction over the next decade, is an extremely challenging target for the Irish economy, especially given our unique emissions profile, where agriculture accounts for over a third of our emissions due to the lack of heavy industry in the wider economy.
“It is welcome that the document acknowledges the special role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of methane.”
Macra na Feirme welcomed the intention to carry out a baseline biodiversity survey and a national hedgerow survey.
Farmers welcomed the position on live exports. “We acknowledge the income pressure that beef farmers are under and the role live exports play in price competition. Recognising the importance of animal welfare, the new Government will provide additional resources to monitor welfare standards by increasing the veterinary presence available on all live export consignments to third countries. We will vigorously pursue value-enhancing alternative market avenues,” said the Programme for Government.
Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and the Marine Charlie McConalogue said supporting live exports is one of the key Fianna Fáil agricultural policies included in the Programme for Government.
He said he will vote yes for the draft programme.
Meanwhile, hopes that the Programme for Government will be accepted by members of the three coalition parties were encouraged by An Taisce describing it as a significant breakthrough on climate and environmental action, and by Stop Climate Chaos saying it is a vast improvement on its predecessor from 2016, and if implemented fully, will mark a major advance in Irish climate policy.
However, the environmentalists' coalition said it lacked firm commitments to reverse the increase in methane and nitrous oxide emissions within the agriculture sector, or to offer any tangible commitments to move away from intensification.
The Irish Wildlife Trust also welcomed the Programme for Government as “potentially transformative for the Irish landscape.”
The support of two-thirds of Green Party voting members is required to allow their participation in government."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40018670.html,2020-06-29 12:16:00,UK farmers told beware of cheaper Irish beef,"British farmers enjoying a price jump for cattle have been told to beware of cheap Irish beef.
The post-coronavirus recovery of Ireland’s beef throughputs could cast uncertainty over the recent strong rally in cattle prices in Great Britain, according to the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.
In sharp contrast to the British price gains, prime beef cattle prices in Ireland haven’t budged for the past six weeks.
AHDB said Ireland’s beef sector was particularly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, due to its reliance on exports to UK and European foodservice markets. The latest trade statistics, for April, showed Irish beef exports in April were down 35% to the EU and 18% to the UK year-on-year, due to the pandemic.
As a result of lower foodservice demand, and furloughing of abattoir staff, Irish cattle throughput has been heavily reduced of late, by nearly 25% in some weeks during the height of the pandemic, said AHDB. “This means that, currently, Irish abattoirs are around 37,000 head behind where they were for cattle slaughter at the same week last year, meaning there is still a substantial backlog of cattle to work through.
“Supplies will likely be plentiful for some time.”
Tighter cattle supplies in Great Britain had boosted prices for their farmers.
AHDB said British cattle throughputs have been recovering in June, as abattoir capacity returned to normal, and the UK and European foodservice sector slowly reopened.
“However, Irish cattle prices have not risen as far as GB prices have in the last few weeks, suggesting that any supplies that do come our way are likely to be more price-competitive.”
Already farmers in Northern Ireland are feeling the effects of cheaper cattle from the south which now make up 8-9% of their weekly prime beef kill, and about 11% of their cow kill. Southern steers are about 8% cheaper, and cows 14% cheaper, compared to prices in Northern Ireland."

Some say that our new Minister for Agriculture, Barry Cowen, mightn’t know that much about farming.
Well, to hell with that talk, because too much knowledge can blinker a fellow.
A fresh pair of eyes is never a bad thing. Give the man a chance, for goodness sake. So-called experts in farming have been leading us astray for years.
It has also been said that his father worked as an undertaker (as well as being a TD, publican, and butcher), which to my mind makes him ideal for the role as minister.
With Irish farming on the last legs, who better than the son of an undertaker to spot the warning signs?
What farming, and beef farming in particular, needs right now is the kiss of life.
Minister Cowen might be the very man, not only to see this but to do something proactive about it.
The suckler cow is key to our success in beef farming. Look after the cow and the industry will flourish. And the best way to look after the cow is to ensure the farmer can afford to keep her.
A straightforward suckler cow subsidy similar to what we had on offer 25 years ago has never been more warranted. The suckler calves born back then took some beating.
Good cattle are always in demand, and if the farmer can be encouraged (as he was, years ago) to breed the best, we can become the best.
Staying with good cattle, and straight for the marts. Our new minister has hit the ground running, and so must we. We begin with Kanturk mart from where mart manager, Seamus O’Keeffe, gave us this report on Tuesday’s cattle sale.
“We had a smaller sale on Tuesday (Kanturk mart had 330 animals on offer, including 90 calves).
“A full clearance was recorded with a flying trade which had dealers and farmers competing for cattle.”
A stand-out lot from Kanturk on Tuesday was the sale of six well bred Friesian heifer calves for €410 a head.

Wine being poured into a glass. Photo: PA Photo/thinkstockphotos
On this 4th of July many of us are looking with sympathy on the traumatic times the USA is going through at the moment. I’d like to have filled this page with wines from California in tribute but to be honest we get a rather meagre selection on this side of the world.
Top end California Cabernet and Chardonnay is excellent but expensive and while there are some big brand sub-€12 jug wines in our supermarkets, they can’t compete on quality with the wines being produced in Spain, Italy and the Languedoc - not to mention Chile and Argentina.
So this week instead I’m going to focus on California’s signature grape variety Zinfandel. We now know that Zinfandel is the same grape as Primitivo from Southern Italy and Tribidrag from Central Dalmatia in Croatia - this last being its oldest name so the one used in the indispensable grape encyclopedia ‘Wine Grapes’ by Jancis Robinson -et al-.
Zinfandel was likely introduced to the USA in the early 19th century with the name Zinfardel (sic) appearing in a Long Island nursery’s catalogue in 1829. The Primitivo connection was made in the 1960’s and the Croatian connection proven just in the 2000’s thanks to work done by the great Californian winemaker Mike Grgich with help from UC Davis and the University of Zagreb - they appropriately called their endeavour ‘Zinquest’.
The best wines from the grape are undoubtedly from battered old dry farmed vines in Lodi and Sonoma in California and I recommend two below, both are top of their class with sophistication and ageing potential (particularly the Ridge). Three others you could try include Ravenswood (World Wide Wines), Gnarly Head (O’Briens) and Predator (Independents) - all three are from Lodi. You will find lots of Primitivo from Puglia and Southern Italy and virtually all are worth a try.
I am loath to make a connection with ‘White Zinfandel’, those sweet pink rosé Zins but if you really must, watch for the Barefoot range in SuperValu and Tesco. Barefoot Wines also this month introduced a pair of Wine Seltzers, a Strawberry/Guava and a Pineapple/Passionfruit version (I prefer the former) - at 4% abv, they are drier than you might expect. ‘Hard Seltzer’ is all the rage with the kids these days.
Wine selections this week are five Tribidrag/Primitivo/Zinfandel wines, two of the very finest California can offer, three from Puglia, and a rogue Aglianico, my other favourite grape from Southern Italy.
Wines Under €15
Vigneti dei Salento I Muri Primitivo, Puglia, Italy - €14.99
Stockists: JJ O’Driscoll, World Wide Wines, Baggot St Wines, Vintry, Martins, Lilac, McHughs, www.wineonline.ie.
I mentioned this a year or two ago but a recent bottle downed with some Orecchiette pasta and a beef and Italian sausage ragù reminded me to tell you about it again. Ripe generous red berry and plum aromas with spice notes, fruity, crunchy and textured black cherry and blackberry fruits on the palate, supremely drinkable.
Pasqua Lapaccio Primitivo Salento IGT, Puglia, Italy - €14.99
Stockists: Ardkeen Stores, Independents.
Pasqua are a large but reliable Italian wine producer based in the Veneto but with vineyards all over Italy. This is a particularly fruit-driven version of Primitivo from the Salento in the heel of Italy, packed with cherry, plum and chocolate aromas, spice notes that begin on the nose and linger on the finish and big bright cherry fruits in the centre. A perfect pizza wine.
Cantina Tombacco Aglianico IGT Beneventano, Campania, Italy - €10-12.99
Stockist: SuperValu
An outlier this week but a grape that also deserves attention. Aglianico is likely an ancient Italian grape -not Greek as many assume) and is famed in Basilicata -A. del Vulture) and in Campania near Naples. Aglianico can be tannic and intense but this pleasingly drinkable one has bright juicy red cherry and black fruits with liquorice and smoky, spicy notes and a dollop of balancing structure and acidity
Wines Over €15
Ridge Lytton Springs, Dry Creek Valley, California 2016 - €49.00
Stockists: Whelehans, La Touche Greystones, James Nicholsons Crossgar
One of my favourite Californian wines but not one I get to drink as often as I used to given its price these days. A field blend dominated by Zinfandel (69% Zin plus Petite Sirah (23%), Carignan and Mourvèdre) - spice-tinged juicy dark fruits with fine balancing acidity, generous blackberry and sweet plums, and a long fruit-driven complex finish.
Seghesio Sonoma County Zinfandel 2015, California - €39.00
Stockists: JusdeVine, Redmonds, Martins, The Corkscrew, Wine Online, Florries Tramore, Blackrock Cellars, Clontarf Wines, Red Island Skerries, McHughs
This Zinfandel is from grapes grown in the Alexander Valley and Dry Creek Valley in Sonoma County with 85% Zinfandel rounded out with a little Petite Sirah -9%) and some Syrah and Carignan. Fine ripe red and black fruits with violet touches and spice notes, integrated tannins, finely balanced and supremely elegant. Benchmark.
Leone de Castris Villa Santera Primitivo di Manduria, 2018, Puglia, Italy - €22.95
Stockists: Vintry Rathgar
Manduria Commune on the western coast of Puglia is the spiritual home of Primitivo and the only Italian DOC dedicated to the grape. Aromas of spice (allspice, nutmeg), ripe fruits, supple and fruity with layers of blackcurrant and cherry with some grip and lingering dried plums on the finish. This lively plush wine is packed with flavour - also watch for this producer’s Salice Salentino."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-31009852.html,2020-07-07 22:00:00,Options if sufficient profit cannot be made from full-time farming,"Many younger farmers want to continue to have off-farm income.
For 2019, the average suckler farmer made €116 per acre.
Other beef rearing farms made €156 per acre.
Dairy farmers made €456 per acre; tillage farmers made €228 per acre; and sheep farmers made €125 per acre.
These are the results from the Teagasc National Farm Survey published last week.
You might forgive my conversion of the results published from hectare rates to acre rates.
The vast majority of farmers still deal in acres rather than hectares.
I don’t think I will ever start calculating how many bales of first cut silage was made per hectare, nor how much land rent costs are per hectare, albeit the transition to litres rather than gallons of milk was somewhat easier, especially when you get paid by the litre.
With land rental, if we chose to stick with hectares, given the heady land rent prices paid in certain spots of late, you’d be talking about rents north of €1,000 per hectare.
That would make land rental seem incredibly expensive.
While on the subject of land rent, based on these figures from the national farm survey, it’s hard to see how renting land can pay.
A survey of land rent prices carried out earlier this year showed that tillage land commands an average rental of just over €200 per acre.
Grazing land commands prices in the region of €170 per acre.
Given that the National Farm Survey shows returns of €228 per acre for tillage farmers and €116-€156 for beef farmers, the question arises of whether renting land is making your business any more profitable.
Tease this out a bit more.
Even if renting land makes you more profitable, does it leave you with more surplus cash?
The key point here is that profit does not directly translate into extra funds in the bank account.
Many farmers are left perplexed, when their accountant tells them they owe tax based on a profit which the farmer cannot comprehend.
A farmer might even have cause to question where has all this profit disappeared to?
From experience, land rent can often come at a much higher cost that you think. Increasing your farming platform can result in knock-on cash flow outgoings.
Renting 45 acres more to carry 30 extra milking cows, can entail a cost of hundreds of thousands.
Not alone do you need to buy or rear 30 cows and their followers, but you’ll also probably expand the milking parlour, increase the bulk tank size, extend the cubicle house, and invest in a bit more slurry storage.
Milking those extra cows has increased income and perhaps profits too, but the farm may be financially less cash flow buoyant, because capital expenditure and associated loans eat into cash flow.
So too the parable can be applied to renting an extra 100 acres of tillage.
You might be tempted to upgrade to a four-metre drill, a six furrow plough, along with 200 horsepower up front.
A person recently reminded me that all the country was farmed 50 years ago with Ford 4000s, three-furrow ploughs, and 10-foot combines, those being the state of the art at the time.
That’s not to say that progress should be halted and we should revert to those times.
It is a most worthy aspect of human nature that drives us to improve our lot.
But, when the returns from farming are so low, we need to answer a few questions honestly.
Is there anything I can do to make my farm more profitable?
Can I identify and park parts of my business which are not profitable?
Is there something else I can spend spare cash flow on, that will either give me greater enjoyment or more profits than expanding my existing operations?
Are there scheme or grants that I can avail of?
These are the questions facing every business owner regardless of sector, county or country.
The National Farm Survey is useful in reminding us that farming is a low margin business.
That doesn’t mean that we should turn our back on it or not invest in it.
Quite the contrary, we should instead look for the opportunities, and be focused on maximising income and reducing costs.
Farming must be more that just some form of physical therapy, the farm must work for you as much as you work for the farm.
Many younger farmers are willing to invest in improving facilities, such that they can continue to have off-farm income, knowing that the better-equipped farm can operate with substantially reduced labour input. When the hours spent farming become smaller, then the profit per hour worked can rise to a very decent level, and can be a nice top-up to a full-time off-farm income.
Average industrial wages climbed again in 2019, to a full-time equivalent of over €47,000.
This equates to about €23 per hour.
So, having a full-time job plus an enjoyable, profitable, farming operation sideline, might be the way forward for this and future generations, if sufficient profits cannot be made from full-time farming."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40013648.html,2020-07-08 21:38:00,"Denis Lehane: Out here in the country, 19 is considered old for a provisional licence","While our new Minister for Agriculture, Barry Cowen, may have hit the ground running, you can’t say the same about his driving.
While failing the breathalyser test is never a good thing, having a provisional licence at 49 is most bizarre.
Out here in the country, to have a provisional licence at 19 would be considered old, never mind 49!
Let's just hope he can steer the farming ship with a little more care.
Speaking of care, ICOS marts executive Ray Doyle has called on Mr Cowen to consider as a matter of urgency a dedicated grant aid package for livestock marts, after Covid-19 mart closures “threatened the viability of marts across the country”.
“Livestock marts were one of the only agri-related businesses to have their businesses closed by government during the Covid 19 restrictions during the busiest time of the year for all marts,” Mr Doyle said.
Yes, at one stage we had farmers’ markets open to the public, while cattle marts remained closed to farmers. I’d like to know who made that call.
As for government compensation now in the form of a financial package for marts, I’d say there’s about as much chance of that as blood from a turnip.
The marts should never have closed in the first place. That’s the fly in this particular ointment.
The horse should never have bolted, and running after him now to try and put a saddle on his back is an exercise in futility.
Onto to those marts struggling to find their feet again, and our weekly catalogue of mart reports.
We begin with Kilmallock Mart, where there was good news on Monday, at least for sellers.
Denis Kirby of Kilmallock Mart reported, “Happy sellers are cashing in here at Kilmallock Mart.

“The trade is very strong for all types of stock. It is a sellers’ market, with sellers being pleasantly surprised with their prices.
“Bullocks on Monday sold for up to €2.40 per kg.
“A small selection of young bulls made up to €1,000 each or €2.56 per kg.”

Overall mart trade
Cattle market trading for the week ending Tuesday, July 7 had bullocks averaging €2/kg, dairy stock on €1,525.
Dry cows were on €1.55/kg.
Heifers were averaging €2.02/kg, suckler cows at €3.18/kg or €1,160 per lot.
Weanling bulls at €2.04/kg and weanling heifers at €2.16/kg. Calves for the week were making €234 a head (source www.livestock-live.com)."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40016495.html,2020-07-14 23:07:00,Far from usual July beef trade,"Market demand for beef has strengthened prices at factories this week for the strong intake of cattle.
Processors have been taking in over 37,000 head per week, more akin to an autumn supply than that of mid-July.
At that level of intake, downward pressure on prices is usually the outcome. Instead, factory agents are being put under pressure to maintain the strong supply of cattle, and their bosses are paying up to ensure they get sufficient stock ,which adds up to very strange times in the beef market, at this normally low point of the year for intake requirements.
Forecasting the trade has always been hazardous, but who’d have thought that in mid-July the cattle supply would be so high, with the price still going in the right direction for finishers?
The first decline in weeks of intakes at factories was seen last week, falling back to 35,758 head, but that still beats the same week last year by 1,000 head.
The steer supply remained strong at 13,546 head, almost 2,000 ahead of 2019, heifers at 9,437 were slightly lower than 2019. Cows continued strong at 9,524, but young bulls are well behind last year, at 2,326.
The quoted base for steers is generally 365c/kg this week, but an increasing percentage are making up to 370c, which has become the new cut-off point on price.
The trading pattern is similar for heifers, being quoted for at a base of 370c, but with a good measure of 375c being paid.
There are reports of some processors trying to get both steers and heifers for less than these base prices, but without much success, as few farmers are willing to part with stock cheaply, while the grass is growing well on their farms.
Most of the young bulls are making 360c for R-grade. Some processors quote back at 355c; in general, interest from the factories for young bulls is not exciting, with the intake well down on 2019.
The cow trade has steadied. In general, the top price for the better quality R-grade cow is between 315 and 320 cents/kg this week. At the other end, P-grade cows are making 280c-290c/kg, and Os are at 29c0-300c."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40016501.html,2020-07-15 21:34:00,"A good week for making hay and selling cattle, as dry cow prices soar in Skibbereen","While it might be said that there is never a good time to sell cattle, I believe this week wouldn't be the worst. The marts are back, albeit tethered like a well spancilled old goat. The weather seems promising enough. The factory trade is showing signs of life. But most importantly of all, there is confidence. Confidence, the greatest driver of all in farming, and life, is back in the cattle business.
While some plucky farmers have hay down and are hoping to transform it into glorious hay bales before the week is out, others (perhaps less ambitious) are visiting the marts, cheque book in hand hoping to surprise the folks back home by purchasing a few nice cattle.
And whatever about the hay being saved, cattle are being purchased. Our mart trade for cattle is thriving with cattle marts like Skibbereen (where I was on Friday) having a nice selection on offer to suit the discerning buyer.
In Skibbereen on Friday dry cows were a super trade selling from €200 to €665 with the kilo or up to €2/kg. There was a strong trade for bullocks and heifers, bullocks made from €300 to €750 with the kilo. Heifers made up to €770 with their weight.
But that's not all from the west Cork mart, in Skibb tomorrow, Friday, the mart will be holding a special sale for Autumn born weanlings. With the mart receiving strong inquires for weanlings at present, it's sure to be a lively sale.

Irish Farmers Association president Tim Cullinan congratulated the new minister but said that he must ""hit the ground running"".
“We look forward to working with the new Minister to ensure that we harness the full potential of our farming sector,” he said.
“The EU Council on Friday and Saturday where the EU and CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] budgets for the next seven years will be discussed is absolutely critical for Irish farming.""
It is ""vital"" that the new Minister stresses the importance of this to the Taoiseach who will be representing Ireland at the meeting, he said.
Mr Cullinane also called for the urgent distribution of the €50m COVID beef payment to farmers.
President of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association Edmond Phelan also welcomed Mr Calleary's appointment as Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine. 
“ICSA looks forward to forging a strong working relationship with Minister Calleary with a focus on delivering economic sustainability to cattle and sheep farmers along with environmental benefits to all,” he said.   
A suckler based application for EU Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) is ""vital"" for the sector's survival, he said. 
""Suckler beef must be developed and promoted as a special high value product it is vital to farmers in the west of Ireland especially the Ministers own constituency, and ICSA will be vigorously opposing the inclusion of all beef in the pursuit of such a protected status.” 
Mr Phelan called for the minister to appoint a Food Ombudsman ""as a priority"" to deliver ""total transparency"" in the food chain and to ensure that neither processor nor retailer can abuse their positions. 
""Farmers are continuously striving to be more efficient but every incremental gain in efficiency is stolen by an unregulated processing and retailing sector driving down farmgate price, and this must change,” he said.
He also called for more funding for new and existing environmental schemes like the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS). 
“A new REPS type scheme is also a must. ICSA is calling for a trebling of the current GLAS budget to facilitate such a scheme, given the numbers of farmers it would hope to attract. 
""An annual budget of €750m, or three times the current GLAS budget, would be the minimum required. It is no longer acceptable to expect farmers to do more on climate change without the resources to do so.” 
Mr Phelan also called for a ""new and improved"" Sheep Welfare Scheme and called for more funding for the sector from next year. 
""The sheep sector has not been supported enough and viability within the sector has become a major issue and can no longer be ignored.”"

In selected restaurants in selected cities, customers will be able to buy burgers from cattle that were fed lemongrass, to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
It is true that various additives can reduce methane production by cattle, particularly if they are reared indoors.
But, overall, Burger King has only added to the huge amount of misinformation available globally on this topic.
One would have expected them to know more about beef.
Their video shows dairy cows with a flatulence problem from the rear end, so anyone who knows something about the subject won’t expect to be enlightened — because nearly all methane from enteric emissions come from the front end of a cow, and beef is more likely to come from beef animals than dairy cows.
Burger King promised beef from cattle that are 33% less gassy on average, because lemongrass (a plant easily grown in hot climates, with medicinal properties, a favourite ingredient in Asian cooking) was added to their diets to reduce methane emissions.
However, Burger King has jumped the gun, the research behind the claimed methane reduction for lemongrass hasn’t yet gone through the rigorous peer review necessary for scientifically proven findings.
Burger King has particularly annoyed the beef industry in its home country, the United States, by quoting a United Nations figure of cattle globally being responsible for about 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
But animals in the US account for only about 4% of US emissions, according to the country’s Environmental Protection Agency (which says US agriculture and land use absorbs more greenhouse gases than it produces).
It is inefficient livestock production in the world’s developing countries that generates most of the 14.5%.
Direct gas emissions from US livestock declined 11.3% since 1961, while livestock production more than doubled.
Livestock numbers are at a historic low in the US, but it produces 20% of the world’s beef from just 6.2% of the world’s cattle, half the amount of India and Brazil.
In Mexico, it takes almost two cows to equal the milk production of one American cow.
In India, nine cows are required.
If the rest of the world’s cattle producers were as efficient as those in the US, 64% fewer cattle could produce the world’s current beef supply.

Scientists say the focus should be on helping developing nations transition to more efficient systems.
Europe scores well, with recent scientific studies indicating it is the only region globally where methane emissions have fallen between 2000 and 2017, thanks in part in greater efficiency in agriculture, and reduced emissions from chemical manufacturing.
Methane also comes from landfills, and leaky oil and gas pipelines and wells.
In contrast, methane from cattle (and wetlands) is part of nature.
Plants capture carbon from the atmosphere when they grow, which is eaten by ruminant animals, that in turn release methane (made of carbon and hydrogen) back to the atmosphere, where it decays over 10 years.
Two hundred years ago, it was mostly buffalo (including 60 million in the US alone), now ruminant animals are domesticated for meat and milk production.
Eminent scientists believe that the global warming potential of a greenhouse gas is over-estimated for methane and other short-lived gases.
Like all science, it’s not as simple as it is portrayed in the millions of articles by a media which seems fascinated with animals causing global warming.
As for a Burger King video, don’t expect scientific analysis, which is unfortunate, because it is likely to be seen by millions more people than a scientific article, and will not add to public knowledge of a complex issue which could determine the future of farming.
Unfortunately, there are too many vested interests at work for well-informed public knowledge.
There’s a propaganda battle going on, with the fossil fuel industry, for example, eager to mask the fact that it is the biggest cause by far of global warming.
Meanwhile, the fake meat industry has not been slow to add to the global warming finger-pointing at the real meat industry.
It has worked well for them.
After a stock market launch at $25, the Beyond Meat plant-based meat substitute producer’s share price rose to $239.71 in two months.
Investors saw its potential to make inroads in the traditional meat industry’s annual turnover of $1.4 trillion.
Misinformed bad press for real meat, support from the biggest fast-food restaurants, and celebrity endorsements, have helped make Beyond Meat a profitable company.
Will this help climate mitigation, as many Beyond Meat consumers may hope for?
Probably not, because making fake meat requires a huge amount of the fossil fuels which are the biggest cause by far of global warming. A main ingredient in Beyond Meat is pea protein, shipped from all over the world, including China and Europe, to US ports, and then to a manufacturing facility in Missouri. There, ingredients are blended, heated, cooled, pressurised, and frozen, before being shipped to co-manufacturers who complete production and packaging.
That adds up to a lot of greenhouse gas emissions compared to eating locally produced real meat.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40017830.html,2020-07-17 22:32:00,Advice for beef farmers: Why don’t more buy grain off the combine?,"Combines started rolling last weekend in some parts of the country. Winter barley is obviously the first crop to be cutb and most of it will be fit to cut by the weekend.
Spring crops are still four or five weeks from cutting, but in general have improved significantly since the rain came after the mini drought.
Forage and concentrate planning
Every year I do feed budgets for customers and I always try to encourage them to consider locally grown cereals as a means of reducing production costs while also helping to boost animal performance.
This model must be encouraged and can mean a better margin for those growing the grain, while also reducing costs for end users feeding the grain.
Irish feed for Irish cattle
Native Irish cereals are the most versatile high energy feeds that farmers can grow or buy.
Margins are tight in beef, so what can you do to make savings and enhance animal performance?
Traditionally, grain was dried or stored on air at moistures of 18% or lower. New technologies developed over the last number of years regarding additive type, processing methods, and storage options have left native grain as the most cost-competitive concentrate feed source available for all classes of livestock.
This is as relevant in 2020 as any other year. No matter what the price is off the combine, the same mark-up per tonne is added to it by the time it is dried, stored, processed and delivered back out to you.
That results in you making the same saving per tonne, regardless of whether the price of green grain is high or low off the combine.
Dairy and beef farmers that store their own grain or purchase grain in whatever form from neighbouring cereal farmers can make significant savings (€60/€70/t) in their winter concentrate costs. Irish barley, wheat, oats and triticale offer outstanding quality and value and provide top class energy for stock in a correctly balanced diet.

Storage options
Various treatment and storage options are available to both the producer and end user this harvest. Every process has its merits. The process you choose should be based on your animal’s requirements in relation to grain being used, the volume to be fed, the protein requirement, other available feeds and required animal performance.
With all grain processing options, seek expert advice when considering which one is best for you and your livestock this winter.
This applies to feed value, ease of storage, operator safety, and reliability of the process. Most over-think storing of grain, and can often be talked out of doing it, for the most petty of reasons.
But the expertise is out there to guide you through each process. Do the sums and see how much your farm could potentially save.
All treatments are appropriate for barley, wheat, triticale, and oats.
Here are the options for moist grain (28%-35% moisture). Next week, options for mature grain (zero green material).
Crimped grain
Not as common as in the past, because it can be a little more difficult to keep stable in clamps, and is quite acidic, which can lead to digestive upsets. The harvest window is narrow if crops ripen quickly. Grain moisture should be 25%-35%, extra careis needed under 30%.
The grain is crimped and additive applied; use a proven additive to suit the particular moisture content, which aids fermentation and reduces heating at feed-out.
Prompt ensiling within 24 hours of harvesting, proper rolling, compacting and covering/sealing are essential. Create a narrow pit face where possible, proper pit face management is critical.
When fermented, the grain stabilises at pH 4-4.5 and is ready for feeding.
It can’t be included in meal premixes due to its high moisture content, which can be an inconvenience when space is limited.
It is highly susceptible to attack from birds and vermin. Storage losses can be 2%-3%. The storage period is four to six months.
Feed rates: dairy up to 4kg, beef up to 8kg.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40019714.html,2020-07-21 21:30:00,Hereford and Angus favoured by processors in improved beef trade,"Strong market demand for beef continues to drive the trade for cattle at factories this week, with prices rising gradually.
While some finishers say an extra 5 cents/kg is available for both steers and heifers this week, the general consensus is more muted.
“Yes, the factories are still anxious to get more cattle, but they are very cautious about agreeing to pay more for them unless they are really under pressure to get them” one source explained.
“There is a policy in the sector now that they’re concerned that the market could overheat, from their point of view at least, and they are desperately trying to hold a cap on what they pay for cattle.”
The reality is that up to 370 cents/kg is being paid as the base for steers this week, but it is not available just for the asking, and a good percentage of stock is still moving on a price base of 365 cents/kg.
The same applies to heifers, with a general base quote of 370 cents/kg.

Steady lamb trade, prices maintained
Up to 375 cents/kg is being paid to larger finishers who are regular suppliers with more power to negotiate on price.
Interest from processors is strongest for Hereford and Angus crosses in both steers and heifers, for which most processors pay a breed premium, as the marketing done by both these breed groups shows dividends for finishers.
Some processors are willing to stretch their buying power to the upper limits to get these animals currently, which is a very positive indicator of the market demand for both from consumers.
Meanwhile, good weather conditions for farming has taken pressure off finishers to sell stock, and processors have to work a bit harder to get cattle moving.
Prices for young bulls continue to track steer prices at a discount of 5-10 cents/kg, with the base for Rs at 360-365 cents/kg, and the intake continuing at 35-45% behind the 2019 level.
Cow numbers going into the factories are continuing at a high level, but so also is the demand, resulting in prices edging upward to 320 cents/kg and some making 330 cents/kg this week for R-grade cows.
Os are making up to 310-315 cents/kg, while the improved trade has also raised the return for P-grade cows, to 290-300 cents/kg.

Quality throughout is one of the main attractions of this farm. Not only does it possess some of the finest grassland in the area, it also comes with good quality outbuildings and a home of superb quality.
The property is located in the townland of Fort East, 5.5km north of Charleville, Co Cork; 14km west of Kilmallock; and roughly halfway between Limerick and Mallow (each about 33km to the north and south).
“All the land has been re-seeded over the last number of years,” says selling agent John O’Connell, “with a central passageway through it, excellent quality land. It’s well located in terms of access to main roads and motorways.”
In addition, there is a home of high quality that is befitting of the class of land for sale here.
Accommodation includes an entrance hallway, kitchen, walk-in hotpress, sitting room, utility room and three bedrooms.
The condition of the property is excellent throughout, according to the selling agents, and it features solar panel heating, which saves on fuel costs.
As if that weren’t enough, the package is completed by an excellent collection of out buildings and out-offices. These include slatted sheds, stables, hay barns and workshops. “The outbuildings are in excellent condition,” says John, “they’ve all been built in the last ten years or so.”
Although the farm doesn’t have road frontage, access to the property is via an uncomplicated and well- established right of way.
There are also entitlements coming with the farm, further details of which can be obtained from the agents.
The price guide of €720,000 is a realistic figure, considering the value of the overall package on offer.
Interest has been good so far, according to the agents.
In short, this is a farm that will possibly appeal more to the beef farmer, hobby farmer, or the equestrian farmer, rather than to a dairying operation, but time will tell over the coming weeks and months.

Richard Bruton 'amazed' by the reaction to his toned abs"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40024928.html,2020-07-30 22:27:00,Report from the cattle marts: Strange pandemic days continue in life and at the mart,"Emma, the youngest in this house, mentioned the other day that we have “really strange weather”.
Our nine-year-old said: “It’s raining one minute, and then it’s OK.”
And while Emma was right with regards to the weather, it’s not the only thing that’s strange.
Since the dawn of Covid-19 the world, and ourselves, have become very strange.
We now shy away from the handshake. We run a mile from the unannounced sneeze. Kissing is practically forbidden. Most faces are covered, as we try and protect ourselves from the dreaded fear of meeting another human being.
Our movements are being curtailed. We now have a green list. But those who gave us the list tell us they’d actually prefer if we didn’t go anywhere at all! What was the point in the green list so? What a waste of time and energy.
We have a world of biologists, chemists, and scientific geniuses of every description. Billions each year are invested in the pharmaceutical industry. An industry housed in grand buildings with grand names, yet none with a cure for the sneezing bug. It’s a puzzle still beyond the reach of all. Where are our Louis Pasteurs and Marie Curies?
Even the marts have changed. We now operate two systems of bidding, in reality, and in the ether.
This week I heard from two farmers with two concerns about online bidding.
The first voiced the suggestion that there could be the possibility of ‘ghost bidding’ happening in the marts. This is the practice whereby an auctioneer accepts a bid not from the ring or online, but from his imagination. A fictitious bid, in other words. A bid used to pump on a trade, in a market already pumped up enough.
Another farmer voiced a concern that his online bid at a certain point was not being taken.
That the eyes of the auctioneer turned away, ignored his bid, to give another chap a chance.
Whether such claims are accurate, it’s not for me to decide.
It’s up to the farmers themselves to voice a complaint to the marts in question.
All I do know is that in these strange days at the mart, we were never more dependent on the honesty of the auctioneer. I know a lot of mart auctioneers, honourable men, so it is very important for their sake that if any weeds or bad apples are in the profession, they are plucked out and tossed to the side. We need a level playing field for all, in these strange times.
And so to the marts we go, where Denis Kirby of GVM reported another fine sale of cattle this week. “Here at Kilmallock, we had a total of 700 stock on offer, with some exceptional prices made.
“Also, on Saturday last, lots from the Curraghtarsna Angus herd sold for up to €4,900, with buyers from as far away as Donegal and Cavan purchasing Angus stock.”
Earlier this week, on Monday, bullocks at Kilmallock sold for up to €1,460 each, or €2.43 per kg. On Wednesday, dry cows sold for up to €1,340 a head, or €2.02 per kg. Heifers made up to €1,430 each, or €2.44 per kg.

Tillage farmer incomes averaged over €40,000 in 2018 and about €33,000 last year, but could slump to a level this year only matched in the past decade by the low point in 2014.
Adverse weather last winter left growers with no choice to increase their area allocated to typically lower yielding and less profitable spring crops in 2020. And drought at a critical stage in crop development has further depressed grain yield prospects.
Teagasc predicts harvest prices will increase for wheat (by 15%), but expects very little change in feed barley prices.
Price gains are unlikely to be sufficient to offset significant cereal acreage and yield reductions this harvest.
Straw prices are expected to increase, but straw value on tillage farms will still fall, due to much reduced straw volume.
Nor will lower input expenditure be sufficient to prevent a poor year for grain growers.
A 20% decrease in cereal tonnage is predicted, compared to 2019, but southern counties may escape the worst effects, having had satisfactory regional results for the winter barley harvest so far.
The projections for 2020 farmer earnings come in this week’s Mid Year Outlook produced by Teagasc economists.
Overall, fears of a sharp Covid-19 related drop in Irish farm incomes in 2020 seem to have been averted, following a gradual recovery in commodity prices and the provision of additional supports to the sector, according to Teagasc.
In the spring, it appeared that the impact on the agricultural incomes could be quite severe, but additional government supports for the beef sector, price stabilising payments from milk processors, and a quicker than anticipated recovery in dairy and beef prices, have helped farmers.
Farmers have also benefited in 2020 from lower feed, fertiliser and energy prices, relative to 2019. Therefore, production costs are likely to fall slightly on dairy, cattle and sheep farms, due to the lower input prices and the relatively normal levels of input usage.
The dairy cow population has continued to increase in 2020, and a further increase in Irish milk production of 3-4% is likely, if normal weather persists through the rest of the grazing season. Average dairy farm income could be close to the €67,000 achieved in 2019.
While cattle prices have recovered somewhat, 2020 will remain a challenging year for cattle farmers. The average income on cattle rearing farms is forecast to increase by 5% in 2020, but is expected to fall by 4% on other cattle farms.
Incomes on sheep farms are set to increase by more than 15% in 2020.
Overall, while the worst-case impact of COVID-19 on the agricultural sector in Ireland would appear to have been avoided, farm incomes in 2020 are still likely to be lower than would have been anticipated at the outset of the year, according to Teagasc economists.
n  Meanwhile, the Central Statistics Office’s final estimate of operating surplus (income) in agriculture for 2019 showed an annual increase of €110.7m (up 3.8%).
The main factor contributing to this change was a decrease of €390.5m (6.5%) in expenditure on farm inputs.
Despite an increase of 3.6% in the volume of goods produced, falling prices resulted in the value of goods decreasing by €258.0m (3.1%).
While the volume of crops produced by Irish farmers increased 7.8%, lower prices resulted in the value of crops falling by €228.9m (10.8%)..
Despite the volume of milk production increasing by 5.1%, lower prices resulted in the value of milk increasing by just €45.2m (1.8%).
Although the volume of cattle produced increased by 1.9%, lower prices resulted in the value of cattle decreasing by €111.1m (4.9%).
While there was very little change in the volume of pigs produced in 2019, large price increases resulted in the value of pig production increasing by €84m (18.3%)."

According to the selling agent, Martin O’Donovan of Treaty Auctioneers in Newcastle West, this represents an attractive opportunity: “It’s good fattening land,” says Martin.
“It’s all in grass and there are a number of sheds, a farmyard and a pit. The outbuildings aren’t new but they’re in good condition.”
The property, located in the townland of Gurtskeagh, is well fenced, he adds, and there is a good electricity and water supply.
“There’s good road access too. Castlemahon would be the nearest village, and Newcastle West is close by as well. It’s between Newcastle West and Charleville.”
It’s in an area dominated by dairying but with a good degree of beef cattle activity too, so the local demand for good grassland is keen.
“There’s a good level of interest so far,” says Martin, “and we’ve had a good number of calls about it over the last few weeks.”
There aren’t any entitlements going with the land, and the price expectation is in line with prices achieved in recent times by similar blocks of land.
“We’d be hoping that it would achieve in and around €10,000 per acre,” says Martin. “It will be sold in one lot, we won’t be splitting it up.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40027700.html,2020-08-05 15:06:00,Beef cattle throughput expected by Bord Bia to remain tight,"The beef trade at factories has become tougher this week with finishers finding it harder to secure the prices of recent weeks for their cattle, as processors “dig in”.
Late July and early August usually sees processors trying to shape the trade to their advantage for the increased autumn throughput, a process made harder for them this year by strong demand for beef restricting their scope to adjust prices.
Over the past 10 days or so, processors were showing signs of concern that the trade could overheat.
But with apparent demand for all the stock they could get their hands on, it was very difficult for them to pull prices.
Steers are still being quoted for on a general base price of 370 cents/kg this week, and factory agents appear to be under direction to stick as close as possible to that target.
Some stock had been bought forward from last week on a base of 375 cents/kg.
There’s a clear signal from processors that they are tightening up on prices.
Prices for heifers are also being quoted at a base of 370 cents/kg this week by a number of processors, with an overall price range quoted of 370-375 cents/kg.
It’s a bit easier to get a few cents more for heifers, than for steers.
Demand is still strong for Angus and Hereford crosses, with a breed premium of 15-20 cents/kg strengthening the returns.
While the number of young bulls being slaughtered continues well below last year’s level, prices have tightened further, in line with the steer price trend.
R-grade young bulls are generally quoted for at 360 cents/kg, with up to 365 cents/kg being paid, and O-grade ranging from 340 to 350 cents/kg.
The cow trade appears to be the one category not subject to downward price pressure this week.
The best of the R-grade cows are making up to 330 cents/kg, with prices ranging from 320 cents/kg upwards.
O-grades are worth 300-310 cents/kg, and P-grades are making 290-300 cents/kg.
The kill last week of 35,267 is more than 5,000 higher than 12 months previously, but is not comparable because the 2019 week included the bank holiday. There was a strong supply of steers last week at 16,500 head, with 9,346 heifers and 7,019 cows.
The intake of young bulls, with only 1,577 last week, continues well behind last year.
Despite a 3% decrease in throughput for the first 30 weeks of 2020, cattle throughput is expected by Bord Bia to remain tight.
The 1,012,207 animals processed up to the week ending July 26 was 31,382 behind the corresponding period in 2019."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/healthandwellbeing/arid-40026548.html,2020-08-07 06:00:00,Eating to save the planet: Is it time to stop eating joints of beef for Sunday lunch?,"IS it time to stop eating hamburgers, steak dinners, as well as joints of beef for Sunday lunch? This is the question being asked by climate change activists who claim that beef farming is harming the planet.
Beef farming has a long history in Ireland. The first cows arrived here from mainland Europe an estimated 6,000 years ago and they have been central to our economy ever since.
In early Ireland, wealth was measured by how many cattle you owned. Fast-forward to today and the country’s 109,400 cattle farmers produce more than 550,000 tonnes of beef every year. In 2018 alone, this amounted to over €2.4bn in exports.

This is not the sector’s only cash cow. That same year, dairy exports brought in a further €4bn.
We do not just export beef. We eat lots of it too. We currently consume 19kg of beef per person per year. This is much higher than the European average of 10.7kg and Britain's average of 11.8kg.
However, we are not as carnivorous as Americans, who consume 26.7kg, or Uruguayans, who consume the most beef in the world at a staggering rate of more than 50kg per person every year.
All of this beef-eating comes at an environmental cost. Cattle produce methane, through their digestive processes. Methane is 28 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2 and, with each burp, they release it into the atmosphere. If the global cattle population (989,030,000 in 2019) was considered a country, they would be the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter.
Nitrous oxide is another byproduct of cattle farming and, given that it is 265 times more potent than CO2, it causes even more damage to the environment.
The science is irrefutable: Beef emits more greenhouse gases per kg of food produced than any other food product. According to a scale devised by Our World in Data, an organisation that presents existing research in an accessible manner, its score is 60 units of greenhouse gas emissions. The next highest on the scale is lamb at 24 units. Chicken scores 6 units and fish ranges from 3-5 units, depending on whether it is farmed or not.
Climate-change activists are calling for Irish beef farming to change. “Ireland’s emission profile has high levels of methane and nitrous oxide,” says Catherine Devitt, policy co-ordinator with the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition, a group of more than 30 organisations that are campaigning to ensure Ireland does its fair share to tackle the causes and consequences of climate change. 
“That comes from how we farm. We have to change our farming policy and we have to do it now.” 
PLANT-BASED DIET 
It makes sense to cut back on beef for health reasons too. Last year, a study by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found that eating more plants and less meat reduced the risk of cardiovascular conditions such as stroke, heart attack, and heart failure by 16%. It lowered the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by 32%, and the risk of early death from any cause by 18%.
Paula Mee: 'A lean cut of red meat is a nutrient-rich food. Irish cattle graze on grass for 300 days a year, and the meat has a fuller, meatier flavour.'
Another study from Harvard concluded that eating a balanced plant-based diet lowered the risk of developing type-2 diabetes and reduced blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, weight, and systematic inflammation.
The science is not quite so clear-cut, says dietitian Paula Mee. “A lean cut of red meat is a nutrient-rich food,” she says. “Irish cattle graze on grass for 300 days a year, and the meat has a fuller, meatier flavour, with more omega-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin A, B vitamins, zinc, copper, magnesium, potassium, and phosphate.” 
The problem is that most of us do not eat lean red meat. “We eat cheaper processed meats such as burgers that are higher in saturated fats, additives, and salt,” says Mee. 
“That is what raises blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.” 
She recommends limiting red and processed meat to under 500g of cooked meat per week. 
In general, most of us eat enough or even too much protein.  However, we have an inadequate intake of fibre. So eating more plant-based proteins instead of red or processed meat could improve people’s health.
In a report last year for the EAT Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, and Health, 30 of the world’s top scientists looked at how best to meet the challenge of feeding a growing global population. They concluded that the consumption of animal products needed to drop by 50% if greenhouse-gas emissions were to be reduced while ensuring everyone was adequately fed.
Their recommendations generated heated discussion. When then-taoiseach Leo Varadkar admitted he was cutting back on red meat, he was criticised by lobbyists for the agricultural industry and by committed carnivores. 
Why is it that even when we are presented with evidence that a plant-based diet is better for us and for the planet, we are still reluctant to give up our burgers? We're surrounded by viable alternatives. “When you remove meat from the plate, there is so much that can replace it,” says Mee. 
“Brown rice with beans or brown bread with hummus can give you as much protein as a piece of meat.” 
It could be that social customs have more of a role to play. “We are creatures of habit and change can be a slow process,” says Mee.
GROWING SUSTAINABILITY 
Ireland’s farmers are understandably concerned about what they perceive as a threat to their livelihoods. They refer to UN projections of global demand for beef growing by 10% by 2020 and claim it would be better if that beef were produced here rather than in South America where it would lead to further deforestation of the rainforest.
“A 2013 UN report showed that the greenhouse-gas emissions intensity of beef produced in western Europe is more than 50% lower than the global average,” says Eric Donald, head of communications at Teagasc. “Contracting production in a region where greenhouse-gas emissions are relatively low would be counter-productive to global efforts to curb those emissions.” 
While it may not agree with climate change activists on what needs to be done in the beef sector, Teagasc is working to improve the sustainability of Irish farms.  “Our Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advice Programme helps farmers with improving soil fertility and reducing nitrogen fertiliser use to lower greenhouse-gas emissions as well as advising on other areas of sustainability,” says Donald.

Some farmers have always done this. John Brennan is the manager of Leitrim Organic Farmers' Network and a member of Talamh Beo, an organisation of farmers working for change in our food and agricultural system. He is also an organic cattle and sheep farmer.
“I farm traditional native cattle that feed in the fields,” he says. “I don’t apply nitrogen-based fertiliser or agrichemicals to the soil, and I don’t use GMO feed.” 
Brennan believes the reason most farmers do not farm like this is because they are required to mass-produce beef for world markets. “Cheap prices encourage farmers to farm more intensively and that leads to environmental degradation,” he says. “Instead, we should be adding value to our meat and selling lower volumes at higher prices to Irish and neighbouring markets.”
This would benefit everyone, he says.  
Farmers would receive a fairer price for their produce, and it would be good for the health of the planet.
FARM TO FORK
The Green Party’s Pippa Hackett is the Minister for State for Land Use and Biodiversity. Under the programme for government, she hopes to effect the change that is needed in the beef sector.
“Ireland has a distinct advantage over other countries when it comes to producing beef and milk, but this must not be at the expense of our environment,” she says. “The new Government is planning its future agri-food strategy and it will be informed by the recent EU Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies as well as by the commitment we have made to attaining a minimum 7% reduction in greenhouse gases per annum over the next ten years.”
 While the Climate Change Coalition is in favour of the Farm to Fork strategy, it is disappointed that no firm commitments have been made to reverse the increase in methane and nitrous oxide emissions.
Other countries have taken a stronger stance, says Devitt. 
The Netherlands imposed limits on how much fertiliser farmers could apply, for example. That’s something we called on the government to do but they didn’t.
While the government lags behind, a growing number of people are making lifestyle changes for the sake of the environment. A Bord Bia survey in 2018 found that 8% of Irish people were now vegetarian and a further 2% vegan.
Questions have been asked regarding the sustainability of vegan diets. After all, nut butters travel across the world to reach Irish supermarket shelves. Yet, beef emissions still dwarf nut-butter emissions, even when transportation is taken into account. This is because most food that is transported over long distances is carried by ships that carry huge loads.
Before you conclude that veganism is your only option, remember that not even the authors of the EAT Lancet Commission suggested that meat-eating had to be an all-or-nothing situation.
You could make smaller changes such as taking part in Meatless Mondays. This campaign urges people to cut meat for one day a week in order to gradually make the shift from meat-heavy diets.
As farmer John Brennan says: ""We must eat less meat, but better.”

While market demand for beef continues very strong, and processors have been handling larger throughputs than ever for this time of the year, it is clear that processors want to pull back the prices being paid.
The initial target of the factory bosses is to cut prices by 5 cents/kg for all prime beef cattle. Processors want to shape the trade for the big autumn kill in their favour, a process which they usually initiate from early August.
Many of them have reduced the quoted base price for steers to 365 cents/kg this week.
Most of the stock purchased forward last week were bought on a price base of 370 cents/kg.
But the intention is that cattle purchased this week are coming in as close as possible to 365 cents/kg.
However, some deals with processors are continuing this week for a base of 370 cents/kg for steers, but this is clearly getting much harder to achieve, with processors determined to tighten up on the payout.
Nevertheless, there are a few reports of 375 cents/kg being agreed, where there is extra market pressure on processors to get beef cattle.
The situation with the heifer trade is similar.

Teagasc Fodder Survey: 10% of farms have deficits
Most processors offer a base of 370 cents/kg this week, but deals returning 375 cents/kg are being achieved, and there are a few reports of up to 380 cents/kg.
Prices for young bulls trail the steer price, at a deficit of 5-15 cents/kg, with R-grade being quoted for at 350-360 cents/kg.
The young bull intake at factories continues well behind the 2019 level.
While the trade for cows has eased a shade, there is still good demand and the throughput continues strong.
Better quality R-grade cows are still worth up to 320 cents/kg, while O-grade make ing up to 305 cents/kg and, in some deals, 310 cents/kg is being paid.
The Ps, depending on quality, can range from 285 to 295 cent/kg.
After excellent grass growth since early June, cattle weights and kill outs are satisfactory, which is some compensation to finishers for relatively low prices.
The intake for last week slipped to 31,838 head, still a strong kill for the shorter bank holiday week.
There were 14,941 steers and 8,742 heifers. T
Cows accounted for 6,121, and the kill included 1,386 young bulls.

The investigation by China’s commerce ministry will look at imports of wine from Australia in containers of two litres or less in 2019, the ministry said, and examine any damage to the domestic wine industry from 2015 to 2019.
The Chinese Alcoholic Drinks Association requested the inquiry, asking the regulator to look into 10 Australian wine producers, including Treasury Wine Estates, the maker of Penfolds and Accolade wines.
Shares of Treasury, the world’s biggest standalone winemaker, fell up to 20% on worries at the prospect of an import tax on Australian wine.
In a statement, the company said it would cooperate with any requests for information from the authorities and remained committed to China as a “priority market”.
The investigation comes against a backdrop of increasing tension between the countries after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.

China is the top market for Australian wine exports and is also Australia’s largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth €143bn last year.
Beijing recently imposed dumping tariffs on Australian barley, suspended some beef imports, and told Chinese students and tourists it was not safe to travel to Australia because of accusations of racism.
Australia’s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, called the investigation “very disappointing and perplexing” and said China was also considering a request to investigate countervailing duties, an import tax imposed to prevent dumping or counter export subsidies.
China will carry out the investigation in a “fair and just way, according to the law,” said Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesman. He rejected suggestions it was politically motivated.
The China Alcoholic Drinks Association said Australian wine producers had cut prices and were taking market share from local companies. China’s imports of Australian wine more than doubled to 12.08 million litres between 2015 and 2019, the association said. 
Over the same period, the market share of domestic wine fell from over 74% to around 49%, it said. Australian industry figures show it sells more wine to China than France.

No-one has it easy, many have it tough, and some very tough indeed. From new-born baby to great grand-parents, everybody's life has been changed..changed utterly. Adapting to such fundamental change is a big ask -- a searching question we have to pose directly to ourselves, but imbued with an authentic empathy for all others within our communal collective.
In the variable and vulnerable vortex of anxiety swirling around the country and the world at large, we all have to accommodate many strange changes both big and small. Carping about restrictive curtailments and economic strictures cuts no mustard in sustaining the well-being buoyancy of the nation's spirit of resilience. Of course, those who are most needy for the basics must be prioritised for nuanced support and safety-net rescue packages, but let's not fool ourselves into imagining that we are in the business of clawing back all our pre-Covid scenarios of affluent comforts and luxurious freedoms of entitlement.
This is the precise time for 'ourselves together' rather than a concerted 'me-fein' dynamic - an opportunity for authentic 'meithealising' as opposed to sectional protectionism, profiteering or prohibitive pricing. Uniquely and oddly, we now have a chance to bolster and boost our cohesive camaraderie and genuine generosities of spirit.
Persistent pushing against advisories and constant complaining about imposed measures to combat the virus, are both needless and pointless

Letters to the Editor: Government must address funding ahead of school reopenings
It's as if the national teams of public health governance are rashly dishing out rough gruel unfairly and disproportionately discommoding certain business enterprises for the sake of it. While no-one (bar none) has the full handle on the virus, we are all trying to do our collective best, but we must do it without fear or favour and always for the overall vital benefit of every citizen. It would seem that many features of our pre-Covid economic tapestry are simply redundant and unsustainable in all but the 'false' good times. Thus, a radical recalibration/reconfiguration is called for - one that is kind, caring and sharing in both design and delivery, for the welfare of all.
Creative conjuring towards a new, more modest expectation of affluence and aggrandisement, is now paramount, if we want to develop a rigorous realism of equitable 'thrivance'. Such aspirations are not pie in the sky, but are merely orientated towards baking a pie from which everyone can have a manageable slice. Ireland is a small country with limited resources and finite potential. The nonsense notion of constant perennial economic growth is forlornly fallacious and we must build a sound sustainable edifice of economic aspiration, appropriate to our native reality, albeit an altered, more modest version of what went before.
In such a new dispensation, there would no room for the likes of beef barons and their shady ilk, who operate systems of exploitative 'slavery' and demeaning 'sharp-practice', pay little or no tax to the public purse and laugh all the way to foreign financial 'bunkers of booty'. The age of decency renewal and ethical morality cultivation beckons apace. Let's answer the call for the good of all.

Spanish Flu and Covid 19, Economic War and Brexit?","Brexit negotiations have stalled, with the two key stumbling blocks being access to British fishing waters and the EU’s demand that the UK tie itself closely to the bloc’s state aid, labour and environmental standards, to ensure it does not undercut the EU’s Single Market.
While Covid-19 has occupied national headlines for the past six months, the countdown to Britain leaving the EU continues to ebb away, with just 18 weeks left.
It has been said that Covid-19 is a once in 100 years event; Brexit is also a once in 100 years event.
The trading relationship between Ireland and the UK has been one of mutual benefit and free trade for nearly 50 years, since 1973, the year of our joint accession to the European Economic Community, the forerunner of today’s European Union.
Further back in history, Ireland and the UK had, for the most part, favourable reciprocal arrangements, especially so since the 1940s.
Prior to that, the Anglo Irish Trade War (1932-1938) was once such time in our past when the trading relationship between Ireland and the UK deteriorated, with disastrous consequences for Irish farmers.
Prior to 1932, approximately 90% of all Irish exports went to Britain, similarly the vast majority of imports to Ireland came from the UK, including the coal which was used to power trains and, of course, electricity generation.
The new Irish Free State sought to avoid paying land annuities to the UK, this was effectively a result of an exacerbation of the inability to pay, in the case of more and more farmers following the 1929 depression, as well as an appetite within the State for retention of the annuities, to bolster the weak finances of the country.
Early government withholds land annuity payments and land prices jump
The newly elected administration headed up by Fianna Fáil in 1932 had campaigned on withholding land annuity payments from the British exchequer amounting to £3.7 million. Annuities were annual sums collected from farmers and sent to England due on the purchase of lands by tenant farmers from English landlords following the land reform acts of the 1890s.
Ultimately, the election promises doled out prior to the 1932 election left Fianna Fáil with no choice but to live up to its commitments.
Initially, the economy in Ireland did well, running a surplus thanks to the retention of the annuities in the Irish coffers, however the UK Government retaliated in subsequent years with the imposition of tariffs on the importation of goods, including agricultural products from Ireland.
Notably, tariffs of up to 88% were applied to Irish cattle.
The UK government had hoped that De Valera’s government would lose much of the support it had garnered from farmers, who were now in dire straits after having been promised an easier run.
Rather than giving in on the annuities, the Irish government sought to retaliate by imposing duties on the importation of coal, steel, sugar and cement.
Ireland set up its own sugar factories in Carlow, Mallow and Thurles.
The UK further ramped up pressure by imposing import quotas, that additional measure not alone meant that the price available to Irish farmers was subdued by the tariffs, but now only a certain quantity could be brought into the UK.
The Irish Government brought in subsidies (bounties) to support prices at the farm gate, and even a slaughter scheme and a free-meat scheme to stem oversupply of cattle and poor prices in the domestic market.
The impasse was unlocked when the Coal for Cattle agreement was reached, with tariffs reduced on both products as reciprocal measures.
Irish farmland prices jumped in the year 1933 as farmers, free, or at least expecting to be freer from the shackles of annuities, were full of exuberance.
Land prices rose by 34% that year. However, by 1934, land prices collapsed by 60%, as farmers suffered severely.
The so-called Economic War between the Irish Free State and Britain lasted from 1932 to 1938, and stories of destitution of that time have been passed down the generations.
World trade tariffs could decimate Irish cattle farmers again 
Ninety years later, the prospect of world trade tariffs of 85% on Irish beef could once again decimate Irish cattle farmers.
However, unlike that older time, our economy is now much less dependent on cattle farmers as the main thrust of our economic output.
Equally, less of our exports are destined for the UK now, compared to the 1930s, meaning our exposure to market disruption is somewhat obviated.
That comes as cold comfort for Ireland’s 90,000 beef farmers who would be adversely affected.
The Brexit leaving date of December 31 has been set in legislation, and for now, a collision course between the immovable object that is the EU and the unstoppable force that is the UK (in its desire to break free) seems set to cause untold damage for Irish farmers.
Whether both sides (the UK and the EU) can see sense and agree a framework for mutual benefit remains unknown.
History may have repeated itself with Covid 19 likened to the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918, let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself when it comes to trade relations.

Denis Lehane: Covid-19 has defeated artists like me"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40035434.html,2020-08-20 20:19:00,"Buy cattle, spare the dogs, Supreme Leader","A man asked me the other day “Is it possible to get into a mart nowadays?”
I said it was, “But you will have to dress up like Neil Armstrong when he landed on the moon.”
“They are taking no chances,” I emphasised.
And as facemasks become almost compulsory, you’d have to wonder how we survived a cattle mart in the olden days.
Days when cattle were sold through a brown haze of cigarette smoke, mixed with the overpowering whiff of strong alcohol.
How the marts back then didn’t combust into a ball of flames from the volatile mix that surrounded the cattle is anyone’s guess.
Anyway, we survived the old days, and now, here we are, all sober and smoke-free, wearing facemasks to protect ourselves from a dreaded virus.
I wonder what the good old boys of yesteryear would make of all the masks and the fear? Somehow I don’t think they would be too compliant.
Anyway, back to the present, and our weekly mart round-up, beginning with Dungarvan mart on Monday, where strong reared calves made from €190 to €290 a head.
The mart’s seasonal weanling sales commence on Thursday, September 10, and will continue on September 24 and fortnightly thereafter. Entries are now being taken at 058 41611.

I hear Kim Jong-un has become a dog fancier. And I don’t mean he is spending his Saturday nights at Curraheen Park, I mean he has ordered all the pet dogs of North Korea to be rounded up, taken in and, I presume, shot. It has been reported that the dogs are being taken to either the nation’s zoos or restaurants.
We can sometimes forget that the world is a hungry place for many, especially when we hear those tasked with marketing our beef speaking about ‘oversupply’ and ‘saturation of markets.’
The only oversupply in North Korea right now seems to be insanity.
The Supreme Leader is clearly not firing on all cylinders, and hasn’t been for some time. It’s tragic to read about a people going hungry in one land, when there is abundance in the next.
Weanling season under way
And so we move on, from North Korea to Skibbereen, where mart manager Tom McCarthy had this to say after Friday’s cattle sale. “We had a very strong trade for all types of stock.”
The mart will hold a special weanling sale next Friday, August 21; expect to see some smashers on show.
In Skibbereen on Friday last, dry cows sold from €50 to €500 with the kilo. Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks made from €350 to €700 with their weight. Heifers on Friday made up to €530 with their weight.

Next to Kilkenny mart where after last Thursday’s sale, mart manager George Candler gave us the following report: “Even though there were some very fancy prices, the trade was more subdued compared to previous weeks’ trading.
“Numbers remaining big for the time of year, with uncertainty going forward due to Covid-19 and the problem we seem to have forgotten about, Brexit.
“The fact that some factories may be forced to close is a worrying development. The coronavirus may be with us for some time to come, so perhaps we have to try and operate the best we can before a vaccine is discovered.
The wearing of masks is now suggested to operate in all livestock marts, and compliance on Thursday was about 98%.”
On Thursday, Kilkenny mart had 850 cattle on offer with bullocks selling from €1.50 to €3.19 per kilo. Heifers made from €1.80 to €2.50 per kilo. Continental dry cows sold from €1.25 to €2.10 per kilo, with Friesian dry cows selling from €1.05 to €1.60 per kilo.

Denis Kirby of Golden Vale Marts was very positive after the week of cattle trading in Kilmallock mart. He gave us this report, beginning with last Monday’s general sale of cattle in Kilmallock.
“This week, we saw 700 cattle sold at great prices. Our auctioneers reported that prices were increased by up to €50 a head.”
Bullocks in Kilmallock sold for up €1520 each or €2.49 per kg. Dry cows made up to €1360 or €1.92 per kg. Heifers made up to €1400 each or €2.20 per kg. Factory bulls made up to €1.63 per kg. A special entry of sucklers sold for up to €1,900 (for a six-year-old Aberdeen Angus cow and her Aberdeen Angus heifer calf).
On Tuesday night, the mart held its first weanling show and sale of the season.
Denis again was upbeat, “Quality was excellent and some exceptional prices were paid by exporters, feedlot owners and farmers.
“Compared to the same sale last year, prices were up 17 cent per kg, or €63 a head, on average.” The mart’s next weanling show and sale will be on Tuesday, September 8.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40037231.html,2020-08-24 12:34:00,"Ireland No 6 in the EU for beef heifer prices, North is No 2","Ireland is at number six in the EU on beef heifer prices, according to the EU Commission’s monthly rankings.
During the week ending August 2, 2020, the R3 heifer price in Ireland was 378.6c/kg, having increased 12.9c/kg from a month previously.
Despite the rise, prices south of the border remained significantly behind those recorded in Northern Ireland (412.2c), which were the second highest in the EU, after Sweden (437.3c), with farmers in Great Britain (410.4c), France (409c), and Luxembourg (394.9c) paid the third, fourth, and fifth highest prices, respectively.
This widening differential has contributed to an increase in the number of prime cattle being imported from Ireland for direct slaughter in Northern Ireland processing plants, said the Livestock and Meat Commission (LMC) of Northern Ireland.
This trend is confirmed by Bord Bia, which said trading of cattle to Northern Ireland performed strongly over recent weeks, with just over 1,600 head travelling north during the week ending August 9.
They included a combination of calves, store cattle for further feeding, and finished beef cattle.

The Irish R3 heifer price was 33.6c/kg behind the same price in Northern Ireland, which is the equivalent of €111 on a 330kg carcase, but the Irish R3 heifer price was 11.5c/kg higher than the average EU price for R3 heifers.
The R3 heifer price in Northern Ireland was 45.1c/kg ahead of the average EU price, which was 367.1c/kg.
The British price increased by the equivalent of 7.1c/kg from the first week of July.
The differential in R3 heifer price between the UK and the EU average price widened from 40.6c/kg at the start of July to 43.3c/kg at the start of August.
The LMC said recovery in Northern Ireland and Great Britain prices has been driven by lower levels of beef import, some recovery in food service demand, and a surge in retail demand for beef products.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40037828.html,2020-08-25 18:41:00,North’s factories pay 8c/kg over quotes on average for prime beef,"Analysis of the beef cattle trade in Northern Ireland shows that finishers happy to take the prices quoted by processors are losing out on 9c/kg (8p/kg).
The Livestock & Meat Commission of Northern Ireland took deadweight prices paid for R-3 steers in 2020, and compared them to prices quoted by major beef processors in the North.
They found the prices paid have been consistently above the quoted prices during 2020 so far. 
The widest differential between quoted and paid prices for R-3 grading steers was 17p/kg, in the first week of April.
The differential narrowed to just 4p/kg in the first week of May.
The differential between quotes and prices paid has been maintained despite upward movement in the deadweight beef trade in recent months.

Effect of rain on cattle supply may tip the beef market balance
Meanwhile, during 2020 to date, some in-spec R-3 grade steers were bought at, and below, processors’ quoted prices.
The LMC said the differential between quoted price and price paid may not be as wide for other grades of cattle, because R-3 steers that meet all other specification requirements meet the widest range of retailer orders and are therefore more likely to be rewarded by the Northern Ireland market than other cattle.
The LMC advised finishers to produce cattle that meet market specifications and to use the base quotes from the major plants as a starting point for negotiation before presenting cattle for slaughter.
It said prime cattle prices in the North are based on a grid, with a U-3 grade quote as a base price. The grid agreed by the industry is a guide only, with variation in its application from plant to plant. In reality, the price paid for prime cattle is primarily driven by supply and demand, and is open to negotiation.
Only R-3 steers in spec for age, weight, grade, number of farms, and FQ status were included in the analysis. Angus, Hereford and organic cattle were excluded, as bonuses for these cattle at point of slaughter are not included in base quotes.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40042382.html,2020-08-31 23:33:00,Uneasy calm and price stalemate after the storms in the beef market,"The trade for beef remained stable at the factories this week.
There’s a stalemate of finishers resisting price cut attempts by processors, in a battle to determine which side can hold out the longest.
Processors cannot enforce lower prices for cattle because they need to maintain the beef cattle supply at or near its current level, to meet market requirements.
Meanwhile, improved weather has reduced fears of sharp deterioration in ground conditions on farms after the storm deluges of rain, and helped to ease pressures on finishers to lighten stocking rates.
The weather over the next few weeks could be a vital factor in determining the flow of cattle to the factories, and the trade.
The intake at factories was slightly increased last week at 35,034 head.
The supply of steers continued very strong at 16,851 head, with heifers accounting for 9,314 head, and young bulls at 1,253 head.
The supply of cows was steady at 6,902 head. The figures are not comparable with 2019, because of the farmer blockade disruption at factories 12 months ago.
Cattle have performed very well in an excellent grazing season, and most finishers are finding weights are up on last year. But the downside of that is that processors are hinting at tighter weight limits.
Processors have succeeded in tightening their rein on the base price for steers at 360c/kg. Some are trying their hand at buying for a lower price, without much success, but finishers trying to squeeze over 360c/kg base for steers this week are up against a stone wall, with few succeeding.
Processors have put heifer prices on a par with steer prices, by offering a base of 360c/kg, although there are some reports of up to 365c/kg being secured, and the occasional lot of high quality heifers managing to command a base price at 370c/kg.
Prices for young bulls are generally quoted at 350c/kg for R-grade, with around 340c/kg offered for O-grade. The supply of young bulls continues to run at around half the 2019 level, indicating the waning interest of processors (and farmers) in young bulls, compared to last year. This is most likely a factor in the increased intake of steers compared to 2019.
The trade for cows is steady or a shade improved. Some of the best quality R-grade cows are making 315c-320c/kg, and there have been some reports of up to 325c/kg being secured.
O-grade cow prices are ranging from 290c to 305c/kg, and P-grade are at 285c-295c/kg."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40042208.html,2020-09-02 17:35:00,Climate action may be new minister McConalogue’s best bet,"Only tillage and dairy have been worthwhile farming enterprises in recent years, with the other main activities all returning negative market incomes (if direct aid payments, mostly from the EU, are excluded).
These are the two enterprises governments turn to, for realistic prospects of growth.
Therefore, it is a considerable setback that bad weather has damaged the cereal harvest to the extent that an already expected large fall in annual cereal profit margins and incomes will be even steeper.
Although the overall summary of 2020 farming is likely to be that Irish farmers dodged yet another bullet this year, with the Covid-19 pandemic impact on incomes not nearly as bad as some had feared, farmers will know that there are plenty more bullets on the way, as they plan ahead for the coming year.
A gradual recovery in commodity prices, government assistance for the beef sector, and price stabilising payments from milk processors, have offset market disruption since the Covid-19 threat emerged in the spring.
Feed, fertiliser, and energy costs on farms are all lower than was the case in 2019.
However, were a second wave of the virus to occur, then commodity prices could again come under pressure.
Recent storms and rain have damaged the harvest, and could shorten grazing seasons unless the weather improves. The mini-drought in May and into June (which Munster largely escaped) left its mark on tillage farms in the form of much reduced yields, even before the harvest ground to a halt, at the halfway mark, with further yield losses inevitable.
One of the bright spots is that profitability on sheep farms are set to increase by 15% or more in 2020.
However, sheep farmers still depend on EU payments for income, and the collapse in wool prices has been dispiriting.
The next big bullet heading for farmers is, of course, Brexit uncertainty.
To avoid a huge slump in Ireland’s export-orientated food industry, farmers seem to depend on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson not risking cutting links with the EU without a trade agreement in place.
So, never a dull moment, as usual in the farming world.
Having effectively had no established agriculture minister for months is also somewhat unsettling.
How will new minister Charlie McConalogue approach his brief?
Problem-solving and putting out fires will keep the new incumbent busy, but what will be his longer-term plan?
Will it veer towards the very challenging continuation of agri-food’s great growth of the past, with €13bn of food and drink exports setting new records, or towards putting farming forward as a champion of climate change?
The latter seems the more politically safe route.
A good start was already made in this area by ex-minister Dara Calleary and forestry junior minister Pippa Hackett, trying to resuscitate forestry with draft legislation to align the forestry licencing and appeals system with other similar planning processes.
Dairy has been the powerhouse of agri-food growth but is running out of steam.
Milk production will increase 3-4% this year, but a continuing nitrates and climate change clampdown will restrict future growth.
Expected nitrates proposals next year such as grazing platform stocking rate restrictions, and chemical fertiliser restrictions, will be major deterrents.
In tillage, the only other potentially profitable main enterprise, the area under crops has declined by 15% over the last decade, and by more than 40% since the early 1980s.
Since the early 1990s, the number of growers has declined by almost 60%.
EU regulations have left farmers uncompetitive compared to North and South American producers whose crops have become the main non-grass feed source for Ireland’s livestock.
Our annual grain production is about 2m tonnes, but our net imports of all main feed ingredients are about 4m tonnes.
The imported feed comes from crops grown in non-EU countries with less onerous regulatory regimes.
As well as making EU crops uncompetitive, regulations have increased the risk of crop failure due to banning of pesticides.
The ban on using neonicotinoid insecticides, blamed for killing bees, has contributed to an expected fall in sugar production of as much as 25% from this year’s beet crops in France and Germany.
Ireland has extra competitive disadvantages for tillage farming, in the form of high land and labour costs compared to other EU states.
Production of potatoes has declined by 46% since the mid-1980s.
It’s hard to see where growth in agricultural production could come from, but it’s also hard to see where it could be exported to. In addition to the possibility of huge tariffs on sales to the EU, world markets are fragile due to Covid-19.
Global GDP is expected to shrink by 3% in 2020, a larger decline than experienced during the 2008–2009 financial crisis.
If the pandemic fades away in time, global GDP might recover by 5.8% in 2021.
The Covid-19 induced contraction in economic activity is projected to weaken global demand for agricultural commodities.
Over-supply of many agricultural commodities in the short run, leading to increasing surplus stocks may hold down commodity prices even after normal levels of consumer demand resume.
These are the market developments farmers will mull over as they make plans for 2021 crops or livestock herds.
It’s ominous that farmers have not proceeded with works in almost one-third of the farm projects approved for TAMS grant aid, and have not submitted a grant claim.
The bureaucracy surrounding the scheme may have defeated some of them, but there may also have been pullbacks from plans for farm development.
It’s another sign that harnessing agriculture for climate action may well be new Agriculture Ministers Charlie McConalogue’s best bet, unlike his predecessors who have thrived on the year-after-year increases in export earnings."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40042373.html,2020-09-02 22:44:00,New minister may quickly face stiff Brexit test,"Ireland’s new agriculture minister, Charlie McConalogue, takes office just four days ahead of make-or-break talks on Brexit in London.
Preparations for a no-deal Brexit could become the new incumbent’s top priority, unless there is progress in Round 8 of the UK-EU negotiations in London next Monday, September 7.
The seventh round of talks between the negotiating teams ended on August 20 with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, accusing the UK of “wasting time” and warning that an agreement this year was “unlikely”.
Without a breakthrough, there is a fast-growing risk that negotiations will collapse by the end of the month.
The result of that would be the Brexit transition period ending on December 31 with the UK reverting to trading on World Trade Organization terms.
Fears of this outcome increased when Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU council, and is seen as a potential dealmaker on the UK-EU future relationship, took Brexit off the agenda for yesterday’s EU ambassadors’ summit meeting.
“Since there hasn’t been any tangible progress in EU-UK negotiations, the Brexit item was taken off the agenda,” an EU diplomat said.
Meanwhile, a UK document leaked to the press last Sunday, warning of public disorder, shortages, and price hikes, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, was perceived in Brussels as a sign of the UK government’s seriousness about leaving the EU single market and customs union without a trade agreement.
For the new agriculture minister, the main fallout from a no-deal Brexit would be loss of free trade access for beef exports to the UK, the world’s fifth or sixth biggest beef importer.
Brexit researchers have calculated that Ireland would experience the strongest Brexit impact, of all the EU27 countries, in value-added in agriculture, with a 16.3% reduction, followed by the Netherlands (a reduction of 2.7%), and France (0.3%).
‘Value added’ is the standard method of measuring the contribution of a sector to gross domestic product and, therefore, its contribution to economic activity.
Meanwhile, farmer organisations welcomed the appointment of Minister McConalogue.
But ICMSA President , Pat McCormack warned he will have no honeymoon period. He said Brexit, CAP, Mercosur and Climate Change are the urgent areas.
IFA President Tim Cullinan congratulated the new Minister and said IFA expects him to to get to grips with his portfolio quickly.
In his statement yesterday, Mr Cullinan said, “Michel Barnier’s assessment today to the IIEA was very bleak and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is a real one. Farmers are in the frontline in terms of a damaging outcome and the Minister has to carry this message at Government and EU level. ” He said the CAP Budget and the new Climate Bill are also urgent and critical issues."

Five lots of young male animals were sold.
The top price was bid for a five-month-old bull, the first lot to be sold. Bidding, which was mostly on-line, started at €400, and finished at €1,140.
A similar bull followed, making €1,120.
A seven-month pair of 207kg then sold for €840 each.
The remaining two lots were buffalo bullocks, with a 285kg pair of ten to 11 months old selling for €760, and a nine to ten months old pair of 247kg selling for €600.
There are already a few farms with water buffalo in Ireland (at least two in Co Cork and one in Co Wexford) and many farms in the UK have taken on water buffalo.
Cheese, beef and soap are among the end-products from buffalo herds.

The fine detail will be critical. An Irish commissioner with her hands around the windpipe of the City of London could have a chilling effect on British ardour, which is running high.
A scoop in the Financial Times on Sunday relying on “three people familiar with the plans” said that “sections of the internal market bill are expected to 'eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement' in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs.” That put the cat among the pigeons. The UK government, whatever plans it had importunely exposed by an inconvenient leak, has been rubbing soothing ointments into the inevitable outrage since. It hasn’t, however, denied the plan, merely sweetly saying things about tidying up loose ends, if loose ends aren’t tied up.

Every week, more and more foods across Europe get geographical indications.
This week, such foods include Strandzhanski manov med, a smooth brown honey with a slightly bitter aftertaste from bees in the wild oak forests of the Bulgarian uplands.
And there is Asperges du Blayais, asparagus grown only in specific municipalities of Gironde and Charente-Maritime in France.
Telemea de Sibiu is a traditional Romanian cheese, made from the fresh milk of sheep that graze upon the rolling hills of Transylvania.
What they have in common is the EU’s geographical indication for products linked to a particular territory or production method.
This identification of products linked to their place of origin is a winner with consumers who trust these quality products. 
They are the ideal farm to fork story, from the consumer point of view, rather than a commodity which may be produced in one country, processed in another, and packed in a third country.
The Republic of Ireland has eight food product names registered in this way. They are Clare Island Salmon, Imokilly Regato cheese, Timoleague Brown Pudding, Connemara Hill Lamb, Waterford Blaa bread, Oriel Sea Salt, Oriel Sea Minerals, and Sneem Black Pudding. Three spirit drink names are registered in this way. They are Irish Whiskey, Irish Cream, and Irish Poitín.

Across the EU, the sales value of these protected name products is on average double that for similar products without a certification.
Foods and drinks whose names are protected by the EU’s Geographical Indications have a total sales value of €74.76 billion, more than one-fifth of which is outside the EU.
Producers can sell these products at a higher price, to consumers looking for authentic regional products.
EU schemes promote the unique characteristics of such products.
They serve as flagships for the traditional culinary heritage of regions, and as economic drivers for the national agri-food sector.
Geographical indications represent 15.5% of the total EU agri-food exports. Wines are the most important sector in terms of sales and exports. Irish Whiskey sits alongside other geographical indication beverages such as Bayerisches Bier, Champagne, Kalamata olives, Parmigiano Reggiano, Polish Vodka, Queso Manchego, and Roquefort.
So it’s hardly surprising that Ireland is at an early stage of applying to the EU to list Irish Grass-Fed Beef and Achill Island Sea Salt as names with protected geographic status.
This proposes to give the name of Irish Grass Fed Beef to quality Irish beef raised on a grass-based diet on pasture grazing farms in Ireland.
It’s meat from cattle raised naturally, and processed in Ireland, before landing on the consumer’s plate.
If it’s as successful as the other products across Europe with protected geographic status, it could be a game-changer for the troubled beef industry.
An application for PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) status can only be submitted by, or on behalf of, a group of producers. In this case, the application will be made by Bord Bia.

Marteye reported ‘phenomenal interest’ in Ireland’s first buffalo sale
Tomorrow evening, Friday, at September 11, is the deadline for legitimate oppositions to the two applications for protected geographic status.
Following satisfactory completion of this stage, the application can be formally lodged with the EU Commission for scrutiny, and a further opposition procedure will follow.
Once registered, EU regulations require the EU symbol for PGI to appear on the labelling of the product, to help consumers distinguish it from similar products.
The PGI certification logo on the product passes a message of quality and authenticity to consumers.
Unfortunately, it is possible that the Irish Grass Fed Beef application will fall at the first opposition hurdle, because the farmers on whose behalf it is being made have objected to it.
Bord Bia says it developed grass-fed beef standards in consultation with farmers and processors.
Key criteria are at least 90% of an animal’s diet on a fresh weight basis must be grass or grass-based forages, and at least 220 days per year grazing, but with an allowance of up to 40 days where soil type or weather may prevent a longer grazing season.
The beef must come from steers and heifers aged up to 36 months, with conformation better than O-minus and fat score of two-plus to four-plus; or beef cows of up to 120 months, conformation better than O-plus, fat score two-plus to five-plus.
Disappointingly, farmers have gone out of their way to pick holes in the grass-fed standard submitted by Bord Bia to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. IFA has objected to the submission setting limits on the distance from farms to abattoirs, and mentioning that registered hauliers must be used. 
IFA wants to know who will adjudicate on the specified colour of the meat, and says processors doing it is unacceptable.
IFA President Tim Cullinan said the submission has been driven by processors to give them even more control over farmers. He said it is likely to do more harm than good for farmers.
The Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association said the grass-fed beef PGI proposal will undermine development of a suckler beef brand.
A group called the Independent Farmers’ Organisation of Ireland said it has submitted a comprehensive objection to the proposal outlining its serious concerns about the implications for beef farmers, saying it is “a Trojan horse to block the prospect of future farmer applications while swelling the coffers of the processors and multiples”.
A PGI for Irish beef has been talked about for many years. In the current Programme for Government, it is one of the priorities in agriculture, but is likely now to be dropped well down the priority list, as it has turned into such a hot potato.
The application is quite likely to fail; a previous application for Irish Beef was withdrawn several years ago, because the European Commission did not accept that there were exceptional circumstances to justify using the name of a member state. 
EU regulations changed in the meantime to permit the use of a member state’s name, but the EU is hardly likely to approve the latest application after there has been such strong producer opposition.
It’s not a new situation; farmer organisations and agencies previously explored possible joint applications, but never reached a shared position.
It’s becoming more and more clear that the beef sector is too divided internally, with the paranoia and suspicions that that entails, to work together on a farm to fork project like this.
Meanwhile, best of luck to the PGI application for “Achill Island Sea Salt”, a hand harvested sea salt from the waters around Achill Island, Co Mayo. Unfortunately, it is unlikely to be sprinkled on a PGI Irish beef.

Ratification of EU's Mercosur trade deal runs into more problems"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40045442.html,2020-09-09 10:53:00,Base price generally at 360c per kg for steers and heifers this week,"Finishers and processors continued to hold their ground on prices, in the beef trade at factories this week.
Weather continues to be an issue for finishers, particularly in heavy soil areas where stocking levels have to be reduced as ground conditions deteriorate.
But there is no indication of this causing an oversupply at the factories, where processors need up to 34,000 head per week to comfortably supply the market demands.
Prices eased and then stabilised, with more pressure on prices for heifers, which are now at parity with steer prices in most areas of the country.
The base of 360 cents/kg appears to be applied to both steers and heifers generally this week.
There are some reports of finishers with better quality heifers negotiating for an extra 5 cents/kg to bring their base to 365 cents/kg.
Little Give
But, in steer prices, there is very little give by processors.
A lot will depend on how intakes move over the coming weeks. Unless intakes increase due to bad weather forcing finishers to sell cattle, any moves by processors to cut the base price for steers is certain to meet with a lot of resistance.
While the overall intake at the factories year to date is now on par with the same period in 2019, there are wide variations within the categories.
The intake of young bulls is down by more than 55,000 head. Most likely some of the suppliers of young bulls in 2019 switched to finishing steers this year, which can account for the increase of 42,000 head in the steer supply. The supply of heifers is not far off par with 2019, at around 1,000 head more this year, and the cow intake has slipped by 7,000 head compared to last year.
R-grade young bulls are trading at 350 cents/kg for a good percentage this week, while up to 355 cents/kg is being paid, and 340-345 cents/kg generally for O grade.
There is some widening in the cow price spread from region to region, particularly for better quality cows.
Finishers have reported deals at up to 330 cents/kg secured for R-grade cows, which in general are in a 310-320 cents/kg price range.
O-grade cows are making 290-300 cents/kg, and P-grade are on 280-285 cents/kg.
The beef cattle intake increased further last week, to 36,326 head, including a strong kill of steers, at 17,231 (the highest per week, year to date), and 9,815 heifers. Cows accounted for 7,300 head, with only 1,264 young bulls.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40047038.html,2020-09-11 11:30:00,Diversification at the heart of Tipperary beef farm,"A Co Tipperary food business has credited a UCC project for its success.
Dr Joe Kerry, Food and Nutritional Sciences, UCC, helped by three Food Science students, worked with Blackcastle Farm at Two Mile Borris near Thurles.
John and Ann Commins continue the tradition of four generations of John’s family, by farming sustainably at Blackcastle, in the heart of Tipperary.
Their speciality beef sausage - which is part of the Grow with Aldi programme - is available at the supermarket chain throughout the week of September 13.
John (55) has Piedmontese cattle that naturally produce a very healthy beef - low in fat and high in protein - and he first became involved with the breed back in 2005.
“At the time we had a suckler farm - Limousin and Belgian Blue cows; we were doing everything as best we could and working closely with Teagasc, and while all of that was fine we felt there were a lot of variables outside of our control,” he said.
“We heard about a breed of cattle in Italy called Piedmontese; there is a Piedmontese society in Ireland and I contacted them. They were actually organising a trip to Italy for later that month and so myself, Ann and her parents went on that trip.
“We were very taken by the cattle and the whole story around them and decided to buy some breading stock and bring them back to Ireland and build up a herd here.
“We soon discovered that we didn’t really have enough of them for the Italians to take it seriously - while they were interested in our cattle they had no interest in buying 20 or 30, they wanted 300 or 400 at a time. The numbers just weren’t here for that.” In 2011, John established a food business focused on selling his special beef.

With the help of an innovation voucher from the Department of Agriculture, John worked with Dr Kerry of UCC’s School of Food and Nutritional Sciences on nutritional testing of products.
It was discovered that most of the meat cuts produced by the Piedmontese cattle were less than 2% fat, and were very high in protein.
“At the time we knew nothing about butchering - in fact I couldn’t tell you one cut of meat from the other; Michael Fennelly - another Piedmontese breeder - and myself decided to set up that; we got a butcher in our area to do the meat for us and we did the marketing,” said John.
“We basically gave away the first animal to family and friends to get some feedback and we actually got enough positive feedback to determine that we had something here and it was worth pursuing.” Slowly but surely the Commins’ built up the enterprise; they attended agricultural shows around the country and secured deals with restaurants and retail outlets including Super Valu.
They also set up their own online shop from where they sold the beef directly to the customer.
“This whole journey was never for the faint hearted to be honest with you because it’s tough out there for any small food business,” added John.
“Anyway, about two years ago beef prices in general collapsed and that affected us because the factories started dumping meat on the supermarkets and the restaurants.
“And, while our beef is considered superior, restaurants - which were also finding the going tough - found themselves in a situation where they were getting cheaper meat from the factories and we just couldn’t compete with that, we didn’t have the scale to compete.
“So, we decided then to go for value-added products and we developed our beef sausage which has been very successful and became part of the Grow with Aldi programme which was established by the retail outlet to help the very best small to medium sized Irish suppliers in building their brand.
“We are also doing a cure beef sausage now and a spice beef sausage all of which is very encouraging.” John says the Grow with Aldi programme served as “a huge boost for us”.
“220 producers applied for that and it was whittled down to 50 of which we were one and those 50 went on the shelves the last week in May.
Ann and John Commins produce their own beef at their farm in Blackcastle, Co Tipperary. Picture Dan Linehan
“The top five then secured a 12-month contract and while we didn’t make the top five we were very, very close; it gave us huge national exposure and our online sales have gone through the roof.
“Aldi wants to do business with us as well; they are going to put our sausages on the shelf during the week of September 13, and are going to take it from there.” John also studied and completed a Level 9 Postgraduate Diploma in Innovation and Enterprise, run by Trinity College Dublin.
He believes the course prepared him to embrace the Grow with Aldi programme and realise his vision for the business.
Meanwhile, John and Ann’s children, Sarah (15), Joanne (12), and Evinned (9), all help on the farm.
The Commins also received support along the way from other entities.
“We have got great support from the Tipperary Local Enterprise Office, the Tipperary County Council, and North Tipperary Leader Development,” added Ann.
“We are members of Tipperary Food Producers, and get lots of support from our fellow food producers.
“We are committed to creating local employment and bringing a healthy, locally produced sustainable food product, our Blackcastle beef, to our customers.” It was much of this support, in fact, that allowed the family to build their own processing unit on the farm.
“We had some old traditional sheds and they were at a stage where we either had to knock them or do something with them to preserve them,” Ann continued.
“We decided at that point to convert the sheds into a food unit.
‘We are also in the process of setting up workshops focused on the whole area of sustainable development and skills; and food skills.
“We have a panel of 20 really good people who are prepared to do those workshops for us; one of the panelist is on the international fishing committee and the idea is that people who participate in this workshop for example would spend the morning fishing in the nearby river and then come back to the farm and cook the fish in the outdoor ovens.
“We are trying to create a real experience for people; we also want to do farm visits and host weddings as well.”"

One can no longer be so sure the answer is no, after last week’s announcement by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture in Germany that the decomposed carcass of an infected female wild boar found near the border with Poland had tested positive for African swine fever (ASF).
Within days, the country’s pork exporters were cut off from their markets in China, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore.
Last Saturday, Chinese officials imposed an immediate ban, meaning that any pork from Germany already in China would be destroyed or sent back.
Overnight, Germany lost export markets worth €1bn per year in the case of China alone.
The ban is a bureaucratic overkill, imposed because veterinary certificates agreed for the export of pork from Germany include the statement that Germany is free from ASF.
Germany’s huge pig industry is still free from ASF. Just one case has been found in a wild pig. In the EU’s modern, biosecure, pig farms, it is perfectly feasible to keep out ASF infection, even though the ASF virus is highly contagious and mostly deadly for pigs, and there no vaccine. The only way to stop ASF is to depopulate all affected or exposed swine herds.
Thankfully, it cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans.
Belgium had had ASF in wild boars since 2018, without the disease spreading to pig farms. Belgian authorities set up a no-go zone to control wild boar, and allowed shooting to lower the number of animals. It also built a fence to avoid it spreading to France.
Belgium has been able to re-open some export markets, including India, Vietnam and Singapore, bringing some relief to the country’s pig farmers, who had seen prices fall 20% when countries like China banned their pork in 2018. Belgium hopes to regain “free from ASF status” shortly.
The Czech Republic also successfully protected its domestic pig herd by confining ASF in wild boar, with a well-devised strategy including fencing and boar hunting. The Czech Republic was declared free from ASF after less than two years, having proved the virus is gone from its wild boar population for at least 12 months.
Germany has now started the process to regain “free from ASF status”, with the state of Brandenburg imposing a 15km quarantine zone around where the dead wild boar was found.
Germany has a head-start, with security measures to keep out the virus well established, including use of drones, sniffer dogs, and a 125km electric fence in Brandenburg on the Polish border to keep away wild boars.
At the other end of the scale, EU countries in central and eastern Europe have found ASF harder to control.
It has entered Germany from Poland, where it was first found in 2014, resulting in EU controls on movement of pigs and pig products.
It spread into commercial Polish pig farms. With 82 pig farms already infected in 2020, including a 6,480-head farm earlier this month, and a recent outbreak on a 600-pig farm near the German border, the Polish pig industry is seriously threatened.
But Germany is not like China, where ASF broke out in 2018, and eventually killed between 40% and 60% of the Chinese pig herd, which had been the world’s largest.
The spread of ASF in China was inevitable, due to the country’s widespread backyard pig farming, and practices such as using food waste as pig feed; using pig blood as a raw material in producing feed for pigs; widespread transport of live animals; and sale of pigs and pigmeat in unhygienic open-air markets.
The disease spread like wildfire in China, and from there to all the other important Asian pig producing countries. Now, China has turned holier-than-thou, banning German pork on a technicality, needlessly disrupting global markets already weakened by the spread of the Covid-19 human pandemic, which has killed more than 915,000 people and infected more than 28.4m, since December 31, when China alerted the World Health Organisation to its outbreak.
Germany is negotiating with Asian officials to turn the nationwide bans into restrictions on specific German regions.
This would allow other German regions to continue their exports, which would be a sensible outcome.
It is after all the policy within the EU, with other member states still taking German pork from disease-free regions.
In the Philippines, meat importers are already calling for more sensible import policies. The Philippines has ASF in its commercial pig farms, and has bird flu outbreaks, yet it has banned pork and poultry imports from countries which reveal cases of these diseases, including Germany because of its one ASF case in a dead wild boar. Meanwhile, there is no such internal blanket ban on pork meat from infected regions in the Philippines. The point has been made that ASF policy is over the top, exceeding in some respects the policy for Covid-19, which is to live with it while awaiting a vaccine.
Of course, the bureaucratic overkill in banning German pork may be politically motivated, especially in China. It is after all the country that banned or restricted imports of Australian wine, beef, and grain, and threatened to put tariffs on Australian coal and iron ore, in a poorly disguised retaliation for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling for an inquiry into the Chinese origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Who knows what motive China may have for an over-the-top ban on pork from its No 3 supplier, Germany?
Maybe it is a gesture of goodwill to the two countries most likely to fill the import gap, Brazil and the USA?
It leaves the EU having to cope with a pork glut, because much of Germany’s €5bn of pork exports will be re-routed back to the EU.
This isn’t expected to be a major problem, adding only about 1% to the EU market compared to 2019 levels. It could be a dress rehearsal for a worst-case Brexit scenario, such as the EU market having to absorb much of the 265,000 tonnes per year of Irish beef which might have to find a new home if tariffs make it non-competitive in the UK."

Their idea will be put firmly to the test with the sale of a 155-acre golf course in Co Tipperary, newly listed jointly with GVM Auctioneers (of Kilmallock and Limerick) and Wheeler Auctioneers (of Hospital, Co Limerick).
The property, at Ballykisteen,  enjoys an excellent location, just across the N24 road from the Tipperary racecourse (recently approved as the site of Ireland’s second all-weather racecourse), and virtually next door to the Limerick Junction railway station and with road frontage onto the N24.
The land is excellent, but the presence of golf-course features such as bunkers is a disadvantage for conversion to agriculture, and there are about 30 acres of woodland.
On the plus side, an investment of effort and time will rejuvenate its agricultural potential, and its commercial potential should compensate for the woodland.
It’s surely one of the most difficult pieces of land to price this year, but the guide price of €10,000 per acre is a reasonable reflection on its unique mixture of qualities and disadvantages.
For sale by private treaty as a golf facility or as farmland, the 18-hole course (designed by Des Smyth) enjoys the benefits of an enthusiastic membership and is linked to a top class hotel facility (not included in the sale).
The course was constructed in 1993, and the agents say it is also very suitable for general farming purposes and would be ideal for beef, equestrian or dairy use.
It was once part of the famous Ballykisteen Stud."

Owner Geraldine Hanley has been here for 14 years, and Ashmore has provided a fun and funky farm base in a mid-Cork rural heartland for her family, as well as an introduction to the joys of rearing livestock.
Yet, you’d hardly pair her home style and family lifestyle with the big retail windows she dresses professionally.
Gable end with pergola and simple pizza oven is funky, a real room outside, just off the  kitchen
She’d rather not divulge the name of the department store where she does signature displays (clue: big, posh, expensive, on Cork’s St Patrick’s Street as well as in other Irish cities), and really, comparing her city job with her homework, well, we’re talking chalk and cheese.
It could even be as different as chalk and mozzarella cheese, in fact, given the fact that small herds of buffalo, whose milk here and elsewhere around Macroom create top cheeses, have grazed these fields at times.
The great outdoors right on your doorstep.
The Hanley family, Geraldine and Richard, arrived here from Cork city to this Lissarda hinterland homestead back about 14 years ago and fell immediately for its charms and scope.
We’re talking a location at Hornhill, Lissarda, not too far from Béal na mBláth and the Bantry line, on up to 7.5 acres of good ground which includes pasture, paddocks and two traditional curve-roofed steel barns, all in a mixed farmland setting, and with some wind turbines in the area whirring around for visual engagement.
It is, as Geraldine says, about 25 minutes from Ballincollig, 35 from Cork city, 40 minutes from the airport and about the same distance from Killarney but is, in fact, a world away from the daily grind in any or all of those referenced contact points.
“ When we first walked into the farmyard to view it, there was this magical feeling about the place. We instantly fell in love with it, and we only discovered after moving in that there was so much more to this farm than we’d first thought or appeared. There’s a perfect fairy fort nearby, and some stone circles also are within walking distance that quite a few people come out to visit” she recalls.
The move west from the city “was to give our kids a better way of life and more of an understanding of where their food came from and also to live in a community in the country, where everyone knew their neighbours,” Geraldine explains.
“I got a herd number when we first moved here and started with Angus cattle, and then bought Buffalo. We had them for a number of years and now, in the last few years I’m rearing rose veal (from humanely-reared calves in contrast to white veal) for Eoin O'Mahony butchers in the English Market.” (O’Mahonys are 40 years in the trade, doing whole-beast butchering and supplying up to 20 Cork restaurants.) She recalls swapping their beef with a sheep producer for his lamb (their son Marcel, now 29 has become a vet, working in Millstreet, who advised against rearing sheep on cost/return grounds!). “We also had our own pigs which we used to make our own sausages.
Duck into Ashmore House?
“We had turkeys and we even had a pony, we have hens and ducks and there is an abundance of wildlife from hedgehogs to buzzards, owls, bats and even deer pop in from time to time,” Geraldine extols of the bucolic, hand-on lifestyle, adding almost needlessly “they loved life growing up on the farm,” as she further adds about the scene with kids’ birthday parties centered around the two barns.
Free-range indeed.
Hornhill is on up to  7.5 acres
Time has crept up on the clan, and a move even further west might well be on the cards. Another son, Luke 21 is in college in Limerick, appropriately studying food science, while the youngest, daughter Kaelin who’s 17 is a student in Coláiste Daibheid.
The Hanleys’ south-facing Hornhill is a four-bedroomed, traditional layout two-storey Irish farm dwelling, with courtyard cluster of old outbuildings with studio/conversion potential, plus barns. A date on a pillar, 1863, may well refer to the date this gently updated and nudged along house was built, while also dating back many years is a tiny shoe from a donkey, inserted between two stones by the front door ‘for luck'. Or for tying up a sheepdog?
The land stretches to as much as 7.5 acres, but the asking price of €280,000 is for the house and 3.5 acres, with a further four acres also available by negotiation. So, it’s hobby farm-sized rather than likely to fund a family on or from its own produce, but, certainly, a good productive work-life balance is on offer.
It has two front entrances, with one in the middle of the long run of the front wall now graced by a chunky-timber sheltering porch, and inside are two reception rooms, one with a traditional fireplace the other with a pot-belly stove in a fireplace.
A bedroom at Ashmore House
Ceilings here, and in fact in most of the other rooms upstairs and down, are traditional in style, in tongue and groove timber sheeting, with some exposed beams and trusses, and décor is simple, a nod to the past really, with some wallpapered walls and others simply painted white.
The inviting /dining room is very much the heart of the house, with range cooker plus corner stove, plus old hand-painted and ‘distressed’ pine units, all watched over by roof beams decorated with tiny fairy or seed lights draped around. “My favourite place is the kitchen, where we gather around the table, for meals and great conversation. We have a lot of callers, hence the reason for the half door, it’s like a welcome on the mat,” notes Geraldine. “Friends and family and neighbours gather around our kitchen table regularly, and that’s what I wanted to achieve in this home.” Extending out from the kitchen, through a wide opening with double doors punched in the western gable is “another favourite place”, the patio with the pergola 
The centre of the home at Ashmore House, Hornhill, Lissarda, Co Cork 
and climbing plants, plus a simple steel pizza oven, making for an extension of the kitchen, of sorts.
Character abounds, and quirkiness, and it’s a real home, not a showhouse (or a window dressing job), and there’s still the feel of a genuine old farm dwelling, kept lively.
Auctioneer is John O’Mahony of OM2 estate agents in Ballincollig, and he guides the beguiling mix on 7.5 acres with outbuildings and barns all-in at €280,000, about the price of an older era three-bed semi-d in a Cork city suburb.
Preparing to have the property visited for the sale process, vendor Geraldine Hanley cheerfully reckons “we put our own stamp on it without changing the look of this beautiful house, we wanted to respect the hard work and imagination that was put into it first day, it’s a very special place.
“I wouldn't change a thing; it’s beautiful the way it is, it’s quirky and different, a bit like myself,” she quips.
VERDICT: As the song chorus goes “oh, show me a home, where the buffalo roam…”

Heifer prices, which are usually at a premium of up to 10 cents/kg over steer prices, continue at parity with steer prices, and weekly reporting by the Department of Agriculture on actual prices paid has revealed a decline in the national average base prices.
But better weather is helping finishers by easing pressure to lighten stocking rates.
Base prices for both steers and heifers are quoted this week at 360 cents/kg in general. A few processors are trying their hand at getting steers for 5 cents/kg less, but without much success.
But finishers seeking a price top-up are equally unsuccessful, at least for steers. 
For heifers, the situation is slightly less rigid, and while most of them are being bought on a 360 cents/kg base, some deals at up to 365 cents/kg base are being reported this week.

In particular, processors are willing to pay a bit more to get Hereford and Angus cross heifers.
Marketing work by members of the Hereford and Angus breed societies is paying a dividend of up to 20 cents/kg on top of the quality payment, which is worth another 20c.
There is no change in the prices for young bulls. They continue to trade at a base of 350-355 cents/kg in general for R-grade. Some of the young bulls can make up to 360c.
The cow trade is bucking the general trend, with prices edging stronger, not a bad omen for the prime beef sector.
Demand for cows eased slightly in recent weeks, but is reported to be very strong this week, with top quality cows making up to 330-335 cents/kg, and some exceptional reports of 340 cents/kg being paid for U-grade cows.
Compared to 2019, the intake of beef cattle up to September has fallen behind by about 1%. 
For the same period, live exports to the EU falling by about 27%.

A number of trends have emerged over the last nine months or so – some of which may have an impact in the months to come. But there are some negative developments around the corner too and these need to be taken into account and counterbalanced to ensure against future shocks.
The effects of Covid-19 on the agricultural land market in Ireland have been shown to be of an inconsequential nature. The omnipresence of the virus and its associated Governmental actions has, however, masked the presence of the other elements and phenomena that will shape the market over the coming months and years.
Top of the list is the issue of Brexit. It hasn’t simply gone away and recent headlines pertaining to British Government back-pedalling on international-agreed treaties have served as a timely reminder that this issue is still very much a live on that has a very direct impact on Ireland’s agricultural industry; and, by extension, on the price of agricultural land.
To date, Covid-19 and Brexit have had little impact on land values in Ireland.
“Brexit is a far more serious problem,” says Michael Brady. “As far as I’m concerned, the three biggest factors that are going to affect farmers’ purchasing power are the following: Brexit first of all. That’s the biggest risk for Irish farmers; Next is the new EU CAP reform, which is starting in 2023; the pandemic is the third most important one. And, by the time Brexit finally beds down and by the time the new CAP reform is in place, we’ll have probably forgotten about the pandemic.” 
Cork city auctioneer Thomas J O’Driscoll has also witnessed a year in which Covid-19 has had little or no impact but where the supply of good quality land in the East Cork area has been stemmed somewhere by the uncertainty surrounding both Covid and Brexit.
Mr O'Driscoll said: “It depends on the area you’re in but for good quality farmland, there’s very strong demand. I myself thought that prices might have softened but it’s going the opposite way… There aren’t too many good quality farms available, particularly in the Cork region compared to other areas. 
""People are waiting to see what’s going to happen with Brexit and with Covid. Many are holding back and hanging on and many who have made the move (to put their land on the market) have benefitted from it.” 
The potential problems that Britain’s exit from the EU has held for Irish agricultural exports was, until the pandemic, very much front and centre of news bulletins and with negotiations over the minutiae of just how Britain trades with the rest of Europe thrown into the air once more, the spectre of a difficult trading situation with our largest market hangs over the agricultural scene like a persistent cloud.
While that remains out of the hands of most of us in the country, one positive result from the fiasco has been the emergence of a new market segment of buyer in the form of farmers looking to move their operations out of the UK and into the EU in Ireland.
Macroom-based auctioneer Killian Lynch has witnessed the phenomenon of the “person moving from the UK from some form of farming enterprise that is looking to acquire a house and a large portion of land here is well. They’re there and quite active now.” 
This phenomenon the British and/or British-based Irish buyer moving lock, stock and barrel to Ireland is one that we may see more of. For most UK-based potential buyers, quarantine restrictions have forced them to stay put but a determined number of them have been active – keen to run a farming business in an English-speaking country in the EU rather than remaining in the UK.
“This has been more a result of Brexit than of the virus,” says Killian Lynch, who has noted this aspect of the market as a new development. “We’ve seen two farms in particular where there were UK-based farmers looking to come over.” 
Trevor McCarthy of Irish & European’s Cork office, who says purchasing land remains an attractive option in terms of tax efficiencies.
Investors returning to the land market with interest 
The investors – in their myriad forms – have been making their presence felt in the land market throughout the year and this sector is certainly one that is growing, with all auctioneers noticing their increasing influence on land prices.
“I’m getting plenty of enquiries from people looking at land as an investment,” says Trevor McCarthy of Irish & European’s Cork office. “Certainly with the tax efficiencies that are in place for leasing land long-term, it’s appealing to a lot of people. As well as that, there’s still a lot of cash in the banks and there’s no return being generated by the banks.”
Richard Ryan of GVM Auctioneers in Kilmallock, Co Limerick, says land is always considered to be a safe investment.
 “Land is considered a very safe investment,” says Richard Ryan. “Long-term leases are good from a taxation point of view… we’ve come across a few cases where people have said that they would rather have a ‘mud bank’ than a ‘money bank’.” 
Auctioneer David Keane in Midleton is also seeing plenty of renewed interest in land as an investment: “Investors are definitely back on the field again,” he says. “To me, there are a number of people out there with money ready to go. Land isn’t coming back in price.”
 “There’s an increased level of interest in good agricultural land,” says Éamonn McQuinn, “and the people I’m seeing at the moment are mainly investors. It’s not so much guys looking to expand dairy herds or facilities… Investors are seeing agricultural land mainly as a safe bet, given what’s going on at the moment.” 
While McQuinn and most other agents are seeing this phenomenon occurring on a more human scale with investors being made up of relatively small operators, there are also the larger-scale investors, some of whose operations are so large that they have even set up a farming function of their own. Such is the case of Coolmore Stud, for example. 
They have purchased a lot of land in South Tipperary and much of their purchased acres are being farmed by the company themselves – mostly preferring to use for tillage rather than for dairying. The Middle Eastern equestrian moguls of Kildare have also been investing in prime agricultural land, normally using the formula of purchasing and leasing.
Continuing a well-established trend the South Tipperary area remains a strong hot-spot in Munster in terms of land values. Another substantial grassland farm has just come on the market in this area with Thomas V Ryan Auctioneers in Thurles; a 60-acre roadside holding 4km from the Rock of Cashel which is already assured of drawing another strong price.
“It’s prime Golden Vale land,” says Vincent Ryan, “just off the Dundrum Road.” The property is being offered in three lots but the asking price of €16,000/acre speaks volumes of the level of confidence that there is in the agricultural land market in these parts.
All this comes at a time when the Government has persisted with its Stamp Duty rate of 7.5% on agricultural land sales (increased just under a year ago from a rate of 6%) – described by some auctioneers as a “penalty tax on farmers”.
A surge in interest in dairy farming is playing a part in keeping land prices strong.
Renewed interest in the dairying sector
 According to Michael Brady, there has been a renewed interest in the dairying sector. This, he says, doesn’t have anything to do with Covid but is rather based on the investor’s behavioural cycle playing out since the ending of milk quotas in 2015:
“In technology adoption, there’s a curve… when something new comes out, you have the innovators, followed by the early adaptors and so on. At a certain point, you have those who have been waiting in the wings to see how the new situation plays out. I think you’re seeing those investors moving into the new dairying scene now.” 
The playing out of the pent-up demand and supply from the main Lockdown period continues, meanwhile, with the market remaining active in recent months at a time of year when it would normally be far quieter:
“August is normally our quietest month of the year,” says Michael Brady. “That’s from both a consultancy and an auctioneering point of view… there are no solicitors, bankers are normally taking it easy, as are everyone else. We don’t normally get a lot of new business in August. But this August was the busiest August I’ve ever had.” 
There is also the fact, of course, that dairying is ten times more profitable than beef and, sooner or later, someone thinking of getting into farming will be far more tempted to put their money in dairying than in beef or virtually any other sector.
“I’m getting a lot of enquiries from guys looking for marginal land,” says Éamonn McQuinn. “That’s mainly to do with the new nitrates regulations from the EU… A lot of the big dairy farmers are looking for marginal ground so that their average acreage per cow increases.”
 “There are still people moving into the dairying sector,” says Richard Ryan, “but I think that a lot of people who had been planning on doing it have already done it.” 
Trevor McCarthy sees more interest in dairying but the costs of getting into the sector from scratch can be a bit too rich from many people: “There are new entrants going into it but the difficulty for new entrants is the cost… It’s often prohibitive.” 
Clonakilty-based auctioneers Hodnett-Forde have witnessed a strong level of interest in agricultural land in West Cork, with a series of strong sales recorded over the last six or seven months. There seems to be a particular focus on the more modest-sized holdings, with interest coming from various sources, many of whom are investors rather than farmers:
“We’ve sold about 470 acres in total in the Bandon region in the last few months,” says Ernest Forde, with a lot of them small holdings that have sold between €13,000 and €17,000 per acre – some of which have been sold off-market.” 
“The price of milk within the Carbery Group region is an indication of why prices are good throughout West Cork,” says John Hodnett, “and over the past few months, we’ve seen an increased interest from investors, rather than farmers, who are buying land to let out to farmers… They’re all looking for good quality rentable land.”"

A good-looking coupe SUV? What next?
We have asserted very recently — rather hotly, it has to be said — that the whole concept of a SUV coupe is one that doesn’t sit we’ll here at Examiner Motoring, the whole idea being somewhat equivalent to a question which was never asked.
It is easy to point the finger of blame at quite who thought such a thing was a good wheeze in the first place — it was BMW. The original X6 was the progenitor of the whole coupe SUV idea and when we reviewed the latest version of that car in these columns recently, we applauded the car’s on-road behaviour as top class.
When it came to the styling, however, words such as ‘hulking’, ‘gross’ and ‘ugly,’ were to the fore and the phrase ‘stylistic crime’ was mentioned.
BMW went on to make such as the X2 and the X4, two other examples of the genre and, of course with the motor industry being even more of a copy-cat business than the fashion industry, that meant that anyone else with a brand to push has gone down the same road too.
The Audi Q3 Sportback roofline is typical of the genre, but the designers have ‘muscled-up’ the look with a huge front grille, a lower shoulder line and beefed-up wheel arches.
These are polarising vehicles, those in the SUV coupe segment, and that basically means that each and every one of them are pug ugly. Do an online search of this breed of beast and you will come across descriptions of the genre as being ‘hunchback-like’ or ‘a niche going nowhere’. 
These epithets are not quite true as the segment is going somewhere and sales figures illustrate that a very sizeable cross-section of buyers is completely enamoured with the idea. BMW, after all have sold nearly half-a-million X6s since it was first launched in 2008.
According to research on the subject, typical buyers are four to five years younger than typical SUV buyers, are typically more image conscious and are less price sensitive. This means that manufacturers can charge more for these things without feeling a pinch. The thing is that if people like ugly, then manufacturers will make ugly for them — and charge them for it.
But does it really have to be like this? Well, no.
And our tester this week is testament to that fact. The Audi Q3 Sportback is an SUV coupe and, truth be known, it is actually an eye-catching and attractive thing.
That the tester came in a lurid orange (Pulse Orange on the Audi colour card) which is actually quite similar to the papaya orange which decorated the first of Bruce McLaren’s F1 and Can-Am race cars and is this year the primary colour of the McLaren F1 team which still bears the name of the legendary New Zealand driver/designer and while the vivid hue certainly made it stand out, the car is still good looking anyway.

Volvo XC40: This beautiful beast is far from a baby
Colour aside, the car’s handsome demeanour is underlined by a design which is actually intended to make the car a lot more sporty looking than it actually is. You have the sloping roofline typical of the genre, but Audi’s designers have ‘muscled-up’ the look with a huge front grille, a lower shoulder line and beefed-up wheel arches.
In reality this car is smaller than the regular Q3, what with the roofline being 49mm lower and overall width some 6mm less. The length is 16mm longer than the standard car, which is not much, but this adds to the trompe l’oeil deal here which makes you think the car is actually much bigger than it is.
The smaller interior space manifests itself particularly in terms of rear seat passengers who have to cope with less head and leg room. For families with smaller children this will not impact much, but if you got leggy friends, they will be entitled to moan. The ability of the rear bench to slide fore/aft will ease leg room issues.
That said, the boot is some 530 litres in size — not much less than the regular Q3 — and generous at that and, all told, this is one of the roomier coupe SUVs we have encountered.
On the road it is a decent whirl as well. 
As a former Audi owner and long-time fan, I would naturally lean towards having the quattro 4WD version by preference, but this thing was quite impressive for a big-ish car with front wheel drive only.
There were only minimal displays of understeer or torque steer and grip levels were generally excellent; the ride was firm but very comfortable (even on the many surfaces that masquerade as roads in this country) and the handling was predictable and secure.
On the engine front the car was fitted with a petrol 1.5 litre turbocharged petrol engine (that’s the 35 TSI version in Audi’s new and incomprehensible nomenclature regime) which is bolstered by a 48V mild hybrid system.
Now, we are familiar with this engine for some time as it is a standard in the VW parts bin by now. It outputs 150 bhp and 250 Nm of torque and will propel the car to 100 kph in 9.6 seconds and see a top speed of 204 kph. It is not terribly economical — 6.8 l/100m or 41.1 mpg — and will cost €280 annually to tax. The seven-speed auto ‘box is also really nice to live with.
The Q3 Sportback is bang up to Audi standards in terms of finish and build quality.
Combined with the hybrid system and some effectively sophisticated electronics, the Q3 Sportback can, if you adapt your driving style even a little, make the engine shut down for short periods, whereupon the battery powers everything. 
Similarly, the engine will shut down at lights or junctions, but, using the same technology which runs the adaptive cruise control, will restart when the car in front moves away.
Being essentially a city dweller, this is not a car you will be off-roading in, but it is very much the sophisticate both in terms of delivering a smooth passage and terribly stylish looks. Throw in a cabin which is bang up to Audi standards in terms of finish and build quality and you have a car which is decent to drive, lovely to be in and appealing to look at.
Without doubt the Q3 Sportback is the pick of the SUV coupe movement in looks alone, but it is also — albeit with lessened practicality than the regular car and a higher price tag — a stable and secure drive without being terribly thrilling. Others in the genre will do better driving thrills, but few look as good.
Others in the class (Volvo XC40, Range Rover Evoque and BMW X2) will do certain things much better, but there is no shame here at the sheer competence of the Audi in almost every area of endeavour.

Third generation BMW X6 is motoring Marmite"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40053236.html,2020-09-23 07:00:00,Legislation proposed to help Irish cattle farmers survive,"Independence has been a hallmark of ICMSA’s work on behalf of dairy farmers for their 70-year history.
As if to emphasise that, in their anniversary year, the Milk Suppliers Association has this week stood alone among farmer organisations in supporting the PGI application for Irish Grass Fed Beef.
ICMSA says it’s an opportunity to be seized. Few could argue with that. If the application is successful, and it’s as successful as the other products across Europe with PGI (protected geographical indication) status, it could be a game-changer for the troubled beef industry.
This identification of products linked to their place of origin is a winner with consumers who trust these quality products. It sets them apart from food commodities which may be produced in one country, processed in another, and packed in a third country.
The name of Irish Grass Fed Beef would be reserved for quality Irish beef raised on a grass-based diet on pasture grazing farms in Ireland. It’s meat from cattle raised naturally, and processed in Ireland.
Across the EU, the sales value of these protected name products is on average double that for similar products without a certification.
Foods and drinks whose names are protected by the EU’s Geographical Indications have a total sales value of €74.76bn, more than one-fifth of which is outside the EU.
Producers can sell these products at a higher price, to consumers looking for authentic regional products.
EU schemes promote the unique characteristics of such products.
They serve as flagships for the traditional culinary heritage of regions, and as economic drivers for the national agri-food sector.

IFA point to difficult harvest, as yields have remained very variable
Geographical indications represent 15.5% of the total EU agri-food exports.
That has been a help for exporters of Irish whiskey, which sits alongside other famous geographical indication beverages such as Bayerisches Bier, Champagne, Kalamata olives, Parmigiano Reggiano, Polish Vodka, Queso Manchego, and Roquefort.
The only problem is that so many people hate Ireland’s beef processors, and that’s not too strong a word for it.
ICMSA has risen above that and proposed that the farmers on whose behalf the PGI application for Irish Grass Fed Beef is being made overcome their distrust of processors (which some in farming now extend also towards Bord Bia, which is making the draft application for PGI).
The Independent TD for Clare, Michael McNamara, who has come to prominence as the chair of the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee, said in the Dáil last week that all of the schemes that Bord Bia has promoted have worked not to the benefit of producers but solely to the benefit of processors.
“They are all being used to hammer prices.
“This nationwide PGI, while a good idea in theory, will be just one more thing that farmers will be penalised by processors for not adhering to.
“Further, it will make it harder for individual farmers who wish to register a PGI, because there will be one PGI register for the whole country which will be in the control of processors rather than producers.
He said the way the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and Bord Bia work is to give power to processors rather than producers.
Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue responded that he and his Ministers of State and the DAFM will work to get the best possible return for farmers and their work.
But the truth is that farmers are not in a mood to co-operate in any way with beef processors.
In other words, nothing much has changed in farmer-processor relations since the Beef Plan blockades which ended at beef factories just over a year ago.
ICMSA president Pat McCormack, after meeting with the DAFM and Bord Bia, said there are aspects of the PGI application that should be amended, but it is a reasonable basis to get a PGI status for Irish beef without any additional conditions being imposed on farmers.
With no new conditions for farmers over and above existing Bord Bia quality schemes, McCormack suggested Bord Bia provide written assurances of no new rules and that farmers will be free to sell their cattle to whichever meat plant they wish, and to transport them to the plant themselves if they so wish.
He said beef producers, whether suckler or dairy beef, are highly vulnerable to a no deal Brexit, and PGI provides an opportunity to brand and hopefully add value.
He said PGI won’t solve profitability problems in beef production, but is a move in the right direction.
It’s the kind of constructive proposal which has helped the dairy industry progress, while the beef industry goes from crisis to crisis, at farm level at least.
Just how bad things are in the beef industry is illustrated by the bill introduced in the Dáil by Aontú party leader Peadar Tóibín, TD, seeking to ensure the provision of an equitable price for beef to farmers as a sustainable means for them to earn a livelihood.
It’s a poor state of affairs when legislation is proposed to help farmers survive while supplying raw material for an industry with €2.2bn of annual exports.
Mr Tóibín told the Dáil the processing industry operates as an oligopoly with a small number exerting enormous control over every aspect of the market, such as the price and all the conditions of sale, while supermarkets make supernormal profits from beef. Meanwhile, the farmer is generally paid less than the cost of production, and would be making a significant loss, if the European income supplementation were removed.
It will be interesting to monitor Dáil debates on the Bill. Rural TDs can hardly speak or vote against it, with few of their constituents having a good word to say for processors.
Meanwhile, the role of processors in the Covid-19 pandemic could also sway opinion against them. In fairness to processors, they have agreed a wide-ranging safety protocol with the Siptu union to suppress Covid-19 at plants and reduce the chances of future outbreaks.
However, not all meat workers get sick pay, and Siptu warned there will be more virus outbreaks at plants while that is the case.
Meat workers with symptoms don’t really have a choice but to go to work, says Siptu.
The Aontú bill proposes that beef processors pay a beef price at or above the cost of production.
That would be a dream result for cattle farmers, and hopefully processors would have a few bob left over for sick pay for all their workers.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40053218.html,2020-09-23 16:30:00,"Top-quality land on banks of Blackwater for €12,000 per acre","The fertile land in West Waterford / East Cork that’s drained by the River Blackwater supports a strong local agricultural scene, embracing all kinds of farming, with particular emphasis on the dairying, beef cattle and equestrian sectors.
A 52-acre parcel of this land has recently been launched on the market with Fermoy-base auctioneers Dick Barry & Son; a non-residential farm at Ballyduff Upper, Co Waterford.
The land is divided by the public road virtually surrounding the village of Ballyduff, with the meandering River Blackwater forming a long stretch of its boundary.
“It’s a very nice farm,” says selling agent Michael Barry. “It’s on the banks of the Blackwater and adjacent to the village... it’s top-quality land.”
Parts of the land are liable to flooding, he says, but on the occasions that it does, it drains very quickly from the land so its proximity to Munster’s premier river isn’t a disadvantage.
The accessibility of the land is a distinct advantage, with ample road frontage onto two public roads. The infrastructure on the farm is good too, making it an ideal outside farm.
“There’s a good farmyard there,” says Michael, “with cubicle house, a four-column slatted house, machinery shed, cattle crush and automatic scrapers.”
Despite the fact that the farm is literally wrapped around the village of Ballyduff, there’s no development value or promise value of any kind, the agents insist – this is a purely agricultural holding.
The heritage town of Lismore is 10km to the east, Tallow is 8km to the south, while Fermoy is over the border in Co Cork and is 18km away to the west of this farm.
“There’s been a reasonably good response already to the property,” says Michael. “A lot of the interest is local but there are a few enquiries from farther afield too. It’s a nice handy-sized parcel of land of top quality. It wouldn’t be big enough to work as a standalone farm but for an outside farm or an adjoining one, it would be ideal. With the buildings there, you could winter cattle.”
There is a mains water supply and the price guide is €12,000 per acre – a price in keeping with recent sales of quality land in the area."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40054028.html,2020-09-24 10:10:00,ICMSA@70: Farmers making their voices heard across EU ,"Kevin Galvin is a dairy farmer in Lixnaw, Co Kerry. He joined ICMSA 10 years ago and has served as chairman of the local branch.
He says the role afforded him the opportunity to gain experience, better understand the issues facing farmers and examine potential solutions to the difficulties.
He is regarded locally as a ‘scientific farmer’ where modern methods are used on grazed grass to produce as much milk as possible while keeping costs low at the same time.
“We are probably more prone to weather fluctuations than other systems so in the likes of a really dry year grass growth can drop back and in wet weather when you have cows outside it can be more difficult to keep them grazing and happy,” he added. “We are managing well so far this year anyway.” 
Meanwhile, he became chairman of the Kerry branch of ICMSA in 2015 having first joined the organisation around 2010.
“It’s about 10 years ago now since I first became involved with ICMSA; I went along to our local branch meeting in Abbeydorney,” continued Kevin.
“I was then proposed as secretary of the branch and took on that role; then I went from there to chairman and after one year and it was our area’s turn to take on the county chair.”
 He says that at the time he was involved milk prices were to the fore in Kerry and it proved to be a very busy and active time for both him and the branch. 
“At the time, my involvement was probably more than what I had anticipated because there were negotiations going on between farmers and Kerry Group regarding the leading milk price and it was the beginning of the wider debate on the issue that subsequently happened,” said Kevin.
“So, I was particularly busy that year - more so than I had expected to be. I spent a lot of time on the phone and going to meetings but it was a great experience for me and very enjoyable.”

He says that ICMSA has dairy farmers at its core.
“I know there are other farming organisations out there but because the nub of my business is dairy farming I felt that ICMSA was specific to my area of expertise,” Kevin continued.
“I know there are beef farmers in ICMSA as well and sometimes there can be a bit of conflict but because ICMSA is primarily focused on dairying there tends to be less of that conflict.” And, Munster is of course at the heart of Irish dairy farming.
But, Kevin feels that since the abolition of milk quotas more beef and tillage farmers in Leinster have made the move into dairying.
“I think the Kerry milk pool is relatively stable; if anything there are more and more suppliers dropping out of Kerry Group and the existing milk pool is therefore being maintained by the people there who are just getting bigger in scale.
“Unless farmers get involved in organisations and represent themselves nobody else is going to do it for them. I’d encourage young farmers to get involved with any farm organisation and just let their voice be heard.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40054256.html,2020-09-24 14:46:00,ICMSA@70: 'Meeting the challenges head-on',"ICMSA's President, Pat McCormack believes Irish farmers are well placed to meet the challenges ahead despite Brexit impact on the horizon, concerns around the Mercosur trade deal, the often divisive imposition on them with regard to climate change and the potential fallout from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform.
ICMSA is on top of the issues too, says Mr McCormack who was keen to highlight how farmers’ ability to adapt to change was never more evident than after the Covid-19 pandemic hit, when their willingness to embrace the technological advances that ICMSA introduced - thus changing the way in which is does its business forever - shone through.
This move, the president added, “shows how our services continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of farmers and their ability to adapt to that change”.
ICMSA President, Pat McCormack, on his Tipperary farm.
“There was no greater change than in 2020; farmers had to embrace technology in order to stay in touch because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions it brought with it.
“ICMSA embraced that technology and was able to hold its national council meetings as a result.
“The various committee meetings were also held remotely and all of that was a huge leap for the organisation in 2020.” 
Meanwhile, Mr McCormack pointed to the “positive solutions” ICMSA is focused on and ensuring that the voice of Ireland’s dairy and beef farmers are heard ‘loud and clear’ through policy formation around the farming and agri-food sectors.
He was also focused on creating the necessary conditions to encourage more interaction and communication from members, and all of this fell into place, it seems, when the move to technology became a reality for ICMSA members because of Covid-19.
“It’s not easy to bring one hundred people together virtually but with cooperation, training and understanding all of that was achieved,” Mr McCormack continued.
“It also meant that members from all over the country could participate in meetings and communicate with each other without facing into two or three hour journeys each way.” The ICMSA president - who has been in situ since December 2017 - also highlighted the importance of EU Covid-19 support packages that have come Ireland’s way over the last few months.
It was never as important as it is now, he added, “to support local”.
“Nobody anticipated Covid-19 nor its consequences from a financial point of view,” Mr McCormack said.
“On the back of that, what we need to do now as a nation is to support local in the months ahead and stimulate our small companies and individuals who are running businesses to keep them afloat.
“It is absolutely imperative that we keep rural Ireland afloat and vibrant to provide security for the generations ahead as well as for ourselves.”

On the dairy front, McCormack says ICMSA is as relevant now as it was in the days when milk quotas were to the fore.
In fact he served as chairman of the Dairy Committee from December 2009 right up to the abolition of milk quotas in 2015.
“The organisation was very relevant during that time, whether it was guys with flexi-milk or guys dealing with TB that were looking for quota.
“But equally I’d like to think that we have been as relevant since the abolition of quotas and focusing on expansion, market and ultimately on where the premium of our product lies.” But, of course, it’s that premium and the quality of the product being produced that is at the very core of many of the challenges on Irish farms.
‘It is hugely challenging because obviously we want to see the premium back with the primary producer,” he continued.
“In dairy there has been huge expansion and a lot of money has been invested by both farmers and on their behalf in ‘stainless steel’ because ultimately that money is coming out of the c/lr.
“We have seen in recent time with Ornua index adjustments that there is significant debt out there and ICMSA needs to remain relevant so we can ensure that the primary producer is getting a fair price for their product.” So, what achievements has ICMSA had during Mr McCormack’s tenure as president?

Participating in last year’s beef talks at Ag House and coming out with results was one, says Mr McCormack.
“In my time as president one of the ICMSA’s greatest achievements was to participate in the beef talks and to come out with 0- and 4+ as part of the Quality Assurance (QA) bonus scheme.
“We would feel that the dairy herd has a significant part to play in the beef industry here in Ireland; 56% of the kill comes from the dairy herd and the UK - which is our largest single market - is supplied by cattle from the dairy herd.
“To get the recognition of those animals was quite an achievement given that there were a lot of farm organisations - newly established and otherwise - that wouldn’t have had the same interest in the cattle coming from the dairy herd.” Mr McCormack also pointed to the threat posed by Mercosur - the EU and Mercosur states Argentina, Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay, reached a political agreement for an ambitious, balanced and comprehensive trade agreement on June 28, 2019 - to the Irish beef sector.
As a result, the potential for cheaper south American beef to flood the UK market remains high, bringing with it concerns around subsequent impact on Irish beef being exported into the UK.
Mr McCormack says that while it certainly poses a threat, there is an urgent need for consumers to become more aware of production standards in non-EU countries.
“Mercosur is a huge threat but people need to be aware of standards in the different jurisdictions and become more balanced in their expectations,” he added.
“You can’t expect the Irish and European dairy farmers - whether it’s dairy or beef - to produce a top quality environmentally friendly product where animal welfare is to the fore and then compete with these barrons that will come in through the Mercosur countries.
“So, there needs to be a huge degree of consistency from the consumer because unfortunately - as primary producers - we are probably getting a price that we got 30/35 years ago.”

Such changes over those years have seen “beef farmers squeezed out of the system of beef production and dairy farmers increasing their stock”, ICMSA’s president says.
“Dairy farmers are now having to produce a lot more product to have the same income because the margin isn’t there.
“That is not sustainable and the consumer needs to become more aware of that.
“You can’t have a sustainable environment if you don’t have sustainable producers.
“And a producer has to be economically sustainable so they can stimulate the various elements that are required to be environmentally sustainable in the first instance.
“A quality product comes at a cost and it’s as simple as that.
“The vast majority of farming in Ireland is based on the family farm model where food is produced as close to eco-friendly as is possible.
“This compares greatly to some of our global counterparts who engage in intensive farming systems.
“The animals are grass fed in Ireland and it really is only in recent times that we have begun to capitalise on that.
“Hopefully we will get a PGI status in the months and years ahead so we will be able to fully capitalise on that.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40054697.html,2020-09-25 10:34:00,Annual poll offers insights into rural Irish communities,"ICMSA, and the dairy farmers it represents, have done much to throw open the gates of farms to the general public, and to reveal farmer attitudes, by participating since 2013 in the annual Irish Examiner-ICMSA Farming Opinion Poll.
Not all representative organisations are so open-minded.

But ICMSA has been at the other end of the scale, putting their money to work as supporters of the annual survey which revealed the thinking of farmers from 2013 until last year. This year, the survey was rendered impossible to carry out by the Covid-10 pandemic.
Although some of the survey findings did not paint farmers in a flattering light, ICMSA never flinched and continued to support it.
For example, in the first year of the survey, many were startled by more than 80% of farmers saying they should be allowed to own a gun to protect themselves and their property.
There was another shock in 2016, with almost one in four farmers admitting they had driven home after consuming as many as three pints in the previous months, and one in five saying they would feel “safe enough” getting behind the wheel after drinking as many as four pints.
But ICMSA welcomed the opinion poll’s success in becoming a landmark survey, timed each year to coincide with the National Ploughing Championships, when the country’s media turns its attention to farming and rural matters.
Through its co-sponsorship of the survey, ICMSA has done the sector a service. Until the Irish Examiner-ICMSA Farming Opinion Poll came on the scene, agriculture had not been well serviced with reliable surveys, mostly because of the prohibitively high cost of interviewing geographically dispersed farmers nationwide, in numbers large enough to obtain statistically reliable national results.
This ICMSA and Irish Examiner opinion polls of 2018 and 2019 showed strong farmer engagement with climate change issues.
The Irish Examiner, and Behaviour & Attitudes, Ireland’s largest independent market research company, came up with a solution — more than 500 interviews with adult farm family members at agricultural shows over a two-week period.
Random probability sampling was used to improve the reliability of the survey results.
With up to 569 interviews each year, the sample size is large enough for findings to be reliable, within a statistical margin of error of plus or minus 4%.
The Irish Examiner ICMSA farming poll has provided a robust and accurate snapshot of the attitudes, beliefs and opinions of the farming community about a range of issues, both farming and social. And the year-to-year consistency of the methodology has reliably revealed the trends in farming.
That trend can be very briefly summarised as optimism ebbing away in farming every year since the Irish Examiner ICMSA farming opinion poll started in 2013.
Seven years ago, four out of five farmers weren’t shy about telling the interviewers they were optimistic.
In the meantime, there have been ups and downs in farmers’ opinions, but the 2019 poll provided the evidence for ICMSA president Pat McCormack to state that “farmers were under attack on many fronts”.
Brexit, the bitter beef dispute, and scapegoating of the sector as a climate change culprit had obviously fuelled increasing pessimism among farmers.
Only 32% of respondents were positive about farming in general — down from 66% a year previously, and from 79% in 2013.
The lesson from the survey for policy-makers is that farming confidence is a precious but easily damaged commodity.
The simmering dissatisfaction among beef farmers that exploded in 2019 came as no surprise to observers of the poll results.
Cattle farmers got a rush of blood to the head in 2013, with 79% telling pollsters they were optimistic.
By 2016, even after a good year for Irish cattle prices in 2015, fewer than 60% were optimistic.
First Brexit, then beef farming setbacks, and climate scapegoating to follow have beaten farmers down.
In 2018, the annual Irish Examiner/ICMSA opinion poll revealed one-in-five farmers fearing climate change could drive them from the industry.
In 2016, ICMSA president John Comer said, “This is the fourth year that ICMSA and the Irish Examiner have come together to commission and publish what has become the most definitive snapshot of the attitudes and ambitions of the farming community.
This 2018 ICMSA and Irish Examiner poll shows a cautious expansion in dairy in the years following the 2015 abolition of the EU milk quotas which restricted dairy output volumes.
“We are proud of our association with this survey. It seems to us to be more vital than ever that the voices of the farmers themselves, from every part of the state, across all ages and through all sectors, are allowed to express their current feelings on a wide range of issues unfiltered by any particular agenda or preconception.
“That was our original aim in getting involved and we hope that the integrity and independence of those motives is reflected both in the findings and in the spirit with which they will be received. That this year’s survey shows a sector both anxious and increasingly pessimistic cannot be surprising.
Three years later, Pat McCormack was saying the poll results were “revealing and understandable”, and reflected a nervousness around the nightmare Brexit scenario at the time.
The survey has revealed how the UK vote for Brexit in June, 2016 has eroded Irish farmer confidence; in the autumn of 2017, seven out of every eight farmers surveyed feared a Brexit setback.
Crucially, along with mapping farmer attitudes, the poll checked their political leanings.
Farmers are one of the most politically active and engaged groups, with nine out of ten telling pollsters they had voted in the previous election.
The poll has confirmed the bulk of farmers remained committed to the two leading parties.
However, in September, 2019, the poll revealed increasing support for Independent candidates, up five points to 10%, with Labour on 1%, and Sinn Féin on 3%.
But the big finding was significant numbers of Fine Gael voters switching allegiance to Fianna Fáil.
One in 10 of farmers who had voted for Fine Gael in the previous general election said they would change to Fianna Fáil. Only 3% who gave top preference to Fianna Fáil in 2016 indicated they would switch to Fine Gael.
It was food for thought for the parties as they went to the country five months later.
This graphic shows how the ICMSA and Irish Examiner opinion poll tracks a general decline in optimism among farmers about the future of the sector.
In the poll, Fine Gael remained the most popular party, with 29% of farmers inclined to give them the first preference. But that was down from 40% in 2017, while Fianna Fáil support stayed near 25% in the 2019, 2018, and 2017 polls.
About 28% of farmers in the 2019 poll were uncertain who they would vote for.
Along with the overall trend of farmer confidence waning since 2013, the poll provided other pointers to politicians on farmer voter intentions.
The answers to a 2019 question revealed that more than 80% of farmers and farm families felt no political party represented rural Ireland properly.
The 2019 poll, five months before the eventual election, also had 86% of respondents saying Leo Varadkar’s administration was too focused on the capital, including 93% of those surveyed in the 55 to 64 age bracket.
Poll after poll has indicated that Simon Coveney is one of the farmers’ favourite politicians. As Taoiseach Enda Kenny came under pressure to step down as head of Fine Gael, 35% of those questioned in the Irish Examiner/ICMSA poll stated they would choose Mr Coveney as his successor (compared to 23% favouring Leo Varadkar). Farmers have not forgotten their good years while Coveney served as Agriculture Minister from 2011 to 2016, a period during which farm income consistently trended upwards.
The poll has helped to keep policymakers focused on rural crime.
in its very first year, more than 80% of farmers saying they should be allowed to own a gun to protect themselves and their property significantly raised awareness of rural vulnerability.
In 2016, the Irish Examiner/ICMSA opinion poll had more than one-fifth saying they or a member of their immediate family has been the victim of crime in the last 12 months. However, 60% of respondents said they had no experience of crime.
Last year, the poll findings indicated that 25% own a gun and 28% of respondents said they would use a gun if required if they or their family was threatened.
There was a poll message also for the Department of Agriculture; over many years, farmers in the poll said the civil servants in Agriculture House are too strict in their implementation of EU legislation, with up to 78% of those polled agreeing this was the case.
Along the way, the survey’s finger of the pulse of farming has revealed interesting attitudinal shifts.
It revealed that by 2017, farmers in the poll were climate change believers, with 88% of farmers agreeing climate change was a reality.
This conversion began in 2016, when the 526 farmers surveyed in the poll were asked what they thought of the statement that “Irish farmers should cut back production in order to reduce global warming”.
Only 53% disagreed, down from 75% in 2015.
Surprisingly farmers aged 65 plus, at 38%, are most likely to agree that Irish farmers should cut back production in order to reduce global warming.
Nearly one in three was fairly or very interested in forestry, 16% were non-commital, and 54% were not interested (mostly because their land quality was too good).
Also in 2017, the national opinion poll showed 59% support for a 32-county Ireland among farmers, down from 69% two years previously.
In 2016, there was a particularly interesting result for ICMSA and its dairy farmer members, when the poll very accurately predicted the success in Ireland of the EU aid scheme to reduce milk production.
In poll interviews weeks ahead of the September 15 closing date for the scheme, one-third of dairy farmers said they were ready to accept the EU financial incentive in return for cutting milk production. The poll accuracy was confirmed when the final results of the scheme showed 32% participation in Ireland, the third highest in the EU."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/people/arid-40056329.html,2020-09-29 06:00:00,"From organics to robotics, these families are farming for the future","Farming is in our blood — we have always been an agricultural nation, living off the land and rearing livestock. Of course, it hasn’t always been an easy way of life and there are still many challenges. Despite this, for many people, farming is something their families have always done, and they are continuing the tradition.
However, many modern farmers are using different methods and equipment to their ancestors and are updating their skills as part of a new generation of farming.
Edward Hanbridge is one such farmer. For as long as he can remember, his family has worked on the land and now he continues to work alongside his father and brother — but while the trio still keep cattle and sheep, he has branched out into organic farming.
“My grandfather bought our farm in 1952 and bought Keadeen mountain in 1954,” says the Wicklow man who is married to Sharon and has three children, Erin, Finn, and Donnacha. 
“We are cattle and sheep farmers and, a few years ago, I leased some ground off my father to do my own thing. A lot of the land I have is on the mountain, so I got Dexter cattle as it suits the terrain.
“Then, in 2015, I decided to go into organic farming as the payment scheme (for organic farming) was available at the time so it made sense to go for it.
“I also have some land on the home farm, and I started growing hemp on that, so now, everything I do is organic.” 
Being organic means not using regular fertiliser, which is not only costly, but is also a lot more laborious. But the father of three says it’s worthwhile.
“There is a lot more involved in organics,” he says. 
We can’t use regular fertiliser so instead use manure or seaweed and we also practice regenerative farming which involves moving stock frequently so we can look after the biological aspect of the soil.
“So there is a lot more to it but, unfortunately, while everyone likes the idea of organically produced food, they don’t want to pay for it. Perhaps they don’t realise the amount of work involved, the meal we use is three times the price of conventional and if we sell our organic lamb to most factories, they don’t give us any extra for it, so it can be difficult.” 
While there are undoubtedly many extra layers to organic farming, the fifth-generation farmer says there are benefits.
“Farming has changed a lot since my father’s time, the profits aren’t what they used to be and there is a lot of work involved,” he says. “But organics works for us because the hilly land is suitable for it and we are rearing high-quality produce, which we also sell in meat boxes, and are also processing the hemp to make oil, so this is another source of income.
“What we do is more than just a job, it’s a lifestyle. I’m my own boss, out in the fresh air, have no commute to worry about, I don’t answer to anyone and choose my own hours. Of course, some days I might be working for 14 hours, but I couldn’t ever see myself doing anything else.”
Eileen Clarke and family
Eileen Clarke and her husband Paddy also practise organic farming but have started using robotics which puts a thoroughly modern spin on their day-to-day working life.
“I was born and reared on a farm and always had an interest in it,” says Eileen, who has two children, Jack and Patrick, and a third on the way.
“Paddy and I got married in 2015 and discussed different options for our future and decided that suckler and sheep weren’t giving us the return for our time investment.
“So after investigating various alternatives, we decided on dairying because I had a keen interest in the new technology and Paddy had a strong knowledge of animal husbandry.” 
The Longford pair decided to go down the route of robotic milking and put a plan in place to move with beef to dairy conversion.
“Our beef farm was under organic status, so we progressed to supplying Aurivo organic milk,” says Eileen. 
I became more involved, checking and maintaining the robots, grass measuring, and feeding and rearing calves.
“Then, we came to the conclusion that our farm was capable of milking 120+ cows, so we decided to expand to a two-robot unit which was installed in March 2020.” 
Part of the high-tech farming involves monitoring and inputting data and robot maintenance, as well as maintaining the correct management of grass and attending regular local Lely discussion groups to ensure everything is on track.
“To date, we have two Lely robots and a Lely Robotic Scrapper,” says Eileen. “All the information is on a computer programme called Time 4 Cows (T4C) which is available instantly and allows for proactive decision making. Each cow wears a collar with a responder unit that monitors movement, health, and activity.
“It allows the robot to identify each cow and there is built-in, long-distance heat detection. During pre-breeding season, I monitor the computer remotely and record heats daily. This allows us to see that all cows are cycling before breeding season commences and they are routed automatically to the separation area when they are in heat and held there for AI.
“The collars also monitor the cow’s movement and activity and over time build up a picture of its health, while milk temperature is also recorded. If a cow’s temperature or activity is out of the ordinary, she will appear on the Health Report and this allows you to flag potential problems before she gets too ill.” 
Doing a traditional job with modern conveniences is hugely rewarding, but the seasoned farmer would advise anyone who is thinking of going down the same route to get some advice before making decisions.
“The sort of farming we do offers a lot of flexibility, is family-friendly, and the systems can be monitored and inputted remotely,” she says. “There is also great information available to help with decision making but it does require a large capital investment and can be difficult to manage outdoor grazing at certain times of the year. And, of course, we are always on call if the robot goes down.
“My advice to someone considering this would be to invest wisely on infrastructure to reduce the overall workload on the farm and visit other farms to get advice and ideas on what works best.” 
Maria Flynn and husband David. 
Eileen is undoubtedly a hands-on farmer but there was a time when farming was considered to be a man’s job. However, Maria Flynn, who lives in Drogheda with her husband David and son Daniel, says times are changing.
With no previous knowledge of farming when she got married, she now grows specialty heritage potatoes and vegetables which she sells to wholesalers and through their farm shop.
“Once I’ve dropped Daniel to school, I start deliveries to our four wholesalers, then I head back to the yard to prepare deliveries for the following day and organise vegetable picking,” she says. 
“Throughout the week, I will spend my days walking the fields to check crops and marketing the produce to chefs on our social media platforms.
“Farming is still traditionally seen as a male role, but there are more and more females adding value to farm revenue by working and running farm businesses, and I also think there may be an increase in females pursuing third-level farming courses.
“This is something I would encourage as it is important to have a solid education before getting into farming. The farming landscape is changing rapidly so it’s important to be open-minded and open to change.”

However, the government has met a fairly hostile reception, not helped by its own failings, writes Elaine Loughlin
Government formation: A century of rival bridged
When the dust settled and the empty ballot boxes were stacked away after February’s vote, the leaders of the three main political parties must have been scratching their heads.
The result of this year’s general election failed to leave any party with a clear or significant majority resulting in a prolonged negotiating process which was drawn out even further by the Covid emergency.
Fianna Fáil’s 38 Dáil seats provided them a margin of just one on Sinn Féin, who cleaned up across the country, taking 37 seats.
Mary Lou McDonald’s one regret was not running more candidates. Fine Gael couldn’t be ruled out either, after returning 35 TDs.
Sinn Féin were left scrambling for support from the smaller parties and Independents after both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael refused to do business with them.
Leo Varadkar also appeared to rule out leading his party into any type of Government, stating he would “relish the challenge of leading the opposition, providing good, robust, detailed, and forensic analysis to the next government”.
But as the days and weeks wore on, Mr Varadkar’s party began to reassess.
Doing a deal with another party is always a fraught process, as sharing power with others doesn’t come naturally in politics. But for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to even consider a deal together required a new level of pride- swallowing.
While Ms McDonald’s party made half-hearted attempts to assemble a government of the left, increasingly the attention turned to the two civil war parties.
In April, with the country in lockdown, both parties agreed to put their fractured past behind them and entered into a ‘shared future’ agreement.
The document, which was finally hammered out four months after the country went to the polls and involved a rotating Taoiseach, bridged a century of rivalry between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael . The Green Party was added into the mix to make up the numbers.
On June 27, in the vast auditorium of Dublin’s Convention Centre, Micheál Martin was nominated and voted in as the Taoiseach of the 33rd Dáil and another page of Irish history was written.
Green party leadership: Politics is a fickle game.
When Eamon Ryan was first elected leader of the Greens back in 2011, he vowed to attract a new generation to the party.

Nine years later, it was this new generation of Green Party members that almost cost him the leadership The Green Party constitution dictates that a leadership contest must be held within six months of a general election, so the race itself came as no surprise.
Mr Ryan, who steered his party from the total wipeout of 2011 to the green wave of the 2019 local and European elections, went into the competition having secured an unprecedented 12 Dáil seats.
He should have felt confident that his position was secure, but the opposite was the case.
As the party expanded, rumblings began to grow and an increasing rump of younger and more radical members put their support behind deputy leader Catherine Martin.
Covid forced the contest online and the four leadership debates were held over Zoom, but this did not dilute the deep divisions that emerged and came to a head, often with pointed and personal attacks.
Allegations of bullying within the party swirled, with Mr Ryan telling one of the online hustings that the party had been “swamped” by this issue.
In the end, Mr Ryan retained his position as Green Party leader by a margin of just 48 votes.
“It was a really close result,” Mr Ryan said in his acceptance speech. “There is no two ways about that. The result could have gone either way. I will reflect on that.” 
The Green Party split: The decision to enter Government was the match that lit the fire.
Negotiations on entering power with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had left the Green party bruised and battleweary, with many coming away extremely disappointed.
The internal party discussions around the programme for government had sparked lengthy and at many times fractious debates between those who wanted to do a deal and those who believed the party would be better placed in opposition.
Two distinct groups emerged — the environmental side and the social justice group.
These arguments around policy and the party’s future became the catalyst for the creation of a splinter group of members who wanted to stick with the green agenda, but couldn’t stomach many of the decisions that were being made in their name.
In entering Government, the party lost a number of high-profile members, including Saoirse McHugh who had ran as a Green in the European elections. She hit out at a “toxic” culture within the organisation. Many agreed with her position and the views of other defectors but didn’t want to fully give up on the party.
On July 24, just a month after the Government was formed, a affiliate group was established with a stated aim to “educate, agitate and organise for social justice, peace and community, inside and outside the party”.
The ‘Just Transition Greens’ were set up ahead of the leadership contest and a letter signed by founding members of the group claimed that both candidates needed to do more to engage with the social justice element of the party, as well as with rural and disadvantaged communities.
“We have heard that our party needs structural change to cope with the enormous increase in members and staff, and cultural change to unite and heal the divisions which have been caused in recent months,” Ms Martin said after she lost the leadership race to Mr Ryan.
Cabinet anger: When the prizes have to be split three ways, someone is going to end up upset.
But when Micheál Martin announced his Cabinet, it resulted in an outcry of consternation from all angles. The lack of women and omission of representation in the west were major issues and individuals who felt they deserved a promotion aired their grievances.

Cabinet announcements and reshuffles always ruffle feathers, however, in the days following the Cabinet announcement there was a vocal outpouring of discontent.
Veteran Limerick TD Willie O’Dea was among those to hit out at the ministerial choices, claiming the Taoiseach had “insulted” the people of Limerick.
“I am bitterly disappointed for the people of Limerick that the third city of the Republic and economic driver of the Mid-West has been completely overlooked for either senior or junior ministerial appointments,” he said.
“I have been inundated with messages from people who feel let down and grossly insulted.” Michael Moynihan, who had been a long-time supporter of Mr Martin accused the new Taoiseach of “disrespecting both him and his community”.
Such was his anger that the Cork North-West TD demanded a meeting with the leader.
“It was a full and frank discussion,” said Mr Moynihan. “I gave it to him both barrels. We had a very fraught discussion, I explained a few home truths to him. It was a very frank discussion.” Others within the party pointed to the obvious omissions of Dublin Bay South TD Jim O’Callaghan from Cabinet and the decision to give deputy leader Dara Calleary the role of chief whip instead of a ministry.
There was undoubtedly disappointment among the Fine Gael ranks too with a number of heavy hitters including seasoned ministers Michael Ring, Richard Bruton, and Michael Creed getting the axe. However, Leo Varadkar’s party was more gracious, or at least less public, when it came to expressing their anger.
It wasn’t all rosy in the Green Party either, as the lack of female representation was raised.
Deputy leader Catherine Martin said that the Green Party junior ministerial appointments were a “missed opportunity to promote women”.
“We talk the talk in relation to promoting diversity and inclusivity but if we’re not acting on it I think that’s regrettable and that’s something I’d like to see changed,” she said.
Barry Cowen: The ultimate political price
Barry Cowen paid the ultimate political price for what he described himself as “terribly stupid, stupid mistake”.
In the end it was the slow but constant drip-feed of information around the TD’s drink-driving debacle that put an end to his short-lived career in the Department of Agriculture.
Barry Cowen's sacking as Minister for Agriculture will provide many tie breaker pub quiz questions. Picture: Harry Burton
When the story first broke, it was reported that Mr Cowen had been stopped at a checkpoint and had found to be over the limit. He had also been driving on a provisional licence at the time.
The Offaly TD issued a statement saying he was “profoundly sorry” and the Taoiseach, who had learned of the conviction the day before it hit the media, said he was “disappointed” that he had come to know of the incident in this manner.
In the following days there were multiple apologies from Mr Cowen, both in the Dáil chamber and to the media.
He told the Dáil that he had been stopped on his way home from the All Ireland football final but stressed that it had been a “stupid mistake”.
“Before the match I consumed two drinks and following the game had a light meal before driving home to Offaly,” he said. “On the way to drop my friend home I was stopped by gardaí and asked to participate in a breathalyser test. I did so, and both this test and a subsequent test at a local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit.” Although the opposition were still baying for blood, it seemed as though the controversy was abating.
However, there was one last plot twist when it was reported that Mr Cowen had been pursued by gardaí after doing a U-turn before the checkpoint.
He strenuously claimed this was a false account and hit out the leaking of garda files from the pulse system.
The following Tuesday, the Taoiseach again faced a barrage of questions from Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald.
Mr Martin provided a cautious defence.
Just before 9pm on July 14, a total of 18 days after the controversy first emerged, Mr Martin went to the Dáil to announce he had sacked Cowen over his refusal to make a further statement.
Golfgate 
It was just after 7pm a quiet Thursday evening when a story was posted on the Irish Examiner website and immediately phones began to ping.
Irish Twitter had already gone into meltdown by 9.06pm when then Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary tweeted an explanation and an apology.
“Last night I attended a function I committed to a number of weeks ago, to pay tribute to a person I respected and admired greatly. In light of the public health guidance this week I should not have attended the event, I wish to apologise unreservedly to everyone.” But that was just the start of what would evolve into a scandal involving a Government minister, multiple senators, a European Commissioner and a Supreme Court Judge.
The gathering of people for a post-golf social dinner at a hotel in Clifden, Co Galway would set off a domino of resignations and enrage the public many of whom had made significant sacrifices since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.

The first head to roll was that of the Fianna Fáil deputy leader, who by 8am the following day had announced he would be standing down. A slew of apologies and party whip removals followed as the day progressed.
RTÉ’s Liveline show is always a good barometer of public interest. For days there was wall to wall fury with members of the public lining up to vent to Joe, one listener dubbing it “a thundering and lightning disgrace”.
On twitter #georgeforeman was trending in Ireland, not because lockdown had renewed an interest in home cooking but because the famous grill had been one of the prizes on offer at the Oireachtas gold society event.
The story of a social gathering in a Connemara hotel became an international scandal and was even picked up by the New York Times. It also severely damaged the credibility of the Government and raised questions around a ‘them and us’ mentality when it came to Covid restrictions.
Phil Hogan: Golf spoiled many a fine walk and a political career too
Big Phil Hogan first entered politics at the age of 22 when he won a seat on Kilkenny County Council.
In the end ,it wasn’t the ballot box that halted his political career (which in the intervening time led him to the Dáil, Seanad, ministerial office, and the European Commission) but his beloved pastime of golf.
While Dara Calleary’s resignation was swiftly delivered, it was another six days and took interventions from both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste before EU Commissioner Phil Hogan came to the “reluctant conclusion” that he should step down from his Brussels post.
Former EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan's travels in Ireland this summer eventually led to his resignation but not before public pressure mounted. Picture: Harry Burton
As controversy rumbled on and Mr Hogan refused to budge, the Taoiseach said he had “undermined the whole approach to public health in Ireland”.
The focus had turned not only to Mr Hogan’s attendance at the golf event, but had also shifted to his movements around the country when he returned from Brussels.
When asked about the Government advice to restrict movement during an RTÉ interview, Mr Hogan said: “Well, I don’t accept that… I did everything possible to ensure that I was no risk to anybody.” Bowing out, Mr Hogan insisted he had “broke no law”.
A defiant Mr Hogan added: “It was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU Commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead.” But the scandal didn’t end with Mr Hogan’s departure. The Government tested Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s patience when they mulled over who they would select as candidates to replace the Trade Commissioner.
For a while it seemed as if the Government would go against the request for a male and female candidate as it was rumoured that Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney would be the only name put forward.
However, a direct intervention from Ms von der Leyen through the European People’s Party, forced the Government’s hand and Mairéad McGuinness and Andrew McDowell were eventually put forward as candidates.
Mixed messages: Confusion gave opposition much ammunition
“Good morning everyone, I need to speak to you about Coronavirus and Covid-19,” Leo Varadkar began.
Members of the media who had gathered outside for a hastily arranged early morning briefing on the steps of Blair House in Washington knew something significant was afoot. But the announcement delivered before the sun had fully come up was stark.
Announcing the closure of schools and restrictions on gatherings, the then taoiseach said: “I know that some of this is coming as a real shock and it’s going to involve real changes in the way we live our lives and I know that I am asking people to make enormous sacrifices, but we are doing it for each other, together we can slow the virus in its tracks and push it back.
“Acting together as a nation we can save many lives, our economy will suffer but it will bounce back, lost time in school or college will be recovered and in time our lives will go back to normal.” Almost seven months on and we all know that normality is still a long way off.
However, as the virus lingers and public unity has waned and fatigue has set in. The opposition has been quick to point to a lack of coherent messaging coming from the new Government, something which is crucial in maintaining public buy-in.
From confused guidelines, to policy changes and row-backs, this Government has given the opposition ample fodder to chew on.
In a television interview over the summer, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly baffled viewers when he tried to compare the corona-virus to jumping on a trampoline.
There was further confusion when Mr Donnelly said he was examining “appropriate powers” to deal with house parties, but the Cabinet put a stop to his gallop and ended any notion of allowing gardaí enter private homes.
Another kite that was quickly pulled out of the sky was a proposal to issue on-the-spot fines to those who refuse to wear masks and we are still waiting for rapid testing at airports which has been signalled for many months now.
However, perhaps the biggest calamity came on the launch day of the Government’s much anticipated medium-term Covid strategy.
While the plan set out five levels of restrictions, which aimed to give the public a clear idea of how the new normal will be applied to their lives in the coming months, Dublin was placed on a limbo level and stuck somewhere between stage two and three.
The day went from bad to worse for Mr Martin and his Government when the Cabinet was forced into self-isolation after Mr Donnelly fell ill. The Dáil was halted by a panicked Ceann Comhairle. Proceedings resumed a few hours later with junior ministers substituting for Cabinet ministers who were still restricting their movements.
In the end, Mr Donnelly’s test came back negative, but a day in which the Government had hoped to get its message back on track had gone completely off the rails.
July stimulus: Ambitious and unprecedented
Credit where it’s due, it’s one they definitely got right.
In July, the Government announced an unprecedented €7.8bn stimulus package to kick-start the economy and protect jobs.
The plan was an ambitious but much much needed move and included a surprise cut in the standard rate of Vat from 23% to 21%, at a cost of €440m.
The stimulus package includes over €4bn of direct expenditure, €1bn of taxation measures to directly support businesses as well as €2bn in credit guarantees.
Announcing the plan which involves 50 different measures, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the raft of supports would protect existing jobs while creating new and sustainable employment options in the months and years ahead.
“These measures will support small and medium businesses, give young people greater opportunities in training and education, support workers who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and rejuvenate communities worst affected by the economic impact of the virus,” Mr Martin said.
The package includes €30m for the refurbishment of social housing stock; a stay and spend scheme to encourage people to holiday in Ireland; 35,000 extra places provided in further and higher education as well as 0% interest for the first year of SME loans.
The employment wage support scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment have been extended until April of next year.
Leaving Cert: Stressful at the best of times
The Leaving Cert is always a stressful time, but this year 61,000 students had to deal with the postponement and eventual cancellation of the State exams followed by the clunky rollout of a brand new assessment system.
Uncertainty abounded as the Government scrambled to come up with a new marking system and refused to release details of the controversial algorithm that they used to decide on individual grades.
The Leaving Cert results looked like the only thing the Government had managed to get right until this week when coding errors in the calculated grade system were admitted to. Picture: Harry Burton
The vast majority of students accessed their results — which were arrived at through a mixture of teacher assessments and a complex system of algorithms — online. The usual jubilant scenes of teenagers hugging outside of school gates did not happen this year as pupils were urged to stay at home.
When schools were first closed back in March there was still a hope that the Leaving Cert examinations could be sat as usual.
As students continued to work at home and accessed lessons online where broadband permitted, the reality of the pandemic was beginning to sink in for the Government.
In April, when the Junior Certificate was cancelled, it was decided postpone the State exams until the end of July.
Then education minister Joe McHugh had hoped that students would get back into classrooms for two weeks before exams kicked off on July 29, but details around timetabling and other logistics remained unclear.
But the holding of exams was always just Plan A and Mr McHugh in May said “Any minister who gave a guarantee on anything would be living in a fool’s paradise”.
A few weeks later, the Government was forced to go with plan B, a newly devised calculated grades system that would ask teachers “to draw on existing records and available evidence, to provide a fair, reasonable and carefully considered judgment of the most likely percentage mark that each student would have achieved”.
Newly appointed Education Minister Norma Foley, who maintained that students would be treated “fairly and equitably”, came under sustained pressure to explain and publish the system used to calculate Leaving Cert grades.
Serious flaws in the calculated grades system in the UK only added to the concerns of students.
With students already logged on to virtual third- level courses, it had been assumed that the Leaving Cert debacle had come to an end.
That was until this week when the Taoiseach unexpectedly announced in the Dáil that the Department of Education has found two errors in the Leaving Certificate calculated grades system.
The errors identified by the department affect around 10% of pupils many of whom have already started third-level courses.

Elaine Loughlin: Historic coalition just lurching from one calamity to another
The Leaders' report card after 100 days
Micheál Martin: D+ 
Taoiseach Micheál Martin. 
It has been a bumpy 100 days for Micheál Martin, who has steered the Government from one crisis to another all while trying to pacify an unruly and vocal rump in his own party.
As Mr Martin tried to readjust from the role of opposition leader to that of Taoiseach it seemed he was being confronted with a new crisis with every day.
The antics of those within his own party have not helped matters and have led to “leaky shoes” jokes over the number of shots Fianna Fáil have fired at their own feet.
In the days where the country came together to halt the spread of Covid-19, Fianna Fáil was tearing itself apart.
“Fianna Fáil, more so than Fine Gael, have this dissident wing that seems to believe that the glory days are just waiting to be reclaimed,” said Gary Murphy of DCU. “That’s not happening, that somehow a new leader and a new vision will change the party’s fortunes. The glory days they yearn for are long gone.” However, the past two weeks have signalled a turn in the road for Fianna Fáil and Mr Martin appears to have got to grips with his new role as leader of Government. His Covid-19 addresses, while stark in their content, have been reassuring.
Leo Varadkar: C+ 
Leo Varadkar’s party got off to the best start in the new three-way Government but arguably had the easiest transition.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar. 
Having spent nine years in power, they knew their way around Government Buildings and so had a clear head start on both Fianna Fáil and the Greens.
As one senior Fianna Fáil member put it, Fine Gael were “match ready”, while their new partners in Government had yet to get stuck into pre-season training.
However, the party has been left bruised by February’s general election, which saw them go from 50 seats after the 2016 election to just 35 now.
Having enjoyed top office, Mr Varadkar was also forced into playing second fiddle to long-time political rival Micheál Martin.
This required a settling-in period and more than a few toes were stepped on when Mr Varadkar took to Twitter to get ahead of official Government statements. This included gazumping the Taoiseach to announce the lockdown extension in Kildare in August.
Immediately after February’s election, Mr Varadkar signalled that he would prefer to spend some time on the opposition benches. Whether the decision to go into government for yet another term was the right one remains to be seen.
Éamon Ryan: D 
Éamon Ryan’s party came in on a green wave, securing the 12 Dáil seats. However, since entering Government, their voices have been largely drowned out by the two larger parties.
Minister for the Environment, Climate, Communications and Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan. 
As well as finding their way in Government, the party also must sort out affairs in their own house.
Deep scars were inflicted during the programme for government negotiations, with a distinct split emerging between those who favoured entering power and those who were looking to progress a social justice agenda from the opposition benches.
This fracturing of the party, which drove some to set up the Just Transition breakaway group, is new to the Greens.
But they are probably now experiencing what larger parties see as a normal, if unpalatable, part of politics. Division, back-biting, infighting, and rivalry are all side-effects to growing your numbers.
However, it will be up to Mr Ryan to ensure that all views are heard, or he could see another exodus from the party.
Smaller coalition partners often struggle to be identified with particular policy changes and Mr Ryan will also be under pressure to deliver on the Green agenda items set out in the programme for government.

The Dáil's winners and losers after 100 days
Winners 
Hot wheels O’Donoghue 
Usually, it’s the Healy-Raes who stop traffic with an impromptu ceilí outside Leinster House on the first day of the Dáil, but this year it was Richard O’Donoghue, the Independent TD for Limerick County, who had heads turning when he showed up in a vintage car.
Simon Harris 
The Wicklow TD has escaped the Department of Health but often continues to act as the minister without all the responsibility attached. He has also cleverly used his social media channels to directly speak to the people and post cute pictures of his daughter for extra voter points.
Holly Cairns 
The Cork South-West TD has been a vocal advocate for many since entering the Dáil after a nailbiter in February. The Social Democrat has raised a number of social issues, including sustainable farming and the postcard lottery of visitors restrictions in maternity hospitals.
Charlie McConalogue 
The Donegal TD was elevated to the Agriculture portfolio after his two predecessors were forced to resign amid separate scandals.
Gino Kenny 
The Solidarity-PBP TD has raised the emotive issue of dying with dignity and has put it front and centre on the Dáil agenda this term.
Losers 
Golf 
Spending an afternoon on a golf course followed by a beef or salmon dinner has now become a sackable offence.
An Independent voice 
Changes to speaking arrangements caused fury and several walk-out on the day before the Dáil broke for the summer recess.
The changes came after backbenchers in the main parties complained that they rarely got time to speak. Now, Independents and smaller parties will now have less time on their feet.
Seals 
A pilot scheme to shoot seals with high-powered rifles from boats was dubbed “insane”.
Heritage Minister Darragh O’Brien revealed that the Government is examining the potential for a scheme that would grant licenses in Kerry and Cork to protect fishermen’s catches.
Barry Cowen 
The Offaly TD didn’t get a chance to mucky his wellingtons before he was forced to resign as Minister for Agriculture over a previous drink driving offence.
Dara Calleary 
The former Fianna Fáil deputy leader was passed over for a senior ministry and was instead offered the job of chief whip. 
He lasted just 37 days as Minister for Agriculture before he was forced to resign over the Golfgate scandal.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40058813.html,2020-10-04 18:55:00,"Deal or no deal, Brexit will be difficult for everyone","Even with a free-trade agreement, Ireland’s food exports are predicted to fall 11.1%, and imports from the UK by 12.6%, said the London School of Economics and Political Science in its recent Vulnerabilities of Supply Chains Post-Brexit report.
With a no-deal Brexit, Ireland is also the worst affected EU country, predicted to have a 30% reduction in its total food exports (43% of which currently go to the UK).
The no-deal fall in Ireland’s imports from the UK is expected to amount to 33.6% of our current imports.
With a free trade agreement, the food trade between the UK and EU will be slashed by almost a quarter in both directions.
The sectors most likely to be impacted, in order of current EU-to-UK export turnover, are fruit and vegetables, beef meat, pig meat, dairy and wine.
For the EU sectors of beef, pig, and sheepmeat, the reduced export of final products to the UK will result in higher cost, loss of trade flow, and oversupply in the EU.
Even with a trade agreement, some EU trade in fresh beef to the UK may no longer be feasible, due to border delays.
Dairy exports from the EU to the UK are estimated to fall by 18% under a free trade agreement and by 94% under a no-deal scenario (with exports of yoghurt, buttermilk, dairy spreads, milk and cream likely to cease).
The London School of Economics (LSE) said their estimates for Ireland should be treated with extra caution, because a significant proportion of the trade between Ireland and the UK is likely to happen at the Ireland-Northern Ireland border, with the goods remaining on the island.
This trade is likely to be considerably less affected, with the Northern Ireland Protocol ensuring goods move between the two countries not subject to border controls, and not subject to tariffs, if they are for domestic use and not for re-export.
The LSE report authors said, “As we look ahead to the end of the transition period, it is clear that a free trade agreement will go a long way to minimise disruption and the impact in the food sector and on consumers.
“However, even in the case of an FTA, significant barriers to trade will be imposed through non-tariff barriers which will still negatively affect the sector.
“But our report also shows that there are urgent and specific actions that both the UK and the EU need to take to ensure the industry is supported in the short and longer term.”
On January 1, Brexit is on course to bring a limited free trade agreement (FTA), or a no-deal Brexit that would leave EU-UK trade on World Trade Organisation terms, which means the introduction of tariffs and quotas on trade into and out of the UK.
Non-tariff barriers will apply, whether there is a deal or not.
For example, import declarations alone could cost traders from both the UK and EU approximately €4.4 billion a year (£4 bn).
Estimates of the cost of compliance with rules of origin checks, when importing into the EU, are found to be in the range of 8% of the value of the underlying good, with a significant portion of this cost (85%) being a result of extra paperwork.
The average no-deal tariff when exporting food and beverage products from the EU to the UK will rise from 0% to 17.7% when accounting for charges per weight, volume, and concentration and weighting by the value of imports of each product.
Some of the reduction in trade between the UK and EU will be offset by increased trade with other countries and/or domestic production.
But in the short run, many businesses are expected to continue operating within existing supply chains for some time, absorbing the cost of tariff and non-tariff barriers.
Price increases are expected in the short run.
Operators have begun increasing stock in preparation for a no-deal Brexit, but the end of the transition period coinciding with Christmas will strengthen the negative impact of tariffs.
Lack of clarity on border arrangements will amplify disruption, deal or no deal.
Consumers who expect that local production will be readily available to replace imported items may discover producers are unable to cope with increased volume demand.
In a no-deal scenario, some EU companies may move production to the UK to avoid tariffs, but such greenfield projects could take two or three years, and substantial investment.
In the UK, the average price increase for branded and speciality products from the EU, with a free-trade agreement, is estimated to be 9.9%, and 26.5% under a no-deal scenario.
In the EU, the average price increase for branded and speciality products imported from the UK under an FTA is estimated to be 8.5% and under a no-deal to be 27.9%.
Tariffs present the highest potential cost, and tariff-free trade is crucial to avoid the most negative effects of Brexit on the food supply chain and consumer choice.
A no-deal Brexit would devastate the UK food sector.
Boris Johnson’s government must decide whether to maintain high tariffs at the expense of consumers; or reduce tariffs and allow global competition undermine UK food and drink producers.
The LSE report also says consumers in the UK are highly exposed to changes in the future trading relationship, because 40% of all food in the UK comes from EU countries.
But consumers in the EU may also notice increased prices and reduced availability of products from the UK.
LSE recommendations to ease the Brexit impact include extending the transitional period for product categories most at risk; avoiding blanket application of tariffs and seeking exclusions for specific products; and applying procedures with leeway so perishable foods does not get stuck at borders."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40060583.html,2020-10-06 19:39:00,"Steady beef market despite last week’s intake increase of 2,000","The overall trade at beef factories this week shows no gains or losses for finishers or processors.
As the beef trade enters October, there is always concern that the peak season supply on the market will drive prices to their lowest level of the year.
Usually, a lot depends on the weather and on how ground conditions on farms influence the outflow of stock from farms to the factories.
Change can come very quickly at this time of the year. A week of rain is always a possibility in October, increasing the outflow of finished animals, and resulting in knock-on downward pressure on prices.
Alternatively, better October weather is not only capable of keeping a floor under the factory price for cattle, but it is also of great benefit in shortening the winter housing season on the farms.
The intake increased last week to 35,627 head, up 2,000 head from the previous week. Steers accounted for 16,889 head last week and heifers 9,444 head. There were 1,379 young bulls and 7,274 cows.
This week, prices for steers remain on a base of 360c/kg. Finishers are refusing to accept less, but are finding it hard to secure higher prices from processors, although there are some reports of 5c-10c/kg being available for very choice lots. Such deals appear to be very thin on the ground.
Prices for heifers are at a base of 365c/kg. They are generally trading at the base price, but some deals there are reported at up to 370c/kg.
There are also reports that some of the processors are prepared to negotiate on weight limits this week for better quality lots of stock, for example, if only a small percentage of a load is over the preferred weight limit.
Young bulls continue to go through the factories in numbers around half that of last year, at prices which are 5c-10c/kg under steer prices. Prices for R-grade young bulls are in the 350c-360c/kg range, with up to 370c/kg for U-grade.
Cow prices have retained their gains of recent weeks which brought the best of the R-grade cows up to 340c/kg, for a small percentage, while 325c-330c/kg is the general run, and ranging from 315c/kg. O-grade cows are making 295c-310c/kg, and Ps are in a 285c-300c/kg range."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40064351.html,2020-10-08 12:40:00,Dairy industry saves the day with a 6% increase in exports,"Our dairy farmers have played a stormer again, along with their co-operatives who process their milk.
Only about one Irish farmer in every six is a dairy farmer, but year after year, they prove they are the elite.
This time around, dairy farmers and their industry have come to the rescue by increasing the value of our dairy exports by 6%.
Figures for the first seven months of 2020 show that their great performance in a world disrupted by Covid-19 has helped to maintain the important exports success of Irish food and drink.
Ireland exports some 90% of the food we produce, and when the hospitality sector shut down across Europe, and beyond, in the spring, it left a huge hole in the demand for Irish food.
There were notable slumps in exports, down 17% for beverages, 11% for fish, and 8% for beef, to the end of July.
Overall, agrifood exports fell by 11% in April, but partially recovered afterwards, and Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue was able to report last week that overall exports for the first seven months to the end of July fell by just 1.9% in value, compared to the same period last year.
The saviour was dairy exports, increasing 6%.
Small wonder then that the Minister recently graciously thanked all those in the dairy sector for their commitment in keeping supply chains operating effectively throughout the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
He said, ‘‘Keeping milk and dairy products moving from farm to processor to the marketplace has taken a herculean effort by all.
“It reflects the commitment and collective effort which characterises the dairy sector in Ireland.’’
He also acknowledged the good work being done in improving the environmental performance of the sector.
Can the success of dairy continue?
There was a good omen on Tuesday when Lakeland Dairies, our largest dairy processing co-operative, got the monthly price announcements going, with a 1c per litre milk price rise.
The co-op said there is some stability in global dairy markets, but growing worries about global supply and demand, with the danger of a global surge in milk supply ahead of the critical Christmas season, and extra dairy product coming from private storage.
Stop-start demand due to Covid-19, and uncertainty around an EU-UK Free Trade Agreement are worries too.
The biggest milk processor, Glanbia, followed up with a 0.4 cpl increase. Management there said dairy consumption and exports have been resilient, with prices reasonably steady, but Covid-19 continues to impact on markets.
Can dairy continue to be the highest-earning and highest investing farming sector?
Can it continue to handle change as well as it did during the substantial structural changes on Irish dairy farms in preparation for, and since the abolition of EU milk quota in 2015?
That went well, with milk production increasing and production efficiency improving.
Consistent industry progress hasn’t happened by accident. Surveys show that hours worked are highest on dairy farms. And the well-managed co-operative nature of the industry’s make-up is a great asset.
Of course, grass for low-cost milk production is Ireland’s greatest dairy asset, and it even got a mention in the European Commission’s recently published short-term outlook report for EU agricultural markets.
It was noted that Ireland again had the EU’s strongest growth in milk production this year so far (up 5%) “thanks to its grass quality”.
The other good news in the short-term outlook report is that the Commission, usually prudent in its projections, sees good prospects for dairy in 2021.
Noting the limited impact of the Covid-19 crisis on food markets, “thanks to the resilience of the food chain”, it held out hope of food demand increasing into 2021, due to the much-restricted foodservice sector adjusting its distribution, by switching to e-commerce and takeaways.
This would enable further growth of direct sales, continuing into 2021, in response to reinforced consumer demand for local food. This will support the recovery of dairy consumption, predicted the Commission.
It welcomed the 2020 recovery in the EU of both dairy and meat prices as the Covid-19 crisis receded, strong milk delivery growth, a positive EU trade balance in meat, and EU olive oil exports reaching a new record level. But EU dairy is also on the way to setting new records this year, and building on them next year.
EU butter, of which Ireland is a significant exporter, has been a star product, heading for a record high level of exports in 2020, and with sales likely to benefit in 2021 from restaurants switching to takeaways and e-commerce.
Skim milk powder exports are expected to reach the second-highest ever level, and a further 3% growth is predicted in 2021.
So far in 2020, the EU’s whole milk powder exports increased 12%, but increasing competition from New Zealand may halt that growth in 2021.
Global demand for EU cheeses remained positive in 2020, with exports expected to grow by 5%. European Commission experts predict Covid-19 adjustments in foodservice and retail should help EU cheese sales to grow by 0.5%. With cheese production growing, more whey is produced, up 3% in 2020, with exports on course for a 5% increase.
Covid-19 wasn’t all bad; lockdowns increased consumption of drinking milk, a product for which sales have been in long term decline, but for which there was increased domestic and export demand this year, with a1.5% increase in sales.
EU milk production growth is predicted to fall from this year’s expected 1% to 0.8% next year. It is noted that EU prices remained relatively stable in 2020, despite the increasing global milk supply.
The EU’s fresh dairy products are on course for an 8% increase in exports in 2020."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40061726.html,2020-10-08 16:46:00,"Average family farm income increases by 2% to €23,934","The preliminary results for the 2019 National Farm Survey - carried out by Teagasc - which were issued in June show that the average family farm income (FFI) for 2019 was €23,934 - a 2% increase on 2018 figures.
Following a decline in the average income level in 2018, largely due to extreme weather, there was a recovery in average FFI in 2019.
However, Teagasc found that this recovery was uneven, with the average FFI concealing differences across the various farm types.
The information was highlighted in the recently launched Annual Review and Outlook for Agriculture, Food and the Marine 2020 by Minister Charlie McConalogue.
The review and outlook pointed to the average dairy farm income which increased by 9% to €66,570 last year.
It stated that “the reversion to normal weather conditions in 2019; the related fall in feed expenditure; and a further boost in milk production offset the fall in the milk price in 2019 (down 3%).” 
Dairy farms are consistently the most profitable farms, however, almost all dairy farms are classified as full time farms. File Photo.  
Meanwhile, in 2019 average cattle rearing income increased by 11% to €9,188 with Suckler cow production the “dominant enterprise” on these farms.
Average gross output increased by 2% on 2018 figures, reaching €36,715 in 2019, with the average direct payment increasing by 12% to €14,706.
The provision of additional support payments in the form of the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) added an average of €780 to the typical Cattle Rearing farm while payments under the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (BEEP) were worth an average of €482 in 2019.
Average income on Cattle (Other) farms decreased by 6% to €13,893 which was largely due to a decrease in 2019 finished cattle prices. Prices decreased due to adverse market conditions.
Overall, the average gross output value per farm decreased by 4% in 2019, which was offset slightly by a 10% increase in direct payments.
Direct payments to Cattle (Other) farms increased due to a special payment received under the Beef Exception Aid Measure (BEAM).
Cattle (Other) farms received €1,548 per farm in 2019 from this scheme.
The value of Gross Output was €50,470 with direct payments on average totalling €17,930. There were 14,322 Sheep farms represented in the National Farm survey.
In 2019 sheep farms had an average income of €14,604 representing a 9% increase on 2018 figures.
The main reason behind this increase in FFI was the fall in production costs.
Direct costs fell by 6% to a farm average of €18,209, with purchased concentrate costs decreasing by 18% to €6,929.
Direct payments increased slightly on 2018 figures - up to an average of almost €19,320. This increase was largely due to BEAM which benefitted sheep farms that also have cattle.
Tillage farms had an average income of €34,437, which was a 15% decrease on 2018 figures, although harvest yields were up substantially in 2019 due to the favourable weather conditions and a fall in cereal prices.
This resulted in a fall in tillage farm margins in 2019.
Dairy farms are consistently the most profitable farms however, almost all dairy farms are classified as full time farms.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40063640.html,2020-10-12 11:32:00,Agri-food exports for first seven months dropped only 1.9%,"Agri-food exports for the first seven months of 2020 dropped only 1.9% in value, compared to 2019.
Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue said last week that exports to seven of Ireland’s top ten destinations are down, with the largest decrease in countries where Covid-19 has been most severe.
Exports of beverages are down 17%, exports of fish are down 11%, while beef exports are down 8% in value to the end of July.
In contrast, dairy exports have increased by 6% for the same period.
Ireland exports 90% of its food. Due to the shutdown of the hospitality sector in many countries, exports dropped by 11% in April but has since partially recovered.
While food retail demand increased, it did not offset the decline in demand from the foodservice industry across Europe, and beyond, which experienced a near-total collapse in demand.
In the first few months of the pandemic, there were lower prices across all commodities. While these have stabilised, and risen in some cases, they still remain relatively low, especially beef prices.
Live exports of cattle were severely affected earlier in the year, particularly the export of calves to continental Europe in the spring, because of the collapse of foodservice demand for veal on the Continent.
Agri-food exporters will face their next big test two and a half months from now, when the UK will be outside of the EU Single Market and customs union.
Notwithstanding the significant amount of preparation already completed, some degree of delay in the movement of animals and goods will be inevitable from January 1, 2021, with new customs and regulatory requirements.
For exporters, export certification requirements for the movement of goods to Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) will be introduced by the UK on a phased basis from January.
Minister McConalogue said complying with customs and regulatory requirements will increase the cost of trade, and result in delays in the movement of goods, although every effort will be made to ensure the minimum possible disruption to trade flows and supply chains.
Any business that moves animals and goods to, through, or from Great Britain, will be subject to a range of customs formalities and regulatory requirements that do not apply to such trade today. It is essential that businesses, no matter how small, understand the impact these rules and processes will have on their operations.
Many of these changes will not apply to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol provide for one island from a food point of view, and that it would be tariff-free.
The Government’s July jobs stimulus included a €20 million Brexit fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises prepare for the new customs arrangements. Included is a ready-for-customs grant available through Enterprise Ireland, offering up to €9,000 per eligible employee hired or deployed in a dedicated customs role.
€5 billion has been put aside by the EU for Brexit adjustments. “We would get a significant proportion of that fund and we would be in a position to fully support our agri-food sector during that period, with the undoubted change and shock that would ensue,” said Minister McConalogue."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40064312.html,2020-10-13 17:43:00,10.6% increase in UK retail sales of primary beef helps Irish finishers,"The good news for beef finishers is that prices on offer at the factories remain unchanged.
It is good news because the season is moving on, and cattle supplies are steadily moving off farms without price cuts by processors.
Still, there is not much of a profit margin for summer finishers who bought forward animals last spring, despite livestock thriving well through the summer and autumn.
Those summer finishers need every cent that they are getting to break-even or make a small profit, and need a good few cents more if they were to achieve a longer term sustainable profit.
Otherwise, the outflow of farmers from livestock production into dairy farming over the past half-decade since the lifting of the EU milk quota restriction will continue to provide the evidence of where farmers see a future for them and their families.
The average price paid for R3 steers so far this year is €3.62/kg excl. VAT, which is 4c/kg below the same period in 2019.
For the time being, a number of factors underpin the trade for livestock.
Export markets for beef are satisfactory, with a surge in beef sales reported in the UK. The most recent report, for the 12 weeks to September 6, showed retail sales of primary beef in the UK up 10.6% year-on-year in volume, with sales of mince, steaks and burgers having performed particularly well.
Processors have a ready market and any attempt to cut cattle prices could prove costly for them if finishers responded by holding back supplies.
So steer prices remain on a base of 360 cents/kg, very solid, but no more than that being paid.
Heifers are generally trading at 365 cents/kg, with some scope to negotiate deals for a base of up to 370 cents/kg for quality lots.
Young bulls continue to sell in small quantities at 350-355 cents/kg for R-grade, and some choice animals capable of making up to 360 cents/kg. The price for O-grade young bulls is in a 340-345 cents/kg range.
The best of the cows make up to 330 cents/kg, and in exceptional cases, a top price of 340 cents/kg has been reported for very good quality R-grade cows. O-grade cows are making up to 310 cents/kg, and the better P-graders are realising up to 300 cents/kg."

The latest offering is a 157.8-acre farm in the townland of Coolroe, just north of Clonea Power and close to the border with Tipperary (just 5km south of Carrick-on-Suir).
The selling agents – Dungarvan-based Nicholas Dwane Auctioneers – say that this is “one of the finest farms to come on the market in Country Waterford in years.” A bold claim but it’s hard to deny that this farm is something of a rarity; its size making it a ready-to-go self-sufficient unit.
The residence at the heart of the property is an impressive two-storey home that was originally built around the time of the War of Independence and which has been extended and immaculately well maintained.
The land has been equally well looked after, consisting of mature grassland of excellent quality that has never been leased. It is laid out in ten waste-free units, well fenced and maintained. Currently used for beef fattening, the farm could easily be transformed back into a dairy farm, requiring the addition of a milking parlour to its array of outbuildings.
The farm has over a kilometre of public road frontage and comes with sizeable entitlements, details of which can be obtained from the selling agents.
The residence at the heart of the property in Coolroe, CarrickonSuir
“The farm is in the same family for generations,” says Nicholas, adding that the owner of the property is retiring from farming – hence the sale.
The interest so far has been strong, according to the agent, with plenty of interest emanating from a very active local dairy farming scene: “I’ve had a good few calls so far from various parts of Munster,” he says, “as well as from farther afield. I even had a couple from the Netherlands who contacted me about it.”
Although the owner’s preference is to sell it in its entirety, there is the option of buying it in two lots, divided evenly by the public road.
The price guide of €18,000 - €19,000 per acre is a strong one but farmland prices are clearly on a rising tide at the moment and rare holdings with quality land and house to match such as this one don’t come along every day of the week.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40068266.html,2020-10-19 19:55:00,Low-margin finishers push for better beef market return,"Farmers around the country say that beef processors are “very interested” in getting cattle but, in general, are not willing to even negotiate on a price increase.
Strong demand isn’t delivering a higher return for beef finishers.
However, the intake is at a point which would normally be regarded as more than adequate for the market demands (the year to date throughput has gone 3.5% ahead of 2019). But processors are more than willing to take all that is available and are “actively sourcing cattle”, according to finishers.
At least. it is a very positive message in the industry that processors have markets for all the beef that is available.
However, the price paid to finishers remains an issue. The base for steers remains firm at 360 cents/kg, with processors insist that there is no more available.
Edging towards the last week of October, it is welcome news for finishers that there is still such strong demand for a strong supply. The problem is that beef finishing profit margins are very tight at current prices, too tight in fact to remain in business in the long term.
Very many have left beef farming in recent years. But it is not possible for everyone to change and become dairy farmers, regardless of the economic attraction.
For the older generation in active farming, and for some farm structures, dairying is not a practical option, and they will continue to struggle with tight margins in livestock.
Heifer prices appear to have eased as much as 5 cents/kg in some parts of the country this week, where finishers are being offered a base of 360 cents/kg, but a good percentage of deals appear to be still at a base of 365 cents/kg, similar to recent weeks.
Young bulls continue to trade at 350-355 cents/kg for R-grade, with those in O-grade back at 340 cents/kg, and the low throughput continues.
The cow trade continues strong. There is very good demand for quality cows, for which t processors are willing to pay up to 340 cents/kg at the top of the market. O-grade cows are at 290-310 cents/kg this week.
There was a strong kill last week, at 37,758 head, slightly back on the corresponding week in 2019.
There were 17,613 steers, 400 head more than last year, while heifers accounted for 9,840 head and cows 8,155 head.
Young bulls continued at 50-60% of last year’s weekly level, with 1,487 last week."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40068830.html,2020-10-20 11:30:00,"West Waterford farm is good value at €9,000 per acre","A 43-acre residential farm near the West Waterford village of Ballyduff is brand new to the market with Youghal-based auctioneers Noel Mackey & Sons.
The property is in the townland of Knockcorragh, close to where Waterford, Tipperary and Cork meet; approximately 4.5km north of Ballyduff, 14km from Lismore and 20km from Fermoy.
The acreage here is slightly elevated but there are still tracts of very good land in this area, of which this holding is an excellent example. The property is all in grass and the surrounding farmlands are involved in a variety of farming sectors, including dairying, beef cattle and the equestrian sector.
Apart from the land, the other main feature of the holding is its dwelling – a three-bedroom one-storey home in very good condition throughout. This forms part of a courtyard around which there is a collection of useful old farm outbuildings, a farmyard, hay shed and selection of stone outbuildings.
With extensive road frontage (as well as secondary access), this is a farm with interesting potential, whether viewed as a hobby farm or by an expanding farmer, who would always have the option of renting or selling on the house.
“The house is in good order,” says Noel, “and the land is probably more suited to grassland… It would be ideal for a hobby farmer but a local farmer could buy it and then sell the house and a portion of the yard along with an acre of land.”
The price guide is in the region of €390,000 (€9,000/acre); a reasonable expectation considering the quality of the land and is assets as well as its location. With its appeal to a broad spectrum of potentially interested parties, it should attract offers over the coming weeks and months."

While many, and nearly all, agri related businesses are running pretty smoothly during the present lockdown, the problems with the marts, as highlighted by Kenmare Mart manager, Dan McCarthy, last week still exist today.
The problem with the marts, in a nutshell, is that the buyer cannot go into a mart and buy.
I can go to a Co-Op store and buy a bag of ration. I can go into a farm machinery store and pick up a part for a tractor, I can even go to a garden centre and pick up a bag of compost, but I cannot, for some bizarre reason, go into a cattle mart and buy a bullock.
Why is this the case? Why, from the very beginning, has there been an exception made in the case of the marts. A mart is a place of business, it is not Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.
And the problems with weak rural internet, again highlighted by the straight-talking Kenmare mart manager, is also not helping the issue. Online bidding, while a marvel in some ways, certainly has its flaws, the main flaw being an internet service in rural Ireland that seems to have come from the time of de Valera.
Marts needs to be put on the same footing as every other agribusiness, the present situation is leading to a lot of frustration.
And with that we will go to the marts, where internet bidding is the only option.
Kilmallock mart had 1,200 stock on offer this week. Bullocks on Monday sold for up to €1,110 a head or €2.10 per kg. Runners sold for up to €530 each (paid for an April born Charolais bull).
Dry cows hit €1,360 a head or €1.72 per kg. Heifers made up to €1,110 a head or €2.27 per kg. Dairy stock sold for up to €1,300 (paid for a four-year-old calved cow). Sucklers hit €1,160 (paid for a two-year-old heifer). Factory bulls sold for up to €1,290 a head.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40072220.html,2020-10-28 15:46:00,Winter Feeding: what options do I have?,"As the days close in and animals across the country are starting to adapt to their winter diets it is important to sit down and look at what you are going to feed your stock for the coming months. Many farmers have done their fodder budget for the winter and have an idea how much forage they have.
The next thing you need to ask yourself is; what is the feeding value of the forage and what should I feed to balance the diets? It is important to give yourself a starting point and get your silage tested if you have not already done so. The quality of your silage will have a huge impact on the performance of your stock over the winter period as it will make up the majority of diets in the next few months.
Once you know the quality of the silage, you can select the pit or bales you want to use first. Most farms will look to use the lowest quality silage for dry cows and in late lactation. A silage with 65% dry matter digestibility (DMD) will still put on condition over the dry period if fed ad-lib. 
A fat cow at the point of calving will increase the incidence of metabolic issues in your herd. The farms I work with try to dry off the cows in the same condition that they are going to calve down in and control the cow’s intake and energy by incorporating straw in the diet with a mixer wagon. The level used will vary depending on the quality of the silage. Reducing the level of silage in the diet by using straw has been shown to reduce metabolic issues like milk fevers as the potassium level of the diet is reduced. 
By increasing rumen fill in the dry period we are also promoting dry matter intake post calving. The important thing is to body condition score your cows now so you can act early and adjust your feeding levels. Higher protein diets will encourage milk production whilst a low protein diet will reduce the milk yield potential and that extra energy will go toward cow condition. In a spring calving herd, if you look after the cows dry matter intake in late lactation, the cows will look after themselves.
Recently, I have been getting a lot of calls regarding the value of feed and what should be used to balance a diet. If we break the straights down into two categories of protein sources and energy sources, we can make a quick comparison to see what is good value. Soya for example has been increasing in recent weeks and is now over €400/tonne in many places. €400/48 = €8.33 per 1% crude protein. If we continue to just look at protein you can multiply this figure by the protein of any feed with the same dry matter to determine which is better value in terms of protein. You should look to balance your protein and energy based on the rate of degradation. Maize meal and Hipro soya will break down slowly and work well together. 
If the dry matters of the products are different you can use the calculations below as shown in figure 1 and figure 2.
Figure 1: Calculation for determining the value of feed in terms of protein Price1/Dry Matter /Crude Protein1 X Dry Matter2 X Crude Protein2 = Price 2 
Figure 2: Calculation for determining the value of feed in terms of energy Price1/Dry Matter1/UFL1 X Dry Matter2 X UFL2 = Price 2
Fodder beet and maize silage are now being introduced to beef and autumn milking diets as farms are looking to high energy feeds to improve performance. For winter milkers you will need to increase the protein to balance the diet along with feeding a high phosphorus mineral. If you are getting quoted prices factor in the cost of washing and chopping the beet. It is best practice to introduce any changes to the diet slowly to avoid digestive upsets. 
Maize silage needs to be fermented for at least two weeks before feeding. If there is nightshade in the crop, ideally you should leave it in the pit for as long as possible before feeding and feed along with other feeds to dilute the amount of nightshade contaminated silage in the diet. Moist feeds are also common on farms and can be a good way in increasing your dry matter intake. The key is to limit the amount of waste by storing the products correctly. Your supplier should be able to guide you through the process.
It is a good opportunity to evaluate your herd performance over the previous 12 months. Ask yourself are your heifers hitting their target weights? What was the average daily gain for your finishing cattle? Are you satisfied with this year’s milk production or can you improve the herds feed efficiency? It&#39;s fair to say everyone wants to improve somewhere. I find writing down your targets will help focus what you are trying to achieve and looking at them this time next year to reassess what worked and what did not. There is a wealth of knowledge in the industry, the key is to utilise it and speak to your nutritionist on a regular basis.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40072814.html,2020-10-29 14:08:00,‘Favourable UK market conditions should be reflected here’,"Beef prices in the UK continue to edge upwards and are now at the equivalent price of €4.47/kg for R4L steers.
The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) has called on the meat factories to reflect those favourable market conditions by paying a higher price for cattle.
The organisation’s Livestock Committee Chairman, Brendan Golden, said demand for beef in the UK market is strong and will improve further as stocks build up for the lucrative Christmas trade.
“The higher than expected cattle kill to-date this year in the UK and the ‘lower cattle inventory’ all point towards increased demand in our primary export market for the coming months,” he said.
“Most of the grass cattle have now moved through the system; with the kill to-date up 47,000 on the same period last year, numbers are predicted to be tight for the back-end trade.
“It’s predicted there will be 50,000 fewer cattle to kill between now and Christmas compared to last year.
“Exports to Northern Ireland have performed very strongly this year with numbers up almost 25,000 head on 2019 to nearly 50,000.” Mr Golden went on to say that while numbers are down, the exports of finished cattle is up 16,000 head, which he added, “impacts directly on slaughter numbers for the remainder of the year”.
“The demand for beef in the UK market alongside tight domestic supplies and tighter numbers predicted here combine to create a positive environment for factories to maximise returns from the marketplace for Irish beef,” he continued.
“Meat factories have no excuse for allowing the current price gap to continue between Irish and UK prices.
“Farmers should dig in on price negotiations in the knowledge numbers will be tight, and the factories need the cattle to fill the lucrative Christmas orders with the supermarkets which have seen sales of meat surge throughout the COVID-19 restrictions.”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40075652.html,2020-11-03 17:01:00,Cow prices cut as much as 10c but beef trade steady in general,"The trade at factories for prime beef animals is steady but the weakening market for cows is noted with some concern by finishers.
While October has passed without any significant easing in the prices paid for steers, heifers and young bulls, neither was there any positive response from processors to finishers’ demands for higher prices.
So it has been more or less all square for the month, albeit with the official prices compiled by the Department of Agriculture showing a marginal easing in the overall average price paid for the base grades over the past month.
For this week, cow prices on offer have been cut as much as 10c/kg, having eased slightly during October. This is of concern to finishers of cows, and to “wise old owls” of the cattle trade who have always held that the cow trade is the advance indicator for trends in the prime beef trade.
For the most part, prices for R-grade cows are back to 300c/kg at a number of factories this week. Some are still paying a bit more, but the trend has moved into a downward mode. O-grade cows are making 280c-290c/kg, and Ps make around 270c/kg.
Strong supplies of cows on offer may be a factor, with processors not under pressure to get sufficient cow supplies to meet their market requirements.
Processors also claim that stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the UK from to-day will impact heavily on the catering business, which is the big customer for manufacturing beef from cows.
With many restaurants switching to take away, it remains to be seen how demand for beef will be affected, but the trend has eroded farmers’ hopes of beef prices hardening in the coming weeks.
Steer and heifer prices continue as they have been for several weeks. The base for steers is at 360c/kg and even hard sellers are unable to extract more.
Prices for heifers stay at a base of 365c/kg, with some scope to negotiate for a few cents/kg extra. But there are few reports of any significant numbers making more than the quoted base price.
There is no change in the prices on offer for young bulls. The intake of these continues at around half the level of 2019, and prices are generally at 10c/kg less than the steer price. R-grade young bulls are quoted at 350c/kg, with some lots up to 355c/kg.
The overall supply dropped sharply, to 33,178 head, for last week, including the bank holiday on Monday. This was back 1,000 head less than the same week last year.
The drop in numbers was across all categories, with steers at 13,982, heifers accounting for 9,355, and cows at 7,670 head. Young bulls accounted for 1,637 head."

Whenever a parcel of good agricultural land comes up in this area, there is normally a strong level of interest coming from a variety of sources.
This is an area where a number of potentially interested parties are generally looking for land.
The convenience and proximity to a large market makes it an ideal location for expanding dairy or beef cattle operations, tillage farmers and market gardeners.
2020 has also been the year of the investor, and the indications are that investment in land from individuals and larger companies will only increase over the coming months and years.
A 33-acre roadside non-residential tillage holding just 3.5km from Glanmire, therefore, should pique the interest of a lot of people in the area and beyond.
The farm in question is located in the townland of Ballyvisteale. Selling agent Miah McGrath of Midleton agents McCarthy & McGrath describes it as “top quality agricultural land.”
“Its location is very central, first of all,” says Miah. “It’s all in tillage at the moment, but it’s a high-quality piece of ground, and it would be suitable for any agricultural activity.”
The asking price is in the region of €500,000.
At €15,000 per acre, this is a reasonable price for land in such a location, and should be achievable.
“It’s not long launched,” says Miah, “but there’s already been a good reaction to it. Plenty of enquiries, so we’re confident that it will go well.”
The property is laid out in seven easily-managed divisions of well-drained fields, with a lengthy stretch of road frontage on its northern boundary, facilitating access.
Cork’s city centre is just 11km away, Little Island lies 6km to the south, while the nearest junction to the M8 Dublin-Cork motorway is approximately 6km away.

From winter warmers to picky bits, here are Cork's best options to order tonight","When lockdown came back in March, a wave of fear and anxiety initially ripped through the Irish hospitality sector with almost the same contagion as the deadly virus that triggered the closure in the first place. 
But it wasn’t long at all before the innate resilience that is a hallmark of the industry began to reassert itself.
First order of business for many establishments was to donate all perishable and now unusable stock to charities such as Simon and Cork Penny Dinners. 
Next up was a drive to feed frontline workers in the health and emergency services and a fund set up to pay restaurants to do so soon found it impossible to spend the rapidly accumulating war chest as most restaurants insisted on doing it for free.
The Government’s decision to issue a Covid payment proved to be a valuable lifeline, enabling furloughed staff to tread water and providing some hope for the future and many operators chose to use to the enforced break as an opportunity for an overall reassessment of their businesses in a sector that had been shaving margins finer than a barber’s baby for far too long.
Let’s face it, you need to top up all your superhuman powers with a soupcon of madness in this particular game and for some of the most driven operators, the notion of waiting it out proved impossible, for whatever reason, they simply couldn’t stifle for a minute the compulsion to cook food and sell it to the public. So they began to pivot their businesses to continue trading under the new restrictions and the public responded in spades, and ‘dining out at home’ became one of those defining lockdown tropes right up there with baking sourdough and cocktail parties on Zoom.
The mark of a true champion however is not the amount of victories marked up but rather the ability to keep getting up from the canvas after each blow and so once more many are returning once more to the ‘dining out at home’ model, anything to keep their businesses moving forward.
We in the Irish Examiner have sold many newspapers in the past on the back of the great successes and triumphs of the Irish hospitality sector so it well behoves us to be there in the bad times as well, to attempt in our own small way to do something to support the sector during these most trying of times. 
We have compiled a list (beginning with Cork city and county, to be followed, hopefully, by a national list) of some of those who are once more pivoting to serve up some of the finest food in the world for you to enjoy in the comfort and safety of your own home. We hope you will do your best to support this hugely important Irish sector that not only provides over 200,000 jobs but is also the backdrop for so many of the most important social occasions in our life, a recurring source of joy and pleasure without which our lives would be so much the poorer.

Top eight: The best barmbracks for Halloween"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40081205.html,2020-11-09 21:47:00,Winter nutrition strategies for dairy performance and herd health,"We had excellent grazing conditions this autumn; unfortunately, the winter has come in very quickly, with ground conditions making it very difficult to extend the grazing season much longer for the vast majority of the country.
It is always worth remembering at this time of year, as dairy herds go indoors, there are four main nutrition building blocks.
These are calf rearing, heifer rearing, dry cow management, and late lactation management.
Autumn calf rearing
For any autumn calving herds, there are currently calves being reared, these will be the replacement heifers entering the herd in the autumn of 2022.
Efficient growth right up to weaning off milk will be critical for these calves' futures.
A good quality concentrate which the calves find palatable is a great start for rumen development, as concentrates are the best way to develop the rumen at this time in their life.
Provision of good quality, clean straw is also more preferable than hay, as hay can often cause pot bellies in calves which restrict digestive function and ultimately performance.
Obviously, the same principles will apply next spring when calves are being reared for replacements in 2022.
The quality of the milk replacer is a major factor in calf performance.
Sufficient energy and protein are required to efficiently grow a calf to target weight at weaning.
Heifer rearing and growing
With regard to youngstock, the better you grow your heifers, the more mature an animal you have entering the herd in the first lactation, which means the transition from being a heifer to a cow is much smoother.
This animal needs to do significantly less growing in her first lactation, which means that she can produce milk, maintain body condition, and go back in calf much more efficiently.
For replacement heifers entering the shed this winter, it is important that they grow efficiently throughout the whole housing period.
For this to be achieved, it is critical that sufficient protein and digestible fibre is supplied to these animals, as these will enable them to grow frame.
Undersupplying protein or oversupplying energy results in these heifers putting on excessive body condition and not growing correctly.
Developing these animals, frame-wise, will allow them to consume large volumes of grass when they go to pasture next spring prior to them being bred.
These heifers need to have a diet which is 16% protein for the duration of the winter feeding.
With most grass silages this year being low in protein, with the vast majority of them between 10 and 13% protein, the concentrate required to complement this grass silage should be in the region of 19 to 20% protein if fed at the typical 1.5 to 2 kilos per head per day.
The target should be to achieve in excess of 0.8kg of live weight gain per day in frame development from those heifers.
Weight gain should be the main driver for these heifers.
Height and size, with maturity, are the key elements.
Many weigh their heifers in the spring in order to establish if they are strong enough to be inseminated.
However, in my opinion, if you have to weigh an animal to establish whether they are fit for the bull or not, it is very likely that they are not fit.
Where some of your replacement heifers for next spring are behind targets, perhaps it would be worth considering dividing those animals into a separate group and feeding them accordingly to try and catch up with the main group.
It is much easier to do this at the start of the winter rather than discover that animals are behind when it is too late, and you are chasing growth up to the point of breeding.
Dry cows
A large proportion of spring calving cows will be dried off in the coming weeks.
Once these cows are dried off, the aim then must be to maintain these cows through the dry period, to enable a smooth transition to lactation next spring.
The delivery of a healthy calf with minimal complications along with the prevention of metabolic disorders in the cow should be foremost in any dry cow strategy.
With this in mind, it is ideal that cows are dried off close to the body condition score at which you want to calve them down.
Aiming to dry cows off with a body condition score of 2.75 to 3 will mean that you do not have to adjust body condition through the dry period.
Any dry cow diet needs to supply sufficient energy and protein to maintain body condition, while helping to produce the new mammary cells for the next lactation, while not excessively growing the calf that will be born next spring.
Mineral supplementation in the dry cow is also very important to aid a smooth transition for the cow into lactation.
It has become apparent that the vast majority of grass silages produced in 2020 are very high in potash levels.
These excessively high levels will lead to more metabolic disorders around calving, such as retained foetal membranes, and milk fever, if they are not addressed.
This may necessitate inclusion of some chopped straw in dry cow diets to dilute down the potash level, and will certainly require increased levels of magnesium in minerals in order to chemically dilute down the negative effects of this high potash.
Specific dry cow minerals to be used in the transition period just before calving are available, which may also be required this year.
An excellent management tool in dry cow management is to include some level of concentrates pre-calving, to help the rumen bug population to grow sufficiently to transition to the milking cow diet as quickly as possible, for less nutritional stress on those cows in early lactation.
A good first step, if you have been having transitional issues and metabolic disorders in the past, is to get your silage tested for minerals. This will help you to establish if there are antagonists which can tie up essential mineral elements, and any deficiencies or excesses which may be prevalent in your forage.
Where silages are low in protein, this can often have the knock-on effect of reducing the volume and quality of colostrum that the cow produces in the first milking.
Obviously, this will have a negative effect on the newborn calf, where insufficient antibody transfer is achieved in the required time.
To address this issue, it is advisable to supplement with some protein in the weeks leading off the calving.
Late lactation management
At this time of year, late lactation cows will be heading towards their dry-off days. How you feed these in the last number of weeks before drying off can have an adverse effect on body condition. If a cow is thin right now, the opportunity is there to build body condition before the cow is dried off.
This is more efficient than trying to gain weight after drying off.
After drying off, a cow lays down fat which she will again mobilise after calving if she requires extra energy in transition.
Increasing supplementation in late lactation will not only improve body condition but it will also help to maintain milk yields and milk quality, resulting in a higher price per litre right through to drying off.
Obviously, later calving cows that you intend to milk through the winter, that are farther away from calving, will significantly benefit from an increase in their plane of nutrition, resulting in extra yield right through the winter.
Again, it is important that you know the quality of your silage when feeding late lactation cows, in order to make sure that you are supplying the correct supplementation. Poor quality second cut silages this year will require additional supplementation to maintain body condition and animal performance.
Cows can lose a lot of body condition before you notice it, at this time of the year. When they go indoors, it really is important that you supply sufficient nutrients to make sure this doesn’t happen in your herd.
Lameness can also be a major issue in late lactation cows when they go back indoors for the winter, keep on top of this to avoid issues next spring.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-40081706.html,2020-11-13 13:43:00,Six weeks to Brexit: Ireland must minimise the hit on agri sector,"We are just six weeks to the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31.
With or without a deal, Brexit will impose customs administration and product inspection, causing costly delays. 
A study from University College London in September shows that even an increase of 70 extra seconds per truck would cause a six-day queue at British ports. 
An extra 80 seconds would lead to irretrievable, permanent gridlock.
Perishable food exports, and just-in-time distribution chains, cannot cope with the delays predicted. They will also add cost, damaging competitiveness.
The UK Global Tariff, published last May, stands to cost Irish food exporters between €1.35bn and €1.5bn per annum, according to the Government’s Brexit Readiness Action Plan.
We estimate this would add almost €1.5/kg additional cost to the export of Irish cheddar cheese (around 20% of current average retail price), and an average of €2.68/kg for beef (approx. 74% of the product value).
Many Irish food exporters have reported that their UK clients are demanding Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) terms — ie that import tariffs be paid by the exporter. 
In addition, they are often unwilling to undertake any customs or import related administration, so that some Irish exporters are now finding they may have to establish some sort of structure in the UK to be their own importers. 
Traffic delays and gridlock are predicted in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Picture: PA
All of this will add significant cost pressure back up the chain, which will cost farmers as well as processors.
On the day before the 2016 Referendum on Brexit, €1 was worth around £0.76. 
Today, it is around £0.90, with parity in sight. 
Currency volatility has challenged our exports’ competitiveness for the last four years, with beef bearing the brunt over that period.
Meanwhile, the UK has also opened trade talks with New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and Canada. This has the potential for inferior standards of food safety, animal health and welfare, and the environment. 
The pursuit of a ‘cheap food’ policy by the UK, which currently imports 26% of its total food consumption from the EU, clearly motivates those negotiations.
The impact of Brexit and 3rd country trade deals would be a disastrous scenario for Irish agriculture. 
Brexit will also likely cause market disturbances and product displacement globally. Coming in the middle of Covid-19, this could destabilise agricultural commodity markets for the longer term.
In August 2014, Russia introduced an embargo on food imports from the EU among others, in retaliation to sanctions over its aggressions towards Ukraine and Crimea. 
The common point between Brexit and the Russian ban of 2014, is that they are both geopolitical events outside of our control, but in which the agriculture sector, especially farmers, take the brunt.

Minister for Agriculture: ‘Tariffs will apply under WTO rules in no-deal Brexit’
However, while the Russian ban affected just over €5bn worth of EU food exports, Brexit will be eight times greater at over €40bn.
Irish exports will be joint third worst affected in value with France, behind the Netherlands and Germany.
Also, while the UK accounts for 18% of total Dutch food exports, 9% of France’s and 8% of Germany’s, it represents 38% of Ireland’s — despite many successful efforts at diversification.
The food industry is at particular risk. Picture: Elevate/Pexels
Fresh fruit and vegetables, pigmeat, and most of all dairy products were severely affected by the Russian ban — and it took close on two and a half years for dairy prices, also affected by lower Chinese imports and increased global output, to recover after the market disturbance kickstarted by the ban.
The EU responded to the Russian embargo with close on €1.5bn worth of market and farmer supports.
Those included extended intervention purchases and private storage subsidies, direct financial supports to farmers, matched by national funding, subsidised voluntary reduction in milk production, promotion campaigns, incentives to green harvesting and free distribution of perishable produce and the provision of funds which in Ireland were used to seed low cost cash flow and investment loans.
Brexit will strike harder and Ireland will be worst hit.
Last July, the EU agreed a €5bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve Fund. Our Government must secure the lion’s share of it for Ireland’s agriculture sector.
The EU must seek a deal which provides for the closest possible trading relationship. 
However, the types of supportive EU measures provided in 2014 to 2017, accompanied with laxer EU State Aid regulations and a temporary suspension of imports and trade negotiations with third countries, will be crucial to manage and minimise the hit on Irish agriculture, and provide the necessary income supports for farmers.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40084232.html,2020-11-17 14:00:00,Angus and Hereford farms do best as signs of beef market recovery emerge,"The first indications of some upward movement in beef prices at the factories have been emerging this week, particularly for select categories within steers and heifers.
Cattle finishers report a strengthening in the demand from processors for Angus and Hereford heifers in particular, with some carryover also to the steers within the same breeds.
A combination of factors is coming together to deliver this hardening in the trade.
Covid-19 restrictions are resulting in more food being consumed within the home, with hotels and restaurants closed except for takeaway.
Both Angus and Hereford producer groups have done a really good job of promoting the merits of their beef over the past decade or two, and the message has got through to consumers, who show a preference for these breed branded cuts at the supermarkets.
Processors are responding to this market demand, and finishers of both Angus and Hereford beef cattle are right now on a winner, with a strengthening in both demand and price at the factories.
Both breeds and crosses of these breeds qualify for a breed premium in addition to the quality assurance bonus, which combines to add a substantial top-up on the base price.
Base prices for both steers and heifers have also made slight gains in some areas of the country this week.
After several weeks at a solid base of 360 cents/kg, some steer prices are reported to be moving to 365 cents/kg, with a few finishers even trying to hold out for 370 cents/kg, but with limited success.
The pattern is similar for heifers, with a small percentage moving upwards from 365 cents/kg to 370 cents/kg this week, and a minority of choice lots reported to be sold for up to 375 cents/kg.
There is only very slight movement in the prices on offer for young bulls.
They are on a base of 350 cents/kg for R-grade, with some deals securing a few cents more, and a minority reported to be making up to 360 cents/kg.
The best news on the cow trade is that the price slippage over recent weeks has ceased, and prices for R-grade cows remain at around 300 cents/kg, with Os ranging from 275 to 285 cents/kg, and P-grade from 260 cents/kg.
The supply of cows continues strong, and demand for manufacturing beef has eased, due to Covid-19 restrictions on the catering trade."

Like an old sow gone too fond of its patch in the sty, I find it hard to see him stirring without some class of a struggle.
A nose ring might be needed.
They may have to cut his rations.
In some ways, I wouldn’t blame Trump for staying put. If the weather in Washington DC is anything like the weather around this part of the world, only a fool would venture outside the Oval Office.
And Trump isn’t a fool.
He managed to get through four turbulent years in power without being tumbled out of office, and almost snatched a re-election victory few would have predicted. If he’s a fool, he must be a very clever one.
And so to the marts we go, beginning with Macroom.
I made a brief excursion there on Saturday, that’s all any farmer can do nowadays. Visits to the mart have to be brief, it’s one of the rules that need obeying.
“Controlling people here in the mart has become as important as controlling the cattle nowadays,” Macroom mart manager John O’Mahony pointed out, as we talked about mart business.
“Numbers of dry cows on offer here today are up, which is no great surprise given the time of the year, with bullock numbers back.” The mart had a very good weanling sale, with a six month old Limousin heifer stealing the show. She weighed 300kg and made a whopping €940.
There was no one more delighted than the seller.
Staying with weanlings, the final weanling sale of 2020 in Dungarvan Mart will take place today.
From this week, here will be a special section at Monday’s general mart sale for weanlings.

Minister for Agriculture, Charlie McConalogue, speaking in the Dáil, has given a few statistics on the state of the marts during the Level 5 lockdown, revealing mart cattle numbers down by nearly 20%.
Between Monday, October 26, and Sunday, November 1, cattle throughput in the marts came to 37,456 head (compared to 45,720 head in the same week of 2019).
“This means,” the minister said “that despite the undoubted disruption caused by moving to Level 5, mart throughput of cattle was 81.9% of the figures for that period in 2019.
“This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts involved.” The Minister went on the say that the value of forward type livestock at these sales ha “reduced slightly in price in the region of 2–4%,” and that quality light store animal values “are on a par with pre-lockdown values.” I hope the statistics for more recent weeks bring good news for farmers.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40086512.html,2020-11-19 18:06:00,September recovery in beef exports to UK,"A last-gasp recovery in Irish beef exports to the UK, before the Brexit shutters come down, emerged in September, the latest month for which trade figures are available.
The UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) said imports of beef (fresh and frozen, processed and offal) jumped to 26,200 tonnes in September, up 5% from August, and up 12% (2,900 tonnes) from September 2019.
Almost the whole rise was due to more beef coming in from Ireland (2,400 tonnes), although shipments were also higher from Brazil (up 800 tonnes), and the Netherlands (up 200 tonnes). However, imports are still well below the five-year average.
Ireland sends about half of its beef output to the UK, and how this will be affected by Brexit is the biggest worry for the food industry ahead of the UK leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union from January 1, 2021.
Meanwhile, the September increase in Irish beef exports to the UK marked a turnaround in the Irish industry’s fortunes. According to the AHDB, Irish beef exports between January and September totalled 374,100 tonnes, down 5% on the same period in 2019.
Shipments into the rest of the EU fell 9% year-on-year, while exports to non-EU countries (including the UK) fell 2%.
At individual country level, the largest falls in exports were to the UK, down 6%, and to France ( down 11%). But shipments grew to countries Japan (by 2,400 tonnes), the US (by 2,300 tonnes) and Canada (by 1,700 tonnes). However, it was not enough to offset losses elsewhere.
According to the AHDB’s trade analysts, the increasingly competitive pricing of Irish cattle may have helped boost imports into the UK during September, alongside increased foodservice activity.
Although the Irish price is currently around 10c below the EU average price, it is around 50c below the UK price, which has largely continued to strengthen. The gap between the Irish price and EU average widened in the last few weeks, although both are still on a downward trajectory.
However, the average Irish R3 steer prices recently ran around 16c above where they were at the same point last year, averaging €3.60/kg in the first week of November.
Prices at the farm gate in Ireland have not fallen this year, despite a 3% supply increase, taking the number of beef cattle processed in Ireland in the year to October 26 to 1.5 million.
Throughputs of steers and heifers are up by 14% and 2%, respectively, cull cow throughputs are 4% higher. But young bull throughputs are down 34% year-on-year, with fewer adult bulls also processed so far.
The live cattle trade is down 11% compared to last year, primarily due to fewer calves being traded into other EU countries.
Total UK beef imports between January and September are still down 7% from 2019, running behind the level of last year until August, when shipments recovered, with some recovery in the UK foodservice market a likely factor.
However, foodservice demand for beef is likely to slump again in the Covid-19 lockdown which started last week, with only essential shops and education settings staying open, and foodservice limited to takeaway and delivery.
And the UK leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union from January 1, 2021, leaves the Irish beef industry facing unknown territory."

She and her team at Goop, the lifestyle brand she started in 2008, are touting the must-have watermelon handbag, designed in Japan by Tsuchiya Kaban for the sole purpose of carrying not just any old melon, but specifically a watermelon.
Before pencilling it into the Christmas shopping list, though, the publicity blurb says, “price on request” which gets me pondering: If Gwyneth and company are also hawking an avocado green mattress stuffed with royal alpaca wool at the brazen price of $38,000, and an igneous self-heating concrete bath starting at $100,000 for a soak, yet unwilling to tell us the price of a leather bag, my wallet and I are too scared to ask.
The Chelsea collection of occasional tables includes a coffee table and nest of two sidetables made from low-maintenance marble and metal (from €299 at Caseys).
For something more easily accessible, sensible and lovely, let’s see what Santa Claus can pick up locally and manage to fit down the chimney, from star buys to stocking fillers. So, shopping lists and pens to the ready as we take a trip around city shops, suburban boutiques and out of town gems.
We’re all about the charcuterie board these days for making a showcase of cold ham and spiced beef when no one wants to cook on St Stephen’s Day. Meadows & Byrne has a circular beauty with handles made from reclaimed wood so it’s virtuous as well as looking good (€34.95).
While the scented candle reigns supreme as the must-have addition to any home interiors themed Christmas stocking, let’s go all out with the Tea Rose, Oud and Patchouli from Irish brand Rathbornes. It has an interesting back story too as it happens to be the oldest surviving candlemaker in the world, founded in 1488 (€36 at Meadows & Byrne).
Help fill a Christmas stocking with a scented candle. Rathbone's offers combinations of familiar and exotic fragrances like Tea Rose, Oud and Patchouli (€34.95 at Meadows & Byrne).
From Douglas-based Interiosity comes the Class drinks cabinet by Dutch Bone. It’s compact but can hold 16 bottles, plus there’s space for glasses and cocktail-making paraphernalia. When closed, its parquet style finish makes it an eye-catching statement piece (€1,350).
For a stocking filler, check out the Leaf candlesticks in on-trend warm brass to put a finishing touch to a mantlepiece, hall console, or along the centre of the Christmas dining table (from €15).
A trip to Caseys in Cork or Limerick offers a star buy with a touch of posh. The Chelsea range of occasional tables from the design studio of the late Terence Conran features a marble-topped, metal-framed console (€399), a square coffee table (€379), and nest of two tables which will be particularly useful at Christmas (€299).

Interiosity's Class drinks' cabinet doubles up as a striking furniture piece (€1,350).
Tramore might suggest sandcastles and ice cream cones in summer, but it has a few hidden treasures including Redlane, where among the scarves and boots you’ll find a star buy of nesting tables with a difference.
A pair of glass-topped, brass-framed lovelies are a lesser-spotted round shape which creates a statement piece, whether stacked together or placed side by side to make a more substantial table (€359).
At the same time, catch a whiff of the Milis range of soy wax candles handmade in Waterford. The Namaste is a particularly covetable stocking filler with fresh lemon and bergamot top notes and a subtle background of ginger, clove and black tea.

Demand from the supermarket trade, which requires hanging of the carcase for 21-28 days, is maintaining pressure on procurement officers at the meat plants, with some processors now working extended hours in order to handle big intakes.
Finishers are responding to the increased demand, but trying to bargain for a meaningful price increase is meeting with a very controlled response from factory bosses.
Prices have edged upwards by a few cents/kg, with each of the recent weeks seeing a marginal further increase, the combination of which, to date, has increased returns by 5-8 cents/kg from earlier in the autumn.
The weekly kill, which has topped 39,000 head, is relatively strong, but processors are interested in taking in all available cattle.
The base price for steers remains at 360-365 cents/kg, with an increased percentage of the intake now selling for 365c.
There are some reports of 370 cents/kg being paid for steers, which appear to be creditable, but there is no evidence that it is readily available for all comers.
Heifers are trading at a 5 cents/kg premium over steer prices, generally at a base of 370 cents/kg, although some plants continue to quote at the lower rate of 365 cents/kg base, trying their hand at keeping the lid on rising prices.
There are reports that 375 cents/kg is there, for a good number of heifers this week, and it is no secret that flat price deals are being offered to finishers this week, wherever the grid price is not securing the supply of stock, particularly for in-spec heifers.
Hereford and Angus are at the top of the list for procurement, with the added breed bonus capable of returning up to 400 cents/kg for some lots.
Young bulls continue to be the weakest link in the trade, with demand remaining low and prices hovering at 5 cents/kg less than for steers of the same grade.
The cow trade has made the strongest recovery, with R-grade now making 310-315 cents/kg, while prices for Os range up to 300 cents/kg, and 285-290 cents/kg is achievable for the best of the P-grade cows this week.
The movement of cattle to Northern Ireland continued at relatively high levels in recent weeks, with 1,357 head travelling north in the week ending November 14, bringing to 95% the increase in live exports of cattle to Northern Ireland so far this year.
But overall live exports have declined by 13%."

Ennis mart on Friday had over 400 bullocks on offer.
Ann Keane of Clare Co-Op Marts reported that “a share of heavy cattle today over 30 months exceeded €2/kg once they had flesh.
“The trade was as strong as last week, and quality stock very sought after.
“There was a strong demand for the beef type animal, with a share of Northern buyers intereste.”
Looking back at last Thursday’s sale of cows and heifers at Ennis mart, Ann said, “Numbers similar to last week overall, with cull cows up in numbers, and heifer numbers easier.
“About 40% of the cows on Thursday were dairy stock, but not straight from the parlour.
“The trade was a shade sharper in both the cows and heifers. Strong Northern activity again for forward stock pushed many lots of cows to over €2/kg.
“Heifers were a very strong trade again on Thursday, with aged bulls averaging €1.62/kg and a top call of €1,840 for a Limousin bull weighing 1000kg.”

Mr Cullinan’s comments came as the final version of the PGI application for Irish Grass Fed Beef was submitted to the European Commission (EC) by Bord Bia.
The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Charlie McConalogue, announced publication of the final version of the application earlier today and pointed to the “detailed process” that must now be carried out by the EC.
“I know that there is a detailed process which must now be completed by the EC in evaluating this application,” he added.
“However, I will be emphasising to Commissioner Wojciechowski that PGI status for our unique quality, Irish grass fed beef would have benefits for all those in the supply chain - principally the primary producer - at this critical time for the Irish beef sector.” 
Meanwhile, Mr Cullinan pointed to how farmers had created the brand, in the first instance, through their grass-fed animals, and therefore, “it is farmers that must see the return”.
“A fundamental aspect of the agreement for the PGI application is the development of a farmer controlled suckler brand, with a budget of €6m, that will recognise the additional value in beef from suckler farms.
“The Department and Bord Bia must now move immediately to develop the suckler beef brand, to go alongside the PGI application, as agreed with IFA.” 
Bord Bia CEO Tara McCarthy said that, if granted, the PGI status would provide a “valuable means” to bolstering the reputation of Irish beef and unlock a range of market advantages to benefit Irish beef farmers.
“This submission is timely, and if successful, the PGI will help strengthen the toolkit available to us to combat the negative effects of Brexit on our beef industry, particularly given the awareness and resonance of PGIs in key Continental markets,” she added.
“I thank all those involved in crafting and fine-tuning this robust submission and eagerly await the decision of the Commission.”

This would give greater access to what sounds like a most lovely outdoor event: a charity fundraiser in aid of St Vincent De Paul Skibbereen and Skibbereen Family Centre, to be held in Dede at The Customs House, in Baltimore. This is the venue where The Menu last summer enjoyed one of his most treasured of all culinary experiences, a very special dining experience in a year all too bereft of them.
Chef Ahmet Dede, formerly Michelin-starred chef of The Mews, and whom The Menu has no doubt would be Michelin-starred chef/co-proprietor (along with Maria Archer) of Dede at the Customs House were it not for Covid 19, will prepare a special kebab menu (beef, chicken and falafel, with flatbreads and sides) along with dessert, mulled wine and hot apple cider, mince pies, gingerbread cookies and plum pudding. In addition, there will be a wine tasting courtesy of Wines Direct, Cheese Tasting with Kevin Collins, of Field’s, in Skibbereen, and a gin tasting from West Cork Distillers. Tickets are just €15 a head (€9 for children) with a  optional donations box for the tastings — and punters are invited to wear their finest Christmas hats and jumpers while Ahmet and Dede will furnish the live festive music. The in-house shop and deli will also be open, selling a range of fine sourdough breads, cakes, rotisserie chickens, salads and dips. All Covid 19 restrictions will be strictly observed in the covered heated outdoor courtyard to the rear of the restaurant and numbers will be limited with four sessions (noon, 2pm, 4pm and 6pm) and booking is essential.

Bakery boost
It’s tough enough to open a dining establishment at the best of times but this is quite probably the worst time of all to commence any hospitality venture but those who engage in the trade tend to have a certain doggedness of character about them, none more so than Michelin-starred chef, Enda McEvoy and his partner Sinead Meacle, the husband and wife team behind Galway’s sustainable Michelin-starred Loam. They have just recently opened Éan, a brand new 56-seater bakery, restaurant & wine bar, on Druid Lane, in Galway, sharing the same building as the globally renowned Druid Theatre Company.
Christine Walsh, head chef at the newly-opened Éan Restaurant, in Galway
Having traded through Level 5 restrictions with a limited menu of bakes and sandwiches, a lifting of restrictions and return to seated dining will reveal a menu of superb bakes and pastries created daily by pastry chef, Lauren Goudeket (of Loam), served alongside seasonally-inspired breakfast (available until 11am), lunch and dinner (wine bar). And The Menu is especially delighted to learn the head chef will be Christine Walsh with whom The Menu has been greatly impressed ever since a few days passed working a stage alongside her some years ago. Christine will oversee an innovative menu and will produce many of the pickles, ferments and charcuterie on offer in what is destined to be a superb addition to the national dining portfolio, a welcome fillip in these fraught times.

Dingle cookery classes
The Menu suspects that one very positive consequence of The Year of Covid 19 is the opening up of so many business models to adapt to a greatly changed operating environment, not least the cookery schools, so many having now gone online to offer classes — in the process greatly expanding access for prospective customers from all over the country and far beyond these shores. While The Menu is in mourning that he will not get to visit his beloved Dingle this year, it is quite some consolation to be able to take one of the cookery classes on offer from the current Irish Cookery School of the Year: Dingle Cookery School. The next up in an ongoing series of classes is a Fish Cookery cook-along class (Dec 4) in partnership with Sustainable Seafood Ireland in which you cook your fish along with chef Mark Murphy as he leads the class. Also upcoming is Cooking Christmas Dinner (Dec 9 & Dec 16) Classes are priced from €35.

TODAY’S SPECIAL
The Menu takes his sampling duties seriously, always giving each and every Irish product he comes across his full attention while tasting. But when it came to running the rule over the Keogh’s Popcorn range, his notes for once fell somewhat shy of his more usual lengthy descriptions.
Keogh’s popcorn, The Menu’s choice this week, especially fine with movies!
While he noted that Keogh’s, creators of fine Irish handmade crisps had applied similar standards to their popcorn, creating a bagged popcorn superior to most others on the market and flavours (Honey & Sea Salt; Butter & Sea Salt; Irish Atlantic Sea Salt) were all sound and balanced, a most ‘buttery’ Butter & Sea Salt, the pick of the bunch. However more extended sampling was conducted by the thieving pack rats that pass for progeny around these parts who made off with the lot and when pressed pronounced them ‘delicious!’.

rewards at the factories this week.
They can demand improved prices for their cattle, on the back of strong pre-Christmas market demand for beef.
Finishers have been a long time waiting for some upward movement in prices at the factories, so they won’t get carried away by the improvement. But at least there is some price movement in the right direction.
The quoted base price for steers has moved to 370 cents/kg at most of the plants this week. Some which continue to offer a base at 365 cents/kg are finding it very difficult to get stock at that price now.
Finishers holding out as hard sellers are getting a price base of up to 375 cents/kg.
There are a few reports of 380 cents/kg being secured.
It is not readily available, but worth trying for by those with better quality in-spec Hereford and Angus lots.
The trade for heifers is showing even stronger gains than the steers, as pressure comes on processors to secure sufficient intake to satisfy the pre-Christmas demand.
The general base price for heifers is 375 cents/kg.
Some finishers are reported to have held out for a base at 380 cents/kg, with some success, although not in all regions of the country. Processors in the northern half of the country are being forced to pay the higher prices, as they compete for tighter supplies.
Finishers with in-spec Hereford and Angus heifers are in a strong position to negotiate for a decent breed bonus on top of the quality assurance and good base, as the breed-branded trade is driven by supermarket demand.
Prices for young bulls are running at 5-10 cents/kg weaker than the comparative steer grade, with the young bull intake continuing at around 50% of the 2019 level.
The cow trade is very steady at up to 320 cents/kg for better quality R-grade cows.
There are some reports of up to 325 cents/kg being paid, although it is not generally the going rate.
O-graders are ranging 290-305 cents/kg and P-graders are making 280-290 cents/kg."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40130042.html,2020-12-02 16:29:00,No-deal Brexit could leave a 40% hole in Irish beef farm incomes,"Without a Brexit trade deal, the average income on Irish beef farms could drop by 40% in 2021, according to Teagasc experts.
The UK market has traditionally been Ireland’s second “home” market for beef, and is estimated to have taken 47% of Irish beef exports so far this year.
If tariffs at the rate indicated by the UK government earlier this year are imposed, in the event of no trade deal being agreed with the EU, Irish exports to the UK are likely to collapse dramatically in 2021, said contributors to the Outlook 2021 Economic Prospects for Agriculture report published by Teagasc this week.
“Irish agriculture faces an enormous challenge in 2021 if no post-Brexit trade deal emerges,” said the Teagasc experts.
Beef farms would be hardest hit, with the 40% income slump assumed “in the absence of very significant Brexit specific income support.”
Teagasc experts said their income analysis for 2021, in the event of a no trade deal Brexit, provides an indication of the scale of the support that would be needed to mitigate the impact of Brexit on Irish farming incomes.
With tariffs, Irish exports to the UK would decline, and prices would fall by about 20%, 8%, and 7% respectively, for cattle, pigs and milk in 2021.
Brexit could drag the average dairy farm net profit margin per hectare down 23% in 2021, from this year’s estimated €1,302 to €1,004.
Irish lamb prices would rise by 7% in 2021, because a Brexit exclusion of UK lamb exports from the EU would boost EU and Irish lamb prices.
Nevertheless, the average sheep farm’s income would still fall by 4% in 2021, because many sheep farmers also have a cattle enterprise, which would experience significant losses.
Imposition of Brexit tariffs on grain imports from the UK could offset an expected fall in international prices for harvest 2021.
A 3% rise in the average cereal farm income is projected by Teagasc, based mainly on a recovery in yields from this year’s low point.
For Irish agriculture, a no-trade deal Brexit outcome could knock €690m off farm income, or €20,200 for the average family farm, assuming that no additional support is made available to address the impact of lower prices.
However, it is likely that additional support would be provided by the EU and the Irish Government.
Nevertheless, the Brexit threat hangs menacingly over what would otherwise have been relatively good prospects for agriculture, and estimates that average family farm income is on the way to a 6% increase in 2020, boosted by cheaper animal feed, fertiliser and fuel, and additional subsidy supports for cattle farms to alleviate the effects of Covid-19.
Unexpectedly, the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on the Irish agri-food sector has been minimal, albeit that additional support was made available to the beef sector, when it was hit by restrictions in marts, a short term contraction in beef processing, and lower beef prices.
Trevor Donnellan of Teagasc said the economic impact of Covid-19 on the Irish economy has been uneven, with distribution and transport, arts and entertainment, suffering the biggest setback, while manufacturing prospered, and agriculture, food processing, and the public sector were largely unaffected.
But unemployment has increased substantially, to 20% in recent weeks when Pandemic Unemployment Payment recipients are factored in.
Good conditions for grassland agriculture in 2020 and reduced production costs, helped dairy, beef and sheep farmers. On the other hand, Irish grain growers had to deal with 2020 weather conditions which substantially reduced yields on some farms.
Meanwhile, efforts are being made to avoid the Brexit storm clouds, with some Irish exporters moving to avoid the initial impact of tariffs by exporting product in 2020 and placing it in storage in the UK.
Cheese exporters, for example, have adopted this tactic, and those stocks now stored in the UK will not be subject to tariffs when marketed.
Teagasc calculations also include product once destined for the UK being absorbed in 2021 by other markets, but at lower price levels.
Nevertheless, Irish milk prices are still expected to fall 7% next year, if there is a no-deal Brexit.
“Hard” Brexit milk price reductions would be processor-specific, dependent on their exposure to the UK market, noted Teagasc experts.
They said their no trade deal assumption is consistent with the Government of Ireland’s operating assumption. For cattle, it could cut 19% off steer, weanling and store prices, and 10% off calf prices.
The resulting average gross profit margin is forecast to decrease by 36% on suckler farms, and by 41% in beef finishing. Brexit therefore poses an urgent challenge to develop new markets for Irish beef. Even with a trade deal, the returns on the UK market will decline, said Teagasc.
Pig prices are forecast to fall by 10% in 2021, to 158c per kg deadweight, with falling Chinese imports an expected major price factor."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40148981.html,2020-12-04 14:30:00,Meeting a new world order head on,"Irish dairy exports rose in 2020 despite the world’s leading economies seeing historic contractions.
“The dairy industry has been the most robust performer throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, and Bord Bia is seeing a 1.3% increase in value,” the food board’s CEO told the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers’ Association (ICMSA) AGM on Thursday.
Global economic uncertainty continues; four fifths of the world economies are likely to contract this year whereas in 2009 there were fewer than half contracted in the recession that took hold.
All of the world’s leading economies are seeing historic contractions this year except for China and the global expectation is that China and the US will prove to be the most resilient.
With less than 30 days left to Brexit, Bord Bia is adamant that there is going to be “substantial and lasting change” because of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
And coupled with that impact there is also the fallout from Covid-19 and its impact on economic recovery to be considered globally.
All of the world’s leading economies are seeing historic contractions this year except for China and the global expectation is that China and the US will prove to be the most resilient.
Ms McCarthy described the challenges facing the country’s food and drinks industry during this week’s meeting which took place virtually.
“We want to go to 180 markets around the world,” she added.
“Through collaboration, our industry has come far but we have a long journey still ahead of us.” 
‘If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together’ is an old African proverb that according to Ms McCarthy has been at the heart of the Irish dairy industry’s success over the last decade.
Just this week Bord Bia concluded its first ever virtual dairy trade mission - a move Ms McCarthy says, “is a sign of the times we are in now”.
Bord Bia was established over 26 years ago to bring Ireland’s food, drink and horticulture produce to the world and to enable growth and sustainability among producers.
The value of Ireland’s exports in 2019 was over €13bn of which 34% was dairy.
The increase in dairy exports is due to a number of factors including price increase and the growth of demand in certain markets including Asia.
Export figures for 2020 will be released in January.
“The key ingredient of success is, notwithstanding collaboration, prioritisation,” she continued.
“The one big driver of change that Covid-19 has brought to all of this is in the digital area and ecommerce. There is a digital version of everything as we try and navigate the very uncertain framework that we now see ourselves in.” 
Global markets and drivers for change 
“There has been disruption of supply chains around the world; Globalisation is to the fore and that means tariffs so we are trying to prove what is different about Irish products,” Ms McCarthy said.
“Verified grass fed and PGI status all come into this.
“Looking at the world population it is clear there is a pivot to the east and the south.
“The United Nations (UN) is predicting that the population will grow by 10bn by 2060 with Africa and Asia accounting for 85% of the growth.
“That will impact on trade flow in those regions which are already heavily reliant on imported food to serve their existing populations.” 
Meanwhile sustainability in a changing climate is also part of the new world order.
And, achieving sustainable resource consumption is going to be a challenge for the global food and drink industry.
“We now have over 260 carbon footprint assessments from beef and dairy farmers in Ireland and there is a continued decline in carbon footprint intensity in this country,” added Ms McCarthy.
“Since 2014 there has been a 9% reduction in Co2 [carbon dioxide] per average unit of milk production on farms.
“This shows that a considerable proportion of farms have performed really well in reducing their carbon footprint.
“With regard to PGI status for Irish beef, the ball is in Europe’s court now with PGI and it can take anything up to six months to get approval,” she continued.
“We would hope there will be no objections, however we know that Minister McConalogue is meeting with his Northern Ireland counterpart over concerns that have been raised there in relation to the application.”

Covid-19 puts new value on dairy ingredients"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40139735.html,2020-12-05 13:44:00,Ocean views from 41 acres for sale in West Cork's Mizen Peninsula,"Located in a scenic setting near the end of the Mizen Peninsula, a 41-acre non-residential farm is on the market just over a week with Clonakilty-based auctioneers Hodnett-Forde.
The property is in a part of the world far removed from the top-class pastures of South Tipperary or East Cork but there is a vibrant agricultural industry in this part of West Cork, centred around dairying and beef cattle. Prices for good land have been holding well in the €7,000-8,000 mark for a number of years.
This particular parcel could be seen as a good example of quality pasture land on the Mizen Peninsula and there will be a good level of demand for it, in an area where not too many good-sized pieces of grassland come on the market.
The farm is in the townland of Gortnagashel, approximately 6km from Goleen, 5km from the magnificent beach at Barleycove and 7km to the east of the famous site of Three Castle Head.
“It’s currently laid out in pasture,” says selling agent John Hodnett, “however parts of the lands require reclamation. The lands have been operating most recently as an outside farm for replacement stock.” The part requiring reclamation is a low-lying area in the middle of the farm. The land offers views of the sea north and south,  towards Dunmanus Bay and south towards Barleycove Beach.
“It’s securely fenced all around,” says John. There is also an old stone ruin on the property which gives it an extra string to its bow for the next owner, should they decide to roof it and develop it for either farming use or attempt to convert it at some point to a rental property.
“The price expectation is around €7,000 per acre,” says John. “We’ve had a few calls on it but it’s early days yet.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40187064.html,2020-12-09 06:30:00,Why the UK will continue to be a major food importer,"Regardless of how Brexit pans out, it will be sold as a great success by the politicians who brought it about.
Even if it looks like a disaster, they will find a way to make it look good.
Just like England's recent announcement that it will scrap the EU system of direct payments to farmers over the next six years, which those politicians have branded as ""green reform, while the EU stays in hock to farmers"".
It remains to be seen if Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland follow suit after English farmers were told their existing system of direct payments will be cut by at least 50% by 2024 and will be gone by 2027.
They must switch to an environmental land management (ELM) system, which UK farm minister George Eustice has said is “the most significant change to farming and land management in 50 years.” It will pay farmers for environmentally beneficial actions such as improving soil health; measures to restore nature, like natural flood management; and landscape recovery such as peatland restoration or planting woodland.
In 2019, the UK was 86% self-sufficient for beef. The major exporter of beef to the UK is Ireland.
Greenpeace UK has praised the British government, which no doubt will continue to promote this as one of the climate actions it can carry out when freed of EU restrictions. Eustice has called the EU's €48 billion-per-year Common Agricultural Policy “actually a bit of a basket case”, and the UK will put itself forward as a climate change champion while pointing at protection of the EU's CAP by the farm industry lobby, at the expense of the environment.
The British public will lap this up, their government siding with CAP critics like teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has accused the EU of hypocrisy for styling itself as a climate leader while backing an old-school CAP.
However, what the government will gloss over is that England and its ELM plan seems to be moving the UK further away from food self-sufficiency, and more towards dependence on food imports.
The existing direct payments contributed 55% of the average English farm income in 2018/19.
No wonder National Farmers' Union president Minette Batters, said: ""Expecting farmers to run viable, high-cost farm businesses, continue to produce food, and increase their environmental delivery while phasing out existing support and without a complete replacement scheme for almost three years, is high risk and a very big ask.""
Some farmers will have to diversify outside of agriculture, to earn the ELM payments on offer for ‘public goods’, such as better air and soil health.
ELM is not expected to completely offset the phased out direct payments, so less money to invest in increasing food production seems the future for English farmers.
It is obvious that the UK will continue to be a major food importer, and will likely produce even less of its own food than it does currently.
Why expand a farm's food production if, without a trade deal, it is forecast that food export volumes out of the UK to its nearest neighbour, the EU, will shrink to almost negligible levels for most commodities?
Even if there is a deal, border controls will return, costing time and money, at least in the first years, which could have serious negative consequences in the case of fresh food produce such as beef, lamb and pork going into Europe.
Everything points to the UK becoming an even bigger net importer of beef and pig meat, being currently only 75%-80% and 60% self-sufficient for these commodities.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the British government will therefore point to its freedom, after leaving the EU, to negotiate free trade agreements with major agricultural exporters such as the US, Australia, and New Zealand. But it's a double-edged sword, with the prospect of imports from these competitive exporters further turning away UK farmers from food production.
And trade deals will take years to conclude.
In 2019, the UK was 86% self-sufficient for beef. The major exporter of beef to the UK is Ireland. In 2019, the UK reached 95% self-sufficiency for butter but still imported about six times as much butter as it exported to Ireland.
Sheep meat is one of the few commodities for which the UK is more than 100% self-sufficient. However, it imports legs of lambs, and exports whole or half carcases, and UK production of lamb peaks in the autumn, whereas demand spikes at Easter and Christmas. Without a free trade agreement, UK lamb would not be competitive in the EU. So Brexit poses a major threat to UK sheep farmers.
The UK is far from self-sufficient in pig meat. In 2019, about 60% of the pig meat for consumption in the UK was imported, almost all from the EU. 
But it is consumers the UK government is more worried about, and the overall picture for them in January, with or without a trade deal, is higher prices and gaps on the shelves in UK supermarkets, after departure from the EU’s single market and customs union leads to supplies of certain foods getting scarce. The UK imports around 45% of its food, with 26% coming from the EU, including nearly all the onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and salad consumed in the UK.
That's why the UK's Food and Drink Federation says a no-deal outcome would be “catastrophic” for UK supply chains.
How could Boris Johnson's government dress that up as progress? It can do so by not levying tariffs on food imports if there is no-deal. The UK government has published tariffs it intends to impose on imported foods, but when it breaks its last links to the EU, on January 1, it is free to revise them.
This is no doubt part of Boris Johnson's back-up plan for a no-deal Brexit, to announce a reprieve for his consumers, and perhaps for his Irish ""friends"" who supply much of the UK's food.
It would be in fact the only option for a large net food importer. Exempting products like sheep meat would protect UK sheep farmers. There would literally be something for everyone in the audience."

One in particular — the sale of cheap alcohol in supermarkets.
Ten years ago my family experienced a Christmas like no other, it was our first Christmas without our son, David, who sadly took his own life after attending a house party where alcohol was freely available.
It states on his death certificate that alcohol was a contributing factor in his death. David had just turned 19. My wife and I campaigned for change in the laws regarding the price, availability, and promotion of alcohol. While some progress has been made, the law surrounding minimum unit pricing has not been implemented. This law would prevent the strongest, cheapest alcohol from being sold at ridiculously low prices in supermarkets and other outlets.
It won’t stop alcohol abuse but minimum unit pricing will contribute to the reduction of alcohol consumption. Covid-19 has contributed to an increase in home drinking which can only add to incidences of domestic abuse and all the dangers associated with unsupervised house parties. 
I would ask the health minister to continue the good work of the Public Health Alcohol act 2018 and enact the act for minimum unit pricing now.

A time to rebuild after ruins of Covid
“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” — Charles Dickens might well begin his novel about the effect of Covid-19 on our country with these words. ‘A tale of two countries’ could be its title and truly they sum up the impact on Irish society of this virus with the measures taken to combat it.
For some people, the restrictions and lockdowns have proved disastrous. Jobs have been lost, never to return, far more loved ones have died without comfort, funerals have been held without proper mourning, weddings have been cancelled, etc. Yet for others new ways of living have been discovered: Working from home, moving to the countryside from stressful city life, a cleaner environment, quieter roads, old values and skills revisited like home cooking. However, on the whole, the impact of Covid-19 has been at least inconvenient and disruptive if not devastating.
We can look forward to the new year as the beginning of an economic boom and a true rebirth and resurgence of the human spirit where we will be born again believers in the values, priorities and aspirations of Irish society. Let us begin to rebuild what has been destroyed, attend to what has been neglected and revive all hope in our future achievements.

Deconstructing our State’s narrative
A campaign to remove references to British monarch Queen Victoria in street names in Ireland is a noble and worthy initiative — ‘Men who painted out queen’s name on Cork signs are ‘of utmost sincerity’’ (Irish Examiner, December 8). 
Even today, the queen’s name conjures up images of famine, evictions, tenant farmers, landlordism, workhouses, and coffin ships. Ireland’s avoidable famine deaths were inflicted almost exclusively on the Catholic peasantry in what can almost be described as an act of genocide.

What a pathetic nation we have allowed ourselves to become. We have issued pardons and apologies to those Irish soldiers who deserted their posts during the Second World War while Ireland was in danger of invasion by Nazi Germany or Britain, and have to endure an annual commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary in Glasnevin Cemetery.
The RIC was a body of police which incorporated the odious thugs of the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries in its ranks. It seems that decades of revisionism and propaganda with the specific purpose of incrementally deconstructing the narrative of the Irish state is bearing fruit.

Pay students for ‘professional’ work
Our Chief Justice is a leader. He has decided, in these extraordinary times, not to take a pay increase. This is a personal choice — but an exemplary one. Student nurses in this country have, in some cases, been given the duty of dressing dead babies and the responsibility for consoling bereaved mothers.
This is not, by any stretch, “work experience”. It is traumatic professional work that I for one do not want to do.

Former taoisigh to get a €17,000 yearly increase on their pensions
These people should be paid for their work. If for no other reason than the fact that they have shown that they will do it anyway.
We have excellent judges in this country and they do an extraordinarily stressful and responsible job.
But as far as I am concerned, our nurses and student nurses are just as important — if not more.

Deliveries in doubt
Substantial coverage was given to An Post and the company’s arrangements for Christmas deliveries on RTÉ News. 
An Post indicated the difficulties they would have completing deliveries presented to them by some on-line suppliers after December 14. 
It would be interesting to know if the other couriers operating in this sector were able to cope with a similar increase in volume.

Pass it forward
During the past month we have witnessed the depths to which football has sunk. Whether it was the Kerry v Cork or Dublin v Cavan matches, the abysmal standard of football was the same. 
Endless handpassing of the ball backwards then forwards, then again in loops and circles across the field; I would hazard at a guess 600 to 700 handpasses. This is a low-grade skill, which is executed poorly, and many passes go astray.
There is endless talk about the structure of the championship and little discussion around the appalling standard of football. For a start, could the powers that be decide that all handpasses must be positively forward, i.e, any pass that is flat or backwards results in a turnover of possession.
This will not be difficult to adjudge for a referee and should lead to much quicker release of the ball and a greater emphasis on the skill of kicking, which is what it should be about.

Double standards
The EU harp on about preserving ‘standards’ which the UK may default on. I believe they should think again.
The EU-Mercosur trade deal is not complying with their rules, or ‘standards’; the use of growth hormones which is banned in EU beef production, is widespread in South America, particularly Argentina.
So it is disappointing to hear them go on about standards, which can be perceived as talking out both sides of their mouth. 
So why not weed those obstacles out first, pull the plug on Mercosur, and retain existing non-tariff status quo on UK-EU beef and lamb trade. Everybody wins, including the Irish farmers.

Outraged at lyrics
Those who feel “offended” because of a few words in the magnificent song, ‘Fairytale of New York’, are welcome to jump around feigning distress every time it’s played on radio and TV. The lyrics as sung by Kirsty and Shane are the language of the truly suffering and marginalised desperate outcasts of this world, who express their sorrow in this way every day of their lives.
Any perceived “offending” words belong to us all who believe in honesty and freedom of speech. Songwriting and words used lay no claim to being deliberately demeaning in their content.

No ‘outraged’ community has the right to censor language and specific real words just because it plays into their self-pitying and shrill narrative.

Singing praise
Happy, heavenly 105th birthday to Frank Sinatra tomorrow, December 12. His incredible talent in all fields of the entertainment industry is legendary, especially in music. His gift of phrasing a song was exactly that, a gift. Add acting in comedy, drama, or musical plus conducting an orchestra and his philanthropic involvement with hospitals and children and we have much to be thankful for.

The government’s Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) in 2019 offered €100m funded 50/50 by the EU and Ireland to beef farmers,  as compensation for low cattle prices cuts.
Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received some €77.72m from the scheme, but it will be clawed back from those who don’t fulfil the scheme requirement of reducing the organic manure nitrogen from their cattle 5% over 12 months (to next July).
Teagasc Galway/Clare Drystock Adviser Colm Kelly has outlined some tricky BEAM scenarios he has encountered.
For example, Andrea took over her farm, and changed the system from suckler cows to dairy calf-to-beef.
Transitioning from suckler cows to dairy calves coincided with the reference period, leaving a lower than normal stocking rate due to declining cow numbers, and the low age profile for youngstock purchased.
Also, as new land has been rented, this increased the stocking capacity. To keep the payment, as it stands, Andrea would have to make a drastic cut to her stock numbers, and the losses per head would outweigh the value of her €800 BEAM payment.
Frank is finishing cattle all year round, and regularly buys cattle in batches. The BEAM payment he received is significant, so it is important to retain it.
But it is proving difficult for Frank to accurately forecast his numbers, as animals turning from one to two-year-olds (57kg of organic nitrogen/year) to two years plus (65kg) can make a significant difference. Frank is taking a dual approach of monitoring average figures as each month’s end, and comparing those to the equivalent month in 2018/2019. 
This gives him a sense of how he has been trending.
A BEAM calculator allows him to then forecast numbers for the remainder of the compliance period. 
Calculators are available through advisors, and now through ICBF Herdplus (a Herdplus account costs €60 per year; it provides herdowners with performance data which can be used to increase profit).
Frank has had to assume animals are aged two-plus, if in doubt. In this way, he is likely to depress his throughput of cattle by being overly cautious, but guarantees keeping his payment.
It is recommended to have a 2% margin for error, as the Department of Agriculture counts the days an animal is on a farm through the animal movements system, whereas it is only practical for farmers at present to use monthly averages when forecasting.
David has a weanling system selling in October and November, with some sold the following March. At the application stage, David’s reduction figure was 130kg, the equivalent of two suckler cows.
However, in late 2018, he culled more cows than normal, and did not replace them until the following March. This presented the problem of his BEAM reference figure being lower than his normal operating number. And with no reductions made at the start of the year, what is required now is the equivalent of six cows sold this month and all weanlings sold by the end of January.
To achieve this, scanning cows can show empties which can be culled straight away, but the sale of in-calf cows would also likely be required. The reduced cow numbers could be replaced at the end of 2021, once the reduction period ends.
Suckler farmer James has had stable numbers since the reference period. While he started off on target, he has since seen his numbers drift upwards to the current point of being 2% under for the month of November.
Some of this difference is due to keeping some cattle longer, because of finishing cattle rather than selling live. Another contributing factor on James’s farm is that he purchased a dairy cow to rear a calf. This dairy cow has a weighting of 85kg of organic nitrogen per year, compared to a beef breed suckler cow weighting of 65kg.
James can therefore make a proportionately greater reduction by selling this dairy cow now.
James also keeps ewes, and has increased the numbers put to the ram slightly this year, to offset a reduction in beef stocking rate, so overall farm performance can continue to improve.
Farmers have to achieve the 5% reduction of organic manure nitrogen from their cattle before June 30, 2021. Colm Kelly advised BEAM participants to assess where they are now with an advisor. The longer the necessary destocking is postponed, the more drastic it becomes.
ICBF has now launched an online BEAM calculator for HerdPlus members to allow BEAM participants project forward their overall organic nitrogen, by entering livestock numbers they intend to have until June 30 next.
The calculator will indicate if they are meeting the required 5% nitrogen reduction or not, and how stock numbers and categories of animals need to be adjusted until the nitrogen target is met.
Bureaucratic nightmare
Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association beef chairman Edmund Graham said the 5% reduction requirement for the BEAM scheme is a bureaucratic nightmare for farmers and advisors, and has called on the Department of Agriculture for it to be shelved because “it has not been thought through, and it is unworkable”.
“I am concerned that a large majority of farmers will not achieve the unworkable requirement and this will lead to the appalling vista of the bulk of the money allocated being recouped.”
“It is proving very difficult for farmers to implement this requirement, particularly because of the immense disruption caused by Covid and Brexit uncertainty.
“I am aware of farmers who do not want to push cattle to finish them in January or February, because of uncertainty around markets in early 2021 arising from Brexit unknowns. So it is not fair to retain this rule in a year where such uncertainty has prevailed and where marts have been closed or restricted in ways that were not foreseen when this scheme was drawn up.”
ICSA also suggested that Teagasc survey its clients to determine what proportion believe they are facing a clawback."

This part of Munster has enjoyed a lot of significant sales in the last few years. There is a very healthy confluence of interests from a variety of sectors and the strength of the agricultural land market has consolidated. Locally, the dairying sector is the most important but there is also active interest from the equestrian sector, as well as from the tillage and beef cattle sectors.
The two blocks of land are within 3km of one another and lie to the west of the village of Rathcormac. Both are excellent quality grassland and both of them are accessed via the R614 that crosses the M8 Dublin-Cork motorway.
“They’re both in very good locations,” says Paul, “and they’re on a very good road too, it’s the old Rathcormac-Cork-Fermoy road.”
The smaller of the two holdings is a 15.5-acre non-residential block laid out in two fields in the townland of Gearagh. This is approximately 5km from Rathcormac, a village that has grown in size over the last decade or so, thanks to the increased connectivity from the building of the motorway that passes just west of the village. Fermoy is just 12km away while Cork City centre is within half an hour’s drive of the property.
“This property is in a prime location,” says Paul. “It has superb views of the surrounding countryside and it’s only a short distance from the villages of Rathcormac and Glenville (7km).”
According to the selling agent, there has been both local and outside interest in these two pieces of ground that represent some of the best quality land in the area, according to Paul.
“There’s been good interest in both,” says Paul of the properties that are owned by two different vendors. “We’re currently at €15,500/acre with the 15.5-acre parcel and we’d expect to wrap it up in the next week to ten days.”
The 41-acre holding is in the townland of Corbally, 7.5km east of Rathcormac and also half an hour from Cork City. The River Bride forms a long stretch of its boundary and it has ample  frontage on two sides onto a minor road off the R614.
“It’s a very nice piece of ground,” says Paul. “It’s a lovely sheltered piece of land, very nice and laid out in four divisions. It’s all good ground and it’s currently let at the moment but in good condition.”
With increased interest in top class land in this prime location over the last year, it will be surprising if these parcels remain on the market too long. The smaller holding may have the advantage of attracting a wider set of interested parties by virtue of its smaller size but the 41-acre farm shouldn’t be too far behind and its price expectation of €14-€15,000 per acre (open to offers) should be an achievable one."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-40194222.html,2020-12-21 06:30:00,Podcast: Ranking the Cabinet ministers on their 2020 performance,"The 177 days in the life of this government have been turbulent, to say the least. Battling the twin crises of Brexit and Covid-19, the historic three-party Coalition has proven itself to be resilient if not extraordinarily prone to self-imposed errors.
The ‘Irish Examiner’ political team — Daniel McConnell, Elaine Loughlin, Paul Hosford, and Aoife Moore — give their individual assessments of the performance of the 15 people around the Cabinet table.
Micheál Martin, Taoiseach
5/10
Having waited nine years as Fianna Fáil leader to become Cork’s first taoiseach since Jack Lynch, Micheál Martin had a torrid start. Losing two senior ministers in seven weeks, his government struggled.
Has grown into the role and his prioritisation of getting schools re-open was a major success. Remains aloof from his parliamentary party, which is struggling badly in the polls and his inflexibility remains an issue for many.
Daniel McConnell
7/10
For almost a decade he sat as opposition leader looking over at the seat he wanted more than anything else. But when he finally became taoiseach he seemed ill-prepared.
After getting off to a rocky start, which included numerous controversies and the resignation of one Fianna Fáil minister and the sacking of another, he has settled in and has made a number of difficult choices. The two most recent addresses on Covid show him as a level-headed politician able to lead.
Elaine Loughlin
6/10
After finally ascending to the throne, Martin might have been forgiven in the summer for wondering why he had ever wanted to. A resignation, a sacking, missteps, and poor communication led to a sense that his administration was over before it began. But as the country went into, and emerged from, a second lockdown, he has proved that his innate level-headedness is an attribute in unlevel times.
Paul Hosford
6/10
Risk-averse, often to his own detriment, and has lost a lot of goodwill within his own party. A strong and sensible leader not given to fits of emotion and has marked out his tenure as that of someone of much talk but little radical action. His party continues to flounder in the polls while he does not seem interested in changing direction.
While the country reels from the pandemic, a steady hand is welcome, but heading into recession his lack of willingness to listen will become a major issue.
Aoife Moore
Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Enterprise
2/10
2020 is the year the man’s myth was busted open. A disastrous general election should have seen him deposed. While he regained some credibility as taoiseach during the first wave of Covid-19, his switch to tánaiste has seen him regress into the worst elements of himself. Undermining government from within, going to war with Tony Holohan and then getting caught leaking a document to a friend. Must do better.
Daniel McConnell
6/10
Got off to the best start in the new three-way Government but arguably had the easiest transition. At a time when businesses were faced with a complete loss of income overnight and tens of thousands of people were left without work, he has often seemed more fixated on scoring political points against Sinn Féin and even those in his own Government. Taking to Twitter to make announcements ahead of the Government, including on the Budget, is a cheap shot.
Elaine Loughlin
4/10
There are often two Leos. The leader on top of his brief, a clear communicator. But there is also the one who enjoys petty swipes at the opposition and announces Government policy on Twitter. It is the latter we have seen too much of in recent months. In his department, there has been a dismal uptake in some Covid supports and a wave of business closures could come as early as January.
Paul Hosford
2/10
In this term as a minister, he has done little but announce new private sector jobs while kicking a number of cans, including sick pay during a pandemic and reform of the insurance industry further down the road. Heavy on reports, light on action. A number of gaffes and petty politicking has overshadowed any work done in his remit, while he sought to undermine Micheál Martin at every turn. Has allowed debate with Sinn Féin to dominate politics in a time where people need decisive action.
Aoife Moore
Eamon Ryan, Transport
3/10
The Green Party leader won out in the internal battle about going into government with a commanding majority.
A second-time minister, Ryan, however, has already seen a number of party members resign amid accusations that he has sold out in order to be in power.
His climate bill was panned by many, including former party members such as Lorna Bogue, who said it “prefers to obfuscate responsibility and weaken legal responsibility”.
The aviation sector is on its knees.
Daniel McConnell
6/10
Often drowned out by the two other leaders in this three-way Government. He has been one of the most vocal in arguing that the impact on business, the economy, and people’s mental health must be considered in any Covid decisions which ultimately led to the Government going against Nphet’s recommendations for stricter measures.
Elaine Loughlin
4/10
At Cabinet level, Ryan is seen as vocal on the unseen effects of Covid and is usually quite effective. However, as leader of a party established to tackle a climate emergency, a watery Climate Action Bill derided by his own TDs can’t be ignored. In transport and communications, there is more of the same, with announcements of National Development Plan staples such as electrifying the commuter rail lines in Dublin, but there is no sense of a sea-change in thinking.
Paul Hosford
2/10
The mass exodus from his party over the climate bill is a testament to his performance in the portfolio he has dedicated his career to securing. A rushed climate bill, described by his own members as worse than Richard Bruton’s, and an attempt to force it through the Oireachtas, beggars belief at why he fought so hard to get into government while using the climate emergency as his reason for it. And he fell asleep in the Dáil.
Aoife Moore
Simon Coveney, Foreign Affairs
6/10
His steady hand on Brexit, despite his reduced status at Cabinet, has left many in Fine Gael wondering why they didn’t pick him to be leader in 2017.
Not an overly warm personality, Coveney’s stock is high at present and appears the obvious choice as Varadkar’s successor.
Has the respect of important stakeholders North and South and is a credible advocate for Ireland on the European stage.
Daniel McConnell
8.5/10
He showed a tremendous work ethic and ability to engage with his international counterparts on what he described in the Dáil as “the Santa Claus issue”.
In announcing Santa is exempt from quarantining, as his work is deemed essential travel, he won the hearts of many young people and their parents. He has also become a master of diplomacy and at a time when calm heads have been needed more than ever, he has become a respected authority on Brexit and other matters.
Elaine Loughlin
7/10
Coveney has handled his Brexit duties with a quiet effectiveness and has been a consistently good messenger for the Government on Covid.
He often seems tailor-made for this role and it was not a surprise to see him touted for the European Commission job after Phil Hogan’s departure.
The controversy around his entitlement to a state car at a cost of €200,000 a year proved to be unnecessary bad optics, however.
Paul Hosford
7/10
Naturally fitted to his brief, a statesman and diplomat to his bones, well regarded in Leinster House and Brussels, it’s difficult to see Coveney in another role.
Despite public apathy to Brexit, Coveney has not stopped his campaign to represent Ireland in Brexit negotiations, fronting EU and British media often. Rarely given to scandal or controversy, he is widely regarded as still having a future as leader of Fine Gael.
Aoife Moore
Helen McEntee, Justice
4/10
McEntee’s appointment to one of the most senior Cabinet portfolios was somewhat of a surprise but she is rated highly by Leo Varadkar.
Normally competent and judicious, McEntee has been at the epicentre of the Séamus Woulfe row, given her protracted refusal to answer questions over his “crony” appointment. This was a mistake and did her damage, but not fatal.
Highlights so far are her work on tackling white-collar crime and the sharing of sexual images.
Daniel McConnell
6.5/10
McEntee follows a long line of Fine Gael justice ministers, from Alan Shatter to Frances Fitzgerald, who have got themselves in hot water. Her refusal to address the Dáil on the appointment of judge Séamus Woulfe exacerbated an issue that could have been put to bed a lot sooner. She is committed to tackling important issues, including the sharing of sexual images, white collar crime, and a court decision banning the naming of murdered children. She is the first senior Cabinet minister to be expecting a baby while in office.
Elaine Loughlin
6/10
Would be a mark higher had this come a fortnight sooner. Her refusal to immediately address the Dáil on the appointment to the Supreme Court of Séamus Woulfe was a serious misstep and fed into the idea that there was something to hide. Legislatively, she has shown a willingness to implement the O’Malley Review and the recommendations of the Review Group on Justice issues, as well as working hard to get the Harmful Communications Bill made law this side of Christmas.
Paul Hosford
5/10
Impressive work on the prioritisation of the image-based sexual abuse bill, originally tabled by Labour. Disastrous on Séamus Woulfe appointment, managing to unite the opposition and dissolve the Dáil business committee by refusing to come before the Dáil. Holds up well under scrutiny but did not let her colleagues throw her under the bus either. Talking points against Labour’s Born Here, Belong Here campaign were worrying and not conducive to a welcoming, modern society.
Aoife Moore
Norma Foley, Education
5/10
Foley, as a first-time TD come minister, got off to a rocky start and her early days were marked by some missteps. To her credit, backed by her taoiseach, she got the country’s schools re-opened, a huge achievement. She got the Leaving Cert concluded, albeit with some issues. Remains overly reluctant in the media and will take time to establish herself.
Daniel McConnell
5.5/10
Weak start, but came back fighting. The first-time TD found herself promoted to one of the most important Cabinet positions, only to be pushed into the eye of a Leaving Cert storm. Has settled into the role. Tackled the Leaving Certificate calculated grades issues as best she could. While inexperienced at a national level, it is clear that she is a naturally astute politician.
Elaine Loughlin
5/10
A first-time TD taking on the Department of Education? You must at least admire her guts.
However, the performance from early on left a little to be desired.
From the Leaving Cert calculated grades debacle to a recall of hand sanitiser, to teachers threatening to strike over Covid concerns. Seems to be settling into the role now, but has a job of work ahead of her.
Paul Hosford
6/10
A new TD and minister in a portfolio that had a mire of problems before she arrived. She handled the Leaving Cert issue well, despite ongoing issues with transparency in the department.
Give or take a few disastrous media outings, has managed to keep her head down and appears reasonable in Dáil debate.
Aoife Moore
Michael McGrath, Public Expenditure
5/10
As spending minister, McGrath has already introduced two budgets if you factor in the €8.5bn July Stimulus and Budget 2021. While it is easier to be dolling out the cash, far tricker waters await and the Fiscal Council has given him a slap on the knuckles over the rate of spending introduced. McGrath is not a show pony and not prone to argy-bargy, but is said to be a steely operator behind the scenes.
Daniel McConnell
8/10
During an unprecedented pandemic, Michael McGrath managed to forge agreement on a Budget without much hassle at all, a major feat given that he was negotiating with the Green Party and Civil War enemies Fine Gael. Journalists were left scrambling for stories about the usual Budget rows and wrangling.
While lacking controversy, Budget 2021 did seem to reflect more Fine Gael policies than Fianna Fáil’s. He also had a leading role in Government formation talks.
Elaine Loughlin
6/10
Prudence. Calmness. Common sense. McGrath has had to co-deliver the largest budget in the State’s history and did so with minimal fuss. However, the Fiscal Advisory Council has sounded the alarm that up to €8bn of next year’s committed spending is not financed and the programme for government is too narrow to allow for additional revenue streams.
Paul Hosford
5/10
Cool-headed and reasonable, McGrath does not involve himself in petty politicking against the opposition and conducts himself with respect. Despite this, it’s noted that McGrath is easily out- manoeuvred by Paschal Donohoe.
The budget displayed how Fine Gael would not compromise on what they didn’t want to, even if Fianna Fáil did manage some concessions. This does not bode well knowing that Fine Gael will soon be looking to balance the books and those affected most will want someone in their corner.
Aoife Moore
Paschal Donohoe, Finance
6/10
He has overseen the greatest negative swing in the public finances in a decade because of Covid, but his prudence in previous years has created wiggle room. His election to the position of President of the Eurogroup is a sign of how well he is respected. A heavyweight politician and the Dáil’s most articulate defender of centrist politics. With Varadkar’s difficulties mounting, besides Coveney, Donohoe is a credible choice as future Fine Gael leader.
Daniel McConnell
8.5/10
Paschal Donohoe may have let go of the Public Expenditure portfolio, but he is still double jobbing, having secured the President of the Eurogroup gig, giving Ireland a prominent financial role at a unique time for not just Europe but the entire world. While the pandemic has limited the number of public events, he has kept up regular appearances on television and radio and is unflappable under questioning.
Elaine Loughlin
7/10
The safest pair of hands that you can imagine, Donohoe’s role in the early days of the pandemic was to reassure the public. Since the new government came to power, he has delivered the largest budget in the history of the State, amid a second seismic shock to the economy in 10 years, without causing too much controversy. That in itself is good going.
Paul Hosford
7/10
His most successful year yet both at home and abroad. Record government expenditure during the pandemic (from Fine Gael, no less) and a historic election as Eurogroup president. Donohoe was often seen as the biggest hitter in programme for government negotiations, deftly guiding talks to ensure his party kept their most sacred portfolios and unloading problem ministries.
Scandal-adverse and generally well regarded even by those who disagree with his policies, Donohoe could well be the next leader of Fine Gael.
Aoife Moore
Stephen Donnelly, Health
2/10
Every government has at least one minister who becomes a focal point for criticism, and Stephen Donnelly is it. A rookie minister in possibly the toughest portfolio, he has been a target of abuse from TDs and has had two major memos on dealing with Covid-19 (breaking up house parties and outside drinking) rebuffed by his Cabinet colleagues. Has angered CervicalCheck campaigners. Must do better
Daniel McConnell
3/10
Spent most of the summer flying Covid kites which were quickly shot down by Cabinet. Since then he has been sidelined and it is now the three Government leaders who make pandemic-related announcements. Widely criticised for his lack of consultation with campaigners on the CervicalCheck tribunal and sparked fury among student nurses for the Government’s refusal to pay them. Who can forget the trampoline comment?
Elaine Loughlin
4/10
Seemed incapable of getting out of his own way at times. His handling of NPHET proposals to go to Level 5 and CervicalCheck victims left a lot to be desired and student nurses will likely mark him low. However, the handling of the vaccine sequencing rollout plan thus far and the fact that the health system is still standing are plusses.
Paul Hosford
4/10
The hardest portfolio in government during the pandemic, Donnelly has not been as warmly regarded as his predecessor. Managing to annoy everyone from student nurses to the 221+ CervicalCheck group, amid a number of media gaffes, it’s not gone unnoticed how many of the promises he made in opposition have fallen by the wayside.
Aoife Moore
Darragh O’Brien, Housing
3/10
Unlike his predecessor, Eoghan Murphy, who had become a lightning rod for controversy, Darragh O’Brien’s time in the Department of Housing has been calmer. Has largely escaped unscathed given the focus on the response to the pandemic. His stand-out moment so far has been the banning of co-living developments. Building houses for this year is behind target and the reliance on the private sector is a major issue.
Daniel McConnell
4/10
O’Brien is one of a number of ministers who are difficult to score this year simply because they haven’t been seen. However, the housing and homelessness crisis has not gone away. It is now likely to be the end of 2023 before housing supply meets demand, with only 18,000 homes expected to be built this year. In October, there were 6,095 adults and 2,642 children living in emergency accommodation. He may have avoided significant controversy but that doesn’t signal a good performance.
Elaine Loughlin
4/10
Stepping into Housing was always going to be a tough ask amid the pandemic. House completions will be down, the mortgage market is tricky and the demands on the public purse are even greater.
But while O’Brien signalled some good news for down the line in the Budget, a promised affordable housing plan hasn’t been published and the policy which led to an dramatic undersupply and 10,000 people homeless hasn’t changed markedly.
Paul Hosford
4/10
The pandemic has shifted focus from what was the most fraught portfolio.
Despite initial hesitation, managed to ban co-living after a number of plans were approved.
Policy on the delivery has not differed from that of Fine Gael in any real way despite much bluster in the election. Has managed to fly under the radar and has so far avoided scandal.
Has the potential to turn around the crisis after the pandemic if he follows his own instincts and not his civil servants’.
Aoife Moore
Charlie McConalogue, Agriculture
3/10
The Donegal-native has faced a hostile farming sector over Brexit fears, CAP cuts, and low dairy and beef prices.
It’s been a baptism of fire and he has yet to define what sort of minister he will be.
Daniel McConnell

As the longest serving Minister for Agriculture in the current Government, following the departures of Barry Cowen and Dara Calleary, McConalogue has achieved what his predecessors couldn’t and stayed the course.
Some argued that he should have been appointed Agriculture Minister from the get go, having acted as Fianna Fáil’s spokesman in the previous Dáil.
Largely untested so far, the pressure Brexit will put on the agri-food sector and farmers incomes next year will determine his ability.

McConalogue’s only real challenge thus far has been the recall of the ViraPro hand sanitiser from schools. January 1 could change all of that, when we will really see what he is made of as Brexit bites.
Paul Hosford

As Ministers for Agriculture go in this government, I respect him for his longevity.

Heather Humphreys, Social Protection
4/10
The late Seamus Brennan once described the Department of Social Welfare as a glorified ATM, and Heather Humphrey’s tenure has typified this, given the explosion in Covid-19 pandemic-related payments. The move away from the top €350-a-week rate of the pandemic unemployment payment was short-lived, and tough seas lie ahead for her. While she has not put a foot wrong, she has not set the world alight either.
Daniel McConnell
4.5/10
For the most part, she has stayed out of the headlines and the many controversies that have dogged this Government and so it would be easy to give her a relatively high score. She may have extended the emergency PUP but only after cutting the rates, which sparked fury among those struggling through the pandemic
With tens of thousands of people working from home, Covid could have provided her with an opportunity to press ahead with rural regeneration in a significant way. However, we have heard little from her this term and the publication of a blueprint for rural Ireland has been kicked back to January.
Elaine Loughlin
7/10
There was a time when Heather Humphreys was considered among the weakest of Cabinet’s media performers. But since her promotion to Social Protection, at a time when the budget for that department has swelled and its challenges multiplied, she has proven to be a safe pair of hands and has avoided many of the pitfalls that have swallowed others in the portfolio.
Paul Hosford
6/10
There has rarely been a better time to be social protection minister than at this point in 2020. Humphreys is one of the few ministers in this calamitous government who has managed to escape a scandal of her own.
This tide will surely turn when the debt-collector comes knocking, but for now, she has managed to perform on the positive side of average, which in this government, is the best you can hope for.
Aoife Moore
Simon Harris, Higher Education
6/10
A surprise choice for this newly created department, given his central role in health in the early part of the pandemic. Rumour has it Fianna Fáil’s Thomas Byrne was originally the intended occupant but last-minute wrangling scuppered that.
The demotion aside, Harris, despite only having an embryonic department to work with, has already shown a deft touch in dealing with the impact of Covid on his flock. By far the Government’s most effective communicator.
Daniel McConnell
9/10
Not only did the Minister for Higher Education manage to find extra places for every student who became caught up in the Leaving Cert grading errors debacle, he also secured a €250 bonus for everyone in third-level education this year as a gesture of thanks and acknowledgement for the year that they have had. Harris, with significant help from his young daughter, uses Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to his advantage.
Elaine Loughlin
8.5/10
Another who took on a new department, Harris was seen by many to be demoted from the high-profile Health ministry, but his reinvention in this department has served him well.
Reacted quickly to the Leaving Cert issue to ensure college spaces were available and fought for €50m to give each college student €250 in the Budget. Called the ‘Minister for Instagram’ by one derisive opposition TD, his use of social media is clever and capitalises on his excellent communication ability.
Paul Hosford
8/10
The best use of social media by anyone in cabinet by a long stretch and fitting for the Fianna Fáil brainchild portfolio he has been given.
Open and frank about the “snobbery” around college courses and has done excellent work on promoting apprenticeships.
Work on sexual harassment has been welcome and is often a welcome change from the more vitriolic members of his party in debate.
Aoife Moore
Roderic O’Gorman, Children
4/10
Showed a degree of political naivety in his handling of the mother and baby homes issue in the Dáil, which caused widespread consternation in all three government parties.
The former law lecturer, is, however, a considered if somewhat understated member at Cabinet and the delivery of three weeks in additional parents’ leave is a significant win, even if he failed to sell it properly. A rocky start but the first time TD and minister shows promise.
Daniel McConnell
6/10
A complete failure to see the controversy that would explode around the sealing of records relating to the mother and baby home commission, demonstrated a distinct naivety on the part of the new TD and minister.
He also came under fire for failing to secure any additional support for parents with the cost of childcare, but he did hammer out a special deal on the wage subsidy scheme to keep creches open. He has extended parents leave and has prioritised the most vulnerable, including those in direct provision.
Elaine Loughlin
6/10
O’Gorman’s sleepwalking into the mother and baby homes controversy was as uncharacteristic as it was damaging. However, taking on a newly (re)created department which is in need of huge legislative changes, he has made some decent noises, namely on direct provision, parental leave, and LGBTI inclusion.
He has also handled a targeted wave of lies and abuse aimed at him with grace.
Paul Hosford
6/10
A terrible day-out over the mother and baby homes, which was not totally a mess of his own making but handled poorly by not meeting survivors groups. Has stayed relatively quiet but has made some inroads with survivors after the debacle.
He is battling unhappy civil servants in a number of departments on how to end direct provision. However, no plan is yet published on the issue.
Aoife Moore
Catherine Martin, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Media
23/07/2020 Catherine Martin
5/10
She voted against going into government and lost. She challenged to be her party’s leader and lost. Awarded an gargantuan number of portfolios, Martin has sought to negate the impact of Covid on the tourism, arts, and music sectors.
Martin battled hard and secured a fund of €60m to support businesses in response to Covid-19. Part of this was the reduction in Vat rate to 9%. However, her plan to secure a viable print media has been panned by the NUJ and newspapers.
Daniel McConnell
5.5/10
Massive ambition but a lack of experience in Government has sometimes let her down.
Announced a number of supports for the arts sector, including a scheme to help get the live entertainment industry back up and running, which demonstrated her ability to think outside the box. The lack of detail behind some of the measures has been noted.
The more militant side of the party has been disappointed by her relative silence on many issues.
Elaine Loughlin
6/10
When the Green Party was part of the left wave in February, party supporters will have hoped to see governance in bold strokes. With the party being forced to vote against its own policies on animal welfare, delivering an underwhelming Climate Action Bill and being caught in the mother and baby homes controversy, Martin has emerged as their best hope. Praised for her handling of the arts sector and a pilot universal basic income scheme could be a huge game-changer.
Paul Hosford
7/10
Has been impressive in her ability to think outside the box. Universal basic income scheme ticked off a programme for government and Green Party manifesto pledge. Acted quickly and openly in both instances of Fáilte Ireland holiday scandals, however, is not always across the full detail of her briefs.
Often the strongest voice in cabinet about optics of how things appear to the public — e.g. the ministers’ pay rise and banning takeaway pints.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-40090049.html,2020-12-25 11:17:00,Cooking Christmas dinner for the first time? Watch Darina Allen's step-by-step guide to all the trimmings,"What a rollercoaster it’s been for the past few weeks: hopes raised, hopes dashed, then raised again. I eventually decided to carry on regardless, and respond to readers' requests for recipes for the traditional Christmas feast that so many happy memories are made of. This year, of all years, we are nostalgic for the past and crave a comforting family Christmas.
Hopefully, your nearest and dearest will be gathered around you, and our hearts go out to those who have also lost loved ones during this extraordinarily challenging year.
Here are all the favourite Christmas recipes you requested. A fine roast turkey or goose with all the trimmings, lots of gravy, roasties, brussels sprouts and our house recipe for creamed celery. 
That last one sounds so old-fashioned, there’s a ring of the Grand Hotel about it — but it's so good with the roast turkey particularly as it can, of course, be cooked several days ahead. 
Keep it covered in the fridge or pop into the freezer, and just reheat. 
Darina Allen at Ballymaloe
Christmas is definitely a ton of work, particularly for those who don’t normally spend much time in the kitchen.
So let’s make a plan so it’s easier and less stressful. I’m like a broken record about making lists. Lots of them are the way to go: allocate some fun roles to as many family as you can cajole or shame into helping. But steady on —we often overestimate the amount of food we need.
If there are just two or four people, ask yourself if you really need a turkey. How about a beautiful organic chicken or a fat free-range duck? You can use the same stuffing as for the turkey or goose.
If it’s just the two of you, you may want to choose a beautiful organic chicken from Mary Regan in Enniscorthy or maybe try this delicious turkey crown marinated in buttermilk — it’s juicy, tender and delicious. 
Half the crown will be plenty for your Christmas feast and you’ll still have lots to enjoy in your favourite turkey sandwich on Christmas evening. Could be just roasted but marinating in buttermilk is a revelation.
For me, a well-hung pheasant with game chips (homemade potato chips) is another of my favourite feasts. Bread sauce and cranberry sauce are the traditional accompaniments and the buttery herb stuffing is perfect here too.
If like me, brown meat is your favourite, why not roast the turkey thighs? The drumsticks are quite sinewy in a bird that has been allowed to range freely but the flavour will be far superior to an intensively produced bird, reared in confinement. Internal temperature of legs or thighs will be 165°C (breast 105°C) when cooked, and allow to rest 10 – 15 minutes before serving.
But here’s the ‘pièce de résistance’ I promised in last week's column: All-in-One Christmas Dinner on a Dish. 
This recipe dates back to the time when the United Hunt held its annual Hunt Ball in Ballymaloe before Christmas every year. They wanted the ‘whole works’ so my mother-in-law, Myrtle devised this delicious version which we prepared ahead and reheated for the large gathering. 
It became such a favourite that it was requested every year. 
It’s definitely a bit of a mission to make and you’ll need to cook the turkey and ham separately.
Meanwhile, make a creamy mushroom filling with lots of fresh herbs and then a creamy sauce to coat the lot.
The end result is an unctuous 'Turkey and Ham Sandwich' that reheats deliciously in 10-15 minutes on the day.
Whenever you decide to choose, I wish you a happy, joyful and meaningful Christmas and so hope that you will be able to connect with your loved ones over the festive season, either in person or by Zoom. 
Good times will come again… We’ll just keep cooking and carry on! A special thank you to all our readers and happy, happy Christmas.
Traditional Christmas Turkey with Fresh Herb Stuffing, Cranberry Sauce and Bread Sauce
More than ever this year in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, we all long for the comfort of familiar flavours. This is my favourite roast stuffed turkey recipe. 
You may think the stuffing seems dull because it doesn’t include exotic-sounding ingredients like chestnuts and spiced sausage meat, but, in fact, it is moist and full of the flavour from the fresh herbs and the turkey juices. 
Cook a chicken in exactly the same way but use one-quarter of the stuffing quantity given. However, my top tip is to brine the turkey ahead — it greatly enhances the flavour, and reduces the overall cooking time.
For help with the sauces and stuffing that accompany this recipe, check out this specially-recorded video, as Darina takes you through each step from her kitchen in Ballymaloe!
Serves 10-12
Requires 1 x 10-12lb (4.5-5.4kg), free-range and organic, turkey, with neck and giblets
Fresh Herb Stuffing (preparation video above)
175g (6oz/3/4 stick) butter
350g (12oz) chopped onions
400-500g (14-16oz) approx. soft white breadcrumbs (or approximately 1lb 4oz of gluten-free breadcrumbs)
50g (2oz) freshly chopped herbs eg. parsley, thyme, chives, annual marjoram, lemon balm
salt and freshly-ground pepper
Stock – the base for a big jug of gravy
Turkey giblet, neck, gizzard, heart, wishbone and wingtips of turkey
2 sliced carrots
2 sliced onions
1 stick celery
Bouquet garni
3 or 4 peppercorns
For basting the turkey
225g (8oz/2 sticks) butter
large square of muslin (optional)
Darina’s Cranberry Sauce (see recipe below)
Traditional Bread Sauce (see recipe below)
Garnish
Requires large sprigs of fresh parsley or watercress
Remove the wishbone from the neck end of the turkey, for ease of carving later.
Make a turkey stock by covering with cold water the neck, gizzard, heart, wishbone, wingtips, vegetables and bouquet garni. (Keep the liver for smooth turkey liver pate).
Bring to the boil and simmer while the turkey is being prepared and cooked, 3 hours approx.
To make the fresh herb stuffing - see video above for more: 
Sweat the onions gently in the butter until soft, for 10 minutes approx., then stir in the crumbs, herbs and a little salt and pepper to taste. Allow it to get quite cold.
If necessary wash and dry the cavity of the bird, then season and half-fill with cold stuffing. Put the remainder of the stuffing into the crop at the neck end.
Weigh the turkey and calculate the cooking time: Allow 15 minutes approx. per lb and 15 minutes over.
Melt the butter and soak a large piece of good quality muslin in the melted butter; cover the turkey completely with the muslin and roast in a preheated moderate oven, 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4, for 2 3/4-3 1/4 hours depending on the weight and whether the turkey has been brined. Brined turkey cook considerably faster — be careful not to overcook. There is no need to baste it because of the butter-soaked muslin.
The turkey browns beautifully, but if you like it even browner, remove the muslin 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Alternatively, smear the breast, legs and crop well with soft butter, and season with salt and freshly-ground pepper. If the turkey is not covered with butter-soaked muslin then it is a good idea to cover the whole dish with dampened parchment paper. However, your turkey will then be semi-steamed, and not roasted in the traditional sense of the word.
The turkey is cooked when the juices run clear.
To test, prick the thickest part at the base of the thigh and examine the juices: they should be clear. Remove the turkey to a carving dish, keep it warm and allow it to rest while you make the gravy. 
To make the gravy:
Spoon off the surplus fat from the roasting pan.
De-glaze the pan juices with fat-free stock from the giblets and bones. Using a whisk, stir and scrape well to dissolve the caramelised meat juices from the roasting pan.
Boil it up well, season and thicken with a little roux if you like. Taste and correct the seasoning. Serve in a hot gravy boat.
If possible, present the turkey on your largest serving dish, surrounded by crispy roast potatoes, and garnished with large sprigs of parsley or watercress and maybe a sprig of holly. Make sure no one eats the berries.
Serve with Cranberry Sauce and Bread Sauce (see recipes below)
Darina’s Cranberry Sauce - see video above for more
Cranberry Sauce is also delicious served with roast turkey, game and some rough pâtés and terrines. We enjoy this simple Cranberry Sauce best. It will keep in your fridge for several weeks. It is also great with white chocolate mousse or as a filling for a meringue roulade. Add a spoonful of port and quarter teaspoon of finely grated orange zest for a change — but I love the clean taste of the original.
Serves 6 approximately
175g (6oz) fresh or frozen cranberries
4 tablespoons (60ml/scant 2 1/2fl oz) water
75g (3oz) granulated sugar
Put the fresh cranberries in a heavy-based stainless steel or cast-iron saucepan with the water. Don’t add the sugar yet as it tends to toughen the skins. Bring them to the boil, cover and simmer until the cranberries pop and soften, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar until dissolved.
Serve warm or cold.
Note: Fresh cranberries keep for weeks on end but also freeze perfectly.
Note: It should be soft and juicy, add a little warm water if it has accidently overcooked.
Traditional Bread Sauce - see video above for more
I love Bread Sauce but if I hadn't been reared on it I might never have tried it — the recipe sounds so dull! Serve with roast chicken, turkey and guinea fowl.
Serves 6-8
600ml (1 pint) whole milk
75-110g (3 - 4oz) soft white breadcrumbs (see recipe)
2 medium onions, each stuck with 6 cloves
35 - 50g butter
salt and freshly ground pepper 
75-110ml (3-4 fl oz) thick cream
2 good pinches of ground cloves or quatre epices
Preheat the oven to 160°C/325°F/Gas Mark 3.
Bring to the boil in a small, deep saucepan all the ingredients except the cream. Season with salt and freshly-ground pepper. Transfer to the preheated oven and cook for 30 minutes. Remove the onion and add the cream just before serving. Taste, correct the seasoning and add a little more milk if the sauce is too thick. Serve hot.
Bread sauce will keep in the fridge for several days and can be reheated, add a little extra cream or milk if it’s too thick.
Note: The bread sauce will keep in the fridge for several days — the remainder can be reheated gently — you may need to use a little more milk.
Quatre Epices is a French spice product made of equal amounts of ground white pepper, cloves, nutmeg and ginger.
Basic Brine for Turkey, Chicken, Duck or Pork
Brining greatly enhances the flavour of chicken, duck or pork. We brine whole turkeys (48 hours), chickens and ducks (5-6 hours), chicken breast (30-40 minutes depending on size).
Soak the bird or joint in a brine mixture of salt and water. The electrically-charged ions of the salt plump up the muscle fibres, allowing them to absorb water. This changes the structure of the proteins, preventing the water from escaping during cooking. In addition to keeping the meat moist, the salt intensifies flavour.
To make basic brine, mix together 40fl oz (2 pints/5 cups) water and 3 3/4oz (105g/1/4 cup) salt in a suitable size container with a cover (stainless steel, plastic or enamel are ideal). A little sugar may be added to the brine, and even a few spices. Add the bird or joint, cover and chill in a refrigerator or keep in a cool place and brine for chosen time.
Glazed Christmas Ham with Cloves and Pineapple
I know this sounds a bit old hat, but of all of the glazes that I do, this is the one that I keep coming back to. Or you could just use marmalade. 
You’ll know when the ham is cooked when the rind comes off the fat easily. I like to buy my ham with the bone in but order a boned ham if carving becomes a challenge. Don’t forget how delicious a piece of glazed streaky bacon can be and at a fraction of the price.
Glazed loin of bacon

Serves 12-15
1 x 4.5kg (10lb) fresh or lightly smoked ham (ensure it has a nice layer of sweet fat)
30 or more whole cloves, depending on the size of the diamonds
350g (12oz/1 1/2 cups) brown Demerara sugar
a couple of tablespoons of pineapple juice from a small tin of pineapple
If the ham is salty, soak it in cold water overnight and discard the water the next day. Cover the ham with fresh, cold water and bring it slowly to the boil. If the meat is still salty, there will be a white froth on top of the water. In this case, it is preferable to discard this water, cover the ham with fresh cold water again and repeat the process.
Finally, cover the ham with hot water, put the lid on the saucepan and simmer until it is almost cooked.
When the ham is fully cooked the rind will peel off easily and the small bone at the base of the leg will feel loose.
To glaze the ham: preheat the oven to 250ºC/ 500ºF/gas mark 9.
While still warm, peel the rind from the cooked ham, score the fat into a diamond pattern and stud each diamond with a whole clove. Blend the brown sugar to a paste with a little pineapple juice. Be careful not to make it too liquid. Transfer the ham to a roasting tin just large enough to take the joint.
Spread the thick glaze over the entire surface of the ham, but not underneath. Bake it in a very hot oven for 20 minutes or until it has caramelised. While it is glazing, baste the ham regularly with the syrup and juices.
Then toss the pineapple slices in the glaze and arrange on top for extra glam.
Serve hot or cold with Cumberland sauce.
Variation
Glazed Loin or Belly of Bacon
Both of these cuts are delicious glazed as above. The latter is inexpensive yet sweet and succulent. Boiled collar of bacon is also delicious.
Another Glaze for Ham or Bacon
Mix together 225ml (8fl oz/1 cup) of apricot jam, 225g (8oz/1 cup) of sifted golden caster sugar, 3 tablespoons (scant 4 American tablespoons) of whole grain mustard with honey and the juice of 1 orange. Spoon the glaze over the ham and cook as above, basting at regular intervals.
Ginger Glaze for Ham or Bacon
5 tablespoons (6 American tablespoons) brown sugar
1 dessertspoon (2 American teaspoons) mustard powder
1 teaspoon grated ginger
grated zest of half an organic orange
20ml (3/4fl oz/scant 1/8 cup) orange juice
Mix together the brown sugar, mustard powder, grated ginger with the zest and juice of the orange. Spoon the glaze over the ham and cook as above, basting at regular intervals.
Roast Buttermilk Brined Turkey Breast
Inspired by Samin Nosrat
Serves 4-6
1 half turkey crown (breast) about 2 ½ lbs (1.1kg)
500ml (16 fl oz) buttermilk
1 ½ tbsp (33g) salt
24-48 hours before you plan to enjoy the turkey, pour the salted buttermilk into a large heavy resealable plastic bag. Put the turkey breast inside, seal carefully, expelling as much air as possible. Squish the bag a little to make sure the turkey is well covered with the buttermilk. Pop it into the fridge in a gratin dish for 24-36 hours, turning occasionally.
Remove the turkey about 2 hours before cooking, lay on a wire rack over a roasting tray to drain off the excess buttermilk.
Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Lay the rack on a baking sheet, roast until the turkey breast is fully cooked through, 40 minutes approximately for a boneless breast. It will register 150°C on a meat thermometer. Keep an eye and cover with parchment if it is browning too much.
Allow to rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. Serve with your favourite traditional or non-traditional accompaniments.
Roast Potatoes
A big roasting tin of crusty roast potatoes always invokes a positive response. Everyone loves them. They are easy to achieve but I still get asked over and over for the secret of crunchy golden roasties. So here are my top tips:
Roast potatoes
Grow or seek out good-quality dry, floury potatoes such as Golden Wonders or Kerr’s Pinks. New potatoes do not produce good roast potatoes.
For best results, peel the potatoes just before roasting. Resist the temptation to soak them in water, or understandably they will be soggy, due to the water they absorb. This has become common practice when people want to prepare ahead, not just for roasting, but also before boiling.
After peeling, dry the potatoes meticulously with a tea-towel or kitchen paper. Otherwise, even when tossed in fat or oil, they will stick to the roasting tin. Consequently, when you turn them over as you will need to do halfway through the cooking, the crispy bit underneath will stick to the tin.
If you wish to prepare potatoes ahead, there are two options. Peel and dry each potato carefully, toss in extra virgin olive oil or fat of your choice, put into a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Alternatively, put into a plastic bag, twist the end, and refrigerate until needed. They will keep for 5 or 6 hours or overnight without discolouring.
Roast potatoes may be cooked in extra virgin olive oil, top-quality sunflower oil, duck fat, goose fat, pork fat (lard) or beef dripping. Each gives a delicious but different flavour. Depending on the flavour and texture you like, choose from the following cooking methods:
1 Toss the potatoes in the chosen fat and cook.
2 If you prefer a crunchier crust, put the peeled potatoes into a deep saucepan, cover with cold water, bring to the boil, simmer for 2–4 minutes only and drain. Dry each blanched potato and score the surface of each one with a fork. Then toss in the chosen oil or fat, season with salt and cook in a single layer in a heavy roasting pan in a preheated oven at 230ºC/450ºF/gas mark 8.
3 Drain the blanched potatoes, then put the saucepan with the potatoes inside over a medium heat, and shake the pot to dry the potatoes and fluff the blanched surface. Toss in your chosen oil or fat, season with salt and roast as above.
Note: some cooks, to create an even crunchier crust, like to toss the potatoes in a little flour seasoned with salt and freshly ground pepper and maybe a pinch of cayenne pepper or smoked paprika.
Variation
Rustic Roast Potatoes
For a more nutritious rustic roast potato, scrub the potato well, cut the unpeeled potatoes into wedges, toss in olive oil, dripping or duck or goose fat. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cook until soft in the centre and crusty on the outside, about 20–30 minutes.
Pan-Roasted Parsnips
Serves 6-8
4 parsnips
olive oil
salt and freshly-ground pepper
I have a real passion for pan roasted parsnips — we eat them three or four times a week during the parsnip season. Buy them unwashed if possible. Roast Jerusalem artichokes are also super delicious. Scrub, no need to peel, half and cook in the same way. 
Scrub the parsnips, peel and cut them into quarters — the chunks should be quite large. Roast in olive oil in a hot oven 230ºC/450ºF/regulo 8, turning them frequently so that they do not become too crusty. We often roast them in the same pan as Rustic Roast Potatoes, see recipe. Cooked this way they will be crisp outside and soft in the centre.
Best Brussels Sprouts Ever
Not surprisingly many people loathe Brussels sprouts, because so often they are overcooked.
The traditional way to cook sprouts was to cut a cross in the stalk so that they would, hopefully, cook more evenly. Fortunately, I discovered quite by accident when I was in a mad rush one day, that if you cut the sprouts in half lengthways, or better still quarters, they cook much faster and taste infinitely more delicious so with this recipe I've managed to convert many ardent brussels sprout haters!
Top tip: they can be blanched, refreshed and drained and refrigerated the day before.
Serves 4-6
450g (1lb) Brussels sprouts, (cut lengthways top to bottom)
600ml (1 pint) water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
25-50g (1-2oz) butter or extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly-ground pepper
Choose even medium-sized sprouts. Trim the outer leaves if necessary and cut them in half or quarters lengthways – cut into quarters if they are very large.
Salt the water (its really important to add enough salt) and bring to a fast rolling boil.
Toss in the sprouts, cover the saucepan just for a minute until the water returns to the boil, then uncover and continue for 5 or 6 minutes or until the sprouts are cooked through but still have a slight bite. Drain very well.
Melt a little butter or extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan, roll the sprouts gently in the butter, season with lots of freshly ground pepper and salt. Taste and serve immediately in a hot serving dish.
Note:  If the sprouts are not to be served immediately, drain and refresh them under cold water just as soon as they are cooked. 
Just before serving, drop them into boiling salted water for a few seconds to heat through. Drain and toss in the butter, season and serve. 
This way they will taste almost as good as if they were freshly cooked: certainly much more delicious than sprouts kept warm for half an hour in an oven or a hostess trolley.
Brussels Sprouts with Pomegranate Seeds and Walnuts
Try this Christmassy riff on Brussels sprouts — with a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds, and a few crunchy walnuts.
Cook the sprouts in the usual way. Meanwhile melt 25-50g butter in a frying pan, toss in about 25g (1oz) coarsely chopped walnuts. As soon as the sprouts are cooked, drain and toss in the walnut butter. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and a little chopped parsley and serve.
Brussels Sprouts with Toasted Hazelnuts and Crispy Bacon or Chorizo
Add 2-4oz (50-110g) of crispy bacon lardons or chorizo and 50g (2oz) of toasted and chopped hazelnuts to the above recipe and serve immediately.
Retro Celery
How retro does creamed celery sound? But it’s really delicious and a much-loved part of our Christmas dinner. It can also be cooked ahead and reheated. Florence fennel also tastes good cooked this way.
Creamed celery
Serves 4 - 6
1 head of celery
salt and freshly-ground pepper
Roux (see recipe)
4-6fl oz (120-175ml) cream or creamy milk
Garnish
chopped parsley
Pull the stalks off the head of celery. If the outer stalks seems a bit tough, peel the outer strings off with a swivel top peeler or else use these tougher stalks in the stockpot. Cut the stalks into 1 inch (2.5cm) chunks.
Bring 1/4 pint of water to the boil, and season with salt and freshly-ground pepper. Add the chopped celery, cook gently for 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until a knife will go through with ease.
Remove celery to a serving dish with a slotted spoon. Thicken the remaining liquid with the roux, add enough cream to make sufficient sauce to coat the celery. Allow to bubble for a few minutes, pour over celery, sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately or cover and refrigerate when cool and reheat later.
United Hunt Turkey - All-in-One Christmas Dinner
Turkey and all the trimmings
Serves 30 
1 x 12-14 lbs (5.5-6.5kg) free range turkey, preferably a bronze turkey 
1 x 8-10 lbs (3.4-4.5kg) ham or loin of bacon (unsmoked, soaked overnight in cold water if salty) 
chicken or turkey stock 
dry white wine 
2 carrots 
1 large sliced onion 
2 sticks celery bouquet garni 
a few peppercorns 
50g (2oz) chopped parsley 
2 tablespoons other fresh herbs, eg. tarragon, thyme, chives, lemon balm 
3-4 egg yolks 
600ml (1 pint) cream 
85g (3oz) roux Duchesse potato made with 5.5-6.5kg (12-14lb) potato, for piping around the dishes 
Mushroom with fresh herbs and cream 
85-100g (3-4oz) butter 
1.2kg (2½lb) sliced mushrooms 
180 ml (6fl.oz) cream 
4 tablesp. fresh herbs, eg. parsley, thyme, chives 
425g (15oz) onions, finely chopped 
Roux as needed (equal quantities of melted butter and flour cooked together for 2 – 3 mins) 
lemon juice 
salt and freshly ground pepper 
3 – 4 serving platters 
Cover the ham with cold water, bring it slowly to the boil and discard the water, cover again with hot water. Bring to the boil and simmer until the ham is cooked, 2½ hours approx. (calculate 20 minutes to 450g (1lb) as a rough guide). The skin will peel off easily when the ham is cooked.
Meanwhile, season the turkey and put it into a large saucepan with about 12.5-15cm (5-6 inches) of water or chicken stock and white wine. Add 1 large sliced onion, 2 sticks of celery, 2 large carrots cut in chunks, a bouquet garni and a few black peppercorns. Bring to the boil, cover closely and simmer for 2 hours approx. either on top of the stove or in a moderate oven 180°C/350°F/regulo 4.
While the turkey and ham are cooking, prepare the mushrooms. Melt the butter in a wide heavy bottomed saucepan. When it sizzles add the chopped onions, cover and sweat over a low heat until soft but not coloured. Meanwhile in a hot frying pan, fry off the mushrooms a few at the time in a little butter, season with salt and freshly ground pepper, add them to the softened onions. Add more butter if necessary, but never too much, add the freshly chopped herbs, cream and a squeeze of lemon juice. Taste for seasoning. Bring to the boil and thicken with enough roux to thicken lightly. Set the mushroom a la crémè aside until you are ready to assemble the dish.
When the turkey is cooked the legs will feel loose in their sockets, remove it from the casserole and de-grease the cooking liquid. Bring it to the boil and reduce by half. Add 300-450ml (10-15fl.oz) cream, I know that sounds shocking but this recipe makes 30 helpings and you are not going to eat it all yourself! Bring back to the boil and thicken to a light coating consistency with roux. Taste for seasoning.
Skin the turkey, the skin from a poached turkey is soft rather than crisp, so I don’t use it in this dish. Chop up the brown turkey meat from the legs and the white meat from the wings into smallish pieces and mix with the mushroom a la créme. Add 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, 1 dessertspoon thyme, chives and lemon balm if available.
Spread a layer of the creamy sauce on the serving dishes. Carve a nice slice of bacon or ham for each serving and place at regular intervals on top of the sauce. Spoon some of the brown meat and mushroom mixture on top. Carve the turkey breast into thin slices and place 1 slice per serving on top of the mushrooms and ham, making individual complete sandwiches.
Whisk 3-4 egg yolks with 150ml (5fl.oz) cream to make a liaison, blend well and stir this into the remainder of the cream sauce. (It should be a coating consistency.) Coat the pieces of turkey with this sauce. Cool and refrigerate. If serving on the day, pipe a generous border of Duchesse potato all around the edge of the dishes. Cool the dishes quickly, cover and refrigerate or freeze until needed.
Reheat in a moderate oven 180C-190C/350-375F/regulo 4-5, for 30 minutes approx. until it is bubbling and golden on top. If necessary, flash under the grill to brown the edges of the Duchesse potato.
Garnish with generous sprigs of flat leaf fresh parsley and serve.
Top Tip:
If freezing the dishes with a potato border around the edge, freeze first and then cover tightly with strong cling film to prevent the potato from getting squashed.
However, for best results, freeze without the potato, but pipe it on just before reheating.
Roux: 
110g (4oz) butter 
110g (4oz) flour 
Melt the butter and cook the flour in it for 2 minutes on a low heat, stirring occasionally. Use as required. Roux can be stored in a cool place and used as required or it can be made up on the spot if preferred. It will keep at least a fortnight in a refrigerator.
Duchesse Potato: 
Serves 4 900g (2lbs) unpeeled potatoes, preferably Golden Wonders or Kerr's Pinks 
300ml (10fl ozs) creamy milk 
1-2 egg yolks or 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk 
25-50g (1-2oz) butter 
Scrub the potatoes well. Put them into a saucepan of cold water, add a generous pinch of salt, bring to the boil. When the potatoes are about half cooked, 15 minutes approx. for 'old' potatoes, strain off two-thirds of the water, replace the lid on the saucepan, put on to a gentle heat and allow the potatoes to steam until they are cooked. Peel immediately by just pulling off the skins, so you have as little waste as possible, put through a ricer or mouli legume while hot. (If you have a large quantity, put the potatoes into the bowl of a food mixer and beat with the spade).
While the potatoes are being peeled, bring about 300ml (10fl oz//1 1/4 cups) of milk to the boil. Beat the eggs into the hot mashed potatoes, and add enough boiling creamy milk to mix to a soft light consistency suitable for piping, then beat in the butter, the amount depending on how rich you like your potatoes. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Note: If the potatoes are not peeled and mashed while hot and if the boiling milk is not added immediately, the Duchesse potato will be lumpy and gluey. If you only have egg whites they will be fine and will make a deliciously light mashed potato also.

He said the agreement, which was finally reached with the European Union on December 24, was an “unforgiveable act of economic vandalism and gross stupidity”.
SNP leader and Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already accused the Conservatives of having “sold out Scottish fishing all over again” in the Brexit treaty.
But Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, insisted it would deliver for all parts of the UK, as he urged all MPs from north of the border to “give it their wholehearted support”.
Mr Jack made the plea after the SNP Westminster leader said the agreement – which was published in full on December 26 – was a “very bad deal for Scotland”.
It will come into force after the UK’s current transition period, as it exits the EU, comes to an end on December 31.
MPs in the House of Commons will vote on the agreement on Wednesday December 30, with Mr Blackford saying: “Boris Johnson’s extreme Tory Brexit is an unforgivable act of economic vandalism and gross stupidity, which will cause lasting damage to the economy and leave the UK much worse off at the worst possible time – during a pandemic and economic recession.”
The Scottish Government has estimated the Brexit deal that has been agreed could cost Scotland’s economy more than £9 billion (€10bn) by 2030, compared to staying in the EU, with the forecast 6.1% drop in GDP the equivalent to losing the equivalent of £1,600 (€1,780) per person.
Mr Blackford hit out: “Scotland has been completely ignored by Westminster throughout the Brexit process and we are being forced to pay a devastating price.
“It is clear that the only way to protect Scotland’s interests, and regain the full benefits of EU membership, is to become an independent country.

Boris Johnson touts ‘big’ changes as Tory Brexiteers scrutinise EU trade deal
“This is a very bad deal for Scotland, which will terminate our membership of the EU, rip us out of the world’s largest single market and customs union, end our freedom of movement rights, and impose mountains of red tape, added costs and barriers to trade for Scottish businesses.
“The blame lies squarely with the Tory government.”
Mr Blackford continued: “Industries and communities across Scotland will face higher costs and reduced access to EU markets.
“Benefits of EU membership, including our right to live, work and study across Europe will be stripped away. Justice and security cooperation will be diminished. 
""Even the broken promises made to our fishing communities have turned out to be another Tory pack of lies.
“With the Labour Party lining up behind Boris Johnson, it is clear Westminster will impose this hard Tory Brexit regardless of how Scotland votes but it is not being done in our name. It is a disaster for Scotland.”
Scottish Secretary Alister Jack described the Brexit deal agreed by the UK as ‘historic’ (Stefan Rousseau/PA)
But Mr Jack insisted Scots would expect their MPs to “do the right thing” and back the agreement in Wednesday’s Commons vote.
The UK Government minister said: “We have secured a historic Free Trade deal with the EU that delivers for Scotland and the whole of the UK.
“This is a deep and wide-ranging deal, covering trade, security, travel, transport, energy, health and social security.
“As Parliament prepares to vote on the deal this week, I urge all Scottish MPs to give it their wholehearted support.”
Mr Jack continued: “Outside the EU, the UK can sign our own trade deals around the world, bringing new opportunities for exporters and some of Scotland’ most iconic products.
“For our farmers, the deal avoids tariffs on their world-beating Scotch lamb and beef.
“For our fishermen and coastal communities, the deal delivers what we promised. We are regaining control of our waters, we are restoring our status as an independent coastal state and, even during the five-year adjustment period, there will be a big overall increase in our share of the catch in our waters.
“As we leave the Common Fisheries Policy, our fishermen will also enjoy near-exclusive access to inshore waters up to the historic 12-mile limit.”
The Scottish Secretary insisted: “The deal is good news for Scotland and I believe it is now time to move on from the Brexit debate and join forces in embracing our exciting future.
“Whether Leaver or Remainer in 2016 we need to come to together to make the most of our new opportunities. The people of Scotland will expect their MPs to do the right thing on Wednesday and vote for the deal.
“They will not easily forgive those who reject this Free Trade Agreement or throw their weight behind a no-deal Brexit.”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40198116.html,2020-12-29 11:18:00,Price change of the 'full Irish' shows resilience of agri-food sector,"New data on the cost of a home-cooked full Irish breakfast, compiled by Ulster Bank using the CSO Consumer Price Index (CPI), reveals little movement in food prices.
The new Ulster Bank Full Irish Index shows consistency for consumers in retail pricing and no major increase or decrease in the cost of a home-cooked breakfast in the year to October.
It now costs €3.45 per plate for a cooked full Irish breakfast - just 0.6% less than it did in October 2019 when it cost €3.47 - and this minor decrease in the cost of a full cooked Irish breakfast was more modest than the reduction in overall consumer prices, with the headline consumer price index down 1.5% year on year in October.
Meanwhile, the agri-food sector has shown resilience over the past year, despite the many challenges faced by the wider economy.
Farmers have managed volatility in farm gate prices and weather, while also adapting and growing their businesses.
According to the latest data, the cost of a cup of tea saw the biggest decrease, dropping by 6.8% per box of 80 teabags.
The price of mushrooms and tomatoes also decreased, with the cost of mushrooms down 1.4% and tomatoes down 1.7%.
Rashers also dropped in price (down 1.8%), while pork sausages increased in price (up 1.4%). Potatoes are down 0.3%.
“2020 has been a challenging year for the economy and the country, but agri-food businesses have shown real resilience,” said Ailish Byrne, head of agriculture with Ulster Bank.
“Working with farm businesses across the country we’ve seen them managing well with the volatility in farm gate prices which was experienced when we went into the first lockdown in March and the adverse weather, such as the extremely dry spring, that followed.
“They have equally proved very adept in making changes to their business operations to innovate and grow, as well as to optimise the returns they receive from farm support payments and diversification.” 
With regard to the dairy sector, Ms Byrne says it has been a “key driver” of customer activity in 2020 and this trend is expected to continue throughout 2021.
“We are working on a number of applications for farmers looking to convert to dairy farming or expand their dairy farm operations,” she added.
“We continue to provide stocking finance to the beef sector, as well supporting the poultry and pig sectors.
“The tillage and horticulture sectors continue to require seasonal loan facilities.
“There has been a resurgence in farm building activity and the purchase of specialist equipment, primarily with the support of TAMS, while land purchase activity has remained strong during Covid-19, driven nearly exclusively by the dairy sector.
“The agri-food sector is a key part of the Irish economy and understanding how the price of food items is changing, particularly in these challenging times, gives us some extra insight into the sector.”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/property/residential/arid-40197042.html,2020-12-30 13:00:00,Thinking big: Bumper New Year in Country Homes sales may be  on cards given deals already  in train,"2020 was a year like no other. The global pandemic brought a level of disruption not witnessed since the last World War with lock-downs and travel restrictions of some sort in force for most of the year.
With the human cost along with the massive damage to employment and the economy, it is hugely surprising that all sectors of the property market have proved so resilient with the country market finishing the year on a high.
Large properties with their own grounds and plenty of accommodation were in demand as both Irish and foreign buyers sought to find a place in the country. Irish nationals abroad living in cities felt the pull of home and open green spaces. A combination of wary vendors helping to produce few new entrants to the market coupled with the novel concept of negative-interest on large cash deposits, produced a spike in activity over the summer with the end of the first lock-down. Many properties found more than one bidder with competition ensuing. Brexit burnout was evident; that unpleasantness could wait for another day.
An Culu near Templenoe in Kerry finally sold, after over a decade on and off the market, for €4.5 million.
Although the year will show fewer sale completions there are indications, with many properties currently under offer, that 2021 could produce a bumper year. There are a good half-dozen €2 million plus sales in the pipeline in Munster alone. Agents are agreed that this one of their busiest years since the bust of 2006 with most reporting a shortage of instructions as the year closes.
The year produced no outstanding highlight on a par with last year's sales of Luggala and Castletown at €20 million plus. Corbalton Hall in Co. Meath with 360 acres sold, appearing on the price register at €4.45 million. Owned by Pat McDonagh of Riverdeep, it had been withdrawn from auction in 2019 at €9.5 million but with the land not included in the register, it is believed to have fetched not far from this figure. 
Castletown Demesne finally entered the Price Register at €12.5m; although with its 500 acres added, the total sale price was believed to be in excess of €20 million.
Perhaps the lock-down sale by WhatsApp of Horse Island in Roaringwater Bay for €5.5 million to a foreign buyer ‘sight unseen’ best sums up this remarkable year. It is believed that two or more parties chased the property with the same scenario occurring with An Culu in Kenmare sold at reportedly close to €4.5 million; the property had been on the market for some 13 years.
‘Beef baron’ Larry Goodman’s Braganstown Estate in Co Louth with 850 acres caused interest when it appeared on the price register in March with speculation that the entire property might be worth in excess of €10 million. It is believed to have sold to a family member. Likewise, the auction of some of the effects and contents of Castlehyde, Fermoy generated rumours of a sale in autumn. Whether owner Michael Flatley is moving on or simply clearing out remains to be seen; it was reported that the dancer had turned down a bid of €20 million for the property during the year from an hotel operator.
The year saw records set with savings soaring during the pandemic and Central Bank figures showing a record €123 billion on deposit in October. Coupled to record low interest returns and a drift into negative interest rates there was now a powerful incentive for those holding large sums in cash to invest in property. It is probable that we are entering into a low interest climate that will endure for some time with significant capital sums held in the bank eroding at almost 1% interest per annum.
Central Bank figures showed  a record €123 billion on deposit in October. Coupled to record low interest returns and a drift into negative interest rates there was now a powerful incentive for those holding large sums in cash to invest in property.
Obvious alternatives are property or the stock market with the property market seen as the less risky. A return to positive interest may be a long time coming where the massive quantitative easing program of the last decade has failed to generate inflation. The Japanese experience may be relevant with a 20 year history of zero interest and where it took many years to sink in that low interest were here to stay.
In Cork, west Cork again proved its appeal with the sale of Horse Island at a reported €5.5 million and Glengariff Castle at €2.75 million. The Old Grainstore, Baltimore fetched around €1.4 million and Rockfort House, Innishannon around the €1m mark. Actor Saoirse Ronan was reported as purchasing a coastal property at Ballydehob at around €800,000.
Ballea Castle Carrigaline sold for €800,000, with its land adding further to the total sale price
 Elsewhere in the county sales recorded included Glebe House, Shanagarry at €840,000 and Ballea Castle at €800,000. New to the market were Oakgrove, Carrigadrohid €2.35 million and Stone Hall, Glandore at €3.80 million.
Around Munster, in Kerry the sale of An Culu was reported closed at €4.5m with Callinfercy Stud Miltown recorded at €900,000 and Bun Na Speir at Caragh Lake making €715,000. In Waterford, Whitechurch House, Cappoquin made in excess of € 1.50 million while Ballyrafter House in Lismore entered the market at €1.15 million. In Tipperary Sopwell Hall, Ballingarry arrived on the market at €8.5 million with 300 acres. Right on the border with Kilkenny,
Castletown Demesne finally entered the register at €12.5m; although with its 500 acres added, the total sale price was believed to be in excess of €20 million.
Looking ahead to 2021, the shape and rate of Covid spread will determine much. If the roll-out of vaccines can arrest its spread and bring hope that the tide is turning there will a huge human and economic boost that the pandemic can be managed and controlled. Emergency State spending will reduce and an apparent wall of savings, larger than the old SSIA scheme, may begin to release into the economy.
There is, on the face of it, good news with a Biden White House on the horizon, with Ireland’s profile sure to benefit. However, although the US approach to trade is not expected to change (excepting fewer toxic Trumpian trade spats), it would be no surprise if Biden were to introduce tax breaks to encourage US companies to bring home jobs from abroad. We are particularly vulnerable here.
Glengarriff Castle sold swiftly in 2020 for its AMV of €2.75 million and will need as much again spent to complete its partial restoration.
Brexit, like a stone in the shoe or an inexplicably long hangover, loomed large,  with the very worst outcome, a no-deal crash out just  avoided as 2020 ended, and as negotiations came out of the ‘tunnel’. Avoiding this scenario was vital,  as a no-deal would have knocked  three percentage points off economic growth next year according to the Department of Finance and twice that in the longer term, according to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.
On a positive note however, according to Ibec our 'resilient' economy will be among the best- performing in the western world this year with GDP growth of 0.8 per cent, before accelerating to an export-driven growth of 5.3 per cent in 2021.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40202315.html,2021-01-05 09:47:00,10 mart highlights and low points in 2020,"it was an extraordinary, and revolutionary year for cattle marts.
Here’s just ten highlights and low points.
1 Bidding fingers no longer required.
I’m not sure what legendary cattle auctioneers like Jack McGraw or legendary cattlemen like Jack Desmond would make of the new 2020 world of cattle trading.
If they came back to witness empty sales rings and cattle auctioneers seemingly talking to themselves, would they say we have gone completely bananas?
And would they be right?
In 2020, you could leave your bidding finger at home.
And far better if you stayed at home yourself too.
With Covid-19, you were as welcome in the mart as a fart in a space suit.
Marts in 2020 were all about online buying and selling.
2 A good phone
Never has it been more important to have a good phone on your person, and a good broadband connection.
For years we have been promised broadband, in 2020 it was out to the test.
In Aghabullogue, my brother informed me that it was hit and miss.
A man in Drinagh told me that he could only get coverage when not in Drinagh.
As for Kenmare, their mart manager Dan McCarthy said it all in October, remarking that online connectivity is “a total fiasco, a total disaster.”
3 stable prices
In spite of a sinking feeling whenever Wuhan or bats were mentioned, price trends were the calmest in years.
From the calf to the finished animal, from January to December, online or offline, the mart trade was steady.
Mind you, I’m not sure if we are becalmed at the bottom or top of a price curve.
4 Year of four ministers
Their arrival and departure so quickly in 2020 took our minds off trying to buy cattle on screens about the size of a matchbox.
First, Minster Creed bowed out.
I thought he would remain minister for the rest of his life.
Next came two more Ministers for Agriculture.
Their names escape me now, they didn’t hang around long enough for me to remember.
Now we have Charlie McConalogue, who seems to be doing a good job, at least he is still there.
5 No Gigginstown bull sale
Covid hit home for me when I heard the annual Gigginstown Easter Bull Sale would not take place.
I enjoyed driving the million or so miles from my ramshackle ranch in Kilmichael to the glorious plains of Westmeath, and the bull sale held on the Michael O’Leary-owned estate.
It was my annual opportunity to see how the other half lives, and it only cost the price of a tank of diesel, to view pedigree stock and nod my head in approval when a good bull saunterered into the ring.
6 Cruelest blow of all
Always happiest when seated at a dining table, it was a very sad day for me when marts closed their restaurant doors.
Having sampled beef and turkey sandwiches, tea, coffee, buns, cake and jelly in Bandon, Skibbereen, Kanturk, Kilmallock, Dungarvan, Gortatlea, Corrin, Castleisland and Kilkenny, I found the mart restaurant closure almost harder than the mart closure.
7 Connecting with family
Love them or hate them, we cannot ignore them, at least not in 2020.
The family.
Many of us discovered new and interesting things about our nearest and dearest.
For me it was that my youngest, Emma (aged 10) loves to farm.
She’s the first on with the wellingtons, and last to complain where farming is involved.
I may have a future cattle dealer on my hands.
8 Return of the cattle dealer
Cometh the hour, cometh the cattle dealer.
For years, the dealer may have been dealt a poor hand with regards to respect within our industry, but in 2020 he or she held all the aces.
With cattle marts closed one minute, open the next, and then neither open nor closed, it was down to the cattle dealer to help us out of the muddle.
And they did, by supplying cattle to fellows who were too fearful of using a phone to purchase.
And for farmers wanting to sell, they were equally as helpful.
And with the ability to tell the weight of an animal by eye alone and with the ability to pay for cattle with cash alone, they became as popular as Dr Tony was in the early days.
We now finally see the important role that they can play in keeping the gears of our business in motion. The dealer is back.
9 Year for good eyesight
I will be the first to confess that my vision isn’t what it used to be.
I can still spot a farm inspector before he enters the yard, but beyond that it can have me at a loss.
So the likes of me had no business trying to purchase cattle on a mobile phone, where even the sharpest eyes, I’m sure, were caught out by bullocks with one testicle that looked like they had none.
There is nothing like inspecting an animal in the flesh.
10 Shippers keep on shipping, farmers farming
Exporters did their best in a tough year sending calves to sunny Spain and weanlings to Turkey.
But we must never forget the farmer, who keeps the show going in every direction, as a seller and a buyer.
The farmer’s hand I used to see in marts before Covid, bidding for cattle large and small is still there, only now behind a phone screen.
And so as we brace ourselves for 2021, give yourself a pat on the back, not only do you deserve it, but it’s long overdue."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40201688.html,2021-01-05 17:13:00,October figures reveal continuing fluctuation in beef exports to UK,"A recovery in Irish beef exports to the UK in September was short-lived, with the latest trade statistics showing 1,400 tonnes less was exported in October, compared to the previous year.
According to the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), the year to October total beef trade from Ireland to the UK was 178,481 tonnes, down 3% year-on-year.
However, market watchers won’t be surprised if the figure seesaws again for November and December, after speculation in the industry that more beef was imported from Ireland in the run-up to the Brexit deadline of December 31, in order to avoid the feared tariffs and delays.
That will not be confirmed until trade data for November and December becomes available.
Total 2020 UK beef imports including October (256,436t) were down 6% by tonnage and 3% by value, to £958 million.
Ireland dominates the imports, with a nearly 70% share.
The UK takes about 50% of Ireland’s beef production. Although the only major exporting country to buck the downward trend in UK beef imports was Brazil, their 12% increased export volume to the UK took them only to 21,089t, compared to Ireland’s 178,481t.
The AHDB says UK lamb imports increased in October, but not from Ireland.
Instead, a 9% year-on-year jump in UK imports of sheep meat was filled mostly by shipments from New Zealand, increasing by a notable 42%, most likely due to competitive pricing.
Meanwhile, volume from Ireland fell 23%, compared to October, 2019.
Total UK sheepmeat imports for 2020 including October were down 6%, and the AHDB said most of this decline can be attributed to falling imports from Ireland.
Ironically, it has been a bumper year for Irish sheepmeat exports, up 7%.
Other EU states accounted for most of this increase, with France taking 8% extra and Sweden 20% extra.
Despite exports to the UK falling 6%, the UK is still the second largest export market for Ireland, after France."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40201682.html,2021-01-05 17:13:00,Beef cattle prices unchanged from last year as Brexit situation beds in,"The beef trade has opened for the New Year with prices little changed ing from the closing days of the old year.
Beef finishers are mostly satisfied to see the back of 2020, not a good year for them.
The early days of 2021 look better than many had feared in the l ater months leading up to the UK’s exit from the EU, after almost five decades.
The agreement reached between the EU and UK on trading has removed the threat of tariffs, which would have been penal for Irish beef exports to Britain, but there is no denying the trading situation is nevertheless changed.
The consumer is king, in Britain the same as everywhere else, and the opportunity for the import of cheaper beef from non-EU sources will be attractive to British consumers on price grounds, and therefore to the British government.
Cheaper non-EU beef on the supermarket shelves of Great Britain could be very challenging for Irish processors to compete against under the new post-Brexit environment in Great Britain.
It is going to take some time for the post-Brexit situation to bed in, which helps to explain why prices on offer at the Irish factories for the opening days of 2021 are largely unchanged from the pre-Christmas trade.
Steers are being quoted for this week on a base of 370c/kg, which is what is generally being paid.
Some deals for large supplies are being negotiated on a base of up to 375c/kg, and the price appears to be a little better, the further north you go for a processor this week.
The heifer trade is following a similar pattern in general, with some widening of the margin over steers prices on offer for this week.
The premium over the steer price is ranging from 5c to 10c/kg, with base prices varying from 375c/kg to 380c/kg.
Reports from around the country indicate that most of the heifers are being traded on a base of 380c/kg, with a few lots making up to 385c/kg, which is the cut off price for dealing with the factories this week.
On the positive side, all processors appear to be very anxious to get beef cattle supplies this week, which means that they have firm orders for replenishing shop shelves after the Christmas demand.
The trade for young bulls appears to be a shade sharper, with R-grade making up to 370c/kg, which has narrowed the price premium for steer beef over young bull beef.
The cow trade is very positive.
Up to 330c/kg is being achieved for better quality R-grade cows. They generally trade at 320c-325c, with Os making up to 310c, and reports of some P-grade cows closing in on 300c/kg, while most lots of P grade are on 280c-290c."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40205852.html,2021-01-12 14:44:00,Unusually busy January beef trade with processors under pressure to secure intakes,"Prices at beef factories this week allowed just a glimmer of optimism for finishers, but “every little helps”.
Getting better beef prices is not easy, but pressure on processors to get enough cattle is forcing them to ease their pricing policy a little.
Processors are working harder to meet the stronger demand for beef for home cooking during the Covid-19 lockdown, at home and on the export markets.
January 2021 is proving to be very different from the usual very quiet month for beef sales.
Beef cattle are moving out of yards at a steady pace, with the balance between supply and demand edging more in favour of finishers, with pressure on processors to secure sufficient intake.
The base price for steers is generally on 370 cents/kg this week. Finishers engaging in harder selling and with larger numbers on offer are securing a base of up to 375 cents/kg.
It is difficult to squeeze more than that out of processors.
In a similar pattern, heifer prices are slightly stronger, trading on a general base of 380 cents/kg and up to 385 cents/kg, with some deals at 390 cents/kg reported for larger numbers.
The word from around the country is that factory agents are under instructions not to leave stock behind them, if it is possible to strike a deal without easing the rein on prices too much.
Prices for young bulls are tracking 5-10 cents/kg behind steer prices, with a general going rate in the 370-375 cents/kg range for R_grade this week. The throughput of young bulls continues well back from previous years.
Demand for cows continues strong, reflected in the increased prices being offered.
The better R-grade cows are comfortably making up to 330 cents/kg and there are some reports of above that being achieved for larger lots.
The going rate for O-grade cows this week is around 315 cents/kg, and 300 cents/kg or slightly higher is achievable for the better P-grade cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40206599.html,2021-01-13 17:09:00,Food and drink exports were resilient in pandemic year of 2020,"Bord Bia has welcomed food and drink exports for 2020 valued at €13bn, falling by only €0.2bn from 2019, despite a year of unprecedented challenge and the largest disruption to normal market operation, globally, since the end of World War II.
Increases were recorded in the value of Irish dairy, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, along with very significant increases in the value of exports to Africa and the Middle East, as new markets come to the fore.
Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue said: “Ireland’s food and drink producers faced many challenges on the domestic and international front last year.
“Despite this, they found a new level of resilience that saw them hold global exports at €13bn. The marginal dip of 2% is in stark contrast to the towering pandemic challenges they faced, including the closure of foodservice, increases in shipping costs, and dramatic consumer behaviour changes as people migrated to working from home.
“I pay particular tribute to our farmers, as well as our food and drink producers, for their heroic efforts in supporting a balanced economy, despite dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic”.
Bord Bia Chief Executive Tara McCarthy, said: “Behind the remarkable export performance of our food and drink sector in 2020 are seismic challenges at a strategic, category and channel level.”
Exports of food and drink from Ireland have increased consistently, by 16% in value since 2016, and by 67% since 2010.
Dairy continued its growth in 2020, with a 3% uplift in value of exports, to €5.2bn, a record level, exceeding €5bn for a second year.
The second largest category in Irish food and drink exports, the meat and livestock sector, also delivered a resilient performance in 2020, with a 2% increase in total value to €3.4bn.
A challenging year for beef exports was offset by strong growth in the value of pigmeat and sheep exports.
And it was a pleasant surprise for farmers to learn that their favoured live export trade increased in value by 10% in 2020, to be worth €221m — despite a decline in the number of animals exported, by 30,000.
However, it was mostly a decline in the proportion of calves, the lowest value element in the live export mix. Exports of more valuable store, weanling and finished cattle increased strongly during 2020, primarily due to an increase in trade with Northern Ireland.
The drystock farming sector also reaped the benefit of sheepmeat export values increasing 12%, to €356m in 2020. Tighter supplies of sheepmeat globally and an improvement in demand in key EU markets drove this increase.
Primary pigmeat exports were worth €586m in 2020, a 14% increase on 2019, on the back of a 3% increase in the volume of exports. 
Alcohol exports overall were down 19% in 2020 to €1.3bn.
Last year saw a decline in the value of primary Irish seafood exports of 10%, to €443m, due to the disruption of exports in the shellfish category normally destined for the foodservice channel, locked down for much of 2020.
Horticulture and cereals exports increased by 8% to €221m in 2020, with the UK being the core market.
The primary constituents of this export mix are mushrooms, primary cereals and amenity horticulture. The value of mushroom exports rose by 14% to €115m.
Prepared consumer foods exports in 2020 were worth €2.5bn, representing a 4% reduction year-on-year, due to disruption brought on by the pandemic.
The largest part of this category, and the source of the largest decline, is value-added meats supplied almost entirely to the foodservice channel. These exports were worth €648m in 2020, a 14% decline on 2019.
Poultry exports declined by 2% in value in 2020, to €152m, but volume increased by 4%.
Outlook for 2021
According to Bord Bia, the global supply and demand dynamic for Irish food and drink products remains positive in 2021. “The likely end of the pandemic will enable a return to growth. Dairy demand growth will continue to outpace supply. The global meat supply balance will continue to favour producers, particularly in Asia”.
The food board said consumers and customers increasingly expect credentials around sustainability and welfare, that Ireland is well placed to supply, and to differentiate from competitor exporting nations.
But trade disruption and increased barriers to trade could stymie potential growth. “The future trading relationship with the UK is uncertain. This is further complicated by the extent to which the UK acts as a bridge for logistics to the EU-27. “Disruption in this area is likely to be a temporary phenomenon however, not lasting beyond quarter one of 2021.”
Bord Bia Chief Executive Tara McCarthy, said, “As we start 2021, exporters are reporting solid order volumes, which is a direct result of the strength of trading relationships nurtured over many years.
“That said, the extra costs and complexities of trade with our largest destination market, as new customs procedures interrupt the smooth flow of produce, will cause significant challenges and should not be underestimated.
“With a return to global economic growth forecast for 2021, we anticipate continued strong global demand for Irish dairy.
“We expect the global meat supply balance to favour producers, particularly in Asia, which has been at the centre of much Irish export growth.
“All around the world, consumers and customers are increasingly demanding credentials around sustainability that Ireland is well placed to meet.”
Bord Bia expects the UK will remain the largest single destination for Irish food and drink exports in 2021 and beyond.
The food board said exporters are wise to invest resources in diversification beyond this one market, but its geographical proximity, shared language, and shared cultural understanding, in combination with the UK’s need to import food, and the UK consumer’s appreciation of the sustainability credentials of Irish food and drink, ensure that the UK will remain a key strategic partner for Irish food and drink exports.
However, the Trade and Co-operation Agreement between the EU and UK will reduce Irish and other European fishing vessels’ access to UK waters.
Over a five year period to June, 2026, the quota available in those waters will reduce 25%.
This will likely have notable effects for the Irish fleet on pelagic and prawn catches, a significant proportion of which are currently taken from UK waters, according to Bord Bia. 
The food board said ratification in its current form of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement would be difficult, leading to significant increases in the flow of beef from South America to the EU.
On climate change challenges for the Irish food and drink sector, Bord Bia warned the price and availability of input commodities will become more disrupted, and there will be increasing consumer expectation of certified processes to minimise greenhouse gas emissions."

They also won two of the three main awards for agriculture-related projects.
The Senior Individual and overall winner, Greg Tarr from Bandon Grammar School, built computer software for a more efficient and cost-effective way to detect fake videos, using artificial intelligence (teacher, Mrs Carena McCarthy).
The other two top award winners from Co Cork both came from students at Colaiste Treasa, Kanturk, Co Cork.
Jack Quirke was the overall individual runner-up award with his project investigating possible vegetable oil soil toxicity, using nematodes as environmental bioindicators (teacher Ms Joanne Corkery).
Isobel and Ava Hynes won the overall group runner-up award with their project to investigate elements informing young people’s attitudes towards Covid-19 (teacher Ms Joanne Corkery).
The overall best group award winner was one of the many agriculture-related projects in the exhibition.
Abby Mullins, Chloe Murphy and Megan Carroll from Moate Community School in Co Westmeath looked at developing a wool blanket which allows the timely and thorough removal of oil slicks following oil spills (teacher Ms Mairead Cusack).
From the Beara Community School in West Cork, Cathal O’Sullivan won the ABP Farm Safety category award.
Cathal’s teacher is Mr Dara Crowley.
In his project, Cathal designed a device that alerts users when they are too close to spinning machine parts, to help prevent them from accidentally coming into contact.
Annie Graham, Livestock Strategy Manager, ABP, said: “His innovative project embodies the spirit of this award, finding new solutions to make our farms safer”.
The award recognises projects that improve farm safety and educate young people about farm dangers, and is sponsored by the ABP Food Group for the seventh year.
ABP Food Group hosted a virtual stand at the exhibition, offering information on the Certified Irish Angus Schools Competition, an annual competition sponsored by ABP which provides students with hands-on farm-to-fork insight into modern beef production, which complements agricultural science course work.
Cian Walsh, a transition year student at St. Brogan’s College, Kilbrogan, Bandon, Co Cork, won the Teagasc award at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.
Cian’s project looked at the social, economic and environmental benefits and drawbacks of growing hemp.
Cian’s teacher is Ms Laura O’Regan.
Cian explained: “100% of the hemp crop can be processed into many different eco-friendly products, some examples include hempcrete, hemp insulation, and hemp bioplastic”.
Cian surveyed farmers to determine current knowledge of hemp, and found that there was a great interest in the crop, but that only 36% of those surveyed would consider growing it.
He hosted a hemp information meeting on Zoom with the farmers surveyed, which included a presentation on hemp research in Ireland by Teagasc’s Energy & Rural Development Specialist Barry Caslin.
“At the end of the conference, I re-surveyed the farmers, and found a significant increase in interest in growing the crop [from 36% to 64%] if there were hemp processing facilities near their home farm,” said Cian.
The Teagasc special award is presented to the project that best demonstrates a thorough understanding of the science of agricultural or food production, or use of science to improve technologies available for agricultural or food production.
The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine award went to Elizabeth Bourke from St Mary’s College in Arklow for her “Nutrient recycling efficiency using bio-based organic fertilisers” project (teacher Ms Joanne English).
Elizabeth measured spring wheat crop yield and soil health benefits for chemical fertiliser and four types of bio-based fertiliser (lime-treated dairy sludge, cattle slurry, lime-treated pig slurry solids, and poultry manure. She found the best yields came from lime-treated pig slurry.
There were awards for many other agriculture-related projects in the exhibition.
The Environmental Protection Agency award went to Orlaith Ni Ghallchobhair, St Kevin’s Community College, Wicklow, for her project investigating if nettles can be the sustainable fast fashion solution.
The Eli Lilly award went to Aengus Price, Kinsale Community School, Co Cork, for his project investigating if casein-based plastics are a viable, sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to oil-based plastics.
There was a category group win for Áine Maxwell, Joyce Conway, and Laura Conlon of Moate Community School, Co Westmeath, for their milk spoilage prevention project.
A survey of plants with medicinal properties in local bogs was a category group winner for Orla Lyons, Lanesboro Community College, Co Longford.
There was a category runner-up award for Joseph Moran, Kildare Town Community School, investigating ash dieback and its impact on Irish biodiversity.
For Lauren Finan, Shana Brady, and Aine Broderick of Moate Community School, Co Westmeath, there was a category runner-up award for their investigation of the impact of diet on the prevalence of laminitis among Connemara ponies.
Epigenetics to help crops deal with climate change was the project that won a category runner-up award for Luke Fox-Whelan of Templeogue College, Dublin.
Do horses respond to human emotion? was the question posed by Aoife Giles, Megan Hegarty, and Tori Gallagher of Loreto Community School, Donegal, to win a category third place award.
For Fergal Keane, Ciarán Bonfil, and Fionn Doherty of St Joseph’s Community College, Kilkee, Co Clare, eco-friendly bale netting was their category runner-up project.
Decomposing rushes, the answer to heating homes? was the category third-placed project investigated by Jim Culhane and Paula-Eve Culhane of Tarbert Comprehensive School in Co Kerry.
Among the Highly Commended projects was “Vertical farming, the future of healthy schools”, investigated by Ali O’Donoghue and Eilís Mullane, St Brigid’s Secondary School, Killarney, Co Kerry.
There was a similar topic for Niamh McManus and Jess Joy of Loreto Secondary School, Balbriggan, Co Dublin, highly commended for investigating if vertical farming could be a more efficient method than conventional arable farming in Ireland.
“The future is bright: turning organic waste into biofuel” was the Highly Commended project of Annie Duffy, Leah Hallissy, and Ava Hallissy of Moate Community School, Co Westmeath.
Claire Finnegan and Louise Crinion, St. Joseph’s Secondary School, Navan, Co Meath, compared barley and wheat straw to see which is best for bedding calves, and were highly commended; as was Sarah Humphreys, Colaiste Treasa, Kanturk, Co Cork, who investigated the ability of different pasture swards to sequester carbon.
Why can some people consume goat’s milk but not cow’s milk? was the highly commended project of Zara Griffin, St Andrew’s College, Dublin."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40210370.html,2021-01-19 15:05:00,Prices inch upwards as processors  compete to buy beef cattle,"A gradual upward trend in beef prices at factories continued this week, as processors responded to demand pressure.
For beef cattle finishers in the early weeks of a new year, it is a long time since they encountered the level of new year 2021 demand now apparent at the factories.
Processors are competing with each other to get cattle this week. As a result, prices on offer hardened a shade further, despite the best price-holding efforts of factory bosses.
Brexit and Covid-19 were two big worries for finishers, but at the current stage of the pandemic, there seems to be increased consumer demand for beef, and Brexit has not had much effect yet.
It all goes to show how unpredictable market forecasting can be in the beef trade.
The intake of cattle at factories slipped back last week to 31,990 head, more than 2,500 less than the same 2020 week.
The steer kill at 11,171 head was the same as 2020, while heifers were back 500 head, at 10,445 head.
The 3,587 young bulls compared to 5,399 for the corresponding 2020 week.
For most of the beef cattle supply this week, the price has moved upwards by 5c/kg. The general base quote for steers is 375c/kg, with up to 380c being paid, and a lot of price negotiation between finishers and factory agents before the livestock move.
Heifer prices are on a base of 385c/kg being paid for a good percentage of the intake this week, with some reports of up to 390c/kg being achieved, although that is not the general run of the trade, nor very readily available.
Processors are very active on the ground sourcing supplies, more evident over the past week at mart sales, as competition between factory agents for heavier cattle boosted prices.
For mid-January 2020, the base price for steers was running at 355c/kg, with some 360c achieved by sellers driving a hard bargain.
In the heifer trade, there is a similar year-on-year price improvement, of 20c-25c/kg, typically adding €80-€100 per head for finishers.
The trade for young bulls has also moved up a notch, with R-grade prices running at 370c-375c/kg this week.
Contrary to what could have been expected, with the foodservice sector so quiet, the demand for cows for the manufacturing beef trade remains very strong.
Better quality R-grade cows are making up to 345cc/kg this week, with O-grade in a 320-325c/kg range."

It should be a hit with all the family and is very quick to prepare. According to legend, a cook named Joe at Floyd Angell’s café in Sioux City, Iowa, added tomato sauce to his ‘loose meat’ sandwiches and the ‘sloppy Joe’ sandwich was born. The rest, as they say, is history!
Serves 4–6 
Preparation time: 20 minutes 
Cooking time: 30 minutes 
Freezer friendly 
Ingredients
1 tbsp rapeseed oil 
50g (2oz) raw chorizo, diced 
350g (12oz) lean minced beef 
1 small onion, finely chopped 
1 green pepper, diced 
1 fresh small green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped (optional) 
140g (4¾oz) tomato purée 
3 tbsp dark brown muscovado sugar 
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar 
1 tbsp honey 
2 tsp Dijon mustard 
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce 
1 × 400g (14oz) tin of kidney beans in chilli sauce

1 Little Gem lettuce, shredded 
100g (4oz) Cheddar cheese, grated 
handful of mixed hot chillies in brine or sliced jalapeño chillies, drained (optional) 
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
Method
Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook until it just starts to release its oil, then add the minced beef. Stir-fry until the meat starts to brown, breaking up any lumps with a wooden spoon. Add the onion, green pepper and chilli (if using) and continue to cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the vegetables are beginning to soften.
Add the tomato purée, sugar, vinegar, honey, mustard and Worcestershire sauce and stir until well combined, then stir in the beans. Season to taste, then bring to a simmer and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is nice and thick.
Toast the burger buns under the grill. Arrange the lettuce on the bottom of each bun, then spoon over the sloppy Joe beef mixture. Scatter the grated cheddar on top with the hot chillies (if using), then sandwich together with the tops of the buns.

With Covid 19 rampaging like an old runaway goat and terrible icy conditions underfoot, I felt my position under the duvet offered me the greatest sanctuary possible in avoiding all danger.
And only when I had sensed the delicious aroma of sizzling sausages wafting in from the kitchen did I finally raise my head and brace myself for the day ahead.
While it hasn't been discovered yet that the humble sausage is a key player in striking out Covid 19, I feel it's only a matter of time before scientists in Oxford University discover the power within the sausage.
After my breakfast on Saturday, not only was I energised enough to face Covid, but ready to take on the world.
As we battle through another lockdown it's important that we look after ourselves.
We have so many rules and regulations to comply with these days that it can be easy to forget about oneself. Behind every mask is a face.
So take a bit of time out today for yourself. Make a plan to do something, or to do nothing at all. At the very least put the feet up and let the world look after itself for a while.
And so, as we begin our trip to the marts, toss your feet up on a chair, we are in no hurry here on this page.
We will begin with Kanturk mart, where Tuesday's sale was a big one. Kanturk mart manager Seamus O'Keeffe reported 595 cattle on offer (this number included 12 calves). The mart had 110 dry cows and 200 weanlings on offer.
""We saw unbelievable prices paid here today for all types of cattle,"" Seamus told me after Tuesday's sale.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40214753.html,2021-01-22 15:45:00,Farmers with cattle to sell respond to strong retail demand for beef,"There has been no movement in beef prices for this week, as a strong supply of cattle continued to move from farms to factories.
It was evident last week that processors were tightening their rein on any further rise in prices.
They were still interested in getting beef cattle but were strongly resisting paying extra for them.
Replenishing of supermarket shelves after strong Christmas sales may have been levelling off and easing some pressure on processors to fill orders.
That said, the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown continues to add to the demand for beef cuts for home cooking, largely mitigating the pandemic restriction of the catering trade.
Brexit, and its impact on export sales., remain unclear, albeit bringing uncertainty likely to last until the industry gets used to Britain trading outside of the EU.
It is going to take some time before we see how the market in Britain settles, and there will always be major concern that cheaper imports from non-EU suppliers could intensify competition and put Irish beef sales in the UK under pressure.
In that event, how British consumers rate quality and farm to fork traceability of Irish beef will determine if they are prepared to pay extra for such assurances.
On the ground, the base price being quoted for steers is 375-380, but at 380 cents/kg in general for a sizeable percentage of the intake.
While there are some reports of 385 cents/kg being paid this week, it is not generally available and, day by day, processors appear to be clamping down more on paying higher prices for stock.
Heifer prices generally track the steer base price at a premium of 5 cents/kg, at 380-385 cents/kg. Some hard sellers are reported to be securing a base of 390 cents/kg for heifers, which are generally in tighter supply than steers, with a bit more pressure on processors to get hold of the available heifers.
There is a bit more appetite at the factories for young bulls this week and, as a result, the price gap with the steers has been almost completely closed, with quotes running at 375-380 cents/kg for R-grade.
The trade for cows is stable. There is good demand for quality cows, with R-grade making up to 345 cents/kg, and 320-325 cents/kg for O-grade cows this week.
Bord Bia said demand for prime cattle at Irish export meat plants so far in 2021 remained strong for quality, “in-spec” cattle, driven by strong demand in the retail sector.
For the week ending January 16, prices recorded by the DAFM were €3.79/kg for R3 steers, and €3.84/kg for R3 heifers (excluding VAT but including all bonuses).
This compared with £3.82 and £3.84 (heifers) in Northern Ireland, and €4.28 in Britain. Across Europe, the average R3 young bull price was €3.66."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-40210853.html,2021-01-23 11:30:00,"Marts on a high, for reasons unknown","While this country in so many ways might be at a standstill, or even on a downer, at the marts things are flying high. All cattle marts this week are reporting one thing. Positivity. It's positive news on the price front, all the way.
And the reason for the positivity? Well your guess is as good as mine. Indeed your guess might be better than mine. I see no reason for the upward push other than it might have something to do with newly elected US President, Joe Biden. 
By all accounts there is nothing Joe enjoys better than grilling steak. And good luck to him, let's hope he keeps the flame alive for the next four years.
Anyhow we will begin with Kilmallock mart where things have gotten off to a flying start for 2021, with the mart reporting that ""Prices are up big time on the pre-Christmas sales.""

Competition for hoggetsupplies takes price to 650 cents/kg in strong market"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40215509.html,2021-01-27 18:11:00,Drystock farmers to lose out to increased imports in EU plans for 12 trade agreements,"Beef cattle prices in the EU will fall by 2.4%, if the Mercosur trade agreement is ratified, according to the latest assessment by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission’s science and knowledge service.
Under the provisional agreement with the Mercosur countries in South America, the EU will allow 99,000 tonnes of beef to enter its market, with a 7.5% import duty.
It will take five years after ratification and implementation of the trade agreement until the 99,000t amount is reached.
The JRC price prediction is for 2030, and also takes into account 11 other trade agreements either concluded or still under negotiation.
In the other trade agreements which the EU is negotiating, it is envisaged sheepmeat imports from Australia and New Zealand would result in sheep prices in the EU falling by 1.9% to 3.1%.
In recent years, the EU concluded trade agreements with Canada, Japan, Mercosur, Mexico, and Vietnam.
Some of these have yet to be ratified.
Further trade agreements under negotiation or possibly envisaged are with Australia, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand.
However, the Mercosur trade agreement would have by far the biggest impact on the beef market.
If all 12 trade agreements were implemented, they would increase the value of EU beef imports by 21%-26% (by €512m-614m).
Most of this increase in imports derives from the Mercosur trade deal (€422m, or 69%-82% of the increase in imports), but Australia also gaining EU market access for beef would bring €45m-121m of additional imports.
The JRC says the EU would meanwhile increase beef exports, mainly to Japan and the Philippines, by a predicted €105m-150m, partially cancelling out the impact of Mercosur and Australia imports.
EU beef production falling 0.3%, and becoming strongly linked to development of the dairy herd, are envisaged.
EU sheepmeat production is envisaged to fall by 0.2-0.4%.
The JRC said the EU trade agenda is set to have an overall positive impact on the EU economy, and on the agri-food sector.
It predicted trade agreements would result in substantial increases in EU agri-food exports, with more limited increases in imports, creating a positive trade balance overall.
Despite No 1 global dairy exporter New Zealand being one of the countries with which a trade agreement is being negotiated, the JRC says potential gains from trade opening up are particularly large for the EU dairy sector, and for the pork sector, and for more high value/processed products of the EU agri-food industry, such as wine, beverages, and tobacco.
Additional export demand enhanced by trade agreements could translate into an important source of growth, jobs creation, and value added for the European agricultural and food sectors, according to the JRC.
But imports would grow of products such as beef, sheep meat, poultry, rice, and sugar.
“The successful conclusion of trade agreements will have to strike a balance between the protection of sensitive products [such as beef] and the achieved market access for EU agricultural products, if the overall result of trade negotiations is to remain economically and socially acceptable for EU agriculture,” said the JRC.
Overall, if 12 trade agreements are implemented, the value of EU agri-food exports in 2030 will have increased by 2.8%-3.3% (or €4.7bn-5.5bn).
Imports would increase by 10%-13%, or €3.7bn-4.7bn, predicted the JRC, which noted that environmental and climate effects, or any EU Green Deal-related initiatives, did not fall within the scope of its research on trade agreements.
And its results are only available for the EU as a whole, not for member states or regions.
Its findings are for 2030, compared to “business as usual”.
Dairy exports (cheese, butter, skimmed milk powder, whey) are predicted to increase as much as 7.3% (€1.3bn), with Japan the main destination envisaged for additional exports.
Increasing EU milk production (by 0.2%) and milk prices (by 1.3%) are predicted to add €890m to the revenue of dairy farmers, by 2030.
Pork exports increasing as much as 8.9% (€914m) are associated with a 3.3%-4.6% pig price increase and a 0.7%-1% production growth in the EU, in the JRC projections for 2030.

20-30% of EU direct pay will be for new climate, environment schemes"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40218500.html,2021-01-28 17:04:00,2021 omens are good for agri-food but...,"As the global lockdown gets tighter, and life as we know it has changed for many people, it is hard to predict how the year ahead will go for farmers and the food industry.
After all, the way is food consumed has changed around the world.
With most restaurants closed, there is more eating at home, and preparing one’s own food at home, whether growing, cooking, baking, or preserving, activities which up to now had been declining year by year.
Globally, more and more have changed to buying their food online, even older and rural customers.
Food quality has come to the fore, along with “comfort foods”.
Premium cuts of beef and dairy-based “comfort foods” have sold well during the coronavirus pandemic.
It is estimated overall spending on dairy rose by 7.8% during 2020 compared with a year earlier, in the UK, which is still the largest single destination for Irish food and drink exports.
Consumption by value was up 14.5% for cheese, 18.5% for butter and 22.8% for cream.
An estimated 73% increase in home baking may have contributed to the rise. For example, mozzarella sales soared by 48%, due to people making their own pizzas.
In 2020, the volume of UK sales rose 11% for all food and drink, including 7.6% for dairy. Sales rose 6.6% for liquid milk, 14.5% for cheese, 18.4% for butter, 22.8% for cream, and 5.9% for yoghurt.
People have been thinking more about their food, with the older generation turning to their tried and tested favourites, but younger age groups may have become more entrenched with less positive ideas about farming and food.
However, increased buying of food was made possible by significant government employment protections or specific Covid-19 unemployment benefits.
In the case of the UK, the government has paid 80% of the wages of staff to prevent them being laid off. This scheme is currently extended to April. 
Another scheme supports self-employed individuals.
Together, they have provided £83.5 billion of financial support to working people since the start of the pandemic. But the unwinding of that government aid, as soon as Covid-19 allows it, will be a challenge.
It’s the same across the developed world, with high levels of sovereign debt as a result of Covid-19 interventions threatening future economic growth, as governments juggle with the roll-out of effective vaccines, and pandemic statistics.
But the challenge may be greater for the UK, because its economy is orientated to entertainment, travel and services, all devastated by the pandemic, and is therefore likely to contract more than other major economies, and may suffer a Brexit impact at the same time.
With the European Commission having committed to €700bn in spending on recovery and investment, the EU states may get through the crisis better.
Further afield, China’s economy is likely to strongly rebound this year by a predicted 8.2%, the highest projection for any major economy. Ireland may come to depend more this year on sales to China, and will need the reopening of access for Irish beef, closed since May 2020.
However, the coronavirus overshadows everything.
It devastated food markets between February and April in 2020, but they recovered well after April.
Bord Bia has looked at 2021 prospects for each Irish food sector.
Overall, the food board expects the global supply and demand dynamic for Irish food and drink producers to remain positive in 2021, based on the likely end of the pandemic.
Dairy demand growth outpacing supply, and a favourable global meat supply balance, are predicted, but the future trading relationship with the UK is uncertain, at least for the early part of 2021.
A drop of at least 50,000 head in finished cattle supplies in Ireland is anticipated in 2021.
Reduced supply will support cattle prices, but demand for Irish beef will depend heavily on the changing trading relationship between the EU and the UK.
That still has to play out, with the Taoiseach warning last week that the extra costs imposed by necessary checks and controls will increase for exporters later in the year, when the UK fully introduces its own import regime.
This includes major new veterinary certification requirements for Ireland’s meat exports to the UK from April 1.
The UK beef market will remain only 75% self-sufficient in 2021.
Therefore a high volume of imports will be required.
The Irish beef supply is well established and understood by customers and consumers alike.
As a result, it is hoped that Irish beef can retain its strong market position — especially if there is some recovery in the foodservice sector.
Trading of Irish beef to EU-27 markets will be largely determined by the lockdown status of key markets, and the extent of recovery in the European foodservice market which has been predicted to, at best, return to within 10% of pre Covid-19 levels, by the end of 2021.
Cheap German pork will compete with beef, due to Germany having lost access to key international markets, because of African Swine Fever in its wild boars. And the further direct impacts and economic after-effects of Covid-19 will leave consumer demand relatively weak in the EU-27 in 2021.
However, Bord Bia expects to see a greater share of Irish beef shipped to EU-27 markets, due to a 1.5% drop in European cattle production and no further growth in EU imports.
Already, Irish pig prices have weakened, but not as much as in the UK or EU mainland.
Chinese pork imports are forecast to fall by 6% during 2021, so lower global pork prices are forecast.
Can Irish sheepmeat exports repeat their very strong 2020 performance?
Yes, predicts Bord Bia, due to reductions in global supplies of sheepmeat and growing demand in Asian markets, particularly China, both factors that re-direct product away from the EU-27 market.
Direct access to China for Irish sheepmeat would be a welcome breakthrough but, even without it, some stability is expected for the deadweight trade for sheep during 2021, barring Covid-19 interruptions to trade with key export markets."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40217039.html,2021-01-30 17:00:00,The paperwork needed to support a loan application,"Over the last decade or so, since the financial crash of 2009, lending institutions have become more demanding in terms of paperwork needed to support loan applications.
Typically, in assessing any lending application of substance, the financial institution will request three years’ accounts, and potentially three years of income tax returns and confirmation that the applicant’s tax affairs are in order.
For more complicated and larger loan applications, additional information might be sought, such as ICBF reports, EBI report,, milk statements, and business plans.
Looking for historic accounting records is useful in terms of assessing what level of profit the current business is making, and more importantly the amount of income which was taken to fund drawings and income tax payments, as well as details of the amount of credit already extended to the applicant.
The advantage for the bank of having the accounts and the income tax returns to hand in assessing a loan application is that figures can be cross compared and validated, giving greater assurance. Secondly the income tax returns contain extra information, such as the amount of stock relief claimed, and capital allowances or losses forward which may be subduing the income tax position for the years in question.
Ultimately, financial institutions try to assess whether an applicant can meet their repayments, and more correctly, the degree to which that person can meet their repayments under a number of different stress factors.
For instance, when lending to dairy farmers, banks and credit unions may stress test applications assuming a base milk price of 28c a litre.
This involves recalculating previous year’s profits as if the milk price for those years was 28c, and assessing if the individual could have met their drawings, existing repayments, and proposed payments, at that level of milk price.
Presenting a comprehensive business plan can really make a difference, when it comes to getting application approval. Of course, it’s pretty obvious that a farmer seeking funding is looking to make the investment in order to improve their business. Improvements to a farm business might come in the form of extra productivity, such as a stocking loan to buy additional cows for extra land rented.
On-farm investment might result in reduced costs. For example, a slatted shed should result in less straw bedding. Whatever your proposed investment is, unless your repayment capacity is blatantly obvious, then supporting your business loan application with a business plan will help your lender understand how and why your investment proposal makes sense.
A comprehensive plan will detail the existing resources of the farm including stock (by age and type), the machinery on hand, entitlements owned, land owned and land rented, together with details of the tenure of that rental land (long term lease or conacre).
The plan will also detail existing repayments and the remaining term.
It is useful to outline any capital expenditure which has been funded in recent years from cash flow, as well as detailing any loans which have been cleared during that time, this information will point to additional repayment capacity coming on stream, and demonstrate that your business has had the capacity to meet expenditure above and beyond the drawings, tax and loan repayments made.
Of course, full details of the proposed investment, such as total costs, VAT recoverable, grants receivable, if any, and amount of own deposit or trade-in to be applied is useful in ascertaining the amount of funding and whether bridging funding is needed and the duration of such funding.
Mapping out historic profit levels for the past number of years and adding projections of where the profits are likely to go, together with projections on tax, drawings and existing and new repayments, presented as a table of financial information, is without doubt the single most important element that can be stitched into a business plan, this is called a cash flow projection.
In a more complex lending application, a variety of projections can be presented which incorporate stress testing for increased interest rates and perhaps milk price, or beef price in the case of cattle farmers.
A business plan can also incorporate details of other income streams, such as rental income, off-farm employment, and outline details of assets which can be disposed of to create liquidity if needed, as well the security being offered, if any.
At the end of the day, financial institutions are in the business of lending money, but also in the business of collecting what’s owing to them.
In assessing any loan application, the lender
will want a high degree of surety that repayments can be made.

Food scares: Pilot nutrivigilance system put in place at Beaumont Hospital"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40219142.html,2021-02-01 17:13:00,Cows the strongest sector in unsettled 2021 beef cattle market,"Beef price trends continued steady at factories this week, albeit with an element of uncertainty gaining some ground.
The kill remained stable, at 31,211 head for last week, around 4,500 head lower than the corresponding week in 2020.
But signs of increasing processor resistance to finishers' demands for better prices have appeared.
The trade had been positive for the early weeks of the year, normally a quiet period for sales.
No two seasons are the same in the beef trade, and 2021 has the added complexity of uncertainty arising from Brexit.
With supermarket shelves now replenished after the holiday period, the trade has moved into a period of assessment of short to medium prospects.
The eventual Brexit deal at the twelfth hour relieved worries, but the post-Brexit situation has yet to find its level.
The message to beef finishers from factory agents this week is clear that there is no appetite in the factories for any upward price movement, and the challenge is to hold on to current prices for those with factory-ready cattle.
Of course, this may well be a ploy to keep a strong supply of cattle flowing.
But it is hard to see which way the trade might move, because there are so many uncertainties.
Most processors quote at 375 cents/kg for steers this week, while in general paying up to 380 cents/kg, but very firmly refusing to go above that.
Heifer prices are on a premium of 5 cents/kg over steers, with most of the quotes at 380 cents/kg, and 385-390 cents/kg being paid.
Some of the edge has gone off the trade for young bulls, priced now at 370-375 cents/kg for Rs, although some deals are being reported at up to 380 cents/kg.
In contrast, demand for cows at factories continues strong.
This is reflected in the price, with the best of the P-grade cows making up to 310 cents/kg, with O-grade at 315-320 cents/kg, and up to 330-335 cents/kg being paid for Rs this week.
The intake of steers last week was 10,548, with heifers at 10,130 head, and both categories down 1,400 head on the same week last year.
There were 6,511 cows and 3,578 young bulls in the kill for the week.
Bord Bia says live cattle exports in 2021 started off slowly, due to the new Brexit regulations.
Nevertheless, movement of cattle to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly, with 768 head travelling north during the week ending January 16.
This included calves and store cattle for further feeding, and 164 animals for direct slaughter.
In 2020, live exports of prime cattle for direct slaughter to Northern Ireland increased by 8,300 head, to over 21,000 animals."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40219175.html,2021-02-02 17:30:00,Deadline flexibility sought for BEAM participants,"Flexibility around the deadline for meeting the 5% reduction in the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) is being explored by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in its communications with the EU Commission.
Funded by the EU and Ireland, BEAM provided aid to beef farmers. Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received €77.72 million from the scheme, €50 million of which was funded by the EU.
But participating farmers agreed to reduce production of bovine manure nitrogen on their holdings by 5%, by June 30, 2021. This was one of the conditions under which the €50 million was granted by the EU.
Based on the most recent data, some 14,000 participating farmers are meeting the 5% reduction requirement, said Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue in the Dáil last week.
He said, “It will not be possible to remove the reduction requirement, because the exceptional aid was granted to Ireland on the basis of this reduction being implemented.” However, he confirmed that his Department has engaged with the EU Commission, regarding possible flexibility on the June 30, 2021 deadline.
One of the reasons flexibility may be needed is to allow for a five-week delay in calculating bovine manure nitrogen, which means that the actual June 30, 2021 nitrogen position on farms will not be known until about August 4.
BEAM participants agreed to reduce production of bovine manure nitrogen for the period July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 by 5%, compared to the period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019. Participants are provided with the totals for organic bovine nitrogen produced on their holding for 12-month periods, updated monthly, based on information from the Department’s Animal Identification and Movements (AIM) system, which is constantly being updated. However, there is a five-week interval before nitrogen data for each farm is extracted from AIM, in order to allow data on calvings, movements, etc, to “settle”, and to provide for the 27-day registration rule for calves.
As a result, existing data is accurate to the end of November, and data up to December 31 will be available in the coming weeks.
Minister McConalogue said an online BEAM calculator is being developed which will inform participants how much of their target figure they have achieved, and allow them to predict what effect prospective changes to their herd will have on their figures, in the run-up to the deadline.
BEAM was provided to support Irish beef farmers whose beef prices fell due to market disturbance."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40219781.html,2021-02-03 15:25:00,€12k per acre expected for east Cork farm,"An excellent quality grassland farm in one block and close to the M8 Dublin-Cork motorway at the southern edge of the Golden Vale is currently on offer with CCM Property Services.
Located in the townland of Ballynaneleagh, the farm is located to the southeast of the village of Rathcormac (now a growing satellite town which is just 10 mins from Cork City via the M8).
The holding enjoys excellent road frontage with the public road along both its northern and southern boundaries. In addition, there is a central roadway, giving good access to all the fields and a good quality shed. According to the selling agent Martin Lonergan, this is excellent free-draining land.
“The land rises from one end to the other,” explains Martin, “with a roadway through it… The first day I visited the site, there were cattle running around on it not doing it any damage so it’s very free draining ground.”
The land has been used continuously by the owner, ensuring that it has been very well looked after and maintained. Its use has been for grazing suckler cows.
“It has its own well and its own electricity supply,” says Martin. “So it’s a self-contained unit with very good access… It’s a walk-in property for somebody who might want it as a small holding and it’s very well located with regard to the mart.”
The nearest Cork Marts is on the far side of Rathcormac on the R639 - formerly the main N8 main Cork-Dublin road -  approximately 6km away from the holding.
Apart from the strong presence of dairying and beef fattening, the other very active sector locally is that of the equestrian world. Within a 10km radius, there are a good number of prominent horse breeding operations that have produced the likes of the famous Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Denman.
“The land would be suitable for anything and everybody wants nice free-draining land,” says Martin. “We’ve had about ten people or so request maps of the property already,” he adds. 
""Given the nature of land sales, it will often take a few weeks for potential buyers to consider the property and the various elements involved before making offers.""
The price expectation for the land is in the region of €12,000 per acre (€360,000 to €380,000). While there is a justifiable air of caution as we begin another Lockdown year with trepidation, the underlying factors and recent sales from the area would suggest that this farm will be likely to achieve a price closer to €15,000/acre. 
The coming weeks will tell their own story.

Reopening of organic farming scheme set for March"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40219919.html,2021-02-03 17:15:00,Six-year high for global milk prices comes at a good time for Ireland,"A sixth positive Global Dairy Trade (GDT) auction result in a row on Tuesday indicated dairy markets remain healthy.
Strong demand from China and Southeast Asia for whole milk powder and skim milk powder from New Zealand helped boost the GDT Price Index 1.8%, to the highest level since May, 2014.
Led on Tuesday by a 10.7% increase in the buttermilk powder price and a 6.2% increase in the butter price, the GDT Price Index has risen 19.3% in three months, and 13% in a year.
GDT butter prices have surged by more than 50% from their 2020 low in September, encouraging for Irish exporters, who are among the top five EU exporters of butter (and of whole milk powder, and a substantial EU exporter of skim milk powder to China in 2020).
With the European Commission saying the EU is currently the most price competitive globally for cheddar, and more competitive than the US or NZ for whole milk powder, and EU-27 exports in 2020 having increased 3% over 2019, or 4% by value, the strong GDT run comes at a good time, after the peak of the 2021 New Zealand milk supply has passed.
It also comes at a good time for Irish dairy farmers who, together with their counterparts in Italy, and Poland, have led 2020’s increase in EU milk production.
This increase has contributed to EU production increases of 3.4% for skim milk powder, 3.3% for drinking milk, 2.8% for butter, 1.6% for cheese 1.4% for whole milk powder, but rising global demand has matched the supply increase.
Despite strong global markets, the milk prices picture across the EU in January and February is mixed, according to the monthly price report by ZuivelNL on behalf of the LTO Nederland farmers organisation, in collaboration with EDF (European Dairy Farmers).
It says the milk prices of Arla (Denmark) and FrieslandCampina (Netherlands) will decrease in January by €1.20 and €0.90 per 100 kg, respectively, followed by no change at Arla in February, and a €0.70 price increase at FrieslandCampina in February. 
The milk price of Milcobel (Belgium) increases by €1.40 in January, while the milk price of Saputo Dairy (UK) remains unchanged until March. The milk price of Emmi (Switzerland) will increase in January and decrease in February.
In the ZuivelNL monthly milk price comparison, Glanbia paid out the biggest price increase for December milk of the 16 processors included, thanks to a 2c per litre bonus paid for December milk by the Kilkenny-based processor, which also pushed Glanbia to the top of the Irish Farmers Journal monthly price league, and lifted Centenary Thurles to joint top place, because they sell most of their milk to Glanbia.
Meanwhile, Glanbia Co-op says it will continue for 2021 the Share of Glanbia Ireland Profit payment (as in 2020, it will be 0.4c per litre for all milk). 
It will also pay a trading bonus in 2021 worth up to 0.4c per litre (or €10 per tonne of grain supplied).
The Co-op owns 60% of Glanbia Ireland and receives a dividend each year equal to 30% of the processor’s annual profit, for distribution to active farmer members of the Co-op as “Share of GI Profit” and “Trading Bonus”.
The co-op also paid €10m in share interest (dividend) payments to Co-op Members in 2020. And beef, sheep and pig farmer Glanbia Co-op members can qualify for a feed bonus.
The three Irish processors included in the ZuivelNL monthly milk price comparison, all paid less than the average of €33.53, with Dairygold at €32.37, Glanbia at €34.21, and Kerry Agribusiness at €32.01. They are even further behind other European processors in the €33.02 12-month rolling average, with Dairygold at €30.83, Glanbia at €30.53, and Kerry Agribusiness at €31.35.
The December milk price also increased at FrieslandCampina, Müller (Germany) and Sodiaal (France), in addition to Glanbia. The price fell at Danone (France) and Saputo Dairy (UK). 
The average December price of €33.53 across 16 processors is 1.9% behind the December 2019 price, despite the average rising for the seventh consecutive month.
This left the average 2020 milk price 2% behind 2019, before supplementary payments based on co-op profit distributions or top-ups.
The ZuivelNL report said the EU dairy market has become a lot more dynamic over the past few weeks.
The price quotation for butter rose sharply in January, after a stable second half of 2020. 
The high price of cream plays a role in this, along with good demand from the retail channel for butter in consumer packaging. 
The price of skim milk powder also showed a strong increase in January, thanks to global demand. 
However, Europe is again increasingly faced with competition from cheaper US supplies.
The price of whole milk powder moved up in line with the prices of skimmed milk powder and butter.
The 2020 EU milk supply, including November, increased by 1.1% compared to 2019. 
The aggregated volume of the major global dairy exporters (including the EU) was up 1.8%.

€100m Brexit scheme opens up for agri-food sector"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40220360.html,2021-02-04 11:13:00,Farmers given option of 2022 BEAM nitrogen reduction period,"Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue last night welcomed a decision by the European Commission to allow Ireland the flexibility of a new nitrogen reduction period for the Beef Emergency Aid Measure (BEAM).
Minister McConalogue recently asked the Commission for flexibility to offer farmers the choice of changing the reduction year from the existing July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 year, to a new period of January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.
Now, farmers can opt to apply for the new nitrogen reduction period.
Those farmers on track to meet the 5% nitrogen reduction targets can use the original reference period ending June 30.
Funded by the EU and Ireland, BEAM provided aid to beef farmers. Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received €77.72 million as part of the scheme.
But participating farmers agreed to reduce production of bovine manure nitrogen on their holdings by 5%, by June 30, 2021. This was one of the conditions under which €50, was granted for BEAM by the EU. Minister McConalogue said, “As the European Commission is a significant funder of BEAM, it was critical that they were consulted on Ireland’s proposed change.
“The option of a new reduction period now gives those farmers who want it a second opportunity to meet the nitrogen reduction requirement of the scheme.”
“Now that this flexibility has been secured, I will be intensifying our engagement with farm organisations and agricultural consultants to ensure their members and clients are fully informed of the requirements of the scheme, and the new reduction period.
“My Department will be writing to all of the scheme participants shortly giving updated nitrogen figures to clearly inform them of what they need to do to meet the requirements of the scheme, and will also be giving advice on how and when they can opt to change the reduction year. I was extremely concerned about the outcome facing many farmers under the current reduction period,” Minister McConalogue said.
He had revealed recently that only about 14,000 BEAM participating farmers were meeting the 5% reduction requirement.
He also said participants are provided with figures for organic bovine nitrogen produced on their holding for 12-month periods, updated monthly, based on information from his Department’s Animal Identification and Movements (AIM) system, which is constantly being updated.
However, there is a five-week interval before nitrogen data for each farm is extracted from AIM, in order to allow data on calvings, movements, etc to “settle”, and to provide for the 27-day registration rule for calves. As a result, existing data is accurate to the end of November, and data up to December 31 will be available in the coming weeks.
The five-week delay in calculating bovine manure nitrogen would mean the nitrogen position on farms at the original June 30, 2021, deadline would not be known until about August 4.
Minister McConalogue said an online BEAM calculator is being developed which will inform participants how much of their target figure they have used, and allow them predict what effect changes to their herd would have on their figures.
BEAM was provided to support Irish beef farmers whose beef prices fell due to market disturbance."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/technology/arid-40219721.html,2021-02-07 11:00:00,"No summer holiday for Livestock farmer, the numbers simply don't add up","Alas and alack, it looks like we won't be basting our big bellies on the beaches of Lanzarote this summer.
The numbers simply don't add up. And I'm not talking here about the Covid numbers, only the spondulicks.
The way the cattle trade has been fixed for that past number of years, the only fellows who can board a plane or ship with any degree of certainty, will be our calves and weanlings bound for exotic ports and destinations too numerous to mention. 
The rest of us will have to make do with the natural wonders of the Emerald Isle. And damn glad we are to have it too. There is nothing like an Irish beach in the summer, bar the rain, the wind and the loose dogs.
And whether the Covid curve is cresting or bottoming out in July, whether Dr Tony is wearing a face mask or swimming trunks, it matters little to us in the beef game.
With a profit margin from cattle that wouldn't launch a rubber duck in your bath, the chances of us being able to afford a half dozen seats on a plane and a hotel to boot, the chances of us being able to afford a family getaway anyplace beyond Mushera mountain is zero.
Dr Tony and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary can say what they like, it's going to be a Fr Ted summer holiday for the likes of you and me.
And so to the marts we go where the flying trade for quality cattle continues, plainer lots are finding the going a little more tricky this week.
Kilmallock mart had 950 cattle on offer on Monday. Demand for all types of cattle and calves was said to be ""very strong at the moment, with sellers benefitting from super spring prices,"" according to the mart. Kilmallock mart had 133 buyers purchasing stock online, which is the only choice we have.
Bullocks here sold for up to €2.37 per kg. Weanlings bulls hit €860 a head or €2.78 per kg. Dry cows sold for up to €1290 a head or €1.83 per kg.
Heifers made up to €1240 a head or €2.68 per kg. Dairy stock sold for up to €1780 a head. A 5-year-old in calf Hereford suckler (time up March) sold for €1,000.

George Candler next and a report from Tuesday's calf sale in Kilkenny mart. ""Our first standalone calf sale only attracted 100 head with stronger types most sought after by farmer buyers.
""The lighter type Friesian bull was the most difficult to sell due to the lack of exporters. It might be more prudent for dairy farmers to hold onto their calves until they are at least three weeks old."" 
Good advice there from George. And looking back to the mart's general cattle sale on Thursday, George added;
""We had a bigger sale of cattle in Kilkenny on Thursday with 800 on offer. The clearance rate was 98% due to a slight lessening in demand for plainer animals.
""Quality bullocks and heifers sold well with the bulk of continentals in this category selling from €1.90 to €2.40 per kilo, exceptional lots made up to €2.80/kg. Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks and heifers ranged in price from €1.75 to €2.20 per kilo.""
Friesian cull cows in Kilkenny sold from €1.10 to €1.68 per kilo. Continental cull cows made from €1.20 to €2.31 per kilo.

Cows the strongest sector in unsettled 2021 beef cattle market"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40223810.html,2021-02-10 09:05:00,Another quality twin property in East Cork seeking €13k per acre,"No, this is not a misprint: For the second week running, there is a modest-sized parcel of high-quality land for sale in the townland of Ballynaneleagh near the village of Rathcormac in East Cork.
As with the 30-acre holding featured on these pages last week, this 26.5-acre property has road frontage on two sides, is excellent free-draining land and is within a few kilometres of the M8 Cork-Dublin motorway.
“The two farms are next door to one another,” points out Ballyhooley-based auctioneer Paul O’Driscoll who is selling the property jointly with Michael Barry of Fermoy-based agents Dick Barry & Son.
“There is water there and electricity,” says Paul, “and there’s a cattle crush and holding pen.”
The price guide is also around the €13,000/acre mark and the pair of adjoining properties might eventually attract the interest of someone. There is certainly no shortage of potential bidders nearby in a lively agricultural scene where dairying, beef cattle and the equestrian sector all have a strong presence.
The interest has been good so far, according to the auctioneer, with a good number of enquiries having come through both of the selling agents – some of whom may be interested in making a joint bid for the two properties.
“There is an opportunity for someone to make a bigger holding if they were to buy the two units,” says Paul. That would represent a rare chance for the right client in an area where larger tracts of excellent pasture are not so frequent."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40223492.html,2021-02-10 10:00:00,Demand for cows remians strong despite slip in factory intake,"Beef finishers are clinging to the hope that the scale of downturn in the quoted prices from the factories for this week will be shortlived.
A further drop of 10-15 cents/kg in the prices being quoted for both steers and heifers at the plants has increased the downturn in producer returns by between €50 and €70/head conpared to two weeks ago.
There are also very strong reports circulating that the breed bonus being paid on Hereford and Angus have been either reduced or dropped at a number of factories.
At the same time the intake at the factories has also slipped which should have been of benefit to maintaining the floor under the prices being paid. 
But several of the factories have reduced operation on the line to three days explaining that orders don't justify full operation.
The intake for last week slipped to 30,454 head, a level which, at least over the past year, would have increased the pressure on the factories to source more cattle and strengthen the hand of producers with stock to sell.
However a further cut of 10 cents/kg for the steers and up to 15 cents/kg off the heifer price has stunned suppliers.
Some plants are offering suppliers a base of 370 cents/kg for both steers and heifers this week. 
In general the steers are being quoted at 370 cents/kg with heifers on a base of 375 cents/kg.
Most of the stock being slaughtered for the week have been bought forward from last week at 5-10 cents/kg above current prices. 
It is reported that up to 375 cents/kg for the steers and a base of 380 cents/kg for heifers is being secured in deals with the factories.
It is believed that many of the tradtional Winter finishers cut back on the number of cattle being fed over this Winter amid concerns of the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit, which should mean that supplies over the next few months will be tighter than normal.
Producers are hinging on continued demand and tighter supplies for a recovery of at least some of the recent drop in the prices.
The young bull prices have also been reduced this week with R grade young bulls dropped to 365 cents/kg. The only category to avoid the downturn are the cows for which demand remains strong and R grade cows are making up to 330 cents/kg. 
The intake of cows is also continuing strong at 6,028 in the kill last week.
The supply for the week included 11,172 steers, 9,261 heifers and 3,437 young bulls.

How PIAs can give farmers enough time to pay their debts"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40223936.html,2021-02-13 15:00:00,Planning now for quality feed next winter,"The weather is never too far away in any conversation in Ireland. There is no doubt that the older you get, the less you like snow. On the upside, maybe home-schooling this week can include snowman construction
A good spell is badly needed to get slurry and fertiliser out as there has been practically no opportunity to do since the close period ended.
For many grazing is still a good bit away due to very soft and wet ground conditions. Ground is actually in okay condition on many farms but there is a lot of standing water. 
A bit of patience now may be well rewarded if and when the weather settles. Avoid travelling ground or turning out animals if you will do excessive damage. 
Remember that any damage that you do at this time of year is likely to reduce overall grass yield for the year.
This winter is dragging on for a while longer by the looks of it. For those who are worried about forage supply, now is the time to take action and not when you run out. 
Do the sums and buy feed sooner rather than later. Straw supplies, in particular, have become very tight recently, with very little now available for trading.
Forages for winter 2020/2021 
Many are now beginning to review their plans for what crops to set for the coming season. In the last two years when the vast majority of crops were excellent in both quality and volume, many beef and dairy producers are reassessing their options for feed next winter.
Before we look forward we should make sure that we have accurate information about the previous year’s forage production. The experience in 2020 is of very good crops of maize, beet and whole crop cereals in 2020. 
As a result, many are thinking of increasing the acreage of these crops or going back to growing them if they had stopped growing these crops. 
It is well proven at this stage that the addition of a second forage along with Grass Silage to a Beef finisher diet will increase forage Dry Matter intake by between 10 and 15 %. This will result in reduced concentrate inputs being required.
Given the way concentrate prices have increased this winter, any way that you can reduce the volume being purchased will help your bottom line. 
Crops such as Maize Silage and Whole-crop Cereals provide high DM and Starch contents for beef farms. Beet is also an excellent sugar energy sources for finishing beef cattle.
What is the best option for you?
A viable option for some farmers who do not have suitable land to grow alternative forages may be to source them locally from specialised tillage producers.
Do your calculations based on the cost per unit of energy utilised by the animals before any decision is made. Renting ground for silage is not cheap and relative to buying forage at harvest may not give you the best return on investment. 
In most cases, buying beet or maize will be cheaper per unit of energy utilised than producing 2nd and 3rd cut on owned ground.
Reviewing Grass Silage 2020 
Of the silages I have tested with my NIR machine on customers farms- one thing has stood out for me. Too much of the silage saved is way too dry due to over wilting. 
This dry silage has not preserved well, is heating at feed out and in many cases contains moulds detrimental to animal performance. 
This is a particular issue in 2nd cuts. Grass destined for the pit must not be on the ground more than 24 hrs unless it is being baled. 
Grass silage production is getting more and more expensive every year and unfortunately its quality can be variable depending on weather, cutting date and grassland management/reseeding policy. Too much poor or average silage in the pit will in fact increase overall beef and milk production costs.
You need to learn from mistakes, challenges and issues in previous years in order to improve silage making.
For those who are worried about forage supply, now is the time to take action
Having a Silage Strategy for 2021 
Those who are serious about producing quality grass silage in 2021 should have a plan in place to produce the best feed possible. 
This plan should include an early grazing strategy or not grazing, a soil nutrient test, a fertiliser and slurry programme, a weed control programme, a reseeding programme, a planned cutting date and a good ensiling strategy. 
Now how many of us can honestly say that we have all of those boxes ticked. This is the time of year to set out your goals for all of the above aspects. 
Those producing quality silage in 2021 will be cutting it from early May on and will have the first application of fertiliser out in the next three to four weeks or so, weather permitting.
 Splitting Nitrogen applications for silage is a wise strategy also as it allows some flexibility on rate applied depending on growing conditions. This will allow you to maintain your target cutting date.

Dairy co-ops seize opportunities as global population soars"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/travel/arid-40223420.html,2021-02-14 08:51:00,How 'Normal People' gave Sligo a tourism boost,"Sligo is feeling the love! The cornerstone county of Ireland’s northwest may be traditionally overshadowed by its Atlantic neighbours, but this weather it’s on the cusp of a PR wave. Last year it enjoyed a so-called 'screen tourism' bounce thanks to the shooting of the tv adaptation of Normal People in the county, while just last week Leo Varadkar’s revelation that he and his partner would be spending their summer holiday in Sligo could do for Tubbercurry what Barack Obama did for Martha’s Vineyard. 
Follow that with news that Sligo is bidding for Unesco status for some of its most ancient burial sites and the region could be poised for further global stardom. Sligo is go!
“I think Sligo has always been evolving as a staycation destination,” Anthony Gray, the newly appointed chair of Sligo Tourism, tells me this week. “What we have, we have in abundance; from local produce experienced on our Sligo food trails to our literary heritage in Yeats Country to our exceptional coastline via the Wild Atlantic Way.” 
It’s that short but sweeping stretch of coastline that has really resonated in recent years with the vibrant surfing market; the county’s beaches appear like scenes from a Fáilte Ireland commercial during any given summer swelter.
“We call them the great escapers,” Anthony says. “They’re the young, vibrant demographic which have stamped Sligo as what I would call the adventure tourism capital of the northwest.” 
Benbulben, Sligo
That niche is poised to only strengthen with current pandemic holiday trends. 
“We’ve already a culture of great outdoor activities and now, if you even look at Sligo town, restaurants are starting to offer outdoor dining all along the beautiful Garravogue river.
“From eating fresh lobster from Mullaghmore to walking on Third Beach at Rosses Point under the head of Benbulben — as you think of Yeats — and I’ll tell you, it would put the hairs on the back of your neck,” he adds.
Last year also brought that “great escape” to Sligo on the back of tourists tracing the footsteps of the now household names of Marianne and Connell. 
“ Normal People has been a massive endorsement for Sligo,” Anthony tells me. 
If you think of those stunning images of the northwest being sent across the globe, it was fantastic publicity for the county and definitely created a buzz here.
While an international Normal People boost is anticipated when inbound travel recovers, there has already been a bounce from Irish tourists to filming locations, from Brennan’s pub in Tubbercurry to Streedagh beach. Sligo Tourism now even features a dedicated page on its website listing the locations.
But even more blockbuster developments emerged this week with the news that Sligo’s neolithic burial chambers are now in the (albeit lengthy) bidding process for Unesco status as a world heritage site. The tomb of Queen Maeve, a cairn that sits atop the mountain of Knocknarea, is just one of a network of local sites that could join the likes of Skellig Michael for the kudos-rich accreditation. 
“Along with all our other attractions, when you add in that we have one of the biggest cairns in the world, you can see how we’re punching well above our weight in Sligo for a small county. And you can see why Sligo County Council are getting so strongly on board with this bidding process, given the worldwide audience it would bring,” Anthony adds. 
“We’ve a wave of momentum in the county now — and we’re going to keep it going.”

He was very pleased with how the sale went.
""They sold better than we had expected. Because it was an online sale, we had buyers from as far away as Kilkenny, Offaly, Westmeath and Listowel. I think the online sale of the cattle really helped the sale and opened it up to the whole country.""
Two local buyers of Lee Valley Pedigree Angus stock on Saturday included Tony O'Driscoll from nearby Coppeen who purchased two Aberdeen Angus cows and one heifer, and also brothers Jerome and Mark Kelleher who purchased two cows with calves at foot.
At the Lee Valley Aberdeen Angus clearance sale in Macroom mart last Saturday, this 10-months-old heifer sold for €1,850.
The largest price paid on the day was €2,700 for an Aberdeen Angus cow with a calf at foot. And yes certainly when it comes to the sale of pedigree cattle, the online auction really looks like the way to go and looks like it's here to stay. In the mart game money talks.
And looking back to last Saturday's general cattle in Macroom, dry cows here sold from €20 to €520 over the kilo. Friesian bullocks made from €1.60/kg to €1.80/kg. Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks in Macroom sold from between €1.90kg to €2.30/kg. Continental bullocks sold from €2.25/kg to €2.70/kg. Heifers made from €1.95/kg to €2.35/kg.
And looking at weanling bulls in Macroom on Saturday, they sold from €2.20/kg to €2.50/kg.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40228400.html,2021-02-17 10:00:00,"Price pressure despite year-to-date intake falling more than 17,000","There were mixed messages in this week’s beef trade at factories, but with prices still under pressure.
Depending on the region of the country, the cattle supply, and individual factory requirements, prices on offer are either stable or down by a further 5c/kg.
There is resistance from finishers to any further cut in prices, as they are being pushed into loss-making, but processors say Brexit regulations are costing them dearly in their best market, the UK (where domestic beef cattle prices have generally increased in recent weeks).
But farmer leaders have hit back, accusing factory bosses of unjustified price cuts, and urging their members to resist by holding back cattle.
In areas where this resistance is affecting intake at factories, it is reported that processors are drawing more cattle from their feedlots to maintain throughputs.
The intake at factories for last week was 31,225, down by 6,500 head compared to the same week last year, with the decline fairly uniform across all cattle categories.
The year-to-date intake is back by more than 17,000 head.
Some finishers were quoted a base of 365c/kg for steers this week. However, 370c/kg appears to be more the going rate, while heifer prices have been quoted as low as 370c/kg.
Reports from around the country indicate that mixed supplies of steers and heifers are being bought by processors at 370c/kg. In general, heifer prices of 370c/kg and up to 375c are on offer, with most lots of heifers going into factories at the higher base price.
There is very little change in prices quoted for cows, but some processors are not as interested as they were in larger cow numbers. R-grade cow quotes are holding at up to 330c, with prices on offer for Os ranging from 305 to 310c.
The intake last week included 10,706 steers, compared to 12,500 for the same week last year, and 9,350 heifers, down from 11,658 in 2020. Young bulls at 3,299 and cows at 6,072 were back on the same week last year.

'Top quality' Tipperary holding likely to attract forestry interest"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40229909.html,2021-02-19 11:40:00,'Self sustaining' 137-acre residential farm near Bandon arrives onto the market ,"Land in the Bandon area of West Cork has been in high demand over the last year or so, with good land in the area achieving anywhere between €12,000 and €16,000 per acre.
The current offering from Clonakilty-based auctioneers Ernest Forde Property Services would represent the upper end of that scale: a high-quality residential holding with fixtures to match and of a scale that puts it in the category of a self-sustaining unit.
The farm – Brothersfort Farm – consists of 137 acres all in one block and is situated in the townland of Kilpatrick, approximately 6km northeast of Bandon and 5km northwest of Innishannon, lying north of the Bandon River. Cork City centre is within a half-hour’s drive away.
“It’s a fine farm and well presented,” says selling agent Ernest Forde. “Everything is clean and good there.”
The lands are bounded by the Brinny River towards its eastern extremities and are well drained. 
It’s currently in pasture and is well fenced throughout, with private well water, electricity, broadband and mains gas.
“There would be 120 acres or so of very good workable land,” says Ernest, “but there is an ash wood of around six acres and a few more acres of waste at the lower end of the farm… the good land is just excellent, though.”
There are good quality modern outbuildings (including an Olympic-sized riding arena), with the dwelling being the only building that needs work:
“The house is gutted inside,” explains Ernest, the owner having originally planned to refurbish the interior. 
That task will now be part of the next owner’s brief to finish out this quality home to their own tastes. 
“It’s a blank canvas for someone to work with,” says Ernest, who adds that the large 2,300ft home was successfully let for a number of years.
The buildings are set up for a beef cattle operation. It could be used for dairying, of course, although that require some further investment.
“There would be a little bit of work to do [to turn it into a dairy farm] but the farm layout would certainly lend itself to dairying.”
The road frontage is adequate and, with the house enjoying a pleasant location on the driveway into the farm, it isn’t a layout that’s conducive to sub-division.
The property’s rarity and quality has generated some interest already, according to Ernest. 
“We’ve a few viewings from interested parties but it’s only just on the market so I’d be very surprised if it doesn’t get interest.”
The price guide of €15,000-€16,000/acre reflects the rarity and quality of the land and buildings.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40229969.html,2021-02-20 17:02:00,Calf rearing primary goal is double birth weight in 56 days,"During the recent Animal Health Ireland and Teagasc Calf Care Virtual Week, Pauline O’Driscoll, Teagasc dairy adviser, Skibbereen, asked Teagasc researcher Dr Emer Kennedy and Teagasc nutritionist Dr Joe Patton about the guidelines for feeding milk and concentrates in the diet of the calf.
The primary goal of the rearing phase is to double the birth weight of the calf by 56 days of age.
Good nutrition is fundamental to animal health, welfare and productivity.
The type of liquid feed given to calves following colostrum is transition milk.
The feeding of this depends on the farm targets, milk price, milk availability, disease status of the farm, and labour availability.
Feeding milk replacer
Feeding milk replacer is common practice on many farms.
There is a wide range of milk replacer powders available, each with their advantages and disadvantages on nutritional content and cost.
Some milk powders are suited to specific rearing systems, so it is important to match the powder to the system employed.
Dr Emer Kennedy highlighted the importance of following the correct guidelines for making up the milk replacer product being used.
Debate regarding the best temperature to feed milk or milk replacer stems from concerns about the impact that temperature has on the energy expenditure of the calf.
The bottom line is that liquid feed is best provided at a constant temperature; avoid feeding warm milk one day, cool milk the next.
Once per day feeding can be introduced from one month of age, but Emer warned of the need to check calves twice per day, paying particular attention to calf health and any signs of illness.
Where farmers buy in dairy calves, it is advisable to feed electrolytes after transport, for the first feed, and, depending on distance travelled, a second feed of electrolytes may be required.
This helps to ensure calves are well hydrated and stay healthy.
Weaning can take place once calves are consuming 1kg of concentrate per head per day.
Feeding concentrates and fibre
The intake of calf starter concentrates is the single most important factor in the development of the rumen, which is very small and undeveloped at birth.
Starter intake is important in ensuring a smooth transition from milk feeding to an adult diet at weaning without setbacks to growth.
In general, calves are fed a “calf starter” ration up to 12-16 weeks of age.
Although consumption of concentrates is low, it is important to introduce calves to it in the first week.
Hygiene of the trough is essential, and offering a little concentrate often is advised.
Developing the rumen of the calf correctly is the main focus in the weeks up to weaning.
Feeding good quality concentrates makes management post weaning easier.
It is important to measure and monitor the concentrate intake of the calves, to ensure they are meeting their requirements.
Introducing fibre is necessary to allow this to happen also.
Clean, good quality straw is preferred to hay.
Water
Water is often the most overlooked aspect of calf-rearing.
Water consumption is important for the development of the rumen, and to allow for timely weaning of calves off milk.
Ruminants require quality fibre in the diet to maximise production and maintain health by sustaining a stable environment within the rumen. If the calves you are rearing are to achieve maximum production from pasture, then the importance of setting the rumen up for life with quality fibre early cannot be over-emphasised.
From three of four days of age, fresh water should be offered to all calves.
However, ideally water should be made available to calves from birth.
Water should be available ad lib.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40232357.html,2021-02-23 15:22:00,Beef cattle prices stabilise in line with year-on-year supply  reduction,"Beef prices at factories have stabilised at the reduced levels generally paid in recent weeks.
Strong resistance by finishers to price cuts was felt by processors trying to source cattle, resulting in an easing off in their drive to cut prices further.
Although there was a week-on-week increase in the cattle intake last week, it was still about 6,000 head per week behind the corresponding weeks in 2020, which could become a concern for processors, if market demand recovers and supply remains tight.
Demand in the UK had steadied, and Irish processors are trying to assess the likely full impact of the new post-Brexit market environment.
With farming leaders having strongly reacted to the beef cattle price cuts which left their members under pressure to secure a reasonable profit margin from winter finishing, processors will also be careful not to allow price resistance to overheat, because of the possible consequences.
Taking all these trends into account, it is understandable that processors have settled on stabilising base prices at last week’s level, for the moment.
For the most part, a base price of 370c/kg is offered for steers.
It is difficult to secure more, but quality assurance, and the breed bonus for Hereford and Angus crosses, can add a sizeable price benefit.
Rumours that the breed bonus payments for Angus and Hereford were under pressure have been strongly refuted, as “scaremongering” by finishers and sources close to the breed schemes.
Up to 1,000 Hereford Prime cattle per week are being processed at factories, a great success for the breed, delivering benefits for finishers.
The base for heifers is being quoted at 370c-375c/kg, with most lots understood to be moving at the higher level.
Prices for young bulls are unchanged this week, with Rs at 360c/kg.
The young bull intake is being controlled at levels sufficient to meet market requirements.
The trade for cows is also similar to last week, with good interest at factories in getting supplies.
Better quality R-grade cows are making 330c/kg with O-grade ranging from 300c to 315c/kg, and P-grade from 290c/kg.
The beef intake for last week was 33,236 head, with all categories well down on the same week last year.
There were 10,810 steers, 9,236 heifers, 3,624 young bulls, and 6,334 cows in the intake.
Live cattle exports in 2021 have started off slowly, back by 14% for the first five weeks, compared to 12 months ago, with only 9,084 head exported, of which 61% went to Northern Ireland.
The trade to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly, at up to 1,566 head per week, mostly calves and store cattle for further feeding.
The intra-EU trade of Irish dairy calves is expected to pick up as the calving season gathers momentum."

And whatever about the Taoiseach's promises on Tuesday evening that the ""end is now truly in sight"" with regards to Covid, the marts have certainly shown great resilience throughout the whole lockdown saga.
Department of Agriculture figures show mart throughput during this time of lockdown is almost on a par with this time last year, when we were as free as the wind. Just ever so slightly down, with cattle numbers for Jan/Feb 2021 hitting 95.5% of 2020 levels.
And with prices also holding firm, it seems it would take a lot more than just some old pandemic to rock the livestock boat.
At Skibbereen Mart last Friday, this Hereford bull calf (22 days old) sold for €415.
Numbers were up at Macroom mart on Saturday with prices remaining firm. Dry cows in Macroom sold from €20 to €510 over the kilo. Friesian bullocks made from €1.60/kg to €1.85/kg. Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks in Macroom sold from between €1.95kg to €2.25/kg. Continental bullocks sold from €2.10/kg to €2.35/kg.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/food/arid-40231409.html,2021-02-26 18:00:00,Wine with Leslie: French wines to enjoy with a croque monsieur,"A recent spate of watching French movies and TV ( Spiral, Lupin, Call My Agent, Une Fille Facile etc.) sent me into my samples corner this week to see what I could find from la Belle France. In addition, Lidl have their annual ‘Taste of France’ promotion in store this week and I’ll be stocking up on Normandy Cider, Saucisson Sec, Breton Butter Biscuits and of course my guilty pleasure — Croque Monsieur sandwiches.
The Croque Monsieur is admittedly best consumed in a dive bar with a bottle of Stella Artois and a Pernod chaser but it seems unlikely I’ll get to do that this year. France is easily the country I’ve spent the most time in besides Ireland and 2020 was the first year I didn’t get to visit since around 1993 — I miss it.
While there is little good to be said about Brexit, a small positive is that it will draw Ireland closer to France with more ferry crossings already in operation and hopefully more opportunities for Ireland’s produce to sell there and vice versa — there is no doubt the French will appreciate our better produce far more than our nearest neighbour ever did.
I think what I love most about France is that my rather obsessive food and drink-focused life is considered perfectly normal there. I love its huge diversity of wine styles and its pursuit of perfection in all areas of gastronomy. The Appellation d’Origine Protégée (formerly ‘Controlée) system covers not just wine and cheese but also chickens, prunes (Agen), lentils (du Puy) and even chilli powder (the wonderful Piment d’Espelette from the French Basque country).
Of course, the AOP system is by no means perfect and more a guarantee of typicité than of quality but it is still miles ahead of any similar system and of huge benefit to rural France where a tiny region can gain fame for a cheese (there are more than 400), an eau de vie or a white pudding (Boudin de Rethel) made by only a dozen or so producers. We should be aggressively pursuing similar IGPs (Indication of Geographic Protection) for Ireland — Cork needs an IGP for spiced beef, drisheen and maybe even things like buttered eggs.
Selections this week are all from France and are a mixum-gatherum of wines —about 20 of which I tasted over the past fortnight. I think only the Dunnes Daronton Ventoux has appeared before and that was a from a different vintage. Bon Appétit et Vive la France!
Wine Under €15
Jean Cornelius Riesling, Alsace, France — €9.99
Jean Cornelius Riesling, Alsace, France — €9.99
Stockist: Lidl
Alsace is the only French region where Riesling is permitted in an AOP wine and thank goodness as it loves the Alsace climate. The best Alsace Riesling from producers such as Trimbach or Zind Humbrecht are among the best white wines in France. Entry-level but with typicité, this has lively apple and pear fruits and good balancing acidity with lingering tart apples on the finish.
La Roche d’Argent, Saint Émilion 2018, Bordeaux — €12.99
La Roche d’Argent, Saint Émilion 2018, Bordeaux — €12.99
Stockist: Lidl
This is my pick of the Bordeaux in the Lidl French promotion, still a bit young but from a ripe year so drinking well now. Dark red-purple in colour, dark plum aromas with some violet hints, full and concentrated on the palate with crunchy textures and ripe black fruits. This will soften a little over the next five years.
Terroir Daronton Ventoux 2019, Rhône, France — €12.50
Terroir Daronton Ventoux 2019, Rhône, France — €12.50
Stockist: Dunnes Stores
From the Rhonéa Cooperative, which has 236 growers in the Dentelles de Montmarail mountains (geographically Provence but classified as Southern Rhône). Made in a deliberately fruit-driven style, this is packed with red and black fruits with noticeable spice notes — fruit-driven palate with a bit of grip and structure thanks to its youth, but very drinkable and suited to rich casseroles or a mid-week pizza.
Wines Over €15
Puech Morny 2019 Gigondas, France — €16.99
Puech Morny 2019 Gigondas, France — €16.99
Stockist: Lidl
Gigondas is a half-hour drive north-east from Châteauneuf-du-Pape and good examples have similar weight and power (if perhaps a little less elegance) than the best wines of its more famous neighbour. This pours a rich purple-red with aromas of dark cherry and blackberry and is fruity and supple with good creamy concentration and richness. Lingering spicy red fruits on the finish and a solid example of Gigondas, a wine that generally costs at least €22.
Kuentz Bas Mosaïk, Alsace, France — €16.69
Kuentz Bas Mosaïk, Alsace, France — €16.69
Stockist: O’Briens
We associate Alsace with varietal wines but there is a long tradition of blends, often field blends from the same vineyard. This is made from 30% Sylvaner, 20% Pinot Blanc, 15% Pinot Gris, 15% Muscat, 10% Gewüztraminer and 5% Chasselas and, as you would expect, floral Gewüztraminer is detectable on the nose but also pear confit — textured and almost lush on the palate but with balancing acidity. This matched a Tartiflette perfectly.
Château Crabitey Graves 2019, Bordeaux, France — €24
Château Crabitey Graves 2019, Bordeaux, France — €24
Stockist: Whelehans Wines Whelehanswines.ie
White Bordeaux is often rather overlooked and although it represents just 10% of the wines of the region, it can offer excellent value and quality at all price levels and ages beautifully. A blend of 70% Sauvignon and 30% Sémillon, this has stony citrus and apple aromas that follow through on the palate with the Sémillon flavours rounding out the mid-palate and adding complexity and length. The red version is also recommended.
Spirit of the week
Bertha’s Revenge Navy Strength Gin - 57.1% ABV, 50cl — €42
Bertha’s Revenge Navy Strength Gin - 57.1% ABV, 50cl — €42
Stockists: Via Ballyvolane’s website: shop.ballyvolanespirits.ie, Celtic Whiskey, Ardkeen, Mitchells, Castle, Bradleys.
Bertha’s Revenge has been a deserved success for Justin Green of Ballyvolane House and his business partner, Anthony Jackson. The punchy cumin and juniper flavours make a perfect G&T and an excellent Gimlet or Tom Colilns. This brand new Navy Strength version might be even better.
Despite the ABV this is remarkably smooth with spice, juniper and floral aromas, characterful citrus, cumin and clove on the palate with a bonus cream and butter texture; a full tongue-tingling spice and herbal hit on the mid-palate, and a long finish.
Try a Bertha Gimlet: 60ml Gin, 30ml lime juice, 20ml 'simple syrup' shaken over ice.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40234298.html,2021-03-01 08:58:00,"Rooftop solar worth €1,249 a year on average Irish dairy farm","ICOS says dairy farms can earn between €208 and €2,773 per annum, from selling electricity to the national grid, when the Micro-Generation Support Scheme goes ahead.
And they will potentially save €843 to €2,341 per annum off their farm energy bills.
The projections identify a return on investment occurring between 2.9 to 13.3 years, depending on the scale of dairying platform, and the scale of solar installation, which is usually affixed to outbuildings, and/or installed on underused areas around the immediate farm buildings.
ICOS also saw significant potential for many beef and tillage farms, if the currently proposed scheme’s limit of selling 30% of the excess electricity they produce back to the grid is raised.
ICOS, the policy and representative body for co-ops, including milk processors and marts, made the projections in its submission to the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications consultation on the Micro-Generation Support Scheme.
The ICOS projections assume investment costs ranging from €3,900 for a 3 kilowatts (kW) solar panel array to €52,000 for a 40kW array.
TAMS (Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme) grants may be available for arrays ranging from 3 kW to 11kW.
Irish dairy farms have an average herd size of 90 cows, for which ICOS said an array under 11kW makes a lot of sense, because the additional cost of battery storage is not incurred, and there may be TAMS grant aid, plus capital allowances.
Installing a 11kW array on a typical 120-cow dairy farm will save the farmer €1,124 in farm energy costs, and the farmer can receive an annual income of €763 from exported energy (30%) at 8c/kWh, according to the co-ops organisation’s calculations.
The expected return on investment payback period is 7.6 years, which may be reduced through availing of TAMS grant aid and capital allowances which can be offset against income tax.
ICOS said installing a 6kW array on a typical 90-cow dairy farm will save the farmer €843 in energy bills, and will earn €416 per year from exported energy, at 8c/kWh.
The expected return on investment payback period is 6.2 years, which may be reduced through TAMS grant aid and capital allowances.
Installing a 15kW array on a typical 250-cow dairy farm will save the farmer €2,341 in farm energy costs, and the farmer can receive an annual income of €1,040 from exported energy (30%) at 8c/kWh.
It is not eligible for TAMS grant aid, but the expected return on investment payback period of 5.8 years may be reduced by capital allowances.
ICOS said energy consumption on a considerable number of dairy farms is high enough to warrant an array of up to 30kW, possibly even 50kW for larger dairy farms, if availing of the feed-in tariff for selling to the grid.
Three key factors are seen by ICOS to make Irish dairy farms a perfect fit for solar microgeneration:
n Significant amounts of roof space available, allowing installation of solar panels with minimal visual and environmental impact.
n Most farm energy consumption taking place during daylight hours in the summer months.
n  And considerable potential to mitigate farm carbon emissions, to help Ireland reach renewable energy targets.
Hence, ICOS has welcomed the Government’s proposed Micro-generation Support Scheme, but suggests a few minor proposal changes, and additional supports.
ICOS legal and development executive Darragh Walshe said co-ops can support their members and dairy farmers by co-ordinating cost-effective financing schemes.
He added: “We believe that a specific renewable energy infrastructure grant should be set up for agricultural holdings to promote farm-based solar generation.
“Funding for this would ideally come from the Just Transition Fund or National Recovery Fund, which prioritises investment in renewable energy.”
Without such grants, the expense of medium to large-sized solar panel installations and renewable energy technologies is out of reach for the average farmer, earning only 40% of the average industrial wage in Ireland, according to ICOS.
Therefore, there is only a low level of investment in solar energy on farms at the moment, by farmers who subsidised the cost with TAMS II grants and use of capital allowances.
But solar arrays over 11kW are not covered by TAMS.
The consultation document categorises agriculture in 0-11kW capacity bands, but ICOS opposes this restriction for farmers whose energy consumption gives a basis for larger installations.
ICOS acknowledges that getting larger capacity from farms to the national grid will present infrastructural challenges, but says a network of power generators dispersed on farms in rural Ireland offers energy security and a rural economic boost.
ICOS also commented on the proposal for occupied buildings to achieve a minimum post-works BER C rating, saying it should be tweaked to only apply to residences and not to agricultural or SME connections with adjacent residential buildings accounting for only minimal shares of total energy consumption.
ICOS welcomes SEAI, government, and Irish Aviation Authority moves to amend restrictions on rooftop solar panels, currently set at 50 square metres or 50% of roof area. Removing these planning barriers for mid-sized installation will increase opportunities for farm level power generation.
Mr Walshe said autonomous, democratic, member-led co-ops rooted in their communities, with a long track record of sustainably providing goods and services, are the ideal delivery vehicle for all types of community energy generation projects.ICOS is keen to engage on this with the Environment, Climate and Communications Department, and with the SEAI.
Later this year, farmers, businesses, individuals and community groups can generate their own renewable electricity, through means such as solar panels on rooftops, and receive payment when they sell excess energy into the grid.
Micro-hydro, micro-wind, and micro-renewable combined heat and power with output of up to 50kW, designed to primarily service the self-consumption needs of the property where they are installed, will also be in the Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS), the first such support scheme in Ireland, with a route to market for selling excess power into the national grid at a fair price.
The Government says the MSS must protect customers, protect vulnerable customers, and be accessible to all electricity customers.
Remuneration for exported electricity is seen as a small additional benefit rather than a revenue-generating opportunity, with the main benefit being savings by reducing power bills
“By producing and selling their own electricity, citizens, farmers, business owners and community organisations can save on their energy costs and reduce their carbon footprint,” said Environment, Climate and Communications Minister Eamon Ryan.
It has been estimated that about 10% of the country’s electricity needs could be met if every household had two rooftop solar panels.

Glanbia Co-op to give up four plc board seats"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40236617.html,2021-03-02 14:25:00,Up to 140 extra vets will be needed from April 1 to certify beef exports to UK,"There is further slight recovery from the recent decline in beef cattle prices at factories.
However, quoted prices continue to fall short of what finishers were paid a month ago, and profit margins for winter finishers remain squeezed.
The intake at processing plants continues to fall well short of 2020 levels.
For January and February, intake is down by 30,000 head, compared to 2020.
The Bord Bia prediction for the year is that the supply of beef cattle will be at least down by 60,000 head.
With the full impact of Brexit on the trade with Britain still very unclear, the expected drop in supplies should help finishers, by strengthening the market for finished cattle.
Another phase of the new regulations for export of beef to the UK will come into effect at the end of this month, adding further to the costs of exports.
The additional herd health certification required from April 1 is seen as as a big challenge for the export trade to handle.
The Department of Agriculture estimates that an additional 130-140 vets will be required to handle the extra workload, and sourcing sufficient personnel could be a challenge.
Therefore, disruption at a normal peak point of the spring beef season cannot be completely ruled out.
For the current week, prime beef prices appear to have improved by at least 5c/kg, recovering some of the price decline since January.
However, the usual 5c-10c/kg premium for heifers over the steer price has been wiped out, with a similar price base for both steers and heifers quoted this week.
Steer prices are generally being quoted at 375c/kg.
Most of the intake for this week is going through at that level, but with a few reports of up to 380c/kg being secured.
Heifer prices are generally also at 375c/kg, but with sellers of some lots securing up to 380c/kg, and it is difficult to get above that.
Prices on offer for young bulls has come to within 5c/kg of the steer and heifer prices, at 370c/kg on offer for R-grade young bulls this week.
Cow prices are also slightly stronger, with Rs making up to 340c/kg.
Intake at the factories last week was 33,666 head, made up of 10,988 steers, 9,362 heifers, 2.869 young bulls, and 6,701 cows.
Bord Bia says live cattle exports picked up in mid-February, despite bad weather for travel by sea.
The movement of cattle to Northern Ireland has continued to perform strongly into 2021, and is expected to remain strong, as cattle prices are higher in the North.
For the first six weeks of 2021, live exports of cattle were back by only 1% compared to the same period 12 months ago, with 14,059 head of cattle exported out of Ireland, of which 50% went to Northern Ireland.
The intra-EU trade of Irish dairy calves has started to pick up, with weather conditions improved for shipping."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40238885.html,2021-03-06 17:23:00,CSO corrects 2020 farm income gain estimate from 14% to 5.4%,"After the Central Statistics Office’s advance estimate in early December predicted the increase in farm income in 2020 at 14%, farmers could have been excused for splashing out on Christmas spending.
Unfortunately, it was only an advance estimate, and when the preliminary estimate was published last week, the CSO had revised the increase in farm income in 2020 back to only 5.4%.
With extra information available for the latest estimate, the CSO cut back their farm output figure for 2020 from €8,387,000 to €8,229,000. They only shaved €10m off the estimate for farm inputs, but their latest figure for net subsidies paid to farmers has been reined back €100m since December.
It all goes to show how difficult it is to predict farm income, or even to measure it with the benefit of hindsight.
So we can certainly forgive the Teagasc economists who took a very early shot last May at predicting the impact of Covid-19 on farm income.
With nearly seven months of the year still to go, their forecast was that income could drop by as much as 50%, but by at least 22%, and that incomes on beef farms would be hardest hit.
Thankfully, the economists were well wide of the mark, as the latest CSO figures show.
By August, in their mid-year outlook for 2020, the Teagasc experts  were able to confirm that fears of a sharp Covid-19 related drop in Irish farm incomes in 2020 were averted, following a gradual recovery in commodity prices and the provision of additional supports to the sector
By December, they estimated that the average family farm income in Ireland increased by 6% in 2020. Now, two months into 2021, the CSO has confirmed the accuracy of that Teagasc figure.
In December, the Teagasc experts acknowledged the concerns early in 2020 that Covid-19 restrictions around the world would hinder food trade, and lead to a reduction in global food demand.
“However, the actual impact of the agri-food sector was minimal,” they said in their December report, the Teagasc Outlook 2021, Economic Prospects for Agriculture. Due to the pandemic, food consumption outside the home has fallen substantially, but this has been largely offset by increased consumption at home. Internationally, agri-food trade proved quite resilient in spite of the restrictions,” confirmed the Teagasc team.
They said key drivers of the estimated 6% income were a reduction in animal feed, fertiliser and fuel prices, along with additional subsidy supports for cattle farmers to alleviate the negative effects of Covid-19 on the beef market.
It is interesting that, between December and February, statisticians at the CSO have subtracted €200m from the value of cattle sold in 2020, while adding about €11m for sheep.
The cattle overestimate comes as a surprise, because market reports for December indicated a high level of pre-Brexit exports in December to build beef stockpiles in the UK.
However, the sheep underestimate can be at least partly explained by the lamb trade strengthening through December.
The lower figure for cattle sales in 2020 was reflected all the way through to the CSO’s bottom-line figure for 2020 entrepreneurial income, estimated at €3,095,600 in early December, but only €2,834,700 last week.
It’s hard enough to predict or measure farm incomes in the year of Covid-19 and Brexit, without a €200m correction for cattle sales.
It will be high summer before the Central Statistics Office arrives at its final estimate  of 2020 output, input, and income in Irish agriculture

Also among the 18 shortlisted entrants are FRS Network, Glanbia and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.
Every three years, the awards present “Oscars” for innovation in co-operative industries, marking outstanding innovation and excellence in the agri-food, fishery and forestry sectors.
Dairygold’s sustainability bonus payment is focused on improving herd health and productivity, through promotion and facilitation of milk recording, and encouraging farmers to participate in herd health programmes.
These actions help to reduce milk suppliers’ usage of antibiotics, avoid the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and reduce veterinary costs, as well as increasing milk yields and quality.
FRS Network is a finalist for its member benefit scheme which offers skilled labour at a subsidised cost in the event of an accident or sickness of the main family farm operator, to ensure the farm business can continue to operate effectively.
Glanbia has been shortlisted for its Twenty20 Beef Club model for dairy calf-to-beef production, which combines a guaranteed market and premium pricing, with a technical support programme, and advanced payment options to assist farmers with cashflow.
It is also designed to reduce the carbon footprint of dairy and beef production 20%, and to ensure the highest quality animal welfare standards.
The National Federation of Group Water Schemes is a finalist for their source protection pilot project.
The project involves examination of water quality, working with farmers and the wider public to raise awareness of water source protection, and the impact of pesticides on water and biodiversity.
As a result, farmers are embracing the weed-wiping method of pesticide use, some farm families have installed beehives.
Various education and awareness initiatives have captured public imagination, with school children and community groups planting over 8,500 trees and installing bee hotels.
Jerry Long, president of ICOS, representing Irish co-ops, said: “Innovative strategies and programmes help to foster sustainability and viability, which is essential in dealing with the challenges and opportunities facing co-operatives today and into the future.
“To have four Irish co-operatives shortlisted for these flagship awards, among the top co-operatives from across Europe, highlights the quality of Irish co-operative innovation and delivery in the interests of their members.”
The winners of the awards will be selected by a panel including European Parliament agriculture committee chairman Norbert Lins and Maria Angeles Benitez Salas, deputy director general of the European Commission’s Directorate for Agriculture and Rural Development.
The winners will be announced in early summer.

To help make this plan a reality, they turned to their local credit union and applied for a Cultivate loan.
Cultivate is an initiative created by a group of 26 credit unions to provide short to medium-term loan finance built specifically around the growing needs of Irish farmers. In these uncertain times, Cultivate is a farmer-friendly finance option for farmers seeking unsecured funding up to €50,000 over seven years.  Given the uncertainty with beef and tillage prices, the Cogan family felt a move into dairy was their best option especially with the next generation coming through and the growth in demand in the dairy industry.
With Robert, a young farmer who is progressive and ambitious involved, they decided to invest in a meal bin and a slurry tank while also making improvements to their existing milking parlour.
To support some of these activities, Maurice and John turned to their local credit union and availed of a Cultivate loan. The application process for Maurice and Robert worked really well; in their own words “From start to finish, the whole process was very straight forward. We wouldn’t be where we are today without the help of the Cultivate loan”.
Finance from people who understand farming
Equally as important for Robert was the level of understanding and support available at his local credit union in relation to the needs of their business “The ambition is to farm into the future by increasing the size of the herd and continually investing and improving the facilities on the farm. Moving to dairy requires a very big investment. The credit union understood our business and our needs”. With the help of the Cultivate loan, in June 2020 Maurice and Robert fully transitioned into dairy farming. They are now milking 49 cows and have ambitions to grow their herd significantly in the coming months and years ahead.
Dairy Farmer, Robert Cogan
Having gone through the full process of applying and securing a Cultivate loan, Maurice’s words of advice reflect a very positive experience: “I would highly recommend that farmers wanting to make improvements to their farm consider applying for a Cultivate loan”.
Unsecured loans 
As a farmer-friendly finance option, loan repayment schedules are available up to a period of seven years, with the flexibility to repay at times that make sense for the individual farmer. Cultivate loans are unsecured, and there is no need to be an existing credit union member to avail of a loan.  Farmers can sign up in their local participating credit union office and be eligible to apply for a Cultivate loan immediately.
Maurice Cogan and his son Robert
Cultivate loans are used by farmers like Maurice and Robert Cogan for a wide range of investments including:
Stocking or working capital 
Upgrading farm buildings and facilities
Purchasing new or second-hand machinery
Undertaking farm improvement works such as fencing and reclamation.
Cultivate loans are offered by 26 credit unions in Ireland. A full list of participating credit unions is available at www.cultivate-cu.ie/#map
Normal life may be on hold, but farming life continues. Like farmers, credit unions are here for the long haul. If you need a flexible farmer-friendly loan, call FREEPHONE 1800 839 999, pop into your participating local credit union today, or visit Cultivate-CU.ie to learn more.
Loans are subject to approval. Terms and conditions apply. If you do not meet the repayments on your loan, your account will go into arrears.
This may affect your credit rating which may limit your ability to access credit in the future. The cost of your repayments may increase. Credit unions in Ireland are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40241003.html,2021-03-09 17:39:00,Euro falls to 86p but beef finishers still wait for price improvements,"Beef processors seem anxious to take in cattle this week, but continue to resist finishers’ demands for a lift in prices.
Anger is increasing among finishers, because rising cattle prices in the export markets for Irish beef are not being reflected in the local beef trade. Cattle prices in Britain (€4.42) and Northern Ireland (€4.38/kg) advanced in recent weeks, widening the gap with the Irish prices.
At the same time, farmers are not benefiting from the sterling-euro exchange rate trend which has benefited processors over the past two weeks. The euro was equivalent to only about 86p (sterling) this week, compared to about 92p in mid-December.
The only consolation for beef finishers is that processors did not succeed in bedding in their price cuts over the past month; instead, most of the lost ground was recovered over the past forthnight for finishers with cattle to sell.
Finishers will keep the pressure on processors to continue that recovery, ahead of export plants looking to source extra finished cattle to satisfy higher retail demand at Easter (April 4).
The intake of cattle at export plants showed a slight increase last week, while remaining more than 5,000 head per week behind the level of 12 months ago (down about 10% this year).
The base price for steers is steady at 375 cents/kg.
Finishers are refusing to part with their livestock for less, but processors are resisting pressure for higher returns, with any reports of up to 380 cents/kg being secured few and far between, and even rarer in the southern counties.
Prices for heifers generally trade at 5 cents/kg above steer prices, with a general base of 380 cents/kg, and occasional lots making up to 385 cents/kg.
For the most part, prices for young bulls are set at 5 cents/kg less than steer prices, on a base of 370 cents/kg for R-grade. However, prices for younger bulls match prices for steer prices, with 375 cents/kg on offer for under-16 months R- grade bulls.
In general, the intake of young bulls continues at relatively low levels.
The cow trade remains strong, and the prices are stable. Better quality R-grade cows continue to trade at up to 330 cents/kg in general, and there are some reports of up to 340 cents/kg being paid to regular suppliers.
Up to 320 cents/kg is being paid for O-grade cows, and the better P-grade cows are making up to 300 cents/kg.
Intake at factories for last week reached 34,932 head, which included 11,667 steers, 9,532 heifers, 2,654 young bulls, and 6,070 cows.
Each of the categories is down compared to the same week last year, and the year-to-date total intake is now running at 35,400 less than for 2020.
In live exports, the intra-EU trade of Irish dairy calves picked up in the first week of March, with nearly 6,000 calves exported to continental Europe, but that left 2021 calf exports still 27% behind the 2020 level, mainly because live exports in February were hampered by rough seas."

You keep your stock indoors all winter long and just as the birdies start singing and trees start budding you decide to give the old boys their first taste of freedom, and as soon as you do, what comes down only the rain!
God must have a sense of humour, or else he's just mad at us for not going to mass in almost a year. Either way, as I write on this wet and miserable evening there's little sign of spring. This week, marts are all signalling that grass men are out in force buying cattle. Well the grass men must be wearing oilskins today. And the cattle must be looking at the wet grass with the same distain that I'd look at a flat pint.
Anyway, confusing and all as our climate has become, we will head to the marts where prices remain as firm as our resolve to carry on regardless.
At Macroom Mart last Saturday, this Charolais weanling bull of 340kg sold for €790.
Macroom mart on Saturday had an impressive display of cattle on offer. The mart looked full to me as I stared across the pens from a nice vantage point I found.
It looked like something from a John Wayne movie with heads of cattle peering up from all corners. There is nothing like seeing a mart going at full throttle to brighten a man's day. The sooner we get back to the good old days of open doors for all the better. It's good for the soul.
In Macroom on Saturday dry cows sold from €40 to €570 with the kilo.
Friesian bullocks made from €1.60/kg to €1.90/kg. Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks in Macroom sold from between €2.10/kg to €2.75/kg. Continental bullocks sold from €2.20/kg €2.45/kg.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40241717.html,2021-03-10 15:15:00,IFA rejects claims that beef farmers receive 80% sales revenue,"IFA has rejected claims by Meat Industry Ireland (MII) that beef farmers receive 80% of total sales revenue earned by processors.
The meat industry made the claims based on the findings of a comprehensive evaluation of the sector in an independent report by Grant Thornton which was presented to members of the Beef Task Force earlier this week.
MII also insists that false claims, made during the 2019 beef blockades, have been exposed and highlighted how the need for current procurement specifications is driven by market and customer demand.
The report was commissioned by the Government in the aftermath of the unrest within the sector in 2019, which MII says “crippled the industry for almost eight weeks and seriously undermined the sector’s reputation with international customers"". 
“During those blockades, false assertions were made and prominently circulated that farmers only get €2 for every €10 spent on beef by a consumer,” said MII Director, Cormac Healy.
“We welcome the Grant Thornton exercise as it provides independent expert confirmation that farmers receive 80% of the sales revenue processors generate from the sale of beef.
“We hope that the sector can now move on and instead work together to address the challenges we face from issues like Brexit, climate change and EU Trade deals.
“MII members also welcome the appointment of a Food Ombudsman to act as an ‘honest broker’ in addressing concerns in future through dialogue rather than factory blockades.” 
The Director went on to say that the industry continues to deliver market price returns to producers that are at or above the Export Benchmark price - introduced as part of the Beef Sector Agreement - which reflects the cattle prices paid in Ireland’s key export markets.
“In 2020, despite the major market disruption caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Bord Bia reported Irish prime cattle price was 356c/kg (VAT excl.) and the Export Benchmark price was 355c/kg,” he added.
“These prices were paid even though we export 90% of our beef and face the additional costs of getting to market, which have been further inflated since Brexit.” 
Meanwhile, IFA President, Tim Cullinan asserted that, despite the claims of MII, “Grant Thornton admitted to the Beef Task Force yesterday that it doesn’t have the authority to access the information needed for a full and independent appraisal of the value of beef at all points in the supply chain”.
He said that at Tuesday night’s IFA beef meeting - which was attended by 250 farmers - it was highlighted how the Irish price is now 13c behind the Bord Bia Prime Export Benchmark price.
“Beef prices must push on and reflect the reality of the marketplace,” added Mr Cullinan.
“Minister McConalogue outlined the importance of greater transparency in the supply chain; he must now come forward with the primary legislation, that allows the Office of the Food Ombudsman or Regulator, to source and provide this information independently.”"

Actually it's three kits in one — alongside the usual excellent burger kit there’s a Bujo Breakfast (containing signature breakfast sandwiches of: Luke Bogue’s Rarebreed Hampshire pork sausage patty; Beechwood Smoked maple bacon; Margaret’s egg; Coghlan’s Artisan Bakers BuJo brioche, and Innocent orange juice) and a Bujo Brownie kit (Coolhull Farm chocolate brownie; Salted caramel & blueberry coulis), all available for nationwide delivery (one day only, March 19), €55 plus €7 delivery charge. (Optional extra of Wicklow Wolf Irish craft beers.) www.bujo.ie
Irish coffee? Yes, please!  
The Irish Coffee was by all accounts created in winter of 1943 by Joe Sheridan, head chef at Foynes airbase near Limerick, and The Menu — on foot of a tour to the Foynes heritage centre in 2019, and, following a fascinating and extensive tour of one of the flying planes — reckons he’d have required at least half a gallon of the stuff to ever take off in such a bockety contraption. And were he to treat himself to a fine exemplar of the globally-renowned hot cocktail, then Vice Coffee’s new limited edition Irish Coffee Kit sounds just the ticket, featuring as it does Teeling’s Whiskey and Gary Grant’s superb Imbibe coffee (a single-origin Colombian), all sweetened with a Demerara syrup. Pre-batched in a 500ml bottle priced €22.50, with Georgian Irish coffee glasses available as optional extras. Free delivery nationwide. www.vicecoffeeinc.com
More whiskey?
Teeling’s Distillery, in Dublin, creators of some of The Menu’s favourite whiskey experiences, have a pair of Patrick's Day packages for sale in their online shop for a limited time only. The hamper includes flagship Teeling Small Batch, Teeling’s pineapple canned cocktail, Teeling’s beer collab with local craft brewer Dot Brew, Teeling’s Paddy’s Day T-shirt and Paddy cap.

TODAY’S SPECIAL
Healthy sugar alternative Homespun Chicory Root Syrup caters for the sweet tooth while keeping a tight lid on blood sugar levels
It is hard to believe such a delicious syrup might wind up in the health food bracket, but Erica Sheehan's Homespun Chicory Root Syrup offers a most pleasing sweetness and a honey-like viscosity that suggests all manner of saccharine sins — yet contains just 14g of sugar per 100g. (Honey is around 80g sugar per 100g).
Now, The Menu would never spurn premium Irish honey for reasons of sugar content alone for the complexity of good honey’s flavours and its other myriad health benefits will never be eclipsed. But, for those seeking a source of sweetness that is proven not to spike blood sugar levels, Homespun Chicory Root Syrup makes for an astonishingly pleasurable alternative, a gentle, balanced syrup with a delicious caramel finish. What’s more, chicory is a rich source of inulin, a natural prebiotic fibre, most beneficial for digestion, gut health, and the reduction of inflammation. The Menu enjoyed it recently, drizzled on exquisite Velvet Cloud sheep’s milk yoghurt, served with toasted hazelnuts and chopped apple for a most delicious breakfast.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40243184.html,2021-03-13 17:00:00,Will faraway fields be greener across Irish (or North) Sea?,"Hemmed in by the demands of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, and ever more so by national and EU sustainability policies, farmers have much less freedom in how to run their businesses than many non-farmers realise.
Across the water, farmers got their chance in 2016 to break clear of the chains, in the UK’s Brexit vote, and many said yes.
In the coming years, Irish farmers will be casting their eyes across the Irish Sea to see what farming life looks like outside the EU, and if the faraway fields are indeed greener.
The UK experiment will in fact hold many lessons for EU farmers, because the ultimate objectives are similar.
The UK farming plan to contribute to the net zero carbon economy of the future, to protect and restore the environment, improve animal health and welfare on the land, help farm businesses become more profitable and sustainable, support confidence in UK food internationally, prevent environmental harm, and protect biosecurity and animal health and welfare, is in fact a carbon copy of the European Green Deal which increasingly directs the course of European farming.
The British will hope to achieve these objectives faster, now that they have shaken off what they see as an overly-bureaucratic CAP.
Irish farmers will have a ringside seat to watch how they get on.
Across the North Sea, Dutch farmers will also watch closely, perhaps with even greater interest, because the farmers of the Netherlands are very mobile, and have for centuries been moving to other countries or even other continents to pursue farming in more favourable locations.
There’s a new wave of Dutch farmer emigration currently, to destinations such as Germany, Denmark or Canada, because of their home country’s increasingly tough rules on agricultural pollution and emissions.
Land prices in the Netherlands are among the highest in Europe, another factor behind emigration of Dutch farmers. Only 100 left between 2010 and 2015, according to the Dutch Statistical Office, CBS. But emigration is thought to have increased to about 75 farmers per year since 2015.
Dozens of farmers in North Brabant, a Dutch border region where pig and chicken farms are concentrated, are moving to Belgium, according to local media, profiting from Belgium’s looser rules limiting the size of factory farms.
In future years, they may turn their eyes towards farming in the UK, but the UK’s stated drive towards sustainability is unlikely to make things easy for the Dutch, who are more orientated towards intensive farming.
So the eyes of rural Europe will be on the UK, where Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs George Eustice (they don’t have an agriculture minister) welcomed the post-Brexit freedom to “make our own laws again and to chart a new direction for agriculture policy”, and said the centrepiece of future UK farm policy will be the Sustainable Farming Incentive for approaches to farm husbandry that help the environment, such as integrated pest management, and actions to improve soil health or water quality.
New payments will be for farming more sustainably, creating space for nature on the land, enhancing animal health and welfare, and reducing carbon emissions.
Of course, the biggest change will be phasing out the EU legacy of direct payments, over seven years.
Eustice has acknowledged that overnight removal of payments would be too much, instead there will be some time for businesses and land renters to adjust to the changing market.
Eustice has said: “Rather than masking poor profitability with a subsidy, we should address the causes of poor profitability. Too many farmers find themselves in the position of being price takers with powerful processors or other purchasers pushing all of the risk down to the farmer.
“The Agriculture Act gives us new powers to create statutory codes and introduce other regulation to bring transparency and fairness in the supply chain.
“Now we will start with a statutory code in the dairy sector, but also intend to use these powers to bring fairness and market transparency in other sectors.”
He could have been talking about the Irish beef sector, in which farmers depend heavily on EU subsidies rather than prices paid by beef processors, to survive.
There are similar situations in the UK, with Eustice saying it is clear that imbalances of power within the supply chain have caused instability for dairy farmers, with milk buyers setting and then modifying at short notice the terms of contracts with farmers.
The Minister said it is unacceptable, and plans to strengthen the position of farmers in the supply chain and to bring transparency and fairness (maybe he should use Ireland’s successful co-operative system to protect dairy farmers).
Irish farmers will be able to see how strengthening the position of UK farmers in the supply chain goes, compared to the work of the Food Ombudsman to be set up here as part of our compliance with the EU’s Unfair Trading Practices Directive.
There will be those in the UK for whom farming changes will be too much to handle, and for them, Eustice has promised exit schemes to help farmers to retire with dignity, alongside schemes to support new entrants.
Irish farmers have been crying out for such an initiative.
The UK will also have Local Nature Recovery and Landscape Recovery schemes. Interestingly, it seems to be behind Ireland in protecting hedgerows, which Eustice says UK farmers have been under pressure to dig up.
Just as in the EU, top-down management of farming will inevitably bring bureaucracy. However, a promising start has been made, with the EU’s “greening” switched off (Eustice says it achieved nothing for the environment but caused huge bureaucracy).
The three-crop rule is gone, along with rules such as maximum width of a gateway, and guidance on the definition of fallow land.
Scheme deadlines and penalties have been loosened, and there will be more warnings and “improvement notices” rather than penalties for every minor scheme error.
The guidance accompanying this year’s BPS scheme has been slashed from 120 pages to just 50 pages.
In contrast, the Terms and Conditions and Guide to 2021 Basic Payment Scheme, Greening and other Area Based Schemes sent to Irish farmers in February is still 105 pages.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40243151.html,2021-03-14 12:00:00,EU cattle herd growth unrealistic - USDA,"The EU dairy herd is shrinking (except for Ireland) because of increasing efficiency, while the EU beef herd is shrinking (except for Central Europe) due to unprofitability, according to US Department of Agriculture analysts.
On the other hand, their latest EU livestock report notes that the pig sector is breaking records, with unprecedented pork production and exports in 2020, and a new production record forecast for 2021.
Despite falling beef production, the EU became a net exporter in 2020, according to the USDA report.
With the reduction in the cattle herd, beef production is forecast to fall, and “beef consumption will inevitably follow”. 
In 2020, EU beef imports fell due to lack of demand, while exports rose.
This year, imports are forecast to recover if the food service sector re-opens, but exports are also projected to increase.
The USDA says EU dairy herd shrinkage has been greatest since 2010, in absolute terms, in Poland (404,000 head less), France (284,000), and Germany (260,000), while the dairy cow herd in Ireland increased by 449,000.
Since 2010, EU beef cows reduced only 1% compared to 3.9% for dairy cattle.
In 2020, the beef herd expanded in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic States, Spain and Portugal. Exports (mainly to Northern Africa and the Middle East) have become a main driver for holding beef cows in the EU. 
But this trade declined in 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic, except for Spanish exports to Libya and Turkey, Portuguese exports to Israel, and Hungarian exports to Kosovo.
In 2021, EU cattle exports are forecast to recover.
The USDA says Covid-19 in 2020 only had a minor effect on the EU dairy market. 
The price for beef cattle, however, plummeted in March, 2020, and didn’t fully recover, because demand for beef was reduced by the food service sector closure.
Worst hit were prominent veal producing countries, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, and Belgium.
Major 2021 cuts to the beef herd are forecast in almost all EU Member States, most pronounced in France and Germany. 
Low cattle prices are expected to encourage farmers to either stop farming or reduce their breeding herd. 
However, expansion of the beef cow herd in Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary could outweigh reductions in France, Germany, and Ireland.
With recent EU policy proposals such as the Green Deal, Farm to Fork, and Biodiversity Strategies, any chance for EU cattle herd growth appears unrealistic in the near-term, according to the USDA.
In 2020, African Swine Fever in wild boar in Germany closed off German pork exports, but the Netherlands and Spain were able to take over exports and relieve the EU market from oversupply.

Michael Gove's border red tape postponement helps Irish agri-food sector"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40245491.html,2021-03-16 14:49:00,Prices pick up as the beef supply stays tight and market strengthens,"There has been a further slight hardening in beef prices at factories this week.
The base price has moved upwards as much as 5 cents/kg for both steers and heifers at a number of plants, as competition for supply puts pressure on individual processors to source sufficient intake.
With markets holding up well in the unusual lockdown circumstances, a retail demand boost likely for Easter (April 4), and the April 1 increase in Brexit administration at Great Britain borders postponed, processors are increasingly interested in increasing their beef cattle supply.
While some processors continue to quote the base for steers at 375 cents/kg, many offer a base at 380 cents/kg, and very few finishers are taking less than that for their stock this week.
The base for heifers is generally at 385 cents/kg. They are being quoted for at 380 cents/kg at some locations, but the percentage of the intake moving at the price is believed to be low. On the other hand, finishers holding out for a base of 385 cents/kg are having only limited success.
Neither processors or finishers are willing to concede ground on price.
It is still early days in the spring trade, and processors want to ensure there isn’t any price overheating this early in the season.
The year to date intake at beef plants is down by more than 4,200 head per week, on average. The heifer throughput has decreased by about 12%, the steer throughput by about 9%.
All indications point to the supply continuing tight over the coming months, with intake for the year expected to be tighter by at least 50,000 head, and the trend so far in 2021 indicating that figure could be on the conservative side for the full year.
The uplift in the trade has also benefited sellers of young bulls, and of cows, both of which have edged upwards by 5-10 cents/kg.
Demand has increased for young bulls, and the prices have caught up with steer prices, at 380 cents/kg for Rs, with some lots reported to be capable of securing a few cents above that.
Sellers of better quality R-grade cows have regained February‘s lost price ground, with Rs now making up to 340 cents/kg at the top of the trade, with the prices ranging from 330 to 340 cents/kg. Up to 325 cents/kg is being paid for O-grade cows, while P-grade cows are making from 315 cents/kg.
There was a further slight increase in the export plant intake last week, which reached 33,987 head. However, all categories remain well behind figures for the corresponding week in 2020.
There were 12,758 steers, 8,863 heifers, 2,629 young bulls, and 6,108 cows in the kill.
For the first nine weeks of 2021, live exports were 18% ahead of 2020, totalling 42,801, head of cattle being exported out of Ireland.
Although one third went to Northern Ireland, the dairy calf trade to the continental EU has reached up to 14,000 per week, despite bad weather for shipping, and calf exports are 27% ahead of 2020."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40247786.html,2021-03-21 15:00:00,"If you find a good source of calves, you have it made...","St Patrick’s Day was the big event of this week, or at least it should have been.
We think back to the not too distant past, when we went to town to see the parade, and to meet friends that we had not met in a while.
Spirits were high, as some headed indoors to indulge in a pint of the “green” stuff, specially coloured for the day that was in it.
More often than not, I was on call for this festive day, and unable to join my family and friends for the festivities.
Instead, I would have to pick my route around the town so that I would not be held up by the crowd.
Such were the joys of the country vet.
As time progressed, at least my wife and children were able to attend the parade rather than staying at home to mind the phone.
Thank God for mobile phones!
Recently, I received the spring edition of the Beef Healthcheck newsletter from Animal Health Ireland, and was really taken by an article on calf rearing.
This particular farmer has a calf to factory enterprise.
He was lucky to be able to source all his calves from his brothers, who were dairy farming nearby.
The reason I say lucky is that he was able to buy from one particular source and not from a number of different sources, thereby running an increased risk of bringing in infection.
In our practice we have a number of clients who have a similar enterprise, and I try to stress the importance to them of identifying a single source for their calves.
It is important to find a source that you can trust, and if you can get one that vaccinates their cows for Rotavirus, and you can trust that they will feed whole milk for the first couple of weeks, then hang on to them, because this is a big bonus.
In the calf rearing enterprise, the one thing that you do not want to see is scouring calves and, most of all, you do not want to hear that it is caused by Rotavirus.
If you can also get your supplier to give them an intra-nasal respiratory vaccine at one week old, then you have it made.
This can benefit the buyer and the supplier, as the farmer selling his calves can build a relationship with his buyer, knowing that he will get a fair price, and the buyer will know in return that he is getting decent calves.
In the Beef Healthcheck newsletter article, the farmer, called Richard, stressed the importance of buying a quality milk replacer.
Price was not the defining factor, rather having the right level of ingredients for a daily weight gain of 0.7Kg/day.
He found that keeping his calves on 1kg of concentrate feed per day, even when they went out to grass, helped very much with the transition from hay/straw and concentrates to the grazing diet. 
It also helped his young stock grow better, so that this year, he was in a position to finish his yearlings off grass, rather than having to winter them in the same airspace as his weanlings.
In the past, he had found a lot of coughing in the weanlings when they came in for the winter.
He had his stock on a vaccination programme for respiratory disease, but having young and older stock in the same house caused a major problem.
Because of the damage that had been done to their lungs as weanlings, the older stock were taking longer to finish and required housing for the second winter, in order to make the weight, and the cycle just continued into the next generation.

Grazing season springs into action"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40247789.html,2021-03-22 09:30:00,"Milk comes from cows, not grass...watch out for cows under pressure","Many areas had no rain for the past week, a welcome change from the previous spell which was no time to be chasing grazing targets.
It is worth remembering that a spring grazing planner is a guide, and it is not compulsory to adhere to.
Getting to the end of the first round may require some paddocks being taken out, but what is wrong with that? 
Anyway, things have come good now, and the end of the first round
will all depend on how growth progresses. Some have already suggested that their planned start of round two has been pushed out by about a week to April 10-12.
That date is a moveable feast, after such a difficult spring until improvement in the weather allowed grazing to really push on.
It is however very important that you transition cows to large intakes of grazed grass.
It takes a ruminant 21 days to adjust to a new diet.
Something else worth noting is that a herd’s yield should not jump significantly when grass is introduced, unless the diet offered indoors before turnout was entirely inappropriate for them. Logical, but often ignored!
Watch for signs that cows are under pressure, which include low protein due to poor energy intakes, low butter fats due to poor fibre digestion, a drop off in milk yields, more rib exposed in cows, empty-looking cows, excessively loose dungs, or individual cows getting digestive upsets such as displaced abomasum and ketosis.
The milk price for 2021 looks very promising, so why feed cows to produce less than they are genetically able to?
Cows produce milk; this should not be forgotten, some seem to think that it is the grass actually produces the milk.
Complementing grazed grass successfully to optimise cow performance
Buffer feeding is filling the feed gap between the energy requirements of a cow and the energy consumed by her in the form of grazed grass.
If there is a deficit, the feed you give her is a “buffer”, regardless of whether that is fed in the parlour, from a bale, out of a pit, or through a mixer wagon.
Don’t be put off by the term “buffer” and associate it with complicated processes.
As Spring hopefully establishes itself after a difficult start to the year, the prospect of warmer weather and cows remaining outside full time becomes a reality.
All going well, most milkers will be out full time in the coming weeks, depending on land type, stocking rate and weather.
So what does a dairy cow need, in addition to grass.
Unquestionably, it is cheaper and simpler to graze cows with little or no supplementation, but that approach is far less reliable for maintaining intakes, milk production, milk solids, and return on investment in genetic improvement and cow fertility.
What is appropriate for a 5,000-litre herd certainly is not realistic for one capable of 8,000 or 7,000 litres.
Different genetics require different nutrition management. If you underfeed a cow, then it is not her fault when she has poor solids and doesn’t go back in calf.
This does not make her a bad cow!
The potential of grass
Optimising grass intake must be the number one priority, while grazing.
Well managed grazed grass in good conditions will be capable of supporting in the region of 25 litres/cow/day. Some would claim rather more, but it’s not common, and requires excellent management. To support 25-litre production, intakes of about 120kg of fresh grass per cow per day (17kg of dry matter, DM) are needed.
In poorer weather, cows graze and eat less, and intakes drop. On top of this, breed, stage of lactation, stage of gestation, and many other factors must be considered.
Complementing grass is about maintaining intakes, milk production, milk quality, body condition and fertility — essentially making sure that the cow’s energy requirements are supplied consistently, in order for them to fulfil their genetic potential.
The main difficulty is in judging how much feed is required on a daily basis in addition to the grass consumed.
Measuring grass regularly is obviously the first step.
Allocating that grass is the next step.
Establishing utilisation and actual intake then allows you to balance the grass accurately.
Turnout to grass should be gradual, starting with grass by day, follow this with a few hours after evening milking for three of four days, before full turnout by night.
At no point should any buffer or complementary feed reduce intakes of grazed grass. It should be designed to improve digestion of grazed grass, and animal performance.
Higher yield potential cows, depending on the level of production, can be offered a fibrous buffer feed via a mixer wagon, or a straight alternative forage (5-7kg of dry matter per cow per day), ideally before or after the morning milking.
Any complementary forage or mix should ideally be fed in the morning so that cows can return to pasture in the evening with a strong appetite to consume the highest dry matter and highest sugar content grass of the day.
Good grassland management and measurement strategies are making intake measurements from grazing much more achievable.
Any sudden drops in dry matter intakes, associated with a change in feed quality, or in the quantity offered, along with weather conditions, must be acted upon immediately.
Introduce diet changes slowly
This is particularly important when cows are turned out to grass, as the sudden change in diet can potentially cause digestive upsets that lead to reduced overall intakes.
Introduce a good quality buffer feeding strategy with sufficient fibre, to help reduce any potential digestive upsets. High dry matter intakes not only drive milk production, but also reproduction, by stimulating ovarian function and reducing days to first ovulation.

We scooped up our pennies and even found the odd shiny 50p to donate to famine-afflicted countries in Africa, to islanders ravaged by hurricanes in Central America and other communities impacted by severe poverty.
We generously and rightly give to these collections but continued to ignore our own working poor.
Workers don't need charity donations, instead they require the Government to act on a measure that should already be a basic entitlement.
In August, as Covid-19 swept through our meat plants, serious concerns were raised that employees were being effectively forced to turn up to work even if they had symptoms, as taking time off would also mean a loss of income.

The pandemic highlighted a persistent issue for mainly minimum-wage or low-paid workers who feel obliged to work even if they are not fit to.
""For low paid workers, even if they are on the enhanced illness benefit they still suffer a very significant loss of earnings, that could be €50 a week, which may not be a lot to some people, but it's enormous to others if they are low paid and very much struggling to make ends meet,"" said Labour senator Marie Sherlock, who brought forward a a statutory sick pay bill back in September.
Meat plant workers accounted for 42% of workplace infections between November and February 13.
Of course. we cannot say how many of those cases could have been prevented if statutory sick pay was already introduced, but it has been pointed out that the lack of paid sick leave in this country is a fundamental weakness in fighting Covid-19.
Between 800,000 and 1m people do not have a sick pay scheme in work, meaning they are totally reliant on what Siptu economist Michael Taft describes as a ""woefully inadequate illness benefit from the Department of Social Protection"".
Ireland is now just one of only five EU countries that doesn't enshrine the right to sick pay in law. The UK also provides statutory sick pay and a new scheme was recently introduced in the US.
In the community sector, people who work side-by-side doing the same work can be treated differently when it comes to sick pay, depending on their source of funding, community worker Linda Scully told a webinar entitled 'Healing our Sick Pay System'.
""Some might have sick pay and others might not. This creates an arbitrary and unfair discrimination,” she said.
Speaking at the same event in October, manufacturing worker, John Montgomery said: “It can take a week for workers to access the illness benefit payment, which is very small. This means that workers either come into work while they are sick or they take time off and lose their pay.""
Leo Varadkar, as Minister for Enterprise, launched a public consultation process last November which received a total of 118 submissions.
Enterprise Minister Leo Varadkar said he wanted to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme that works for employees and employers. Picture: Sasko Lazarov/Rollingnews.ie
Launching the consultation process, Mr Varadkar said he wanted to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme that works for employees and employers.
Equally, his department recently stressed the importance of protecting employers.
“The intention is to develop a scheme that is fair and affordable and that does not place an undue burden of costs on employers. “
“Any move to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme which will place a new financial burden on employers must be balanced with the need to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector, thereby protecting jobs,"" the department wrote in correspondence to the Oireachtas committee on enterprise and employment earlier this month.
Solidarity-PBP picked up on this point and ran with it in the Dáil, claiming the Government continues to represent the interests of big business and not vulnerable workers.
""If it is a populist conspiracy theory that the Government represents the interests of the beef barons and not the interests of the workers, why, 10 months after this issue was first raised in the Dáil, has the Tánaiste not acted to introduce sick pay for meat factory workers?"" Paul Murphy asked on March 4.
The Tánaiste was quick to point out that ""workers need jobs, and we always have to bear that in mind in our policies too"".
A spokesperson for the Tánaiste said he was committed to introducing a statutory sick pay scheme in Ireland and work is progressing on the heads of a bill. It is hoped a bill will be enacted and up and running before the end of the year.
But Ms Sherlock believes the Government has been ""hedging its bets"" that the pandemic would simply go away and the issue of sick pay would dissipate with it.
Statutory sick pay cannot and should not be purely linked to Covid. The Irish Cancer Society has also called for statutory sick pay and enhanced supports which it says are needed to help cancer patients return to work.
""There will always be a need for sick pay whether we have a pandemic or not, obviously it's more urgent now because there are large numbers of people who need it,"" Ms Sherlock said.
Covid has provided a new perspective on the term 'essential worker', as many of us had the luxury of safety cocooning from behind laptop screens.
Eventually, we will all be vaccinated and Covid will become a distant memory, but the danger is that as normal life resumes, we will also forget about our binmen, our shelf-stackers, our meat plant workers and the issue of sick pay will not be tackled.
The Government needs to learn that change must begin at home.

Poor contact tracing capacity and travel behind 500-plus per day Covid cases
What to look out for this week
Tuesday: The pandemic has undoubtedly exposed Ireland's poor planning and provision for life in our later years. the Health Committee will discuss the regulation of nursing homes and a new model of care for older people.
Tuesday: Given the announcement to close over 100 of its branches, the appearance of Bank of Ireland officials at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach is likely to be an interesting one.
Wednesday: The much-anticipated Family Leave Bill (2021) is due for debate in the Dáil on Wednesday afternoon. However, Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman has already said a change of mindset is needed, as nearly 50% of dads don’t take parental leave already on offer.
Wednesday: The proposed EU Covid green pass to allow for greater travel signed off on in Brussels last week, is sure to be raised with Transport Minister Eamon Ryan when he takes questions in the Dáil.
Thursday: The Thursday morning slot has become an almost permanent speaking session for the Health Minister, who will be in for further interrogation on the Government's vaccine rollout and hotel quarantining.
Thursday: The Taoiseach will take part in a EU virtual meeting of leaders on Wednesday and Thursday. Items on the agenda include the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the single market, digital transformation and the economy and relations with Russia.
Thursday: The cost of insurance and those making false claims has been a hot topic in recent years and the regional group of nine TDs are bringing forward the Civil Liability and Courts Bill to tackle this. The bill would increase the penalties relating to fraudulent claims and would impose legal costs on those found guilty. “Each week An Garda Síochána receive reports of fraudulent insurance claims and there is a perception that fraud and exaggerated claims have been increasing in recent years, however, at present there is no consequence or risk to taking such a claim,” independent TD for Galway East Sean Canney said ahead of the debate.
'Bugs and bombshells' was the lead headline, about the deepening crisis concerning then Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan, on the front page of 'The Irish Examiner' on Wednesday, March 26, 2014.
This week in years gone by...
March 31, 1966: The Tricolour flag flown over the Dublin GPO in 1916 is handed back by the British to representatives of the Irish Government in London. ""A cloak and dagger atmosphere permeated the arrangements for the handing over in London yesterday of the historic flag which flew over the GPO during the Easter Rising,"" the Cork Examiner reported.
March 24, 1968: 61 people died in Ireland’s worst ever air disaster. The following day a report on the front page of the Cork Examiner said Aer Lingus had confirmed that ""little hope could be entertained of finding any survivors from the worst tragedy in the history of its operations when a Cork-London Viscount aircraft with 61 people – including two babes in arms – plunged into the sea off Stumble Head, near Fishguard, Wales, just before noon.""
March 30, 1981: In the US, Ronald Reagan is shot. The following day the Cork Examiner reported that the president had a bullet removed from a lung after the assassination attempt. He was shot by John Hinckley Jr as left the Washington Hilton hotel after addressing a union convention.
March 25, 2003: Tourism minister John O’Donoghue launches the 'Value Menu Restaurant Guide' to offer meals at three price points – €15, €25 and €35. However, the scheme did not make the front pages as just days before US president George Bush had launched project 'Shock and Awe' on Iraq.
March 25, 2014: Garda commissioner Martin Callinan resigned after months of controversy and a now-famous appearance before the Public Accounts Committee during which he described whistleblowers, Maurice McCabe and John Wilson as “disgusting”.

Processors are finding little room for manoeuvre on price, if they want to keep the cattle supply flowing, which they do, leaving market power edging more in favour of finishers.
The intake for last week, with St Patrick’s Day on Wednesday, slipped back a little, to 31,255, compared to 38,843 for the same week in 2020.
Steers accounted for 11,790 last week, with heifers at 8,901, and 5,697 cows. There were 2,175 young bulls.
Positives for finishers in the trade are that the retail market for beef remains strong and the year-to-date intake is early 12% down compared to 2020.
Numbers available to the factories for the weeks ahead should remain tight.
A tight intake and market demand will put pressure on processors trying to get sufficient stock at current prices.
For the most part, prime beef cattle prices have edged upwards as much as 5c/kg this week for both steers and heifers, and cow prices showing some gains, but young bull prices seem to have levelled off for the present.
The general base price for steers this week is at 380c/kg. There are very few finishers willing to take less, and a small percentage say they are getting up to 385c/kg.
Some are getting free transport, or part of the cost of transport, in areas where processors are most anxious for a good number of quality stock that they don’t want to leave behind.
Heifer prices are generally on a base of 385c/kg.
It is difficult to get a base at 390c/kg, but there are some reports of the extra cents being secured.
There is strong competition between processors for cattle, which helps finishers who are willing to shop around for the best deals before selling.
There has been a slight easing in demand for young bulls, with prices stabilised at around 5c/kg less than the steer price.
The weekly throughput of young bulls continues to trail the 2020 figures.
Demand for cows is continuing at a very strong level.
Better quality R-grade cows are making up to 340c/kg at the top of the trade.
Up to 320-330c/kg is being paid for O-grade cows, and the best of the P-graders are now hitting 300c/kg."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40250537.html,2021-03-24 15:45:00,Brexit knocks nearly 40% off Irish beef exports to UK in January,"Imports of beef from Ireland to the UK slumped in January, according to British trade statistics.
Brexit trading difficulties are behind the 38% fall, which compared with only a 16% reduction in January, 2020, compared to January, 2019.
The UK leaving the EU has greatly disrupted the UK beef market, and inevitably has upset the import source most dependent on it, which is Ireland.
Nearly half of all Irish beef production goes to the UK.
Irish exporters will need the trading relationship to settle quickly, because the January fall from about 18,000t in 2020 to 11,000t in 20221 is not sustainable for the Irish beef industry.
The postponement of extra border checks from April 1 to later this year and to 2022 will help Irish beef exporters recover lost ground in the UK market.
When the overall fall in UK beef imports is analysed, Brazil is the beef source least affected, albeit supplying mostly processed beef and offal rather than prime beef, and with tonnages falling only 6%.
In contrast, the much bigger falls in shipments from the EU indicate that Brexit trading difficulties between the EU and the EU were to blame, with established UK-Brazil trading relationships relatively unaffected.
However, stockpiling of imported beef in the UK towards the end of 2020, in preparation for Brexit difficulties, was also a factor in the huge January slump in beef imports.
Statistical reports indicate that tonnages from Ireland, which supplies over 60% of UK beef imports, fell by nearly 40% in January, compared to 12 months previously.
Even worse affected were beef exporters to the UK in the Netherlands, with tonnages down 65%, and in Poland, down 46%, compared to the same month last year.
The UK’s total imports of beef (fresh, frozen, processed, and offal) in the first month of 2021 totalled about 16,000 tonnes, compared to about 26,000 tonnes 12 months previously, and about 31,000t in January, 2019.
The figures confirm the Brexit trading shock for Ireland’s beef industry, which has heavily relied on the fairly steady UK beef import demand, for 360,000 tonnes of beef and beef products on average from 2013 to 2017, with Ireland the dominant supplier, with 63% of the trade.
A proportion of these imports is beef produced in the UK but exported for further processing.
UK beef imports increased in 2018.
But in 2019, the pound sterling was weaker, there was weaker demand for beef in the UK, and increased UK production of beef, all of which resulted in Briitsh imports falling, and UK exports rising.
Import volumes fell about 17%, but with imports from Ireland down only 11% in 2019.
The fall in Irish exports of beef to the UK continued in 2020, but not as steeply, with the reduction of about 6% in the trade probably unavoidable, as the UK market endured rollercoaster consumer demand, due to Covid-19 lockdowns.
In fact, Irish shipments into the rest of the EU were hit even harder, down 9%.
For example, France took about 11% less beef from Ireland in 2020.
Irish exporters were helped by non-EU destinations such as the Phillipines, Japan, the US, and Canada, taking extra Irish beef in 2020, but it was not enough to offset reduced shipments elsewhere.
And then came Brexit, with the UK finally exiting the EU, after four and a half years of currency fluctuations and cliff-edges.
CSO figures (seasonally adjusted) confirm the magnitude of the Brexit shock for the entire Irish economy, with January 2021 exports to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) down 14%, compared to January, 2020 (imports from Great Britain fell 65%).
The challenges of complying with customs requirements were a big factor, along with stockpiling of Irish goods in the UK, late in 2020, in preparation for Brexit. Covid-19 restrictions also affected imports and exports.
Unfortunately, the CSO figures indicate a disproportionate Brexit effect on trade in food and live animals, not unexpected because of stricter customs requirements for these commodities.
Exports of food and live animals to Great Britain fell by one-third, to €188 million; and imports slumped 75%, to €62 million.
The trade disruption was also evident from the UK side, with data from the HMRC indicating British exports of fresh and frozen beef were devastated in January, falling from 11,300t to just 2,200t.
Ireland is typically the largest export destination for British beef, but took only 200t in the first month of the year, down by 3,400 tonnes.
Can the UK-Ireland beef trade recover, and help processors pay the €4/kg base line price demanded this week by the IFA?
There are encouraging signs, not least that the currency exchange rate has settled for the past month at about 86p sterling for the euro. 
And retail beef sales in Great Britain have performed strongly in recent weeks.
According to Kantar Worldpanel data reported by the Livestock and Meat Commission for Northern Ireland, the consumer spend on beef in England, Scotland and Wales during the 12 weeks ending February 21 increased by 15.8% year-on-year, totalling £1,152m.
Volume sales of beef were up by 12.7%.
Especially welcome for Irish exporters is the greatest proportional increase in terms of value sales during the 12-week period being recorded for steaks, burgers, grills, and marinades. Steak volume sales increased by 32.1%.

You’ll recognise The Menu this Easter by the chocolate-smeared head on him and you can be sure much of his consumption will be of splendid chocolates from his much-loved Chocolate Shop (chocolate.ie), in the English Market. And while many of the products will be sourced from around the globe, he’ll also be consuming chocolates from fine Irish chocolatiers as well, including chocolates from The Kingdom. The Menu has always been very partial to Benoit Lorge’s range, the Kenmare-based Frenchman's selections always proving most fine and flavoursome (lorge.ie).
On his last visit to The Chocolate Shop, The Menu was especially taken with the gorgeously liveried Skellig Chocolates Easter egg range — another fine Kerry chocolatier. Handmade of solid chocolate — another bonus point as The Menu always feels hollow easter eggs to be something of a swizz — they come in two weights, 400gm and 1kg and flavours include: Strawberry & Champagne; Hazelnut Praline; Limited Edition Teeling Irish Whiskey; Irish Sea Salted Caramel; Honeycomb & Marshmallow; and Mint, with a signature mint truffle centre (skelligschocolates.com)
Partner chocolate with whiskey or beer
A drop of finest Irish Whiskey so often makes a splendid partner for good chocolate so a pairing masterclass, Teeling Whiskey & Chocolate Pairing (April 1) is thoroughly recommended especially as it features Chapter One pastry chef Darren Hogarty and your pre-ordered event pack and tickets (€50 in total) includes four Teeling Samples (50ml), premium chocolate samples, Mason Jar and Cocktail Ingredients, Whiskey Glass, Recipe Card and Tasting Mat. reservations@teelingwhiskey.com
Of late, another favourite chocolate pairing of The Menu’s has been a limited edition beer from Porterhouse Brew Co. Although to call Around The Clock a ‘beer’ is almost a misnomer for it is a stout that has undergone an especially prolonged maturation of 365 days in Dingle Whiskey Distillery bourbon and sherry casks, the process yielding a quite extraordinary concoction, a rich, velvety mouthfeel and deep, complex flavours of stewed fruits, marzipan and cacao. porterhousebrewco.ie
Sweet treats
An Easter edition of their Comfort Kit from the ever-splendid Pudding Row (puddingrow.ie) in Sligo (delivery nationwide) is always chock-full of wonderful treats, edible and otherwise, including chocolate hearts filled with salted caramel from Mayo chocolatier Noo Chocolates.
When it comes to putting on the nosebag, The Menu has a list as long as his arm and also his other arm and then the arms of another dozen or so especially long-armed citizens and up near the top of that list is a return to Ballymaloe House for some of their legendary hospitality and chef Dervilla O’Flynn’s wonderful iteration of Myrtle Allen’s culinary ethos but in the meantime a finish-at-home box from the legendary kitchens, Ballymaloe At Home: Easter Feasting, also including some sweet delectables from top pastry chef JR Ryall, is an extremely adequate compensation, even more so if you add wines selected from the wonderful Ballymaloe cellar by sommelier Samuel Chantoiseau. ballymaloe.ie
Easter Sunday Family Feast — delivered
Bujo Easter Sunday Family Feast
On foot of colleague Leslie Williams’ splendid review of Bujo Burger and aware as The Menu is of the enormous talent that is Bujo Culinary Director Gráinne O’Keefe, The Menu reckons their special Easter Sunday Family Feast is well worth a punt, feeding four to six people, with three meal kits in one for €90 (nationwide delivery, April 2). Easter Sunday roast includes 21-day aged Irish striploin is served with duck fat roasties, creamy garlic and nutmeg potato gratin, roasted root veg and apple pie. A dessert kit with six servings features Bakers Chocolate Brownie and Salted Caramel Sauce while the Mini-Masterpiece Burger Kit which Leslie so raved about includes six beef patties, brioche buns, cheese, pickles and Bujo Secret Sauce. A Bujo Gift tea-towel and brief instructional video from Gráinne surely seals the deal! bujo.ie
The Twelve Hotel’s Limited Edition Easter Cocktail Box, €90, includes six delicious cocktails, complete with chocolate eggs and bunnies in which to serve the two chocolate-flavoured cocktails (Baileys Espresso Martini and The Grasshopper, served in chocolate, topped with The Twelve’s own salted caramel sauce or chocolate and Baileys sauce). Price includes delivery nationwide. thetwelvehotel.ie
TODAY’S SPECIAL
international award-winning MIA chocolate produced bean-to-bar in Madagascar
After Valentine’s Day and then Mother’s Day, it seems The Menu has been eating nothing but chocolate of late and what’s more, he is not complaining. Though he usually features Irish products in this spot, the origins of chocolate are a little bit further out of the parish and in the spirit of acting local and thinking global, he is happy to bring news of a new Irish charity, Proudly Made in Africa, supporting sustainable job creation in countries such as Madagascar, Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, and promoting the message of ‘trade, not aid’ as the optimum solution to African poverty. Through their online shop, PMIA supports, connects and promotes African businesses producing organic, fairly traded, environmentally friendly, award-winning products, while also supporting female empowerment, living incomes, and environmental habitats.
Retailing a range of goods including organic teas, spices and cocoa beans to handmade soft toys, natural soaps, and Moyee Coffee, the world’s first Fair Chain coffee. And how does all of this connect to the above? Well, PMIA also retail chocolate, including international award-winning MIA chocolate produced bean-to-bar in Madagascar and even amongst the wealth of fine chocolate tastes in recent times, The Menu was especially taken with MIA’s Dark Chocolate (65%) with Baobab Powder and Salted Nibs — a well-balanced chocolate with notes of citrus and smokey cocoa and a savoury saline crunch via cocoa nibs all resolving in a fruity finish. proudlymadeinafrica.org

https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-40256183.html,2021-04-01 11:00:00,Planning a holiday abroad? Proceed with caution,"Holidays abroad this year? The jury’s still out on this one, but just in case you’re tempted to go book something, the European Consumer Centre (ECC Ireland) suggests that you keep your wits about you.
Make sure you use a travel agent with a good track record, always try to get flexible booking arrangements or else just book a package holiday.
As vaccination programmes roll out across the continent and economies begin to open up again, we’re going to see an increase in international travel. 
That’s great, but before you make too many assumptions about what’s going to be possible and when, remember that thousands of holidaymakers are still struggling to get refunds back from tour operators and airlines for trips cancelled last year.
If you travel for non-essential reasons to a destination that is not allowing inward travel/tourism, or only under strict conditions, you may not be able to change or get a refund for your travel booking.
So make sure, before you book, that there are no restrictions either from here or at the destination because if travel operators (airlines, for instance) are operating their services as normal, but you decide not to travel or cancel the reservations/tickets, you will not be entitled to a refund.
ECC Ireland advises that you plan ahead, keep informed, and know what’s going on at your preferred destination. 
What do they require in terms of vaccination, testing and quarantine?
Remember, restrictions and lockdowns can happen at very short notice, so keep a close eye on the local news in the run up to when you’re supposed to travel. For up to date info, go to reopen.europa, which will give you info on all destinations in the EU/EEA area. They’ve also got an app you can download.
Package holidays
One way of securing peace of mind when you book a holiday is to book a package deal. 
Because consumer law in this area has been beefed up considerably in recent years, package travel offers the optimum form of consumer protection. You’re protected against company insolvency, travel cancellations and travel restrictions imposed by authorities.
When a national lockdown is announced or travel advice for your destination changes, tour operators, unlike airlines, will cancel holiday package contracts. 
Unlike all other forms of travel, consumers can cancel the holiday themselves, without losing money, in the event of extraordinary circumstances such as Covid-19-related disruptions. Additionally, you can transfer the package to another traveler who may be in a position to take the holiday if you can’t.
Package deals are a safer option.
Under the terms of the package travel regulations, a consumer who has had their holiday cancelled will be offered either a replacement holiday of equal or superior quality, a lower quality holiday, plus a refund for the difference between the two trips, or a full refund.
In the context of Covid cancellations, many travel companies offered a voucher/credit note. In Ireland, these notes are good for a minimum of five years and are fully backed by the government.
Holidaymakers can cancel the package themselves for a reasonable cancellation fee but are entitled to free cancellation and full refund in the event of natural disasters, substantial changes in the price or nature of the trip, or as a result of ‘conditions on the ground related to disease and pandemics.’
Cash refunds should be made within 30 days. Having said that, the mass cancellations we saw last year left many operators struggling to meet to this deadline.
You don’t have as many protections with non-package travel, but you do have options, especially if you paid by debit or credit card. If your holiday is cancelled by the travel company or any of the service operators (airline, hotel, etc.), you may be able to claim a refund from your card issuer for services not delivered. This is called a chargeback.
Now, not all card issuers operate chargeback in quite the same way — check with yours before you try to engage it. Note too that card issuers are not legally obliged to refund you. 
There’s a full investigation before a chargeback is authorised, and it can only be used as a last resort, when traders’ claims processes have been exhausted and no refund is forthcoming.
So think before you book. 
If it’s not a package holiday, look for flexible terms. 
Research travel companies and suppliers that offer flexibility if you need to change your plans. The best ones will allow you to cancel or change your booking right up to the date of departure.
As ECC Ireland points out, flexible policies are relatively common among accommodation providers. Many airlines also offer free changes for extended periods if you need to postpone your travel due to restrictions either here or in the destination country.
Then there’s travel insurance. Always a good idea to take out insurance when you book, but do bear in mind that protection for Covid related illness and disruption is not standard. Ask in advance about what’s covered.
When choosing the policy, check what will be covered before, during and after your holiday. Find out if flight or accommodation cancellations are covered if travel advice restricts outward travel or if you require hospital services at destination. 
Some airlines, tour operators and hotels are now offering free or paid-for Covid cover as an optional addition to your booking/ticket.
Brexit
Then there’s Brexit. Many Irish consumers would have booked holidays and independent travel with UK travel operators in the past. 
ECC Ireland points out that we still don’t know exactly how the rights of Irish holiday makers will be protected when they book with UK companies.
Neither the Withdrawal Agreement nor the Trade and Co-operation Agreement contain any specific guidance in relation to the travel sector, but there is an implicit commitment that the EU and the UK will ‘continue to cooperate in terms of mutually enforcing consumer rights in their jurisdictions’.
From 2021, UK travel companies selling services into EU countries will need to meet local requirements for insolvency protection, i.e. will be bound the standard protection obligations that exist in EU jurisdictions.
This effectively means that UK businesses that sell package holidays to Ireland must comply with travel protection legislation (and insolvency protection requirements) applicable in Ireland.
It’s important to note also that EU Package Travel Directives and regulations were enshrined into UK legislation via the transposition mechanism before they jumped ship. 
This legislation has not changed, and ECC Ireland expects that it will continue to apply this year. The centre also points out that UK travel operators have a robust licensing authority and a strong financial insolvency protection scheme which is run by the Civil Aviation Authority.
Chances are, therefore, that the pre-Brexit consumer protections will continue.

Five fab Irish lake escapes for summer 2021"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40256129.html,2021-04-01 14:00:00,Taskforce hears of new beef pay option,"Teagasc researchers have said the current technology for classifying beef carcases could be further developed for “cuts-based” payments to farmers, allowing payment to farmers for cattle to be better aligned to the beef breeding programme.
In their recent report to the Beef Task Force, Paul Crosson and Laurence Shalloo described how multiple component pricing (MCP) could provide more detailed signals for cattle farmers to breed animals with the attributes desired by consumers of beef.
MCP could better reflect market returns for different beef cuts, and market preferences.
It would allow specification cut-offs based on the size of cuts rather than the size of an animal.
And the Teagasc researchers said it would allow additional components to be included in pricing, such as marbling in certain beef cuts.
With MCP, each carcase component that has a value could be included in the price, and the items that have a cost are also included.
It could resemble the A plus B minus C system used for milk pricing, in which protein has a value (A), fat has a value (B), and processing has a cost (C).
The equivalent multiple component pricing in beef could have the high-value striploin, fillet, rump, and cube roll (A); the medium value topside, knuckle, silverside flat, and eye of round (B); the lower value flank, brisket, chuck and neck, heel/shank, chuck tender, and leg of mutton or thick rib cut (C); the fifth quarter offal (D); and processing costs (E); to arrive at a carcass value of A plus B plus C plus D minus E.
MCP could be based on estimating each beef cut by using a modified version of the existing video image analysis (VIA) which is used for beef classification.
VIA involves taking images of a carcass with one or more cameras, then applying specialised software to extract data from them, such as lengths, areas, volumes, angles and colours.
Further software is then used to process these data, to predict the conformation class and fat class.
The modified VIA could be used to predict meat cut yields, in addition to conformation and fat.
The MCP report to the Beef Task Force followed Teagasc being asked to carry out an in-depth study of revised systems of beef cattle pricing.
The researchers reviewed the current pricing model and meat processing technologies and presented an overview of the “cuts-based” pricing concept.
In their technology overview, the Teagasc experts said VIA can determine subcutaneous fat cover, but loses accuracy as the fat depth increases, and is poor at prediction of intramuscular fat. 
They said Computed Tomography (CT scan, as used in medicine) is the “gold-standard” method.
The Teagasc experts said feedback and further research on MCP are required, but noted that Ireland has historically been an innovator in carcass grading systems.
Pre-automation, manual classification was done by a large team of DAFM staff.
Ireland was first to adopt automated grading by VIA in 2004 (following a review of systems by Teagasc, and application for approval to the EU by DAFM).
The “Drennan” model of carcass payment was adopted in 2009/2010 (it was based on research by Michael Drennan of Teagasc).

Marts reporting strong demand for all types of cattle"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40256222.html,2021-04-02 15:00:00,The time is now to prioritise quality silage  ,"it was certainly a “March of many weathers”.
The last few weeks saw big variations in temperature, with plenty rain and some glorious sunshine. It looks like a colder spell over Easter and into next week will limit grass growth.
Silage season is just over a month away. Producing sufficient silage for next winter and aiming to make quality silage must be priorities over the coming weeks.
This message never changes, as good quality silage is cheaper to balance in the diet, and gives better animal performance.
Given the current price of concentrates, silage quality will be essential to achieve cost effective animal performance next winter.
Silage production costs
Grass silage is getting more and more expensive. Unfortunately, its quality can be variable, depending on weather, cutting date, and grassland management/ reseeding policy.
Too much poor or average silage in the pit may increase overall beef production cost.
Producing silage from rented/leased land has had a hugely detrimental effect on silage quality in Ireland recently. 
This ground tends to have older swards, and unless in a long term lease, it is not being reseeded often enough, limed, or having P and K indices maintained sufficiently.
First cut grass silage will typically cost approximately €30-35 per tonne, or €300 per acre, when you include reseeding, liming, fertiliser, weed control and contractor charges.
Delaying the cutting date, while perhaps increasing volume, will result in poorer feed, and will increase the cost per unit of energy utilised by the cattle being fed.
Silage planning
You will reduce the tonnage of silage you produce if you cut earlier.
But better quality silage has higher energy and digestibility. 
Your cutting date is obviously down to weather, ground conditions, stocking rate, contractor availability, units of nitrogen applied etc.
The amount of nitrogen is a major issue in Irish grass silage production.
Many overuse nitrogen, and this delays the cutting date and can prevent good preservation. 
If you haven’t put out fertiliser for silage yet, you must make sure to apply it in accordance with your intended cutting date.
For those that have split nitrogen application, assess growth before applying the second split.
You may be better to put out less than you had intended, because recent growth rates did not use a lot of the first spread.
Use soil test results to determine if P and K are needed, to ensure efficient use of applied nitrogen.
Silage requirements
How much silage are you going to carry into next winter? What is the quality like? Is it in bales, or in a pit?
Recent years have taught us to produce more silage than our requirements. But don’t go overboard.
Build in a 20-25% safety valve to provide for a longer winter due to poor weather, poor growth etc.
We have had long winters and summer droughts forever, so you never know when you will need extra silage.
How much will each type of animal eat next winter (of 22-25% dry matter silage).
Dry suckler cows will typically consume 40-45 kg silage per day (depends on if you feed straw and/or concentrates).
Sucklers with calves will consume 50-55 kg of silage per day along with some concentrates to provide sufficient milk for their calf and help them to return to cycling.
Weanlings will eat about 2% of body weight in dry matter, of which silage will usually make up 80%. 
For example, a 300kg weanling will eat 6kg of dry matter, and 75% of this is 20-22kg of fresh silage per day.
Stores will eat mostly silage during winter feeding, as 80-85% of their total feed intake. 
For example, a 500kg store will eat 35-40kg of silage daily.
Finishers may not be so dependent on grass silage for winter feeding, as they may have access to alternative forages such as beet or maize. 
On a finishing diet, depending on breed and sex, an animal will consume 2-2.5% of their body weight in dry matter. In this period, total intake may be split, 50% forage and 50% concentrate.
For example, a bullock of 600kg will eat 12-15kg of dry matter, equal to about 25-35kg of fresh silage daily.

Spring lambs at 770c/kg and €211 in marts as record-breaking market conditions continue"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40259861.html,2021-04-06 15:41:00,Processors concede another 5 cents/kg to beef finishers,"We are approaching the time of the year when beef processors usually have to work a bit harder to get sufficient supply through the gates to meet market requirements.
That means it is also the season when beef finishers are in the strongest position to negotiate on price, before parting with the livestock.
Some aspects of the beef business have a habit of repeating themselves, no matter how other things change, and the late spring price battle between factories and farmers has become a very regular occurrence.
Processors are loudly defending the prices they are paying, but finishers are gaining better control over the supply of stock that processors want.
That’s why processors have conceded another 5 cents/kg to finishers across most of the cattle categories this week, under pressure to keep the supply flowing, as beef cattle number remain well below the level of recent years, and markets continue strong.
For the first 12 weeks of 2021, the steer throughput was back 8.3% and the heifer throughput back 14%, compared to 2020.
Most of the steers are now priced at a base of 385 cents/kg.
Some hard-sell finishers are holding out for a base of 390 cents/kg. It is hard got, and the factories are very reluctant to concede, but there are some reports that it is being achieved.
Prices for heifers are at a base of 390 cents/kg.
The pattern of trade is similar to that of the steers, with some finishers reporting that up to 395 cents/kg is being attained.
The weeks of the year when supplies are normally tightest are fast approaching, and processors are aware of that, and are getting in early warnings that there is nothing more from the market to give.
Only time will prove if their approach is sustainable, and they can continue to secure sufficient stock without having to pay more for them.
Strong demand continues for both Angus and Hereford crosses, with a breed bonus of up to 15 cents/kg on top of the quality assured bonus adding a tidy sum to the cheque from the factory.
There is demand for young bulls this week at up to 380-385 cents/kg for R-grade.
The price for R-grade cows has increased to 350 cents/kg, with strong demand at factories for cows, despite the continuing lockdown of the food catering sector, and probably more a reflection of the overall strength of the markets for all categories of beef.
The total intake at beef plants for last week was unchanged at 31,124 head which was 4,500 head lower than the same week in 2020.
There were 11,696 steers, 9,525 heifers, 2,245 young bulls and 6,185 cows, with each of these categories down compared to the corresponding week last year.
For the first 12 weeks of 2021, the number of animals exported is running 3% behind the same period in 2020, with 85,703 head exported. But calf exports were 10% lower this year."

Make This Your Best Breeding Season Yet with Munster Bovine’s FarmOps
 The Breeding and Fertility module in Farmops is designed to help herdowners achieve the best possible outcome from the breeding season. This is achieved by providing herdowners with live relevant insights during the breeding season for both cows and heifers.
The Key breeding metrics provided are:
 Number of heats expected per day: This calculation is performed daily in FarmOps and will give herdowners an invaluable barometer to benchmark heat detection efficiency.
 Cows due to repeat: This gives the number of animals served or recorded in heat 18-24 days ago that are due to repeat. You can also view the actual list of cows or heifers.
 Valid serves: A valid serve is a serve that can result in a pregnancy. For example, if a cow was served twice in 2 days, only one of these serves can result in a pregnancy. FarmOps will calculate the herds total serves, total valid serves and what the target valid serves should be.
 Cows calved 35 days not served: This is a critical action list. It is these cows that require timely veterinary intervention during the breeding season.
Potential empty cows: This calculation is performed daily by FarmOps. It is the number of cows, based on a 60% conception rate, that have yet to go in calf. This metric along with the number of heats expected per day are powerful motivating metrics to maintain heat detection intensity.
 Stock bull required: This is the number of mature stock bulls required based on the number of potential empty cow. This is a key metric when deciding when to stop AI and release the stock bull(s).
Munster Bovine: The FarmOps app is suitable for all dairy and beef farmers across the country and comes with a three-month free trial.
If you are on the Tech Service, simply download FarmOps and you will get these metrics. If DIY, start recording serves to see these metrics in FarmOps.
The FarmOps app is suitable for all dairy and beef farmers across the country and comes with a three-month free trial. Munster Bovine dairy customers who participate in a milk recording programme and use Munster Bovine breeding services get the app for FREE for all of 2021. The app is also available for FREE for all of 2021 to beef customers who use Munster Bovine breeding services i.e. a minimum of 20 straws / AI tech serves.
Farmers can continue to use existing apps while trying out FarmOps this breeding season, before deciding which app to finally continue using on farm.
Milk Recording and Herd Health Programmes with Munster Bovine 
Changing legislation regarding the use of antibiotics is coming into effect in January 2022, which will seriously curtail the use of antibiotics on farm. The information generated from early Milk Recording is gold and will help you, your Vet and your advisor to manage your herd to lower SCC, reduce mastitis incidence, improve dry period performance and help ultimately in becoming less reliant on antibiotics.
Our Herd Health programme is all about helping herdowners achieve the best possible performance from their herds through maximising health and management. The Munster Bovine Herd Health programme has been running since 2013 with approximately 2500 herd owners set to avail of the service in 2021. The greatest testament to the Herd Health programme is that once farmers join, they continue to use the service year after year.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40261199.html,2021-04-08 14:48:00,Why can’t beef business run as smoothly as dairy industry?,"Beef processors got a telling-off from Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue at the Beef Taskforce meeting in March, about the manner in which they informed farmers about a February price cut, and about changes to breed bonuses and weight limits.
With the minister always at pains to explain that prices for beef are a commercial matter which he or his Department has no role in determining, that was probably as stiff as he can get with processors, unless his temper gets the better of him.
And well it might, because the beef industry is by far the greatest source of complaints to the minister from all the stakeholders he has to keep happy.
There’s a new beef crisis every few months.
Meanwhile, the rest of the agri-food industry runs relatively smoothly.
As if that wasn’t enough, the beef business, and the meat industry generally, is portrayed as a bogey-man by the opposition politicians forever looking to trip up the Government and its ministers.
Yet, some would say that the Minister (but even more so, the EU whose funds the Minister distributes) effectively subsidises the beef industry, by throwing money at the farmers who never stop complaining that processors don’t pay them enough for their beef cattle.
The main reason these farmers can still survive is reliance on the €1.2 billion in direct payments that comes from the EU, distributed via the Minister’s Department.
They also draw heavily from the Government allocation of more than €450 million for schemes like GLAS and ANC, supporting livestock farmers mainly.
The majority of beneficiaries from €79 million in new funding for pilot measures in the agri environment area (including the new results-based pilot programme) will also be livestock farmers.
Then again, these farmers are the lifeblood of many rural communities, as the minister said last week when presenting expenditure estimates for his Department in 2021.
Hence the 2021 estimate provides €102m for them, in targeted supports, including more than €85m to support sustainable beef farming.
It is only sustainable with the help of EU and national money, such as €40m for the extension of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme, €40m for the BEEP-S Scheme, and €5m for the new weighing measure to support beef farmers rearing dairy calves. 
There’s also €6 million to promote Irish suckler beef abroad.
And beef farmers will get their share too of the €80m annual provision for the TAMS scheme to support investment on farms.
The beef industry also depends on government funding for the Meat Inspection Service, and the Department’s laboratories, and the 70-year-old bovine TB eradication scheme.
Even the EU has got tired of propping up the TB scheme, having reduced its annual spend to about €7m of the €92m cost in 2019, with farmers paying €35m and the state €50m. With the incidence of the disease in herds rising since 2016, these sums are climbing each year.
For every million that his government has to find for beef farmers, the minister has to fight hard, especially now with Covid-19 having left the economy in recession, and the public debt level one of the highest in the world.
Targeted schemes to support beef farming were even more costly last year, with a once-off €46.6m beef finisher scheme in the middle of last year, to make up for low prices paid for their cattle.
The Minister will justifiably say that it’s all worthwhile to protect €14.2 billion of food and drink exports, of which meat and livestock accounted for €3.4bn.
However, he may well ask why can’t the beef business run as smoothly as dairy (€5bn of exports); or the drinks business (€1.3bn of exports), and not be so dependent on government and EU subsidies?
When the price for beef cattle dropped from €4 per kg in January to €3.70 in February, the Government came under renewed fire from beef farmers’ representatives.
From the Taoiseach down, the Government held the line that all markets fluctuate, and the beef market is especially exposed due to reliance on international trade and the food service and hospitality markets, where the uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 crisis and Brexit are even greater.
They were proved right, with statistics recently revealing that Irish beef exports plummeted nearly 40% in January to the UK, which takes nearly half of Ireland’s beef production.
However, there will be no let-up in pressure on the Government to get tough with the beef industry, after the latest EU figures show prices for beef cattle here in the week ending March 21 were 12% behind the price in Northern Ireland, and more than 15% behind the price in Great Britain.
The price here is only a fraction ahead of the EU average.
The Government keeps pointing to its hundreds of millions of euros every year to support beef farmer incomes, when many would prefer to see a forensic examination of prices paid for beef cattle, rather than much of the tangential investigations stemming from the Beef Taskforce.
Maybe the Government is kicking that can down the road until it appoints a National Food Ombudsman (NFO), as promised in the Programme for Government (and as part of enforcing the EU’s Unfair Trading Practices Directive in Ireland).
The minister is quick to point out that neither the NFO, nor any public authority, will have the power to determine the prices paid by meat processors, but has said he is considering how to include price transparency and reporting as part of the Food Ombudsman’s functions.

Currently, Glanbia Ireland has 253 farm families supplying milk in the county and it has delivered “a solid performance” in 2020 despite global disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Revenue for 2020 stood at €1.9bn, down 2.9% - a 2.1% drop was caused by volume decline with the balance due to “modest price deflation over the period”.
The company also reported profit after tax of €61m.
There was a sales decline in the Agribusiness side of the business because of very favourable weather conditions which led to good grass growth and a reduction in demand for both feed and fertiliser.
The domestic foodservice element of the Consumer business was significantly affected by the three lockdowns during much of 2020, but was cushioned by higher retail demand.
Glanbia Ireland is reporting profit after tax of €61m for 2020.  File Picture.  
The milk price paid for the year averaged out at 35c/L, inclusive of VAT.
“Covid-19 significantly added to our operational challenges in 2020 but the speed at which the management team acted and adapted to safeguard the health and wellbeing of all was exemplary,” Glanbia Ireland CEO, Jim Bergin, said.
“Keeping milk on the shelves throughout the past year has been exceptionally challenging and tremendous credit goes to everyone who played their part.
“Milk volumes in 2020 increased by 4.9% on a like-for-like basis and the Group paid over €1.083bn to milk suppliers - an increase of 3.8% on 2019.
“This represents a significant source of income for farm families, for our rural and regional economies and highlights the impact of dairy farming on villages and towns throughout rural Ireland where our suppliers live, work and spend their farm income.” 
Meanwhile, other highlights for Glanbia in 2020 include the contribution of over €1.08bn to the rural economy in the form of milk payments - up €50m from 2019; achieving Origin Green Gold Membership Status; surpassing the 3bn/L processing threshold; the shortlisting of the Twenty20 Beef Club in association with Kepak in the ‘Economic Value Creation - Support for Farmer Members’ category of the European Award organised by Cogeca; capital investment of €35m; construction of a new €15m Innovation Centre in Ballyragget, Co Kilkenny which is expected to deliver significant capabilities when it comes on stream in late 2021; the purchase of 248,300t of grain; and the sale of 395,000t of dairy products.
“Investment in our digital platforms paid dividends; these included our fresh doorstep delivery business mymilkman.ie; our agri and gardening input business; Glanbia Connect; and a new business-to-business ingredients trading platform - Glanbia Direct,” the CEO continued.
“Each recorded significant growth.
“Customers really turned to trusted brands during the pandemic and this helped boost revenue.
“We have rallied in the face of adverse global as well as domestic conditions, with substantial growth in sales of UHT milk and cream into SouthEast Asia.
“The Truly Grass Fed brand continues to be well-received in the US marketplace with good momentum building as distribution grows.”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/healthandwellbeing/arid-40261436.html,2021-04-11 08:00:00,Are plant-based meat substitutes actually good for us?,"The message is loud and clear. We must eat less meat to save the planet and protect our health. But what if the plant-based meat substitutes available in our supermarkets fail to deliver enough protein to sustain us?
A recent report by Safefood Ireland (Vegetarian meat substitutes: Products available in supermarkets on the island of Ireland and consumer behaviours and perceptions) examined the nutritional content of 354 of these products and found that 28% are not an adequate source of protein, which means they shouldn’t be regarded as meat substitutes at all.
Not long ago, this might not have made headlines. Meat-free products were far from mainstream, consisting of a few Quorn products in the freezer section of the supermarket. Now, meat-free burgers, sausages, and mince are everywhere.
Celebrities and influencers have led the way in convincing us to try a plant-based diet. Rosanna Davison, Beyonce, and Bill Clinton are just a few who have spoken publicly about why they no longer eat meat.
Science backs up their claims. A 2019 study published by the John Hopkins School of Health in America found eating more plants and less meat reduced the risk of stroke, heart attack, and heart failure by 16%.
Another study published in the same year by the EAT Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, and Health highlighted that meat consumption needed to be halved if greenhouse gas emissions were to be reduced.
Savvy food producers are catering for the increasing number of consumers who are curbing their meat consumption in response to this growing body of research. In 2019, Bord Bia reported that vegan was the third fastest-growing, on-pack claim for food and drink launches.
It's this development is that prompted Safefood’s research. “Vegan foods are no longer niche,” says Joana Caldeira Fernandes da Silva, chief specialist in nutrition at Safefood. “There are lots of ready-to-eat vegan products out there.”
Safefood wanted to find out why people were eating these products. “Do people perceive them as healthier because they are meat free and how healthy are they really?” says da Silva. “We looked at their nutritional profiles to investigate.”
Safefood interviewed 802 people and of those who ate meat substitute products, 41% ate them at least once a week, with 7% eating them daily. Their top three reasons for doing so were because they thought these products were healthier (33%), they liked the taste (21%), and environmental concerns (15%).
From a nutrition point of view, a food must meet certain criteria for it to be recognised as a significant provider of protein in the diet. If the percentage of energy that comes from protein ranges from 12% to 19%, it is regarded as 'a source of protein'. If that percentage is 20% or more, it is regarded as 'high in protein'. If foods do not meet either of these thresholds, they are not significant providers of protein.
In Safefood’s survey of 354 meat substitute products, 23% were a source of protein. Some 49% were high in protein, and the remaining 28% were neither a source of nor high in protein.
“This is a problem if people rely on these foods to replace meat protein in their diets,” says da Silva.
Why protein matters 
Protein is a vital nutrient. “It’s essential for so many body functions,” says dietitian Paul Mee. “It helps produce hormones which send messages to different parts of the body, enzymes for digestion, and antibodies for the immune system. It’s a structural component in cells and we need it to build and repair muscle.” 
The amount we need depends on our age, body composition, and exercise levels. “The guideline is 0.83gram per kilogram of body weight per day, that’s 50g to 60g for the average person,” says Mee. “Children and adolescents need more as they are building muscles and older people too as they want to maintain muscle mass.” 
Protein is found in meat, fish, dairy products, nuts and seeds, legumes like lentils and beans, and wholegrains such as oats, wheat, and quinoa. “According to the food pyramid, we need two servings of these a day to meet our protein needs,” says Mee.
A plant-based diet makes this slightly more complicated. “Animal proteins contain all nine essential amino acids but only some plant proteins like tofu do,” says Mee. “This means you have to mix and match plant sources to get all the essential amino acids. But this isn’t a problem for vegans who plan their meals carefully.” 
Dr Alan Desmond, a consultant gastroenterologist and author of The Plant-Based Diet Revolution, says there no need for concern.  “A healthy and varied vegetarian diet consisting of wholegrains, fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds will give your body the protein and amino acids your body needs to thrive,” he says.
As part of the research he did for his book, Dr Desmond looked at the diets of some of the world’s healthiest people, including those living along the Mediterranean. “They eat a predominantly whole-food plant-based diet and consume between 70 and 80g of protein a day,” he says.
One reason why 28% of meat substitute products not qualifying as a source of protein, says da Silva, is the addition of ingredients to make their consistency and texture more like meat. “If they add potato, they may not add extra protein to balance the nutritional content.” 
However, while these foods may not measure up to meat in terms of protein content, they can offer other nutritional benefits. 80% were a source of fibre, which means they contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g.
“This is a definite advantage,” says Mee. “Nine out of ten of us are low in fibre and would benefit from eating more plant proteins to remedy this.” 
 She hastens to add that she does not recommend eating ready meals in order to do so. “The highly processed nature of some of these foods is worrying and I would always recommend a natural unrefined diet,” she says. “Why eat any of the mind-boggling range of burgers, sausages, and so-called meat alternatives when it’s so easy to cook a can of beans? And economical too.” 
She certainly does not recommend meat-substitute products for children. “The emphasis in a child’s diet should be on less processed food with lots of diversity,” she says. “Peas, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds provide a good nutrient profile without being over processed or containing any of the additives often found in these pre-prepared vegan products.” 
Da Silva agrees. “If you think about it: a sausage roll is a sausage roll, whether it contains meat or not,” she says. “Like all processed food, it should be limited to once or twice a week.” 
Shop wisely 
Cost is a factor when it comes to food and most meat-free products fare well when compared on price. For example, Tesco sells 500g of Quorn mince for €3.75 versus €4.00 for 554g of beef mince.
Familiarity is another concern. “For people new to a plant-based diet, these foods may look the same as the burgers and sausages they are used to eating,” says Dr Desmond. “They can act as gateway products to vegetarianism and veganism, which is a good thing. But we definitely don’t need them for protein. I built the main meals in my book from the healthiest plant-based ingredients in the supermarket – ingredients like tofu and chickpeas - and those recipes offer an average of 25g of protein per serving, all without using a single meat substitute.” 
Convenience is a priority too. “People have busy lives, and the attraction of these products is that they are ready to eat,” says da Silva. “But we don’t expect anyone to soak beans overnight. They come in a can and there are lots of easy recipes for cooking them on our website.
Safefood’s remit is to provide customers with facts so they can then make informed decisions about what they eat. “We don’t want to put anyone off eating plant-based foods,” says da Silva. “In fact, we’re encouraging them to. It’s just that if they’re eating meat substitute products, we advise them to read the label and to choose the healthiest options – ones that are high in protein and low in saturated fat and salt.” 
Stay away from products that have too many processed ingredients, says Mee. ""Instead,  choose ones that contain fruits and vegetables along with good protein alternatives such as a mixture of different legumes, nuts, and seeds. 
""Look beyond the buzzwords of plant-based this and meat-free that, and simply read the label.""

LauraLynn: a game-changer for this mum and her son "
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40265672.html,2021-04-14 09:48:00,Marts Report: Positive sales reported again,"I understand that the children have been away from school for some time.
I know how they can get on your nerves.
I also crave that bit of time to be on my own.
Nevertheless, the determination of some to get their children back to school last Monday morning took the biscuit.
Not since the days of the California gold rush has such speed been witnessed.
Not since the days when Mario Andretti was let loose on the world has such vigour been seen behind the wheel.
The delivery, and indeed offloading, of children at the school gate, a bit like the letting out of calves for their first taste of grass, should be done with restraint.
Rushing has never been of benefit to either child or beast.

The youngsters of today have been cooped up at home for almost a year.
Surely five minutes more in your company isn’t going to drive you crazier than you already are.
I did my best on Monday, with regards to chivalry.
I encouraged people to go ahead of me.
I pulled in where I could.
I waved on fellow road users politely, and even smiled on occasions.
But at the end of the day, there is only so much kindness one man can show.
I understand the demands that are on people to get from A to B these days. I understand the time constraints.
But the same demands are on us all.
Most of us here in the countryside have to make our way to school by travelling along bumpy, narrow boreens.
It’s not a road paved like the Grand Prix circuit of Monte Carlo, so why are many driving as if it is?
Cop on and slow down.
That’s my message for today and indeed for this week.
I will now go to the marts but I am in right bad form over the mad driving of some.
We will begin our look at the marts with Bandon, where the only panic is about ensuring your mobile phone has enough battery life and data space to see you through a busy day of buying and selling.

Mart auctioneers were able to juggle online and traditional selling a few months back when restrictions were eased, I'm sure they will be able to juggle all once again, when we taste freedom.
When it comes to an outlet to sell your cattle, the more options the better. And as for buyers, when it works, the online system is terrific.
Alas it doesn't always work. I was approached yet again this week by another buyer who was less than happy and complained bitterly about the online bidding process. He claimed his mart was denying he had placed bids on cattle when he categorically says that he did.
Now whatever about farmers embracing technology, the folks behind our broadband need to embrace our need for a more reliable service. The online system hasn't been all plain sailing.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40265282.html,2021-04-14 11:20:00,Beef prices at factories gain at least 5c/kg,"Beef prices continued to harden at factories this week, as pressure comes on processors to secure sufficient supply to meet market demands.
Quoted prices have increased by at least a further 5c/kg, with the rise in prices across all categories of stock, reflecting the supply deficit which has been building over the past number of weeks at factories.
The intake was back to 29,492 head for last week, with closures on the Easter Monday bank holiday taking their toll on intake.
The supply included 11,600 steers, and 8,494 heifers.
There were 2,166 young bulls, and 5,906 cows, with supply reduced across all categories.
The supply of cattle to factories since the start of the year has been down.
That was expected, from the statistics available.
On the other side, the market challenges, which had been expected as an outcome from Brexit, have not materialised very significantly, at least so far.
Nevertheless, the value of food and live animal imports to the UK is down 11% for the first two months of the year.
The vast majority of these declines are in imports from the EU, with meat and meat preparations, as well as vegetables and fruit, being particularly reduced.
However, imported products are more important in the UK’s food service sector than in its retail sector, and the UK’s path out of lockdown may lead to an increase in imports for food service.
That doesn’t seem to have overly affected the market demand for beef cattle in Ireland, which has been strong so far in 2021, and those who gambled on late spring beef finishing being a winner are reaping some benefit, albeit badly needed in order to leave a profit margin.
Beef cattle prices in the UK rose sharply over the past two months (up 18% over the past year), and Irish beef finishers have been asking why their returns didn’t increase pro rata with the lift in the UK.
Processors have pointed to additional administration procedures and associated costs which they have to carry since the exit of the UK from the EU customs union at the start of the year.
However, the beef trade is always unpredictable.
Forecasting the future pattern of demand and prices is hazardous and rarely accurate. 
So it is only in the past month or so that finishers here have at last seen a gradual lift in prices, and a beef cattle supply deficit has strengthened their hand to demand a better price.
Steers are being quoted on a base of 385c-390c/kg this week with very few animals moving for less than 390c/kg, and some reports of deals returning up to 395c/kg.
Prices for heifers are quoted on a base of 390c-395c/kg, and they are generally selling at 395c-400c/kg.
Prices for young bulls have drawn close to parity with steer prices, with R-grade young bulls at 385c-395c/kg and some reports of up to 400c/kg being achieved.
The throughput of these animals continues to be relatively low.
The top price for cull cows varies regionally, with prices for R-grade cows in a 345c-360c/kg range.
In live exports, 70,093 calves left Ireland in the first three months of the year, which is 10% behind the same period in 2020, and 22% behind the same period in 2019.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/food/arid-40264946.html,2021-04-17 10:45:00,The Menu: Cork is the country's breadbasket and that's official,"Cork: the country's breadbasket
It is probably not the greatest pandemic-related hardship by more than a country mile, but The Menu is genuinely disappointed to once more miss his annual trip to the Big Smoke for the Irish Food Writers’ Guild Food Awards, when he gathers each year with his fellow food scribes to pass a wonderful day of wining and dining to celebrate an always splendid collection of Irish food producers and personalities. 
Selected and voted upon anonymously by the Guild members, winners only learn of their success after the decision has been made, ensuring they are amongst the most reputable and highly regarded such awards in the country.
This year’s winners maintain the usual impeccable standards and, as always, reflecting the county’s position as the country’s breadbasket, Cork producers are once more to the fore, winning three of the eight awards. The Menu was also especially pleased to see one of his great cheesemaking heroes, Marion Roeleveld, receive a lifetime achievement award and to see one of the growing band of Irish native grain-to-flour farmers, James Kelly, of Ballymore Organics, also honoured. 
Neighbourfood, the Cork-based online farmers’ market network with outlets all over Ireland and also in Britain, and founded by Corkonians Jack Crotty and Martin Poucher, was just about the only choice possible after the massive positive impact it had on the livelihoods of small producers when the lockdown initially wreaked havoc on the livelihoods of so many of them. Ballymakenny Farm’s excellent Irish heritage and specialty potatoes, featured several times in this column over the past year — and nothing goes better together than Irish spuds and butter — and handmade Abernethy Butter is one of the very finest to be found in this country.
The winners of the 2021 Irish Food Writers’ Guild Food Awards are:
Abernethy Butter, Co. Down (Food Award)
Ballymakenny Farm Irish Heritage and Specialty Potatoes, Co. Louth (Food Award)
Tom Durcan’s Spiced Beef, Co. Cork (Food Award)
Kinsale Mead Wild Red Mead, Merlot Barrel Aged, Co. Cork (Drink Award)

Designer Zoe Carol's handmade linen bread bags, part of her new range of food accessories, also including gorgeous linen napkins
Following a recent food foraging expedition to Midleton, The Menu spied a gorgeous linen bread bag — the traditional means of storing bread in many other countries. The Menu has been using one for many years to store his own sourdough loaves, having procured it from the West Cork Baking Emporium, many moons ago. 
This linen bag allows the bread to ‘breathe’ while the natural oils in the fabric keep it from drying out. This lovely pale eggshell blue bag was crafted by the enormously talented fashion designer, Zoe Carol. 
Zoe has also unveiled a range of very gorgeous linen napkins, available in packs of six. Suitable for day-to-day use, and equally for dining with friends and family, they make for a casually stylish addition to any table.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40267496.html,2021-04-18 09:00:00,'Rare opportunity' as 162 acre farm arrives onto the market in East Cork ,"Over the last few years, there has been strong demand for land in East Cork with proximity to the Dublin-Cork motorway system. 
The area enjoys a vibrant agricultural scene, with some of the most important dairying, beef cattle, tillage and equestrian operations in Munster.
The relatively rare appearance of a large residential holding, therefore, should create a stir in the market and there should be no shortage of interest in the probate sale of a 162-acre farm near Kilworth that has recently come on the market with Fermoy-based auctioneers Dick Barry & Son.
The property is in the townland of Cronohill, straddling the Cork-Waterford border 8km east of Kilworth and 12km from the town of Fermoy.
“It’s essentially a dairy farm,” says selling agent Michael Barry of the property. 
“The 162 acres is more-or-less all together. The public road divides it but it’s all together. 
""There is a bit of waste in it but there would be 150 good acres in the farm.
“So there’s good potential there. If somebody wanted to set up a dairy enterprise, there’s enough land to do so and getting a good block of land of that size in one lot isn’t easily done.”
The farm buildings include a six-column hay barn with lean-to, a cattle crush, a disused milking parlour and a series of old stone buildings around a concrete yard.
“There’s an old single-storey farmhouse there as well,” says Michael, “but that’s in poor condition. 
""If somebody wanted to sell that off with an acre or two, they could get back a good price if they had no requirement for the house… we’d have customers for those kinds of properties.”
The property enjoys a huge amount of public road frontage, running along its boundary and dissecting it in parts. 
This means that the property lends itself to subdivision and that’s something that the owners would not rule out, although the clear preference is to sell the holding in its entirety.
“We’d prefer to sell it all together,” says Michael, “but it can be broken up if that’s the way the interest develops…we’ve had enquiries both ways so far - we’ve had enquiries in different parts of it and we’ve had interest in the whole property.”
The farm comes with 58.83 entitlements, further details of which are available from the selling agents. 
For anyone looking to purchase a substantial holding, the price guide of €7,000 to €8,000 per acre is certainly a realistic opportunity.

Tempting 77.5 acre residential farm for sale on Iveragh Peninsula"

He shall not hear the bittern cry
In the wild sky, where he is lain,
Nor voices of the sweeter birds
Above the wailing of the rain.
If Mr McDonagh were living among us he would surely be heartened by the fact that the ‘dark cow’ has left the moor and is now ‘lifting her horn in pleasant meads’.
But alas he would be unlikely to hear the bittern’s cry as that bird became extinct sometime in the second half of the 19th century, maybe even as the poem was written. While the cow’s lot has improved
it has been at the expense of wildlife, including birds. The ‘dark cow ‘ of the poem could also of course be a reference to Ireland whose circumstances have also improved,
at least in an economic sense.
That 54 species of our wild birds are under threat is a cause for great concern and similar to the bittern, one of the main causes is the destruction of nesting sites.
For years we’ve known that the corncrake, the skylark, and the tern were under stress but now that the snipe, the swift and the kestrel have been added to the list of those birds with a high risk of extinction we surely need to sit up and take notice.
On a more upbeat note, it’s great to see some of our more popular birds, particularly ‘the gardener’s friend, the robin, showing no indication of departing from us any time soon.

Competition ebbs from bank market
Paschal Donohoe is standing idly by while bank after bank leaves Ireland. The KBC exit is another symptom of a dysfunctional banking market. The elephant in the room is its structure. Mario Draghi, when president of the European Central Bank stated that the Irish Banking market is a “quasi-monopoly”. This is not an accident. Fine Gael announced the “two pillar” banking system 10 years ago. In truth, they created an oligopoly and gave massive supplier power to the two largest banks. As a result, these banks have significant control of the market and can do what they want. We have seen in the last few years that they don’t want customers in branch, they have made it harder and harder for customers to do business in their branches and in the end they are shutting bank branches down left right and centre.
Ireland’s lack of competition is also a hangover from the last banking crash. Interest rate pricing in the mortgage market is significantly affected by capital requirements, credit risk, and the level of non-performing loans. But it is also affected by the lack of competition. Unless these issues are fixed by the government then we will see a further concentration of the market. Continuing low interest rates are adding to the pressure on banks that do not have a market advantage.
These problems exist in part because Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have a laissez-faire attitude to markets and they are ideologically inclined and deferential towards the large players. Just look at the crises in insurance, housing, or beef, caused by large players with enormous power and a government sitting on their hands which leaves citizens suffering massively as a result.
The market needs to be restructured to ensure functionality. This means more commercial players both internationally and home-grown. And it means creating diversity within banking. I have written to the finance spokespersons of each Dáil party to coordinate political will and energy towards the creation of a public banking system. I’m delighted that three parties have responded positively and urge the other political parties to treat this crisis with the urgency it requires.

Bold statement on level of lockdown

Tax waste creation at its point of origin
The Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy has reached the pre-draft consultation process and submissions are invited. I would appeal to any individual or group considering being a party to the process to focus on the central issue associated with any proactive national waste management strategy, where taxation is based on waste creation at source.
Without such a concept as the foundation stone upon which this plan is built, no society can hope to have a worthwhile input into the quality and quantity of waste created.

A ‘living wage’ and lavish salaries
The Tánaiste and Minister for Employment Leo Varadkar recently said in the media about achieving a ‘living wage’ for the lower paid, and that this could be introduced by 2025 under plans to be launched by the Government? What utter nonsense this is on his part; is he trying to placate the lower paid in society or what is he at? While at the top of that society; top broadcasters in RTÉ are already earning near to half a million euro annually.
On a number of occasions, I have aired my views about those top broadcasters in RTÉ, earning those unjustified and over-paid wages. The Government and the RTÉ Board should jointly bring in the ‘time and motion’ experts to arbitrate on those high wages immediately, and reduce those wages by more than half, thus saving to some extent the future of RTÉ?

Government must protect hares
The World Health Organization has called for an end to wildlife markets due to their role in spreading pathogens such as the coronavirus.
In 2019, RHD2, a new and deadlier strain of rabbit hemorrhagic disease, was confirmed in Ireland. Several rabbits and hares were discovered displaying fatal symptoms.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service stated that the virus is highly contagious. The government responded by suspending coursing.
But then the downside of human nature obtruded; as it often does in any contest between the wellbeing or conservation status of a species. A backlash forced the government to reverse the suspension. The disease continues to kill hares, with further outbreaks confirmed throughout 2020.
RHD2 does not pose a health risk to humans, but it could deprive us of a treasured part of our heritage. For a government including the Green Party to allow coursing while RHD2 is rampant is unconscionable.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40270940.html,2021-04-20 17:45:00,Quoted base prices for steers have increased to 395c/kg,"Gradual hardening of beef cattle prices continued at factories this week, due to pressure on processors to get sufficient stock.
The intake at plants continues to trail last year by about 4,000 head per week on average for the year to date, which is a significant slice off the throughput, more keenly felt because markets have continued to demand a strong supply of beef.
For the first 15 weeks of 2021, the supply has been down by a total of almost 60,000 head, compared to 2020, leaving processors competing more keenly for the reduced supply.
Quoted base prices for steers have increased to 395 cents/kg, with most processors having to pay 400 cents/kg to get the stock.
There are some reports of 405 cents/kg being successfully negotiated by finishers.
But it is not generally available, and appears to be confined to deals with some of the larger-scale finishers, or to situations where a factory is under extra pressure to get the stock.
Prices for heifers are at a quoted base of 400 cents/kg, but they generally change hands at 405 cents/kg and up to 410 cents/kg.
It is the third consecutive week of rising prices adding at least 15 cents/kg in total to returns, an increase urgently needed by finishers, many of whom still contend that higher prices are still needed for them to break even.
They are backed up by Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association claims that the gap between Irish and UK prices has more than doubled over the past three months, from 35 cents/kg to 72 cents/kg.
But processors say that it is not a like-for-like comparison.
Comparing Irish and UK prices has always been difficult because of the complexities of our trade with the largest export outlet for Irish beef.
But some further explaining is necessary when the price gap widens to €120/head for similar weight carcases. Prices being paid for young bulls have kept pace with the other categories, rising to around 5 cents/kg under the steer price.
Cow prices are at their strongest for a considerable time, with the better quality R-grade cows worth 360 cents/kg this week, and the price ranging from 350 to 360 cents/kg. O-grade cows are making 325-335 cents/kg and P-grade are generally in the 320-330 cents/kg range.
There was a slight recovery in intakes at factories last week to 30,390 head.
The kill included 11,340 steers, 8,966 heifers, 2,180 young bulls and 6,626 cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40272224.html,2021-04-22 14:30:00,'Most farmers already run ragged before taking on new agri-food strategy',"A draft Agri-Food Strategy has been presented for consultation by the Department of Agriculture, with interested parties invited to make submissions until June 15.
The strategy’s central objective is that Ireland should become an international leader in sustainable food systems over the next decade.
The sustainability element is further defined as having a balanced approach to economic sustainability, social sustainability (benefits to society) and environmental sustainability (positive or neutral impact on the natural environment).
The document lists a plethora of elements that are unquestionably desirable — environmentally sustainable sector; viable food producers; food that is safe, trusted, and valued; and innovative and competitive food production.
The document maps out missions and goals to be achieved. Case studies are presented, showing what is achievable.
As part of the strategy document, farmers have also been tasked with improving competitiveness and productivity. File Picture.  
As farmers, our attention is drawn to those elements which most affect us. 
The ambitions within the environmental sustainability mission that might affect us at farm level include goals to enhance biodiversity, reduce biogenic methane emissions by 10%, reduce ammonia emissions below 107,500 tonnes by 2030, reduce nutrient losses to water by 50%, and 10% of farmland to be focused on biodiversity.
The document further expands on these targets, suggesting biogenic methane reduction of 24-47% by 2050. It doesn’t mention reducing the national herd up to 2030, but reducing methane 24-47% without reducing stock numbers seems a tall order.
Other ambitions include a reduction in annual chemical nitrogen use, not to exceed 325,000 tonnes by 2030, and 90% of all slurry application by low emission equipment by 2027. All external slurry stores are to be covered by 2027, to mitigate ammonia emissions, and most CAN nitrogen usage replaced by urea and protected urea. 
A 90% increase in milk recording by 2030 is the aim.
Overall, for intensive farming, it looks like the brakes will be coming on.
On improving the viability of farms, the document suggests farmers move towards ‘premiumisation’, and diversification of activity and income streams.
The document fails to acknowledge that direct payments have been decoupled for nearly two decades at this point, and whilst every farmer can now switch production to more lucrative enterprises, the reality on the ground is that the number of farmers producing niche, premium products barely registers.
With such products, the power of the supermarkets in deciding to take or drop your product, the lack of scale, the costs of establishment, the costs of specialist equipment and storage, the lack of marketing skills, and not enough existing farm cash flow to effect such change, all conspire to leave farmers stuck in the loop of subsistence.
It’s better to make a meagre existence from continuing to do as we have always done rather than risking the entire farm to chase a dream that may not come to fruition.
Unless real financial supports become available to aid change, a move to diversification will not happen.
In the strategy document, farmers are also tasked with improving competitiveness and productivity. 
Farmers will live in hope of the draft document’s aspiration that equitable distribution of value is shared along the food chain.
The critic in me suggests we should not need to wait until 2030 before increased value is passed back to the farmer.
Meanwhile, expecting farmers to increase productivity and competitiveness is bordering on offensive, the underlying assertion being that there is more to give. 
Most farmers are already run ragged.
And expecting increased productivity becomes a much harder ask when we consider the changes coming in the next decade, such as curtailing antibiotic usage, restricting fertiliser usage, withdrawing key chemicals (such as glyphosate, probably) and increasing the land area devoted to biodiversity.
Within the mission to create food which is safe, nutritious, trusted and valued at home and abroad, are goals to create value-add in food through insight, innovation and product differentiation, and to develop market opportunities at home and abroad. 
While these goals are not within an individual farmer’s remit, they are intrinsically linked to the price that farmers will get for their product. 
In the world of commodity based farming, farmers will only ever get enough to keep their heads above water.
Right now, that seems to be predominantly where Irish farmers are at. 
Yet, our main products are world class beef and milk high in health benefits such as conjugated linoleic acids and Omega 3, thanks for our grass based systems. 
Are our national campaigns and individual processors doing enough to differentiate these top notch products as being healthier and more sustainable that competitors?
Ultimately, setting ourselves apart from our competitors by extolling our green and sustainable credentials will only be of benefit to farmers if the processors in-between decide to pass back a share of the benefits from the markets.
Farmers may have some hope of getting their fair share if they continue to champion the co-operative model, and by organising themselves into producer groups.
The strategy document is very comprehensive and worth a read, especially for farmers who anticipate a tipping point at which they will no longer be satisfied to just eke out a living.

Details of new REAP scheme announced"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40272284.html,2021-04-23 11:00:00,Trade figures indicate Brexit decimation of beef exports to UK,"Trade statistics indicate that the severe Brexit effect on Ireland’s beef trade to the UK intensified in February.
The UK’s imports of 11,600 tonnes of fresh and frozen beef in February were 40% (7,600 tonnes) lower than the same month a year ago, and 7% lower than January 2021.
Lower imports from Ireland accounted for most of the 40% decline, with Irish volumes totalling 8,700 tonnes for the month.
Volumes from Poland and the Netherlands also fell, by 28% and 42%, respectively, according to an Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board report based on HMRC trade data.
The AHDB said HMRC’s trade data collection has changed, and comparisons with historic data should be treated with caution.
But huge disruption of trading with our single most important beef export market, by far, is obvious.
Evidence from the UK’s Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) suggested that additional paperwork and higher transportation costs were the biggest challenges facing UK importers (and exporters) in February.
The UK’s Office of National Statistics said: “Trade patterns are likely to also reflect the impacts of the unwinding of stocks, coronavirus pandemic restrictions, and lower demand due to the UK and global economic recession.
“It is too soon to be able to assess to what extent recent trading patterns are short-term or reflect more lasting structural changes.’’
Difficulties 
Already, trade figures for January had pointed to Brexit knocking nearly 40% off Irish beef exports to UK.
Brexit and Covid-19 have combined to hugely upset our trade with the UK, which took an estimated 44% of primary Irish beef exports in 2020. 
Difficulties for exporters and importers in adjusting to the UK being out of the EU customs union since January 1 have to be taken into account.
Meanwhile, demand was reduced by the significant decline in foodservice during the lockdown, although this was somewhat counteracted by strong retail demand.
However, the retail market favours British-produced beef.
And how much of the market was supplied through January and February by stockpiled beef imported in December in preparation for Brexit disruption?
As the UK unwinds its lockdown measures, it is reasonable to expect that volumes of imported beef will increase, to serve the foodservice market as it reopens.
While import volumes fell in February, the average price of imports rose by 11% year-on-year.
This meant total imports were valued at £49.7 million, down 33% from a year ago.
Markets
Markets are also adjusting to reduced UK beef production, 5% lower in March compared to a year ago. Production was also lower in January and February, but by a lesser amount.
Declines in prime slaughter levels were steepest in Northern Ireland, dropping 11% year-on-year, 5% in Scotland, and 3% in England and Wales.
It has all worked out well for UK beef farmers, who have seen cattle prices rise by 70p/kg in the past year.
According to the AHDB, strong retail demand is particularly positive for British beef demand, but as the foodservice market reopens, “we might reasonably expect more competition from imported beef through these outlets”.
The UK’s cattle slaughter decline in the year to March has particularly affected the cow throughput, falling 7%.
UK beef exports in February were 59% less than the same month a year ago, but up 81% on January volumes.
The value of all food and live animal imports to the UK were down 11% for the first two months of the year. 
The vast majority of the decline was in EU trade, with meat and meat preparations, as well as vegetables and fruit being particularly hit.
Border Control
Much of the border control plan has been postponed to later in the year and next year, which could mean further trade disruption down the line, when pre- notification and export health certification for animal products will be required from October 1, and for low-risk plant and plant products from January 1, 2022, the same date when physical checks on a range of agri-food products and high-risk plants will start at Border Control Posts.
Physical checks on live animals and low-risk plants and plant material will not take place until March 2022 at Border Control Posts.
On top of these disturbances in the coming year, the continued stop-start of Covid lockdowns will also affect trading.
Meanwhile, Central Statistics Office figures indicated that Irish exports to Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) decreased by €107m (11%) to €859m in February 2021 compared with February 2020.
The largest fall was in the exports of food and live animals, down nearly 30%, from €289m to €203m. 
These exports fell from €570m to €395m for January and February together.
But this seems to have been offset by non-GB exports, with exports of food and live animals increasing to the EU, from €275m to €324m in February (from €553 to €569 for January and February together)
Exports of food and live animals increased from €20m to €24m in February to the USA (from €46m to €52m for January and February together).
Exports of food and live animals increased from €55m to €56m in February to China (but fell from €132m to €103m for January and February together).
To the rest of the world, exports of Irish food and live animals increased from €220m to €247m in February (and from €435m to €474m for January and February together).

€27m in GLAS payments will be issued to over 43,000 farmers this week"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40273247.html,2021-04-23 12:55:00,One week left to apply for Organic Farming Scheme,"Farmers wishing to participate in the Organic Farming Scheme have until midnight on Friday, April 30 to get their applications in.
Minister for State, Senator Pippa Hackett is urging all farmers to consider taking the appropriate steps in respect of the initiative, which reopened last month.
“I believe the future is bright for organic farmers; demand is strong for all types of organic produce, prices are often higher, and crucially, it’s also a less intensive way of farming which comes with lower input costs and which embraces nature and natural processes to produce food,” she added.
“I want to reassure farmers who are considering taking this step that there is room for everyone - beef and sheep farmers as well as tillage dairy and horticulture enterprises.
“I also want them to know that the EU is totally committed to supporting this way of farming, and organic farms will be fully integrated into the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) when it eventually rolls out in 2023.
“Applications can be made through my department’s online system and the application process itself is quite simple and straightforward.
“Those interested can avail of a wealth of information and guidance from my department, Teagasc or their own farm advisor and the organic certification bodies.” 
Meanwhile, the Scheme is an agri-environment measure under the Department's Rural Development Programme.
Additional funding allows for an increase of 30% in the number of organic farmers in Ireland this year. 
Qualifying farmers could receive yearly payments of up to €220 per hectare during the conversion period and up to €170 per hectare when they have achieved full organic status. Higher payment rates are available for organic horticulture and tillage farmers.

‘Even in adverse conditions, the pig sector can thrive’"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40274894.html,2021-04-26 13:00:00,‘Strong and favourable market conditions for Irish beef must be maximised’,"Cattle supplies at export meat plants totalled 30,390 head during the week ended April 17, increasing by 898 on the week previous, as processing plants returned to a normal week of production, according to Bord Bia.
Prime cattle throughput also increased by 226 head on the previous week, with overall supplies currently running 11.7% lower than they were 12 months ago.
Throughput levels for the past week were 3,267 head above the same week in 2020.
A total of 478,462 head of cattle have been processed in the 15 weeks of 2021.
This figure represents a decline of 58,627 head on the corresponding period in 2020 (-10.92%).
Heifer throughput has decreased by 12.28%, while steer throughput is back 6.63% on the same period 12 months ago and the appetite for good quality cows remains strong - this is reflected in current quotes being received in export meat plants.
Quotes for P grade cows are ranging between €3.20-€3.25/kg, with good quality O grade cows achieving prices of €3.30-€3.35/kg.
R grading cows are receiving quotes of €3.50-€3.55/kg, and maybe slightly more in some cases depending on carcass quality and demand.
The average prices paid for prime cattle for week ending April 17 - as recorded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - were €3.97/kg for R3 steers, and €4.00/kg for R3 heifers.
The same week average prices paid in Northern Ireland saw R3 grade steer and heifer quotes increasing to £3.92/kg each.
These prices were equivalent to €4.52/kg, excluding VAT.
Meanwhile, in Britain prices paid for R3 prime cattle saw further changes in the past week, with steer prices increasing to £4.08/kg and heifers increasing to £4.09/kg.
Across Europe, average R3 young bull prices are equivalent to €3.80/kg excluding VAT, which is 17c/kg lower than the Irish R3 steer price.
The Irish composite cattle price for week ending April 17 was €3.75/kg deadweight excluding VAT, compared with the Export benchmark price of €3.76/kg.
IFA’s Livestock Committee chairman Brendan Golden said the updated cattle supply projection points to tighter supplies of finished cattle for the year with 120,000 fewer this year compared to 2020.
“The projection is based on a number of factors, including the very strong export performance of forward store and finished cattle to Northern Ireland so far this year,” he continued.
“This trend is expected to continue, where exports to-date are up 117% on last year to 24,513.
“Coupled with the estimated 5% reduction in the UK kill for the year, this points to strong and favourable market conditions for Irish beef which must be maximised by factories here and returned in beef prices to farmers.” 
Meanwhile, the full reopening of the food service sector in mid-May in the UK is expected to increase demand for Irish beef, in particular.
“Beef prices continue to rise as factories struggle to meet demand; steers are making €4.05 to €4.10/kg and heifers €4.10 to €4.20/kg base prices, with higher deals available,” added Mr Golden.
“Young Bulls R/U grades are making €4.00 to €4.30/kg.
“Cull cow demand is very strong, with prices for P grades starting at €3.25/kg and moving upwards depending on numbers.
“O grades are starting at €3.30/kg, with good quality continental cows making €3.50/kg to €3.70/kg.
“The gap with the Prime Export Tracker Price has closed in the last week, but increasing UK prices and the additional demand from the food service sector there for beef is driving the trade.
“Farmers should sell hard in favourable market conditions.”

The gardaí will soon have a new Dublin HQ — but the circumstances leading to its location remain something of a mystery.
The €86.3m command centre will be based on a State-owned site on Military Rd in Kilmainham, south Dublin.
However, it has emerged that the controversial site was not even on an initial shortlist.
The Office of Public Works (OPW) and An Garda Síochána ran a site evaluation project in early 2015, according to multiple sources. A number of sites were recommended in order of suitability, with the results communicated to Garda management at that time. The Military Rd site was not among the recommendations.
The OPW has denied that a separate site selection project had taken place.
Leaving aside how the new site was selected, the Military Rd project has come in for sustained scrutiny in recent months after it emerged that the new build will not be large enough to accommodate the number of employees housed at the current command centre at Harcourt Square in Dublin city centre.
Ten years in the making, should the OPW fail to construct and fit out the new command centre site by the end of next year, a substantial payout will in all likelihood fall due to An Garda Síochána’s current landlord at Harcourt Square, Hibernia REIT.
The OPW first raised concerns with An Garda Síochána that its tenure was coming to a close in 2013, three years ahead of deadline. Nevertheless, that deadline was emphatically missed.
Construction at Military Rd didn’t begin until February of last year.
In 2014, the OPW had the chance to buy Harcourt Square outright, at a fraction of the cost of moving out, but did not do so.
The new build will be distinctly smaller than the current command centre was in 2016, and the number of gardaí on-site has increased significantly since then.
It’s the latest controversy to envelop the OPW and again shines a light on the overall management of projects, the ability to get value for the taxpayer’s money, consistent inertia, missed opportunities and little or no accountability at the body.
With that in mind, in 2014 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform canvassed for submissions regarding how best to improve the standards of accountability in the public service.
The OPW provided a submission from its then chair, suggesting that there was little wrong with how such things were managed at the body.
What's your view on this issue?
You can tell us here
However, unbeknownst to the chair, a second submission was sent to the department, from two of the OPW’s valuers, who felt there were most certainly issues with accountability within the agency responsible for managing the State’s property portfolio.
That three-page memo kicked off a seven-year odyssey towards the achievement of improvements in just one of Ireland’s many State agencies.
It is a salutary lesson as to just how difficult it is to shake the public service from its status quo.
In the submission, titled simply Property and Accountability, valuers Allen Morgan and John Dowds argued that the OPW had had a problem since the late 1990s with the property transactions that the body had been entering into.
Put simply, multiple OPW acquisitions and projects from that time were described as not appearing “to make sense in the context of the property market”.
“The transactions invariably seem to be balanced against the State,” Mr Dowds and Mr Morgan wrote.
Possible reasons for such outcomes might include mistakes in judgement, ignorance of the market on the part of a negotiator, bad negotiating skills, or even a compromised negotiating position, they said.
The submission's two authors did not believe that wholesale corruption was an issue within the OPW. Rather, they saw it as an issue of incompetence and unaccountability. Nevertheless, they included “corrupt actions” as a “potential” reason for case mismanagement.
When the OPW got wind of the fact that some subordinates had been making submissions to the body’s parent department, management homed in on one word: “corruption”. They asked for a list of all projects that the memo’s authors considered to be vulnerable to corrupt actions. When the list was received, it was considered, and no evidence of such corruption was found.
Mr Dowds and Mr Morgan asserted that the issues around management, accountability and value for money would always be present unless the Oireachtas public accounts committee (PAC) and the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), the State’s fiscal watchdogs, could find a way to successfully interrogate the nooks and crannies of the OPW’s actions.
Memo merry-go-round 
Back in 2014, the accountability memo died a predictable death and probably would never have been heard of again only for the Irish Commercial Tenants Association getting wind of it.
That organisation duly took out an advert in The Phoenix magazine, lauding the memo and its authors, and stating that it had sent a copy of it to every member of the PAC.
The PAC didn’t know what to make of it, so it sent it to the C&AG, which in turn reverted back to the OPW.
The body’s response was to commission what became known as the five-case review by the same valuers who had written the initial memo — five examples of projects that could serve to “identify accountability vulnerabilities in the context of non-optimal outcomes” — in a lay person’s terms, five projects where good money was thrown after bad.
As a result, a number of projects came on the C&AG’s radar, including Miesian Plaza — the Department of Health headquarters, which remained empty 16 months after its lease was signed (at a cost of €16m).
It was also subject to a €10m rental overpayment after its floor space was mismeasured, a fact noted by the C&AG in its 2018 report on the public finances.
From there, PAC got involved, leading to an excruciating six-hour session before the committee for current OPW chair Maurice Buckley in October 2018, whereupon the Miesian lease was laid bare:
Mr Buckley was forced to admit that nobody at board level in the organisation had any qualification in property valuation whatsoever.
The OPW argued it would “neither be possible, feasible or necessary” to have such qualifications included on the board.
At a recent PAC hearing, Robert Watt, now the secretary general of the Department of Health, was asked what consequences should befall the person responsible for signing off on the Miesian Plaza lease in the certain knowledge that the property’s floor space had been exaggerated.
“You’re talking about negligence and poor performance, not fraud. These are uncertain concepts,” Mr Watt replied.
“You can do your best and make a legitimate mistake.”
Asked what has changed recently to increase its standards of accountability to the public, the OPW said it “works to the highest levels of corporate governance”, with the establishment since 2017 of both a project oversight group and a sub-committee of the board — charged with addressing issues impacting on the State’s property portfolio — as evidence to that fact.
1. Proposed new garda HQ is shrouded in controversy

The property that the OPW eventually selected for An Garda Síochána’s new Dublin command centre is shrouded in controversy.
The site on Military Rd in Kilmainham, a little over 4km from the current location on Harcourt Square, was a late selection as a replacement for probably the most important Garda installation in the country, and was only settled on in November 2015.
The Military Rd site was not even included in the first phase of the selection process. The site made no appearance on the initial shortlist, though most of the other properties which were on the second list also appeared on the first.
It raises the question of whether Military Rd, which currently houses a computing centre for Revenue, and is in State ownership, was effectively rubber-stamped as the new site before the process had even begun.
To add to that, the site is not exactly flavour of the month with the gardaí themselves, who will be seeking to turn it into one of the most secure installations in the country.
For one, the new build will not be big enough to house Harcourt Square’s current complement of personnel. Two separate tender processes, separated by four years, saw the planned building scaled back in size by 10% to 10,060 sq m.
The OPW said the building it envisaged was based on the numbers of personnel based at Harcourt Square when the project was first mooted, six to eight years ago. They said the new site will take into consideration “extension potential” as one of the key garda requirements for its new command outpost.
However, Military Rd as planned will only accommodate 850 people. That’s more than 200 fewer personnel than were stationed at the centre in 2016, and the numbers have only gone up since.
All this means that a number of divisions currently based at Harcourt Square won’t be making the move to Military Rd, and will have to be accommodated elsewhere. The cost of any overspill will have to be factored into the final bill.
Meanwhile, rumours persist that the operational heads of An Garda Síochána are less than enthused at the prospect of their new home, which is seen as being too small, too narrow, and too close to private residences.
Nevertheless, the OPW has insisted repeatedly that the move to a fully fitted-out Military Rd will be completed on schedule for September 2022, three months ahead of deadline.
“This leaves adequate time for the vacation of Harcourt Square in advance of the expiry of the lease,” a spokesperson said.
Whether that target can be met remains to be seen. 
2. Eyewatering spend on moving gardaí from Harcourt Square
Pending the proposed move to Military Rd, An Garda Síochána is still in Harcourt Square, sold out of Nama and ultimately on to one of Ireland’s largest corporate landlords. Picture: Moya Nolan
An Garda Síochána has occupied the site at Harcourt Square in Dublin’s south city centre since the 1970s.
Its installation there is amongst its most important — as a base for its armed response unit, arms stores, cybercrime and fraud sections, and the Criminal Assets Bureau. However, the gardaí don’t own Harcourt Square — they reside there courtesy of the OPW, which is the property’s tenant.
In the early 1980s, the OPW signed four 35-year leases for the four buildings on Harcourt Square, with those contracts set to expire between 2014 and 2016. The property passed into Nama ownership following the banking collapse of 2008.
However, despite the extended period of time necessary to locate and tender for construction for a replacement for the Garda command centre, it was not until 2013 that the OPW and gardaí began discussions regarding the pending expiring leases.
At the same time, the OPW was given the opportunity to purchase the loans on the properties outright, for a figure rumoured to be in the region of €44m, an option that was not exercised.
The property was duly sold out of Nama to US firm Starwood Capital, who in turn sold the four buildings to Hibernia REIT, one of Ireland’s largest corporate landlords, who drew up plans to redevelop the site.
As 2015 unfolded, it became obvious that no replacement building would be procured in time for the final lease expiry in December 2016, and an emergency extension was agreed for six years, at a rent which had been increased by €1.1m per annum. The building will have cost the OPW €36m in rental payments by the time the lease finally expires in December 2022.
Meanwhile, the proposed move to a new site on Military Rd, Kilmainham, has been budgeted at €86.3m, while — if the gardaí fail to vacate Harcourt Square in time — the OPW will in all likelihood be on the hook for a penalty fee due to Hibernia REIT in compensation for the loss of its development opportunity.
The size of that penalty is notional as it will be decided by the courts — but, whatever it is, it will be eyewatering, and has the potential to easily match the cost of moving from Harcourt Square in the first place.
Notwithstanding the missed opportunity to acquire Harcourt Square outright, at the PAC in October 2018, the Commissioner of Public Works, John Sydenham, said “the key issue” with the building “is that it is coming to the end of its life”.
3. Eerily similar precedent for the Kilmainham debacle
There was a race against time — albeit over many years — to move personnel from Harcourt Terrace Garda Station to nearby Kevin St at a cost which ran 36% over budget. Picture: Leah Farrell/ RollingNews.ie
For the current controversy involving the proposed garda building in Kilmainham's Military Rd, there is also an eerily similar precedent — that of the former garda station at Harcourt Terrace in Dublin which was subject to a similar race against time to move its personnel to nearby Kevin St.
On that occasion, the deadline was comprehensively missed.
In 2006, the OPW, the owners of the site, instructed the Department of the Environment that at least three years would be required to move the gardaí from what was then one of Dublin’s busiest stations to their new home at Kevin St.
Despite this, the department struck a land swap deal with developers Durkan New Homes to provide it with a vacant site at Harcourt Terrace by the end of 2008.
By 2010, the gardaí had still not moved and Durkan, having grown tired of waiting, went to the High Court. The resulting enormous financial penalty was cataclysmic for a State already struggling to stanch the wounds which resulted from the collapse of the Celtic Tiger.
With the value of Harcourt Terrace having fallen from about €18m to just €2.8m as a result of the financial crash, and Durkan securing a minimum payout of €33m due to lost earnings on the 215 houses it had planned to build on the site, the final loss to the State was more than €30m.
Amid the finger-pointing in the aftermath, the Department of the Environment made clear to the C&AG it had made repeated requests to the OPW to finalise the land transfer before the end of 2008 and had made clear “the potential costs to the State for the failure to close the negotiations”.
The OPW for its part noted that, in the end, the gardaí weren’t out of Harcourt Terrace before 2012.
Meanwhile, the site at Kevin St was redeveloped in recent years into what is considered to be the most modern garda station in the country.
That build officially concluded in August 2018, but not before a row had broken out between the OPW and developer JJ Rhatigan which saw the project’s budget rise by €3m to €31m.
That wasn’t the final cost, however. During the OPW’s appearance last November before PAC, OPW chairman Maurice Buckley announced the final figure was in fact €38.2m — a 36% increase of the original budget.
4. Prison has cost us €50m already — and not one brick has been laid
While work carried out at Thornton Hall include an access road and street lighting, there is no sign of a single brick being laid for the proposed prison beyond artist's impressions such as this. Picture: Justice.ie
Thornton Hall is a 150-acre farm in north County Dublin earmarked for a new prison. All told, about €50m has been spent on the project to date without a brick being laid.
The location was earmarked for a new prison in the early 2000s to help deal with overcrowding and a lack of space at Mountjoy in Dublin City centre.
The site was bought for €29.9m in 2005, a price which State accountant the C&AG subsequently deemed to have been “at least twice the market price at the time for well-positioned agricultural land”. In 2015, the site was revalued at just €2.4m.
The C&AG commented when reviewing the deal that the State had effectively twice in one year ended up in land purchase negotiations with single vendors, leading to a far higher price being paid due to a lack of competition.
They were also critical of the State’s having advertised that it was seeking a significant parcel of greenfield land to build a marquee prison project as this would have effectively bumped up the price, when a more attractive outcome could have been achieved by discreetly utilising the services of a confidential third party.
Officials at the Department of Justice at the time defended that advertisement as being appropriate given that the site would play host to “the most significant prison development in the history of the State”.
The land itself has never been built on and remains in State ownership.
Part of the site includes a fully-realised access road with a dedicated underpass and street lighting which ends abruptly in a dirt track and is in complete disuse. The budget for that road build was €5m.
When the purchase of Thornton Hall was being reviewed by the OPW’s valuation team (which had played no part in the initial purchase) in 2017, the original official OPW file for the project could not be located.

In summarising the deal, the valuers concluded that the “price paid for the subject site was grossly excessive” and that “the manner in which the acquisition was pursued was poorly planned”.
In a recent communication to staff, the OPW board stated it is “not correct” to say “the Thornton Hall case is an OPW issue”.
Nevertheless, the farmland was put forward by the OPW as a possible solution to the need for a new Garda command centre location in 2015, an idea firmly rejected by the gardaí.
5. A measure of error is not the only issue at Miesian Plaza
Home to three Government departments, the Miesian Plaza was vacant for 16 months after the lease was signed. Arguably more embarrassing, a measurement error led to a rent overspend of an estimated €10m. Picture: Gareth Chaney/Collins
Miesian Plaza, the seven-storey headquarters of three Government departments, has become something of a symbol of the notion of OPW mismanagement in the past five years.
In 2016, the agency agreed to a 25-year lease deal with the building’s owners, Remley Developments, for the provision of Oireachtas office space at a value of €10.1m per year.
The deal agreed was heralded by OPW chairman Maurice Buckley at the body’s meeting with the PAC last November as being of exemplary value for a marquee building.
However, Mr Buckley had to concede that one part of the deal was less laudable — that the building had been measured incorrectly, that this mismeasurement would lead to a rental overpayment of roughly €10m, and that the OPW had been aware of the mismeasurement before signing the lease.
This situation, Mr Buckley admitted, constituted something of an “own goal”.
For its part, the developer Remley, owned by beef baron Larry Goodman, claimed recently that, had the OPW wished to reduce the rent payable to allow for the mismeasurement, stating the building was bigger than it was, it had never bothered to inform Remleys of that fact. In fact, the reason the rent wasn’t reduced “is not clear”, according to the C&AG, who reviewed the deal in 2018.
The saga as to whether or not the OPW can get Remley to reduce the rental payments has now been going on for more than two years, with the latest update from the developer being that it is not willing to attend a virtual meeting as its preference is for a face-to-face discussion.
It has somewhat overshadowed the other main issue with the Miesian Plaza deal — that the building remained vacant for some 16 months after the lease was signed, a period in which rental and service costs totalling more than €15.8m were paid.
Addressing the deal, The OPW suggested the move to Miesian Plaza on Baggot St Lower in Dublin had been “transformative”, with any issues arising an unavoidable consequence of such an ambitious project.
Last week, Patrick O’Donovan, minister of state for the Office of Public Works, told the Dáil that the measurement error “should not have happened and… I know they [the OPW] very much regret that it did”. 
“This is an issue, but I am dealing with it,” he said.
6. Overspend of €2.1m in Galway after 'haphazard' selection process 
Echoing one of the issues with Dublin's Miesian Plaza, Revenue's building near Eyre Square in Galway has cost the country an estimated €2.1m more than it should have so far, due to mismeasurement. 
The issue of rental overpayment is not confined to Miesian Plaza. A very similar problem raised its head ten years previously with the leasing of a new headquarters for the Revenue Commissioners in Galway city.
The securing of the office at Fairgreen, just off Eyre Square, under a 20-year lease was the culmination of a five-year search by the OPW on behalf of Revenue.
In reviewing the transaction in 2017, the OPW’s valuers found that “from the outset, the selection process generally appears to have been haphazard, and to some extent client-led, and without the benefit of detailed option appraisal to inform a final decision”.
Specifically with regard to the Miesian Plaza deal 10 years later, the Fairgreen lease also saw a discrepancy in terms of the measurement used in order to calculate the rent due.
In reviewing the transaction, also in 2017, the C&AG found the negotiations with the landlord were based on a ‘net internal area’ measurement — but, in the signed lease, the terms agreed were applied to a higher ‘gross internal area’ standard.
Correspondence from the time reveals that the Chief State Solicitor’s Office (CSSO) had queried that measurement discrepancy, as had the OPW’s own architects and valuers via internal memoranda.
The added cost to the State of agreeing a lease with a higher measurement was estimated by an OPW valuer at the time as being €141,000 per annum, a figure which would see a total overspend of €2.1m by 2021.
When queried regarding the rental measurement issue precedent, the OPW told the C&AG that “the matter is being examined”.
It is unclear whether the rental discrepancy was ever rectified to the OPW’s satisfaction.
More recently, the case has led to a number of seemingly contradictory interactions between the OPW and the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
In a follow-on submission to the PAC following his appearance before it in October 2018, Maurice Buckley acknowledged the “measurement mistake that occurred” regarding Fairgreen.
Four months later, in March 2019, a letter from Mr Buckley to the PAC stressed that the annual rent had been agreed by then Commissioner of Public Works, the late David Byers, and that “therefore the OPW are satisfied that an overpayment has not occurred”.
Responding to a query on the matter, the OPW said the Fairgreen lease “reflects the final agreement between the Commissioners and the landlord”.
7. State asset on Dublin's quays nearly made it to the list of shame
The 10-year Hammond Lane saga almost saw the prominent State asset — adjacent to the Four Courts in Dublin — added to the city council’s ‘name-and-shame’ vacant sites register. Picture: Moya Nolan
The site at Hammond Lane, adjacent to the Four Courts, is one of the best-known vacant plots of land in Dublin City centre, and has been embroiled in a 10-year saga in terms of its development.
First acquired by the OPW in the late-1990s from Maguire and Paterson, the matches manufacturer, the site had lain idle for 15 years before being sounded out by the Courts Service as the potential site for a new family courts complex in 2012.
An initial budget of €40m was agreed in 2015, though no progress was made on the site.
Two years later, the Courts Service retained a firm of quantity surveyors to determine an updated cost for the build.
The final report of that exercise, delivered in December 2017, declared that the overall cost of the project would be just under €141m, a figure which the Department of Justice balked at.
Discussions have continued since and, last July, Helen McEntee, the justice minister, announced that just under a quarter of the courts’ annual budget of €66m would be allocated directly to the development of Hammond Lane.
Whether or not a revised budget is available is at present unknown. 
However, the long-derelict nature of the site led to a different headache for the OPW more recently, when Dublin City Council (DCC) announced in 2019 its intention to place the location on its vacant sites register — an action which, along with the embarrassment of having such a marquee site in State ownership listed on what is effectively a name-and-shame list, would also have cost the taxpayer in the region of €700,000 per year in levies.
Indeed, Hammond Lane was one of the sites first highlighted by Dublin City Council in 2013 as necessitating a vacant site tax in order to nudge lackadaisical landowners into actioning their unused property.
Instead, a stopgap solution was found, with the OPW leasing the property as a builder’s yard to the construction company Sisk, for a possible 24 months from October 2019. The OPW said last November that it is “the norm” to facilitate neighbouring construction projects where possible.
In January of last year, DCC announced that the Hammond Lane site would not in fact be entered on the vacant site register. It has now remained unused for 23 years.
The OPW told the Public Accounts Committee last November that it has as yet “not been obliged to pay any (vacant) site levies”, a fact it said is “primarily due to the proactive management by the OPW of its property portfolio”.
8. The art of the deal in Dublin's Merrion Square 
A review of the OPW’s purchase of three buildings on Merrion Square highlighted its apparent failure to negotiate down from the seller’s ‘opening gambit’ asking price. Picture: Moya Nolan
In 2007, the OPW moved to acquire a block of three buildings on Dublin’s Merrion Square, adjacent to the National Gallery of Ireland, with the stated purpose of providing expansion capacity to the gallery should it have needed it.
That purchase eventually expanded to include four apartments in a block of eight such dwellings to the rear of the building.
All told, the various buildings and apartments were purchased for €22.1m, including VAT, in late 2007. The OPW’s stated objective was the demolition of the apartments, leaving behind a clear expansion space for the gallery as and when it might need it.
As part of the five-case review undertaken by the OPW’s own valuers in 2017, one of the authors remarked that an expected sale price for the three Merrion Square structures in 2007 would have been in the order of €12m, suggesting the OPW overpaid to the order of €7m.
The review noted that the Department of Finance at the time said that sanctioning of the deal “is on the understanding that the OPW is satisfied that the acquisition of the houses represents value for money”.
“It is difficult to see how the purchase of the subject site represented value for money and how this requirement of the Department of Finance was satisfied,” the review states.
In order to ascertain how the value-for-money requirement was met, the authors sought out the original valuation report for the transaction, only to find that “no such document was available on file”.
They concluded that the asking price by the seller for the three buildings (€17.6m ex-VAT) was merely an “opening gambit”, and should have been greatly reduced following negotiation, not least because the figure was €5.5m higher than the seller had paid for it just three years earlier.
Add to that the fact that they had been comprehensively refused planning permission for the site, which should have markedly reduced its value further rather than raising it.
Such negotiations do not appear to have taken place, while the entire deal seems to have been conducted without reference to the OPW’s valuation arm.
The three buildings on Merrion Square lay vacant until 2014, before being refurbished at a cost of €4m and used as Oireachtas offices. They were vacated early last year after a stairwell collapsed in the middle building.
Meanwhile, the four apartments to their rear were untouched until 2015, before being refurbished and are currently leased to homelessness charity the Peter McVerry Trust for the provision of social housing.
The OPW told the Irish Examiner the budget for the deal of €23m, as set by the Department of Finance, had not been breached.
The notion that the three buildings had been acquired at a price many millions above their market value “is one that the OPW… would strongly dispute”, a spokesperson said.

Bandon fish pass 'not done right and starting to fall apart'"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40275614.html,2021-04-27 12:00:00,Public consultation on establishing new Food Ombudsman opens,"A public consultation has been launched with regard to the setting up of a National Food Ombudsman in Ireland.
Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Charlie McConalogue made the announcement this week after highlighting at a Beef Taskforce meeting on Thursday that a Food Ombudsman would be in situ by later this year.
The new office will analyse and report on price and market data in Ireland as well as incorporating Enforcement Authority functions required by the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Directive.
The Minister said he wants the Food Ombudsman to bring a greater level of transparency to all parts of the supply chain.
“I am fully committed to ensuring fairness, equity and transparency in the agricultural and food supply chain,” he continued.
“The establishment of the new office is an important step towards achieving that.
“The outcome of this consultation will help to determine the principles and policies to be included in the new legislation and the powers to be assigned to the new office.
“I expect to announce shortly the transposition of the UTP Directive as it stands through secondary legislation; this consultation includes an opportunity for input from the public on additional functions that can and should be assigned to the new office,“ 
IFA, meanwhile, has warned the new ombudsman must be able “to hold processors and retailers to account”.
The organisation’s president Tim Cullinan said that while he acknowledged the move, “there cannot be any foot dragging with setting up this office”.
“It must have full powers of investigation, the ability to make findings, and the authority to impose sanctions,” he added.
“At present, farmers feel that processors and retailers are abusing their dominant market positions with impunity and that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has failed farmers.
“The recurring evidence of large retailers dominating the market with excessive buying power has to stop.
“This drives prices to farmers to unviable levels, often below the cost of production.
“At present, only 6% of farmers in Ireland are under 35 years of age.
“We will not attract young people into the sector unless they get a fair return for what they produce.” The public consultation can be found at www.gov.ie

A top price of €6,800 was paid for an in-calf red angus heifer “Gigginstown Red Gamer”.
Coming in second was Gigginstown Milsean, she sold for €5,800. I watched the sale of this heifer from the comfort of my armchair here in Kilmichael. She was an absolute beauty. I’d buy her myself if I had the money. But back to the reality.
With a 100% clearance and an average price paid of €4,000, the herd managed by Drimoleague man Joe O’Mahony is flying high.
An in-calf heifer that sold for €5,800 at Saturday's angus sale at the Gigginstown Estate.
Angus bulls from the Gigginstown herd are being sold privately, with Joe telling me “the high demand for well-grown bulls is continuing.”
Moving onto Skibbereen mart where clearly some superb heifers are also making headlines. When you see prices reported like those for a Belgian Blue heifer of 500kg selling for €1,400 or a Limousin heifer 405kg making €1,370 you know quality is appearing and pulses are racing.

And finally, Ann Keane of Clare Co-Op marts gave us the following two reports from Ennis mart.
Beginning with last Thursday’s sale of dry cows and heifers, “We had a big sale of cows on Thursday with almost 300 on offer and nearly 200 heifers.”
“Some great cull cows with good flesh on offer and these were well appreciated by buyers. There was a great trade for the beef cow.
“Heifer quality somewhat more variable, with quality lots still attracting very strong prices.
“A number of aged bulls on offer also met with a strong trade and averaged €1.90/kg, with a top call of €2,120 for a Charolais bull of 1,130kgs.”
Looking to Friday’s bullock sale Ann said: “We had just over 300 bullocks on offer with the trade very strong.
“Again quite a number of forward cattle available, with a very strong trade, and quite a few going north of the border again.
“Some quality light stores met a serious trade with up to €3/kg achieved for these, but some lovely lots available.
“The traditional breeds also meet a serious trade.”

The situation is that markets for beef are strong and the factories have requirements for intake to match the demand which has become challenging for the procurement managers at a time when supplies of finished stock are tight.
The bridge between the easing in supply from the yard finished cattle to the first of the stock off grass usually delivers the peak prices for the year. 
The opportunity for producers normally ranges late April-early May to early or mid-June depending on the growing season.
Year to date the weekly intake at the factories has consistently been down on 2020 and the tighter supply is putting pressure on the factories to source sufficient stock to fill their orders.
The result is that the scenario is delivering for the producers with an upward trend in the prices becoming the norm as the processors compete against each other for the scarce numbers.
The base price in all categories of stock has been increased by at least 5c/kg with some variations between the different regions of the country. 
The strongest prices are being paid in the midlands and upper regions where the supplies are tightest.
The base for steers is ranging 400-410c/kg. It is very difficult for any plant to get steers for less than 400 cents/kg and equally prices above 410c/kg base for stock being purchased on the grid is not easy to come by.
The heifers are following a similar pattern on a base running at 5c/kg over the steers.
All that said, flat pricing is nearly always the carrot on offer to suppliers when numbers are tight, and the same applies now, with particular interest in both Hereford and Angus, with reports of up to 450c/kg being on the cards for the latter, including all bonus payments.
The young bulls are generally making 395-400c/kg for R grade with numbers low and the trade for cows is continuing very strong with up to 360c/kg now being paid for the good R grade cows.
Such is the demand for cows to supply the manufacturing beef sector that some of the factories are reported to be paying up to 350c/kg for good O grade cows this week and the P grade are ranging 310-335c/kg.
The intake at the factories for last week was unchanged at 30,503 head. There were 11,495 steers and 9,061 heifers. 
The young bulls amounted to 2,183 head and there were 6,753 cows.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40280108.html,2021-05-03 16:19:00,How farmers will be paid to capture carbon,"Never waste a good crisis may be the motto of the promoters of a climate-friendly milk now marketed to UK consumers, from cows fed Mootral, one of the many products that cuts cattle greenhouse gas emissions.
The feed supplement, with extracts of garlic and citrus, has been proven to cut methane emissions as much as 38%, thus helping in the fight against the climate crisis.
If Mootral can get enough supermarkets and other outlets to stock the milk, and enough environmentally conscious consumers to pay a premium price for it, it will be able to get more farmers feeding the supplement to their cows, ideally at no cost.
The milk is already used by the London-based Gail’s bakeries chain, and can also be bought from the Butlers’ Larder specialist online grocery store.
Part of the marketing message is that if all 1.5 billion cows in the world ate Mootral Ruminant for a year, the reduction in methane emissions would be equivalent to taking 330 million cars off the road (17% more than the number of cars in the EU).
Another reason the company hopes to eventually provide Mootral Ruminant at no cost to farmers is that it has become one of the first companies to generate and sell credits eligible for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).
Businesses across the globe can purchase these “CowCredits” to offset their emissions.
A CowCredit equals an emissions reduction of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, based on emissions from cattle.
Mootral plans to turn their attention next to the climate-friendly beef market.
Along the way, the company seeks help from ethical investors in their mission to make the feed supplement available at no cost to all cattle farmers.
It’s a British-Swiss company, and “CowCredits” methodology was approved by Verra, a Washington, DC-based non-profit organisation that manages standards for reducing emissions.
It will be quite a while before the EU has a regulatory framework for certifying carbon (or methane) removals, to open the way for carbon farming ideas (like “CowCredits” ) in the EU as a new green business model that creates a new source of income.
It was only last week that the European Commission published the final report of a two-year study on how to set up and implement carbon farming in the EU.
Building on this study and other preparatory work, the Commission plans to publish an EU carbon farming action plan by the end of 2021.
It will primarily promote nature-based solutions that remove carbon from the atmosphere, to help the EU achieve climate neutrality.
Such solutions should be rewarded, says the EU.
But certifying carbon removals must be based on robust and transparent carbon accounting to monitor and verify authenticity.
The study concluded that carbon farming brings benefits such as carbon sequestration and storage and increased biodiversity and preservation of eco-systems.
The Commissions’s Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, said: “Our climate action must first and foremost reduce human-made emissions.
“But we also need to restore and protect natural carbon sinks, so that we can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in our soils and forests.
“Carbon farming offers new income opportunities for farmers.”
Ireland should be well-placed to take advantage, because we have experience since 2014 of beef carbon schemes, and the Burren Project’s role in managing soil organic carbon in grasslands, and result-based payment schemes for biodiversity such as the Co Leitrim species-rich grassland and marsh fritillary butterfly habitat scheme and the Shannon Callows species-rich flood meadow and wet grassland suitable for breeding waders schemes.
All of these were included in the Commission’s two-year study, as case studies of how to operate carbon farming.
One of the lessons learned is that any scheme where the intention is to sell carbon credits will need a system of carbon audits for integrity.
As well as maintaining and enhancing soil organic carbon on mineral soils, and livestock farm carbon audits, other promising carbon farming area relevant to Ireland include peatland restoration and rewetting, and agroforestry.
Enhancing soil organic carbon in depleted arable land not only helps climate action; it also improves the productivity and resilience of farming activities, of great importance in continuous tillage soils across vast areas of the continent.
The same end result comes from protecting existing carbon-rich soils, such as grasslands and peatlands, with appropriate management techniques.
Planting new forests, restoring degraded forests, and improving the management of existing forests also help climate action. Supplying biomass for production of long-lasting bio-based products is another carbon farming possibility.
The European Commission says pilot initiatives should be developed at local or regional level in order to gather experience to upscale carbon farming, and expand farmers’ knowledge and understanding of the potential benefits for them.
The EU offers financial support for pilot initiatives on carbon farming through the LIFE programme and the European Regional Development Fund, among others.
Then Member States can accelerate the roll-out of carbon farming practices in the new 2023 Common Agricultural Policy, the main finance source for carbon farming initiatives, along with State aid, private initiatives linked to carbon markets, or through a combination of these funding options.
The land sector is seen as key for reaching a climate-neutral economy, because it can capture carbon from the atmosphere. However, to encourage the agriculture and forestry sectors to deliver on climate action and contribute to the European Green Deal, it is seen as necessary to create direct incentives for adoption of climate-friendly practices, as there is currently no targeted policy tool to significantly incentivise individual farmers to increase and protect carbon sinks."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40281236.html,2021-05-04 16:20:00,Scene set for a price battle between beef finishers and processors,"Beef prices are steady at the factories for this week, as processors tighten their rein on recent price rises.
The April improvement by 20-25 cents/kg in base prices on offer for steers and heifers brought some financial relief to finishers.
But processors are always cautious at this time of the season to prevent “overheating” in the market.
The coming weeks, until beef cattle come off grass, normally squeeze intakes enough to put price pressure on processors, which will encourage finishers to hold out for price gains.
Some of that pressure was seen last week, when the intake slipped to 28,787 head.
Steers accounted for 10,916 head, there were 8,600 heifers.
There were 2,275 young bulls, and 6,107 cows, in last week’s intake.
The 2021 beef cattle supply has remained tight (heifers down 11%, steers back 5.5%), and markets are strong.
Not long ago, a weekly intake of 30,000 head would have been adequate for processors. Now, that is tight, factories can generally take up to 10% more, the result of better production of quality beef on farms and improved marketing by processors.
Early grass growth has been slow, which means that beef cattle off grass are likely to be some weeks away, a perfect market environment for a price battle between finishers and processors.
The quoted base for steers remains at 410 cents/kg in general, while up to 415 cents/kg is being paid to get sufficient stock. The going rate for last week has been maintained, but there is greater reluctance among processors this week to concede further price gains.
Heifers are on a quoted base of 415 cents/kg with up to 420 cents/kg being paid, but it is difficult to get above that. Young bulls are trading almost on par with steer prices. at 410 cents/kg for Rs this week.
The one category where price gains continue this week is cows. The best of the R-grade cows are making up to 380 cents/kg, with O-grade have improved to 355-360 cents/kg, and the better P-grade cows make 330-340 cents/kg."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40283057.html,2021-05-06 15:40:00,ABP acquires Slaney Foods and Irish Country Meats,"ABP announced today that it is to acquire the remaining 50% holding in Fane Valley Co-Op’s red meat business which includes Linden Foods in Northern Ireland and Slaney Foods and Irish Country Meats businesses in the Republic of Ireland.
The deal is subject to approval by the relevant regulatory and competition authorities and the businesses will continue to operate under their respective trading names for the foreseeable future.
“This development is the direct result of our successful joint venture arrangement, which has enabled all parties to improve their offerings to customers and to compete more effectively nationally and internationally, Frank Stephenson, Chief Executive of ABP said.
“The time is now right to build on this success ensuring that we continue to be a dynamic and innovative organisation as we face into the challenges of operating in a very competitive global marketplace; whilst also addressing the ongoing challenges of changing agricultural policies, Brexit and Covid-19.” 
IFA, meanwhile, says the full takeover by ABP is “further erosion of competition in the processing sector”.
“This consolidation of the buying power for livestock in the hands of a few has to be addressed by the Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and the Consumer Protection and Competition Commission (CPCC),” its president, Tim Cullinan added.
“It renews the urgency for the Minister to implement the primary legislation to provide the office of the Food Regulator with the powers necessary to investigate and enforce at all levels throughout the supply chain.
“The CCPC has continually failed farmers in this area.
“The figures speak for themselves: breakeven prices for beef are €4.50/kg, but this is rarely achieved due to a combination of factors including lack of competition in the processing sector; high dependence on large supermarket chains; and the powers they have been allowed establish and the importation to our key markets of sub-standard produce.” 
Mr Cullinan went on to say that in 2016, an independent report commissioned by the IFA on the joint venture raised serious competition issues for farmers.
“The main conclusion of the report was that the primary procurement market for farmers selling cattle in Ireland to the meat factories is characterised by weak competition and the deal is likely to weaken competition even further, through a ‘substantial lessening of competition’,” he continued.
“It was very clear on the competition concerns in the beef sector, the income pressures that exist for livestock producers and the impact that any weakening of competition would have on their livelihoods.
“The Irish beef processing industry is much more concentrated than that in England - which is about the same size as the Irish cattle procurement market - with large processors slaughtering more than 50,000 head of cattle accounting for 85% of the kill compared to 50% in England.
“In contrast, small and medium sized processors account for 43.3% of the kill in England and only 8.9% in Ireland.”

Bord Bia set to return to on-farm audits"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40282799.html,2021-05-08 13:00:00,Early silage  still the way to go...,"Hailstone and sleet hit us several times earlier this week. 
Grass growth remains poor, and most still wouldn’t have growth rates greater than demand. 
We could really do with a big rise in daytime temperatures, and once this happens, there will be an explosion of grass.
Meanwhile, the year is moving on and silage production must now be high on the agenda for beef and dairy farmers. Mowers have already been in action, harvesting early crops.
Silage reserves and quality
The common aim for farmers I have been speaking to lately is to make top quality feeding.
For two reasons. Firstly, most yards still have a good reserve of silage after last winter, and secondly, meal prices look like being high for next winter, and quality silage will help to reduce the meal volume required on beef farms.
Producing top quality silage requires careful planning, and for many, a change from their regular practices.
Early cutting
So we have a scenario where growth is poor, due initially to no moisture and no heat. Now, we have had rain, but still no heat.
The sensible thing to do is to take a first cut now and get the second cut growing.
The fear is that when we get heat, swards will have much increased nitrogen uptake which will make it very hard to wilt and preserve properly.
If we don’t get heat soon, grass will become stressed, and as we approach heading dates for the grass, it will rapidly reduce in quality.
So get ready, strip the pit and get the new covers, etc.
If you are short of silage
When silage is scarce, most automatically try to buy more silage. It is important that you do the sums before committing to a deal for a cut of silage.
Work out the potential cost per tonne of dry matter and then the potential cost per UFL or MJ/kg of dry matter, and compare with purchasing alternative feed sources, such as maize silage, whole crop, beet or brewing/distilling byproducts.
It is worth noting that most grassland available for a cut of silage will be old pasture which has a lower population of perennial ryegrasses and, as a result, may be less productive, potentially producing lower energy silages.
The silage quality you can achieve determines your animal’s winter performance and affects your costs, either positively or negatively.
Silage requirements
Plan for a five-month indoor feeding season in the south of the country, and more as you go north and west. 
Given that several of the last few springs have been late, it would be prudent to construct feed plans for slightly longer indoor feeding periods.
For many, alternative methods of forage production will be the only way of bulking up stocks cost effectively, with animal performance in mind.
Maize silage continues to be popular, in suitable sites. It is becoming more common for livestock farmers to purchase maize from local tillage farmers.
Some are considering under-sowing grass seed with a spring barley crop, to produce a wholecrop, plus a few grazings at the backend.
A great option for many will be to source co-products such as distillers or brewers grains. 
They can be ensiled with silage or alone, and both are excellent energy and protein sources.
Some are considering forward buying fodder or sugar beet from local growers.
It is important to evaluate all of the above on a cost per tonne of dry matter basis, and then delve further into its value to you, by taking feed quality into consideration, and evaluating the price per unit of energy utilised by your animals.
Mega Joules or UFL per hectare really need to be considered in any forage costings. 
This must be a future method of accurately evaluating feed value. Cost per tonne of DM is too crude a figure when comparing feeds, as it takes no account of energy or protein content.
You should also consider ease of storage and of feeding, and consistency of supply of a feed.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40286813.html,2021-05-11 15:40:00,Processors wary of free-for-all on prices as prime beef supply falls 10%,"Processors held their ground this week, resisting finisher demands for price increases.
While there are some slight variations in prices for beef cattle around the country, the overall trade is more or less steady at recent weeks’ prices.
That said, processors are finding it very hard to get steers for less than the base of 410c/kg which seems to be their upper limit in their negotiations with most finishers.
The only exception is likely to be when processors push the base to 415c/kg for their best finisher suppliers, especially if a large number of cattle are involved, and the factory is under pressure to get sufficient cattle locally.
The price pattern is very similar for heifers, for which the base is generally set at 415c/kg, but with a few lots reported to have traded at 5c/kg more.
Strong demand continues for both Hereford and Angus, for which the breed bonus and quality assurance bonus add a worthwhile boost in the farmer’s cheque. The marketing job which both of these breeds have done over the past decade is a lesson to all on how to achieve a good consumer product and promote it well. Continued success to them; they are both delivering for their finishers.
With the throughput at the factories having dropped to under 30,000 head in recent weeks, and the supply of prime beef cattle 9.6% lower than 2020 in recent weeks, there is pressure to source sufficient to fill the orders, but the processors are, and will likely to continue to be, on guard against any spiralling in the prices.
With delayed grass growth, it is unlikely that cattle will come off grass before mid-June.
Until then, the supply will remain tight, even tighter than it is now, so a free-for-all on prices is the last thing processors want to see.
Prices for young bulls are hovering around 405c/kg for R-grade animals, with the throughput of young bulls remaining relatively low.
Prices for cows have continued to strengthen.
The best R-grade cows are now making up to 380c/kg, getting nearer to the prime beef price.
The total intake for last week was little changed, at 28,319 head, which was around 2,500 more than the corresponding week in 2020.
There were 10,099 steers, 8,056 heifers, 2,421 young bulls, and 6,984 cows.
For the first 16 weeks of 2021, the number of animals exported live has moved ahead of the same period 12 months ago by 3%, to 130,329 head.
Although calf exports are down 4%, the movement of cattle to Northern Ireland is running 125% higher, and live exports to the North for direct slaughter are expected to remain strong due to the big price gap."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40287344.html,2021-05-12 10:23:00,Reopening of marts to buyers will be marked with price rise,"""The fellow who coined 'A wet and windy May fills the shed full of hay,' wasn't too worried about the poor grass in May,"" silage contractor Michael McCarthy said to me the other evening as he waited for conditions to improve.
In a normal year, which this certainly is not, men like Michael would be busy by now mowing and harvesting silage. Bringing into farmers yards the fodder that keeps our show on the road over the winter.
But alas, this year because of poor growth and poor conditions prevailing at present, the action is on hold. The mowers have fallen silent.
At Skibbereen mart last Friday, this Limousin steer born 2019 weighed 705kg and sold for €1,700.
And just as the distinctive song of the cuckoo heralds the beginning of spring, the familiar sound of an empty silage trailer rattling down a narrow boreen heralds the beginning of summer around these parts. Alas, the rattling has yet to begin in earnest, so too has the summer.
And so we go to the marts where all is about to change. Next Monday buyers are set to return to the ring and this can only be seen as a positive in every regard, and especially with regards to price. Up, is the only way I see things going once the boys are back in town.
We will begin this week with Macroom mart, where on Saturday cattle numbers were back but prices overall remain strong. Suckler cows with calves at foot sold from €1250 to €1850. In calf suckler cows made from €900 to €1470 a head. 
Dry cows sold from €100 to €970 with the kilo. Friesian bullocks in Macroom made from €1.60/kg to €1.90/kg.
Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks in Macroom sold from €2.05/kg to €2.30/kg. Continental bullocks sold from €2.20/kg to €2.45/kg. Heifers made from €2.05/kg to €2.35/kg.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40292495.html,2021-05-18 17:15:00,Finishers need every cent and are not in the mood for soft selling,"Prices are unchanged in the finely balanced market for beef cattle.
Processors need the current level of supply to meet demand from the markets, which is holding up well.
In April, they benefited from the beef throughput reaching more than 15,000 head higher than April 2020.
But any fall-off in intake could leave processors in a difficult position, if finishers adopt a harder line on selling their cattle.
For profitability, finishers need every cent they can get, and are not in the mood for soft selling, which has warded off any processor attempts to reduce prices on offer.
With beef cattle coming off grass still likely to be some weeks away, processors are on guard against further heating in the market.
With unseasonal weather having brought showers of hailstones and frost many nights, grass growth is slowed by low temperatures, so beef finishing off grass is delayed.
In general, prices for steers are quoted at a base of 410 cents/kg.
Most of the intake is believed to be coming into plants at or close to 410c.
But there are some reports of up to 415 cents/kg base being paid.
There are also some reports of transport costs being partially covered.
In general, prices for heifers are on a base of 415 cents/kg with some reports of up to 420 cents/kg.
Prices for young bulls are on 400-405 cents/kg for R-grade, with the intake of those animals continuing steady at a relatively low level of 3,000 head for last week, albeit 800 more than the same week last year.
Some of the heat has gone out of the trade for cows this week.
Processors are not quite as anxious for supplies, and they have eased back prices by around 5 cents/kg.
The better R-grade cows are making up to 370 cents/kg this week, with O-grade ranging from 345 to 350 cents/kg, and P-grade at around 340 cents/kg.
Cows are the only category of stock showing an intake increase year-to-date.
To mid-May, the intake of cows was up by 6,000 head, with the current supply remaining strong at 7,567 head for last week. The total beef cattle intake for the week was little changed, at 29,971 head, with steers at 10,378 (slightly higher than the previous week) and heifers at 8,437 head, up by 500 head compared to the previous week."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40294460.html,2021-05-21 13:00:00,The advantages of early grass beef...,"Hailstones, thundershowers and lightning - you wouldn’t think it was the middle of May.
Ground conditions are difficult around the country after all the rain.
Thankfully, it looks like several weather forecast models agree that we can look forward to a warmer more settled spell from the middle of next week.
Grass quality continues to be variable, due to cold stress, and we are approaching heading dates which will make sward management much more difficult.
After all the moisture, an increase in temperatures will drive on growth, and a surplus will appear on most beef farms very quickly.
When that happens, I recommend you should walk your farm twice per week to assess grass supply, to help you make grassland management decisions sooner rather than later.
Grass quality for beef
So far this spring an summer, we have all underestimated the volume of grass in paddocks, because dry matters have been much higher than normal.
I have recorded grazing sward dry matters of 17% to 20%, measured with the mobile NIR4.
With the recent rain and subsequent growth spurt, grass will return to its seasonal norms for dry matter in the mid-teens.
When finishing advanced stock, it is critical - in order to keep costs down - that lower covers are grazed, at all times. 
Higher quality, more leafy swards are higher in digestibility, energy and sugars. meaning optimum intakes and performance can be achieved.
For grass to supply top quality feed, it must also be kept up to date with the required amount of fertiliser. 
When I do on-site grass analysis, apart from dry matter, I test for all nutrients, and I am discovering that many swards are starved of nitrogen, and they are significantly lower in protein, energy and sugars, because they are under nutritional stress.
This was also an issue when we had little or no rain last month, and nitrogen had not been washed in.
Finishing stock off grass
Many with advanced stock are considering the option of finishing them earlier than they would traditionally have done, off grass.
Factory beef prices are at their strongest level of the last few years, so many are looking at early slaughter. But don’t try to push cattle unless they have been fully grown first.
The best quality grass will be capable of giving up to 1kg of live weight gain per day on finishing cattle (it depends on the animal’s breed and sex). 
The target gain for beef type continental stock should be at least 1kg for heifers and 1.2-1.3 for steers, per day. 
A cost-effective response from finishing cattle at grass by supplementing with 2.5-3kg meal per day is possible, when targeting the right stock - provided that excellent quality grass is available at all times. 
If top quality grass is not available, it will be necessary to feed higher levels to heavy heifers or steers that are close to finish. The volume of meal needed will depend on the breed and sex of the animals.
At this time of the year, finishing cattle off grass quickly has many advantages, in terms of stocking rate, profitability and work load.
What meal for finishing?
Any concentrate to be fed on grass to heavy cattle must be high in energy and low in protein, to get the final cover of fat on stock quickly.
What you are aiming to do is complement the qualities of grass and balance its excesses and deficits as closely as possible.
Look for meals that include native barley and oats along with some maize meal as this will achieve target fat cover quickly.
Avoid fillers in these mixes, they are of no advantage in a finishing diet.
Inclusion of a digestible fibre such as hulls or beet pulp may be advantageous, depending on the volume of meal being fed on grass.
Always include a good quality beef mineral all the way to slaughter, to provide essential elements such as calcium and phosphorous for saliva production, and vitamins for enzyme production and an efficient immune response.

Farm succession: ‘The best thing I ever did for me and my family’"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40298219.html,2021-05-25 14:33:00,Beef cattle processed to mid-May running 6.84% behind the 2020 numbers,"Beef prices at the factories have continued as they were at the end of last week, with processors resisting pressure from finishers for price improvements.
A reduction in prices for cows last week was a warning to beef finishers that processors are watching the cost of intake very closely.
However, in a finely balanced market, factory bosses don’t want to risk further tightening in the supply at this time.
The 596,078 head of cattle processed to mid-May this year represented a decline of 43,746 head, or 6.84%, compared to the corresponding period in 2020.
Poor weather has slowed grass growth through May and, unlike recent years, when the first of the grass-finished cattle were beginning to flow by June 1, this year they will be delayed by several weeks.
Downpours over the past week also led to deterioration in ground conditions, while heavy showers of hail and temperatures were not favourable conditions for growth of grass or cattle.
An improvement in the weather is forecast for the coming weekend, which will be welcomed after the wettest and coldest May for some years.
The general quote for steers remains at 410 cents/kg.
There are reports of some large lots of steers being purchased on a base of up to 415 cents/kg, but that price is not easily achieved this week, as processors resist upward price movement.
Instead, the word is being circulated that current prices may not be maintained over the coming weeks, but that may be only a ploy to dissuade farmers from holding back finished cattle.
The trade is very similar for heifers, off a general base of 415 cents/kg this week with a few lots reported to have moved at 420 cents/kg, although not generally being paid.
The best demand in the prime beef sector is for Hereford and Angus, for which there is a breed bonus of 15-20 cents/kg.
It is interesting however to see that the price for young bulls is now on a par with steer prices, at 410 cents/kg for R-grade, which can be taken as an indication that processors are again more interested in young bulls.
Cow prices are steady this week, with last week’s price levels being maintained.
Better quality R-grade cows are generally at 350-355 cents/kg, with some very good quality lots reported to be making 360 cents/kg, and exceptional lots at 365 cents/kg.
At the other end of the scale, prices for P-grade cows are back around 320-330 cents/kg.
There was an increase of more than 1,000 head in the factory kill last week, to 31,096 head. The intake included 10,967 steers, 8,567 heifer and 2,817 young bulls.
The supply of cows was up 2,500 head on the same week in 2020, at 7,986 head.
Heifer and steer throughputs so far this year are back respectively by about 9% and 4%, compared to 2020.
Cow throughput this year has increased by 5.4%.
For the first 18 weeks of 2021, animals live exported were 4.7% ahead year-on-year, at 146,865 head. Overall calf exports have declined 2% so far in 2021, but the movement of cattle to Northern Ireland is 120% ahead of 2020, at over 31,500."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40299209.html,2021-05-26 16:18:00,Australia likely to be first new post-Brexit competitor for Ireland on UK market,"Farmers across the United Kingdom and Ireland are bracing themselves for an ambitious liberalising trade pact between Australia and the UK, its first major new trade deal since leaving the EU.
UK officials have confirmed that the trade deal to be offered to Australia would see tariffs and quotas on goods traded between the two countries phased out over 15 years.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to conclude the deal before he will host a G7 summit in June.
Australia has been pushing for a five-year transition, but the 15-year period is said to have been signed off by the UK Cabinet sub-committee in charge of the negotiations.
Currently, Australian imports incur tariff charges when entering the UK, for example, 20% in the case of beef.
The trade agreement is likely to lead to an increase in Australian meat imports into the UK.
Agreement 
Hugh Killen, the chief executive of Australian Agricultural Company, Australia’s largest integrated cattle and beef producer, has forecast that beef exports could increase tenfold.
In the UK, the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) warned that small-scale beef and lamb farmers in the UK risk being put out of business by the Australia meat production industry.
Only 0.15% of Australian beef exports went to the UK in 2020, however 14% of the UK’s sheep meat imports came from Australia.
NFU president Minette Batters warned, “A tariff-free trade deal with Australia will jeopardise our own farming industry and will cause the demise of many, many beef and sheep farms throughout the UK.
“This is true whether tariffs are dropped immediately or in 15 years’ time.”
A UK-Australia tariff-free trade deal is also a daunting prospect for Irish exporters.
Ireland
The UK is expected to remain the largest single destination for Irish food and drink exports in 2021 and beyond.
It accounts for 44% of Irish beef exports in value terms.
It is also very important for exports of Irish dairy products, taking 40% of our cheese exports in 2020.
The UK is still an important market outlet for Irish pigmeat, accounting for 30% of the total.
The UK accounts for 18% of Irish sheepmeat exports.
Most of Ireland’s poultry exports also go to the UK.
Other Irish export commodities heavily dependent on the UK are unlikely to be much affected by imports from Australia, such as the 94% of Irish horticulture exports and 68% of prepared consumer food exports from Ireland to the UK.
But the threat of displacement of UK sales by cheaper imports from around the world remains a constant since Brexit, with the UK also seeking to do trade deals with huge exporters such as the United States, Canada and Mexico.
UK
The UK Government has started a consultation process on its trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico.
Irish beef exporters will fear that an Australia-UK trade deal could hit our beef trade with a severe blow even as it recovers slowly from the January 1 exit of the UK from the EU customs union.
For the first quarter, the UK’s imports of fresh and frozen beef totalled only 40,000 tonnes, down 36% year-on-year.
Irish export volumes to the UK are thought to be down 38%, having slumped in January following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
But volumes have steadily recovered month on month.
Mainly due to lower numbers of Irish beef cattle this year (down by about 13%), global Irish beef exports up to April are estimated to have fallen 22%, to 105,400 tonnes.
But the fall in value terms may be only 7%, with higher prices helping to make up for some of the reductions in volumes.
These figures come from the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), which says that current high cattle prices in Great Britain offer scope for exports from Ireland to increase in the coming months, possibly helped by the re-opening of the UK’s foodservice sector, although availability of production in Ireland may limit volumes to a degree.
The AHDB also notes that Irish beef prices remain below those in Australia (but above the beef prices in New Zealand and Brazil).
Threats 
The threat to Irish and EU exporters was made clear by the UK’s international trade secretary Liz Truss saying the trade deal would, after a very long transition period, allow Australia the same kind of access the EU already has to the UK market.
Therefore, she said, she had no doubts that British farmers will continue to thrive under the new deal, because they are already thriving even while the UK imports over 200,000 tonnes of beef from Europe, which is a much bigger producer than Australia.
She said beef from hormone-injected cattle will remain banned in the new Australia trade deal.
She also noted that Australian lamb coming into the UK is currently more expensive than UK lamb.
Former Australian Ambassador to the UK Alexander Downer said Australia has substantial markets in Asia, and that’s where the focus will be.
“To send beef, particularly to send large quantities of beef and sheep meat, 10,000 miles across the world, is very expensive.
“The only access to the market we would ever have in the UK is at the very high end. A high end which is substantially served by the EU.”
'Nightmare scenario'
Sinn Féin spokesperson on Agriculture Matt Carthy TD has warned that a British government trade deal with Australia, on top of challenges of climate action and a new Common Agriculture Policy, presents a nightmare scenario for Irish farming.
He called on Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue to commission an impact assessment of such a deal, and to proactively engage with the British government on the is matter.
“It is also essential that the Irish government demand that the EU cease their trade deals that would further damage our agri-food sectors, particularly the Mercosur trade agreement.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40301063.html,2021-05-30 09:00:00,€2m guide price for 165 acre farm near Cork's  Rathcormac  ,"Good quality land in east Cork has been in big demand in recent years, with investors keeping a keen eye out for any substantial blocks of agricultural holdings that come up and with prices often achieving the highest levels.
A combination of factors come into play with land in this part of the world. 
As in much of Munster, the thriving dairying sector is undoubtedly the dominant one but added to this are the lively sectors of tillage, beef cattle, and the equestrian scene.
The appearance of a substantial block of land here is quite a rare occurrence so the current offering from Sherry Fitzgerald O’Donovan - a 165-acre residential farm in Ballybrowney, Rathcormac - should elicit a strong response from the market.
'Excellent quality'
“It’s a fine spot,” says Michael O’Donovan of the selling agent’s Mallow office. 
“There are about 95 acres of it in tillage. The rest is in grass.”
The property is leased out at the moment. 
It is laid out in 12 divisions and of excellent quality throughout, with a good deal of mature trees on its grounds. 
It has very good road frontage and is conveniently located, being just 2km from the village of Rathcormac.
The M8 motorway is close by, with Cork City centre a 30-minute drive away. 
Fermoy lies 10km to the north of the farm.
“There’s an entrance lane,” says Michael, “with a branch of it leading to the house and the main road continuing to the farmyard. 
""It’s a fine farmyard, although it hasn’t been used in years. It was a dairy farm at one stage.”
Variety of uses 
The holding would lend itself to a variety of uses, he says, whether it’s tillage or dairying or other.
There are no entitlements with the property, which has its own water supply and electricity. 
The farmhouse is a substantial two-storey structure that dates from the 1970s.
“It has a beautiful setting with mature gardens,” says Michael. 
“It’s facing south, overlooking one of the fields. The house itself would need modernisation.”
Accommodation includes an entrance hall, kitchen/dining room, sitting room, living room and utility room on the ground floor, with a bathroom and four bedrooms on the first floor.
The property has only just come on the market so the response is difficult to gauge yet.
However, the auctioneer feels that it will sell well.
Its rarity and quality should ensure a strong reaction and in this context, the price expectation of €2,000,000 (€12k/acre) seems a reasonable one.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40302473.html,2021-05-31 11:10:00,Closing date for BEAM Deferral looms,"The closing date for Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) Deferral is on Monday, June 21 next.
The current reduction period is from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, however, as a result of Covid-19 and the impact it could have on some farmers meeting their 5% bovine Nitrates reduction requirement, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine wrote to the European Commission in January 2021 seeking an extension of the reduction period.
The Department subsequently opened a facility on www.agfood.ie in March that afforded farmers the opportunity to indicate if they wished to opt for the later reduction period of January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, in which to meet their 5% reduction requirement.
And, since then almost 6,000 BEAM participants have opted to defer.
“Achieving flexibility around the BEAM reference period was a key priority of mine as I knew that a lot of farmers were in danger of missing the initial reference period,” Minister Charlie McConalogue said.
“I succeeded in getting consent from the European Commission to facilitate the changing of the reference period and I am now urging farmers to use this maximum flexibility to do all they can to meet the requirements of the scheme.
“Farmers need to take a proactive approach to avoid facing penalties; if a farmer considers they cannot meet the 5% reduction requirement by 30th June 2021, they should opt to defer and choose the later 12 month reduction period of January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.” 
The Minister also reminded farmers the Department’s BEAM Bovine Nitrates Calculator is available on www.agfood.ie and is being updated monthly.
“I would encourage all participants to utilise the range of tools available including the monthly letter to each BEAM participant outlining their individual progress to date on achieving the 5% reduction and to engage with their agricultural advisor if necessary,” he added.
Meanwhile, BEAM provides temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland, subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132.
BEAM was funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support and was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall in light of market disturbance.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40303640.html,2021-06-01 16:13:00,Prices 66c/kg higher than 2020 but processors are walking a tight line,"There is no movement either way in beef prices at factories for this week.
Processor resistance against higher prices is very firmly in place and, if anything, hardening further as each week passes.
However, the factories need all the cattle that are available, while telling finishers that the markets cannot justify higher prices for the cattle.
The gradual re-opening of the catering trade, as Covid-19 restrictions continue to be lifted, will probably switch some consumer demand for beef from retail to catering.
Summer weather will also increase demand.
Processors are having to walk a tight enough line in sourcing sufficient stock to meet market demand without paying better prices.
Prices this week are largely ‘as you were’.
The processors’ target is to get steers at a base price of 410 cents/kg. Only in exceptional deals are they paying a few cents/kg extra.
It is the same for heifers, at a quoted base of 415 cents/kg, with a small percentage of finishers successfully holding out for up to 420 cents/kg.
The price gap between steer beef and young bulls continues to be marginal, with 400-410 cents/kg for R-grade on offer for young bulls.
The downward pressure on cow prices of early to mid-May has disappeared, with some recovery in the trade for cows.
Top quality R-grade cows are making up to 370 cents/kg, with prices ranging upwards from 360 cents/kg.
O-grade cow prices are 330-360 cents/kg, while P-grade are making up to 330 cents/kg.
There appears to be a stronger trade “up the country” for cows in recent weeks, with prices a shade higher than in the southern counties.
The overall beef cattle intake is holding steady, at 31,076 head for last week, which was around 2,000 head more than for the same week last year.
Most of the categories are now showing a higher weekly intake than for 2020.
There were 10,865 steers, an increase of 600 on the 2020 level, while heifers at 8,091 were lower by 600 head, and cows were up 1,000 head, at 7,809.
There were 3,855 young bulls in last week’s kill which was 1,100 more than for the same week in 2020.
However, the overall supplies of prime cattle in 2021 up to May 22 were 7.9% lower than they were 12 months ago.
According to Bord Bia, the Irish R3 steer price in mid-May this year was 32c/kg higher than 2019, and 66c/kg higher than 2020.
Meanwhile, live cattle exports for the first 19 weeks of the year totalled 154,858 head, 6.8% up on the corresponding period in 2020."

A RETURN to Irish family roots for an international couple, to the foothills of the beautiful Ballyhoura hills by the Cork Limerick border, saw the completion of this very large family, which had languished for years awaiting new life.
The couple have a mixed background, from opposite sides of the globe. She’s originally from Fiji, but grew up in Australia. He’s from Effin in Limerick, and they started their life together in Australia.
Touch of Oz?
However, they decided to move from the southern hemisphere to the northern one to be closer to his family, so their own children could be with grandparents.
They settled on this rural Ballyhoura spot, with plenty of space all around as well as their own site’s 2.25 acres, and rolled up their sleeves, big time.
Originally looking for an existing, pre-built home to move into, they switched focus when they came across this whopper and saw the potential it had to be brought to fruition.
The gracious curve of the home's centerpiece staircase, in the double-height entrance hall.
The one-off had been started in 2007, not alone in the vaunting ambition of those McMansion heady and frothy days when the Irish countryside as well as its cities seemed to be awash in cash, and was set to top 5,000 sq ft.
It was in a shell state, they say, but they fell in love with the sweep of views from the land and rooms, and the idea of taking on a big project took hold…. “too many Grand Designs episodes,” they wryly suggest at the end of a successful delivery, to the standard seen here.
Those views include, on a fine day, the Galtees to the front and even Kerry’s Macgillicuddy’s Reeks to the back, while the Ballyhoura walking and mountain biking trails (done to an international competition standard) are on the doorstep, as are equestrian facilities.
Main bedroom has views of the 'Reeks
And, if anyone living here wants  a bit of more formal finery, well, they also have Doneraile Park just down the way. It's a pristine 400-acre country estate on the side of a heritage village and the Awbeg river, with strong literary links and with the period 1700s-built Doneraile Court (home to the St Leger family for 250 years) now back open to the public since 2019, as a work in progress with the OPW.
One of the three sizeable ground floor reception rooms.
The area is rich still in large period homes (though Bowen Court was wilfully demolished), so big and all as this Ballyhoura one-off home surely is, it still isn’t quite the largest house in the hinterland.
The family bought nine years ago, in May, with what they ruefully say were ambitions to move in by the time one of their children, a daughter, was due to start primary school in the coming September.
Aussie-like brightness
While she made the school’s start, the house took a bit longer to be fully habitable.
It took several years, in fact, with attention to detail meaning there’s quality as well as quantity here with a crisp, contemporary touch, just witness the gracious curve of the home's centerpiece staircase, in the double-height entrance hall, with feature double entrance door with overhead apex windows.
Barn-stormer: spot the blue sliding barn door? Blue period
There are extensive polished concrete floors, with underfloor heating and even though the floors had not been poured with any specialist aggregate mix for polishing “we took the gamble to polish and it paid off,” say the occupants, now vendors.
Accommodation includes a scene-stealing kitchen/diner, with extensive white and blue units plus island
It’s listed with a price tag now of €695,000 via estate agents Ron Krueger of Engel & Volkers, based in Kinsale, acting jointly with Sarah O’Keeffe of REA O’Keefe in nearby Charleville, which is about 8kms away.
Closer is Ballyhea itself, a tiny dispersed rural community along and off the N20 Cork-Limerick road, known nationally and even internationally for the weekly march it supported for several years in protest at the Irish Government’s banks bailout.
This home’s owners did their own bailout version (though the price they paid in 2012 is hard to discern as the Price Register has 49 Ballyhea sales since 2012, but this one doesn’t have a more precise name) and then poured money into its finishes – the agents say it’s finished to exacting standards - as well as building an Australian-style contemporary pergola and seating bower on the rear terrace, which may well give them a 'bounce' in the market.
Australian-style contemporary pergola and seating bower on the rear terrace.
It comes complete with a fire pit, possibly more used to warm human flesh on cooler Irish evenings than for barbecuing sausage, chicken, beef or kangaroo steaks….
Accommodation includes three sizeable ground floor reception rooms plus central, scene-stealing kitchen/diner, with extensive white and blue units plus island, . pantry, plant room and an en suite ground floor bedroom.
Multi-function!
Up the curving stairs are four more bedrooms, all with bathrooms: two share one in a Jack and Jill layout with shower plus a bath, and the main bedroom is to the back, with walk-through dressing rooms/wardrobe leading to a large private bathroom with an oval, free-standing bath and walk-in shower. Rounding out this level is a walk-in linen press.
The house has oil central heating and gets a very good B2 BER, and as well as the 480 sq m (5,005 sq ft) home there’s a detached 105 sq m/1,200 sq ft lofted garage with twin doors.
VERDICT: Put this inland-set  house close to the sea, and you could probably double the asking price. It equates to a €138 per square foot valuation, and most one-off homes now cost much more than that  to construct.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40310183.html,2021-06-09 09:08:00,Report states an absence of data has limited the independent examination of beef prices,"The value of beef animals for slaughter in Ireland between 2018 and 2019 was estimated at €2.1bn exclusive of VAT and the value of the sale of beef products from Ireland at €2.9bn in Grant Thornton’s independent examination of price composition.
Sales are €2.7bn excluding prepared or preserved products (which may be double-counted). The business services company said an absence of data limited their analysis in this report, which is one of three commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of the Beef Taskforce’s work.
The report said there is a high demand for Irish beef amongst customers across the globe, built up over time, and the quality and sustainability standards set in Ireland have supported in creating such a demand.
Most demand comes from near markets, which can purchase fresh or chilled Irish beef products. The UK market is the number one destination for Irish beef, followed by the domestic market. Demand from markets further away such as China and the Philippines tends to be for frozen product and hides.
Data available indicate a relatively even split in demand from retail (37%) and wholesale/foodservice (35%). Manufacturing accounts for 25% of the market demand for Irish beef, with the proportion of beef sold into commodity trading at just 2%.
Over the period examined Ireland slaughtered, on average, 1.86 million cattle per annum.
Animals purchased for slaughter are purchased inclusive of VAT, but beef products sold are subject to 0% VAT.
Grant Thornton said all Irish beef products in the period totalled 672,072 tonnes, at an average price per kilo across all markets of €4.35 a kilo. But data to determine the final value of Irish beef as paid by the consumer was not available.
Retail prices in certain markets are distorted, there is little or no reliable valuation of beef prices in the food services sector or in manufacturing.
Product sold into trading can be traded multiple times before it reaches the consumer.
“The absence of data on the final price paid for Irish beef by consumers globally makes it impossible to accurately allocate price points along the supply chain. The data presented accounts for only a proportion of the final supply chain for Irish beef.” 
Grant Thornton said their report reflects a point in time in the complex beef supply chain, and market and customer volatility lead to changes in demand and pricing over time.
At last week’s Beef Taskforce meeting, Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue said: “I am pleased to see that the three market transparency studies commissioned by the Department are now completed. Notwithstanding the challenges identified in relation to data availability, these reports will act as an important starting point for further work on transparency. I hope that this work will be carried forward by the new Office of the National Food Ombudsman or regulator, to be established by primary legislation.” The Minister said the detailed actions set out in the Beef Sector Agreement are now completed or nearing completion, and he has asked for a detailed report on the work of the Beef Taskforce by its chairman, Michael Dowling.
Last week’s Taskforce meeting heard from Bord Bia that the mid-May farm gate prices of €4.13/kg Ireland versus €4.64 in the UK and the EU average of €3.82 flower gains in the Irish price in March, April, and May.
The Irish prime beef composite price has exceeded the prime export composite price since April 2021, and the prime EU composite since April 2020.
The Irish weekly cattle throughput so far in 2021 has been behind 2019, but has exceeded the 2020 supply since April.
UK beef production is forecast to fall by 5% in 2021, and by 2% in the EU-27.
According to Bord Bia, market challenges facing the Irish beef sector are concerns around environment, animal welfare, and antibiotics; local preference by consumers overseas; economic factors such as consumer spending and price sensitivity; more competition possible in the UK due to their new free trade agreements; implications of future EU food policies such as Farm to Fork; and “meat alternatives”.
Potential opportunities for the Irish beef sector are the increasing beef consumption and import demand in emerging markets; becoming the preferred choice of consumers choosing to eat “less but better” meat; maintaining shoppers’ positive impressions and associations of Irish beef; and recovery of foodservice demand.
South-East Asia is seen as an area of market opportunity because of its relatively low level of red meat consumption, rising incomes, and improved market access. Also, African Swine Fever has reduced pork consumption in Asia.
Bord Bia said international beef trading, in general, is currently strong. Although there has been reduced consumption of red meat in Western Europe, there has been no such drop in the US, and consumption increased over the last 12 months in China by 11%.
Meanwhile, Argentina’s president has called a 30-day halt to his country’s huge beef exports, in order to reduce the country’s domestic beef price."

While most of its operations have been restored, the Brazilian-headquartered company said it hoped the payment would head off any further complications including data theft.
JBS, which supplies more than a fifth of all beef in the US, reportedly made the payment in bitcoin.
“This was a very difficult decision to make for our company and for me personally,” said JBS’s chief executive, Andre Nogueira. 
However, we felt this decision had to be made to prevent any potential risk for our customers. 
The meat producer was forced to stop all cattle slaughtering at its US plants for a day last week, in a move that threatened to disrupt food supply chains and lead to further food price inflation in the US, where labour shortages, high demand and Covid-related disruptions are taking their toll.

JBS, which spends more than $200m on IT and employs more than 850 tech specialists, said the FBI described the cybercriminal group that carried out the attack as “one of the most specialised and sophisticated” in the world.

Verdict
Forget the naysayers, both classics
You can never keep all the people happy all the time and BMW is all too well aware of the fact.
Take the company’s M3 model as a case in point. Since we first saw it back in 1986, it has been a hot topic for discussion among the cognoscenti, as well as those less informed who feel it necessary to impose their ignorance on anyone who’ll listen.
In essence, much of the M3’s history has been littered with searing criticism of BMW’s engineering decisions with regard to the various models (there have been six generations, including the new one) and particularly the pick of engines chosen to propel them.
The original car, the E30 to the true student of the M3, was originally intended as a homologation special to qualify it for the DTM, the German Touring Car Championship. It came with a modest four-cylinder engine which produced 192 bhp, but this was later uprated to 2.3 and 2.5 litres in size with incremental power increases to 296 and 374 bhp respectively, although these units were only seen on track and special stages.
It was a legend as a track racer and a crack rally car worldwide, as well as a street racer’s hero, but then BMW came along with the second generation E36 version in 1992 with a straight six engine which was initially a three litre which ultimately gestated into a 3.2. The critics were hysterical. BMW was betraying the faithful, they moaned.
That the car also came with an automatic transmission was also a high sin and the complainants were wracked with dismay.
The third generation remained powered by a six, which quelled the doomsters for a while, but then in 2007 BMW produced the E90 fourth generation and it had a V8 engine. The world stopped while we took in the enormity of this vicious perfidy perpetrated on humankind.
But, to those of us who simply marvelled at the extraordinary performance of the thing (414 bhp, 4.6 seconds 0-100 kph and a 250 kph limited top speed), it was much more of an engineering marvel than any display of duplicity on behalf of the manufacturer.

That the car also came with an automatic transmission was also a high sin and the complainants were wracked with dismay.
That was not the end of the wind bags, however. In 2014 BMW reverted to the straight six, but there was a but…a big one. To the horror of the faithful, the company had the absolute temerity and cheek to turbocharge it. Turbocharging. By God, this was proof positive that we were all headed for hell – in a violently fast handcart.
Again this was a sensational machine and I don’t care how much people want to play the dog in the manger with their endless whining and brutally uninformed opinions. This time around there was 425 bhp and the 0-100 time was down to 3.9. The bloody thing was mind blowing.
But the wafflers waffled and gurned their aimless fury into endless treatises about how BMW had abandoned the devoted. Their often halitosis-tinged breath was more of a stain on the car than anything the engineers did to it.
And now we have the new M3 – as well as an M4 Coupe which is essentially the exact same thing mechanically but with two instead of four doors – and this week we test both of them. Yet again, though, the carping classes are dissatisfied.
The main beefs this time are an increased all-round weight and dramatic new styling – especially those twin overgrown kidney grilles which have eschewed BMW’s traditionally conservative design approach and become a talking point for people with nothing else to talk about.
Believe me both these cars – and the engineers have done everything they can to ensure both have near exact handling and performance traits – possess almost inhuman levels of speed, poise, handling and accuracy. Both are demonic by design and can only be marvelled at by mere mortals like me.
Both are powered by three litre twin-turbocharged straight six engines, which is a new one and has a different cubic capacity. That means it has 510 and not 444 bhp, which is a substantial gain by anyone’s measure, but the naysayers point accusingly to the fact that the 0-100 kph time is only one-tenth quicker (3.8 seconds as against 3.9).
This is easily explained by the fact the new cars having an extra 135 kg weight gain (which includes the ‘M’ carbon bucket seats at an extra cost of €5,870) , but it does not in any way dilute from the monstrousness of what’s on offer here. 
Both the M3 and M4 will only be sold here with a ‘Competition’ tag added and this means that there is no manual version on offer – instead you get a seven-speed auto that was originally seen in the 7 Series.
Again, this is grist to the mill of the alleged purists, and they may have a point as this unit seems slightly laboured and ponderous when compared to the last version which had a double clutch ‘box. But when you have an engine as ripplingly muscular as this one, you would still want to be the reincarnation of Ayrton Senna to find miniature flaws in this beastly package.

Both the M3 and M4 will only be sold here with a ‘Competition’ tag added and this means that there is no manual version on offer – instead you get a seven-speed auto that was originally seen in the 7 Series.
Bristling with state-of-the-art technology which allows you configure the car’s set up to almost anything you want it to be. Scroll endlessly though the mapping for the engine, the gearbox and the electronic dampers and you will keep yourself endlessly amused. Your prodding and scrolling might not make it any quicker with you behind the wheel, but at least you’ll be entertained.
The majority of the entertainment, however, does not come from the electronics. It comes from the sheer force of personality both these cars possess. Just leave it in ‘Comfort’ settings and you will still have a beast you’ll have to be in the full of your health to master.
Pages of text on the intricacies of both M3 and M4 could be filled easily, but as space is an issue, we’ll get down to personal brass tacks.
Of the two cars, the M3 four door was the one I preferred most. I know the engineers claim that the two mirror each other in performance and handling terms, but I must say the M3 felt to me to be much more sorted than the M4. It was like it was welded to the road.
The M4 was a mildly terrifying thing to drive because you felt it wanted to pitch you into the scenery were you to over-flex an arm or leg muscle. It seemed to me to be much more of a high wire act than the M3.
Maybe I’m over sensitive, or something, but the M4 did not appear to have the same seat-of-the-pants security feel the M3 did. The former seemed to be over-zealous and fussy, while the latter was a doddle to get to its handling limit and pitch it over the edge without causing unnecessary terror to you.
These are both – in some ways – cars that will easily overwhelm you if you let them, but the M3 seemed to be less inclined to actually do so than the M4. 
Both are properly fast cars and both have the sort of power attributes and handling nous that will have the likes of Porsche looking in their rear-view mirrors.
So, don’t in any way take it from some know-it-all that because they are heavier, don’t have a manual option and are styled by a mule, that they are not proper ‘M’ cars. 
They fully merit their status as brilliant, strong, safe and mind-bendingly fast cars (no matter what anyone says), but I’d still prefer the M3, personally.

Seat Ateca: Value for money and outrageously practical without being flamboyant or flash"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40312517.html,2021-06-13 09:00:00,Status quo maintained as processors and finishers hold firm,"It is more of the same at the beef factories this week as the status quo is maintained on prices while each side continues to hold their ground.
Neither the processors nor the finishers being prepared to yield a centimetre of their ground stand is an apt summary of the situation around the country for the majority of the deals being done for cattle this week.
The supply remains steady and finishers with factory ready cattle want to keep them moving, while market demand is constant and the processors have a requirement for every animal they are getting.
The early grass cattle are going to be three to four weeks later than usual, because of the poor grass growth in May resulting in what has become a balancing act for the processors to keep sufficient intake without conceding on the prices.
For the finishers, the prices continue to run ahead of 2020, which is a positive, but they argue that 2021 has been a long late Spring involving higher costs and the extra is necessary to hold margin.
The quoted base price for steers remains at 410 cents/kg with some deals being negotiated for a base of 415 cents/kg this week, but it continues to be very difficult to get above that even for finishers with larger numbers of stock available or a factory under extreme pressure to get the extra stock.
The heifers are on a base of 415 cents/kg which the factories are trying not to concede on, if possible at all. It is being reported as very difficult to get extra for heifers at the majority of the plants this week.
The exception are producers with Angus and Hereford for which the demand continues very strong with the breed bonus of up to 20 cents/kg boosting returns. Both of these breed finisher associations have done a remarkable job in marketing which continues to pay off.
The young bulls are a firm trade with prices on par with the steers at 410 cents/kg for R's and the belief that the young bulls are making up any deficit in the supply chain over the current weeks.
There is a strong trade for the cows and the prices are very firm with the good R grade cows making up to 370 cents/kg this week with prices generally 360-365 cents/kg. The O grade are at 340-350 cents/kg and P grade at 330-340 cents/kg.
The intake for last week was slightly higher at a total of 31,258 head, which included 11,426 steers, 8,500 heifers, 3,506 young bulls and 7,167 cows.
The supply was marginally ahead of the same week in 2020. The steers were higher than last year by 1,000 head, and young bulls were up 600 head, while the cows were over 1,000 head lower than 2020 and heifers were back 600 head."

The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) president, Tim Cullinan said the deal “sets a perilous precedent” and highlights the vulnerable position that Irish beef farmers now find themselves in.
He also said that IFA and the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) will hold a bilateral meeting on Thursday to discuss the implications of the deal.
“Apart from the extra checks that will apply following the trade agreement, the threat to our markets is the biggest fallout for Irish farmers from the vote nearly five years ago,” he added.
“It’s precisely the dangerous scenario that we have signalled following the Brexit vote in June, 2016.
“Trade deals between the UK and third countries have the potential to undermine what is a very important market for our beef exports.
“Farmers here and in the UK are committed to the highest standards and we are opposed to any trade deal that gives an opening to sub-standard food imports.”
Exports 
Meanwhile, total beef exports last year were €1.9bn, with 44% going to the UK market.
“It’s our most valuable market, in terms of volume and price,” added Mr Cullinan.
“Any loss of shelf space would be very damaging for our livestock farmers, who are in a low-income sector.
Last month, Hugh Killen, the chief executive of Australian Agricultural Company, Australia’s largest integrated cattle and beef producer, forecast that beef exports could increase tenfold.
Threat
As reported in the Irish Examiner back in May, the threat to Irish and EU exporters as a result of the deal was made clear by the UK’s international trade secretary Liz Truss who highlighted how the trade deal would, after a very long transition period, allow Australia the same kind of access the EU already has to the UK market.
She said she had no doubts that British farmers will continue to thrive under the new deal, because they are already thriving even while the UK imports over 200,000 tonnes of beef from Europe - which is a much bigger producer than Australia.
Ms Truss also pointed out that beef from hormone-injected cattle will remain banned in the new Australia deal and highlighted how Australian lamb coming into the UK is currently more expensive than UK lamb.

Supplies of cattle available to the factories continue to be tight and the markets have lifted a shade following the easing of Covid-19 restrictions on outdoor activity and the resumption of business by more of the catering trade both on the continent and at home.
It is also the time of year when there is normally more outdoor dining as we head into peak holiday season, and all of this is contributing to a bit more life in the market for beef.
Supply
On the supply side, the first of the grass finished cattle, which are normally available to the factories by late May or early June are running up to four weeks later than normal with the grass finished stock in the supply chain remaining very light.
The factories don't like a long window between the shed and grass cattle which inevitably puts more pressure on their procurement officers to source sufficient intake.
This year has been the exception to the general run and as a result putting more pressure on the plants to keep the intake flowing at the desired level to meet demand.
The factories will be hoping that the good grass growth over the past two weeks will bring forward the cattle finished off grass and offer relief on intake sooner than later.
The last thing that the processors relish is the cost of beef animal overheating at this time of the year.
With the June Bank Holiday on Monday the supply for last week slipped to 28,804 head. There were 10,262 steers, 7,818 heifers, 3,291 young bulls and 6,793 cows.
Base price 
After a number of weeks on a base of 410 cents/kg for steers with a small percentage making up to 5 cents/kg more, this week the general base is much closer to 415 cents/kg with the upper end of the trade having increased to 420 cents/kg which has become necessary to get sufficient stock.
The base for heifers has moved to around 420 cents/kg with some now making a shade more at the top of the trade.
The prices on offer for the young bulls is tracking the steer price. For most of the intake they are running around 5 cents/kg behind the steer base with some deals for very close to steer price being negotiated.
The cows have also remained very firm at up to 370-375 cents/kg for the tops of the R grade cows. 
The O grade cows are running at 345-355 cents/kg with the P grade cows from 330 cents/kg."

22 Newtown Park, Newtown Park Avenue, Blackrock, Co. Dublin.

volpenera.ie - @volpeneradublin
Do you remember ‘Fusion Cooking’? Probably not, it was only in fashion for a brief time in the 1990s in California when celebrity chefs such as Wolfgang Puck mixed Asian and European flavours. I remember eating in Oritalia in San Francisco in 1996 at its height and the mix of flavours blew my mind a little — Sichuan pepper and soy flavours on the Florentine Steak slices, if I remember correctly.
Fusion cooking could be clumsy of course, but sometimes it was sublime and the best bits (e.g. soy sauce on tuna tartare) were incorporated into the culinary mainstream in the same way that the best ideas from Nouvelle Cuisine linger on (lighter sauces, beautiful plating etc).
Now to be clear, Volpe Nera is not fusion cooking, it is very much Mediterranean as you would expect from the former head chef of Etto. However, chef Barry Sun Jian was born in the Liaoning region of North Eastern China so if anyone could artfully drop in a few subtle Asian flavours it would be him.
Hence Volpe Nera’s rather wondrous ‘Mushroom Dumplings in aged Soya with Fennel and Lovage’ - silky creamy almost liquid mushroom mousseline in a light delicate dumpling in a soy influenced broth with background herbal notes from the fennel and lovage. What I loved about the dish is that it reminded me as much of an Asian dumpling broth (typical of Liaoning Province I’m told), but also Tortellini al Brodo as you would find in Bologna.
Spiced cucumber endive salad
I chose Volpe Nera as my first post-lockdown review for a few reasons. I wanted light zingy fresh flavours suitable to the warm June weather but, more importantly, I had been planning on visiting since it opened in the closing months of 2019. The restaurant has just a couple of outdoor seats but the pub next door has kindly allowed them to use their frontage which allowed for 20 or so comfortably spaced seats. The restaurant is a 15-minute walk from Blackrock Dart Station.
We began with aperitivo drinks to whet our appetites — my guest opting for a nutty and complex Amontillado Sherry from the fine house of Fernando de Castilla while I had a bittersweet Vermouth & Soda from the same house.
Pro tip: sherry houses make some of the very best Vermouth.
I also ordered a ‘Quinta Milu’ Ribera del Duero from the well thought out and varied wine list — its pungent ripe blackberry fruits worked perfectly with everything we ordered.
As it had been so long I wanted the whole menu and it took considerable restraint not to order the Flaggy Shore Oysters and the Smoked Almonds and Nocellara Olives — as it was we greedily ordered three ‘bites’ and two starters and I don’t regret any of them.
Treacle brown bread was nutty and complex while the sourdough was simply wonderful — crusty, fluffy and light, while some creamy cep butter added depth and umami. Wafer-thin slices of Guanciale melted in the mouth while two golf ball-sized salted Hake Croquettes were meaty and rich with a little kick of preserved lemon to add complexity.
The mushroom dumpling starter (€11) mentioned above was a highlight of the meal but my guest’s starter was also outstanding — Pig Trotter in thin ‘carpaccio’ slices with some crispy breaded sticks of pork, and solid contrast from kohlrabi salad, violet mustard and quails egg.
Hash potatoes in beef drippings
Côte de Boeuf (€68 for two) was served medium rare and was a perfect cut of beef, meaty and rich, while on the side a Cucumber & Endive salad added crispy fresh and bitter contrasts and the more-ish cubes of beef-dripping hash potatoes also deserve mention.
Because I was greedy I added a half portion of satiny delicate Spelt Gnocchi with Chanterelle mushrooms with a ‘crispy egg’ which had been breaded and fried whole but retained a comforting liquid centre.
Desserts cost a very reasonable €7 — a soft light Basil Panna Cotta had lovely spiky anise flavours that contrasted nicely with a sweet Smoked Strawberry Consommé. Pineapple Sponge was a richer style of sponge with caramelised pineapple on top — by now we were struggling.
The meal cost a very fair €188 — which sounds like a lot but we stuffed ourselves silly so was a very fair price for the quality of all we ate. Barry Sun is building on his work at Etto and elsewhere nicely — a wonderful start to the 2021 dining season.

Restaurant Review: Elbow Lane operating at full throttle — it's so good to be back"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40320860.html,2021-06-23 17:35:00,"Lack of supply, markets, and a fair price in Ireland’s organic farming sector","There is one purchaser of organic beef in Ireland with a premium of just 12% being paid for the product compared with commercial beef.
40% of Ireland’s organic beef is being sold as commercial beef while three-quarters of organic lamb is being lost to commercial sale.
And, the delivery of processing outlets for organic produce must be part of the country’s organic farming goals.
This is what emerged during a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture which discussed Organic Farming in conjunction with Teagasc, Bord Bia, and the Department earlier this week.
Colin Hayes, Assistant Secretary-General with responsibility for organics at the Department told the meeting, organic farming in Ireland was at 1.8% compared to the EU average of 7.5%, and production here was “not fully aligned” with market opportunities.
“Most organic farmers engage in beef and sheep production with growth on the domestic market anticipated in fruit, vegetables, and dairy,” he added.
“At the moment, there is insufficient supply to meet demand, and growth in the dairy and beef sector is being impeded by the insufficient supply of organic cereals and proteins.” 
Mr Hayes also highlighted how the sector supported the EU’s Farm to Fork strategy and Green Deal initiative and pointed to the importance of the three main initiatives in Ireland which include the Organic Farming Scheme, Organic Capital Investment Scheme, and the Organic Processing Investment Grant Scheme.
Demand 
Padraig Brennan, Bord Bia, said there was a need to look at the demand for organic food both domestically and further afield.
He pointed out how the Bord has seen a growth in demand for organic produce domestically over the past 12 months with an increase of 16% experienced in retail sales.
“Over the last few years we have seen a growth in the number of organic producers and this year’s Organic Farming Scheme will see more producers coming through,” he continued.
“But with regard to the producers that are there and looking at the sheep sector, there is considerable leakage of organic store lambs into the conventional sector.
“Three out of every four store lambs that are being reared organically are being lost to that and are therefore not slaughtered or processed as organic lamb.
“If we could minimise that from happening we could increase supply.” 
Mr Brennan went on to say that the level of imports regarding fruit and vegetables coming into the Irish market was “very, very high” and he pointed out that some of those products can be produced here while others could be produced “if the price was right”.
“There is potential for more supply coming through, which is very positive, but we need to maximise what is being produced on the ground as much as we can,” he added.
“Bord Bia is looking at ways to develop the domestic market further and to make the most of opportunities overseas.
“If you look at the cereal sector, at the moment Ireland is only producing about half of the demand that is there for organic oats.
“If we can get growers then there is potential there.
“If we could get more cereal growers into the system we could reduce our reliance on imported animal feed as well.
“There are customers out there for Irish organic beef but we need a level of scale to meet that demand.” 
Sustainability
Meanwhile, Professor Gerry Boyle, Teagasc, pointed to organic produce and sustainability.
He highlighted how Teagasc now has 100 farms across the country that will demonstrate ‘sustainability in action’ on farms.
The plan, he added, is to have five organic farms represented in that network.
“That will give us the opportunity to link the credentials associated with organic production and sustainability,” said Professor Boyle.
“From a marketing perspective, both of those credentials should reinforce each other.
“Organic farms and organic produce will have a lower carbon footprint and will also benefit biodiversity and water quality.
“Organic farming leads to much fewer ammonia emissions.
“All of this should be a marketing strength particularly in export markets.” 
He went on then to highlight one of the programmes that Teagasc is running which focuses on zero nitrogen application, which he added: “is replicated in the organic context”.
“We are also doing expensive work on our multi-species swards and that too can be carried over into the organic sphere.” 
Deputy Michael Collins, meanwhile, put a human perspective to proceedings.
Farming 
An organic farmer for 20 years - until he handed over the reins to his son last year - Mr Collins said the entire setup in Ireland was “a farce”.
“The price of cattle never changed; if you were living in a peripheral area there was no opportunity to sell your cattle,” he continued.
“There was one buyer up the country and it was very difficult to find a market.
“In my view, the marts should be used around the time when weanlings are being sold to sell organic cattle.
“We have a great scheme in the Organic Farming Scheme and that scheme just needs to be developed further and enhanced.
“The bottom line is that organic farmers are not getting the price for their cattle and if they are not getting the price then that is discouraging, particularly for young farmers who want to farm organically.” 
In response to Deputy Collins, Mr Brennan said that an organic finished animal was selling at between €4.90-€5kg - a 10-12% premium above the average of a conventional animal.
He highlighted how there was “stability” in the organic cattle price whereas conventional cattle price experiences “fluctuation” - which has been going through a strong period over the last few months.
He also said there was a need to “co-ordinate supply”.
“There is a considerable leakage of animals from the organic sector when they come through a livestock mart, so I think if we could co-ordinate that better we would have more supply available,” continued Mr Brennan.
“We would then be in a position to supply some of the opportunities that exist not just on the Irish market but also overseas.
“There is work to be done at an overall sector level; when you have a producer that has gone to the effort of converting to an organic enterprise, then it is necessary that their supply continues on in an organic channel right the way through to slaughter.
“I think that would help in terms of the average price return as well.”

€10k per acre sought for working dairy farm in West Cork"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40320989.html,2021-06-23 19:02:00,Concern that moisture deficit will soon hit grass growth,"Only a few weeks ago we were all wondering when the rain was going to stop.
Last week we were marvelling at the super grass growth. Now many are asking when it is going to rain again.
The current dry spell is beginning to be a concern for many beef and dairy producers around the country. Grass growth has slowed down dramatically on many farms, particularly in the South and East of the country.
Much of the growth seems to stem as swards are beginning to head out due to stress from the heat and moisture shortage.
As a result, many can see a shortage of grass in the not too distant future. Animal performance is beginning to suffer a little as a result.
If we look at milking herds as a yardstick, producers are reporting two issues — a drop in yield due to poor intakes and low butter fats due to poor fibre intakes.
Seamus Twomey rowing up the grass for baling at Old Court, Ballinspittle, Co Cork. Picture: Dan Linehan.
If dairy herds are experiencing these issues with dropping performance, then beef animals are also under pressure for fibre and energy supply while grazing similar swards.
Met Éireann is, as I write, predicting moisture deficits of between 20 and 60mm around the country by the time we reach the end of this week.
The rain forecast for this week looks like it has reduced considerably and weekend temperatures are expected to be in the low 20s by day.
What actions should you consider if grass is getting tight?
Increasing meal or reintroducing meal;
Grazing a proportion of the second cut silage ground. Obviously, this is only possible where an early first cut was taken. Zero grazing may be the only possibility logistically;
Feeding silage or other available forages remaining from last winter.
Obviously, not every option listed above is a reality on many farms. You must pick the option which is the most efficient from an animal performance point of view while also being cost-effective.
For those starting to experience what we hope will be only a mini drought, it is essential that grass is managed well.
Try to slow down the rotation if growth has slowed down. This will involve feeding additional ration to those already being fed and introducing some to other stock. It may also require the feeding of round bale silage if it is available to slow down the rotation.
Whatever happens it is only the month of June so don’t let animals run out of grass before you start thinking about what you will do to feed them.
Right now, grass grows grass!
Feeding to stretch grass
Creep feeding of suckler calves will help to reduce grass demand.
Autumn 2020 calves will be weaned soon or may already have been. Early spring calves will also respond well to meal at this point, especially if grass quality has diminished. Starting to feed meal to forward stores on grass will slow down the rotation while getting animals used to meal before being pushed for finish.
Some may also consider bringing in cattle intended for slaughter later in the year. Commencing the finishing period a little earlier will take the pressure off the grazing platform. With the current beef prices, this would be one of the first options to consider.
Silage first cut in and plans for a second
Most beef producers have now saved their first cut. The recent dry spell has provided ideal conditions for silage.
However, that same dry spell is now resulting in slow growth in second cut silage crops.
Fields cut early for the first cut (early May) are now only a few weeks from harvest again but have not yet bulked up.
Recent first cut fields have very little grass in them and many are still yellow, which may result in less bulk and late second cuts if we don’t get rain soon.
Fertiliser spread after recent first cuts are still sitting on the surface, while slurry, if applied, has obviously not washed in and is caked on the stubble.
Neither can work if not washed in.
A warm week ahead
Temperatures day and night for the next six to seven days look high, with days above 20 degrees.
Most cattle will have no problem with the heat; however, where they cannot get access to sufficient water, stress may occur. Keep an eye on water flow to troughs and make sure that ball-cocks are functioning correctly. Cattle not drinking enough water will be unable to eat enough feed resulting in poor performance.
External parasite control
Obviously, during any warm spell at this time of year, insects are going to be more abundant and provide more irritation to cattle.
If animals become affected by this you may need to treat stock for external parasites. Regular treatment will be necessary.
Pay particular attention to recently dried-off suckler cows and consider applying a fly/lice treatment to their udder as well as on their back."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40321475.html,2021-06-24 15:00:00,Irish eyes on UK beef market share,"Australia will become a new competitor for Ireland in the 270,000 tonnes of beef per year UK import market, following the UK recently agreeing to a Free Trade Agreement with Australia.
However, it will be late 2022, at the earliest, before the trade deal is likely to be approved by the UK’s parliament.
Some details of the deal released by the Australian Prime Minister indicate that Australia will have immediate access to a duty-free quota of 35,000 tonnes of beef, rising in equal installments to 110,000 tonnes in Year 10.
In the subsequent five years, the volume threshold is expected to rise in equal installments to 170,000 tonnes, above which a tariff of 20% will apply.
Chart examines Australian beef in the UK. 
According to the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), the current arrangement is that Australia has a quota for export to the EU (including the UK, until Brexit), while paying a 20% tariff rate.
This has resulted in the UK importing 2,500-3,000 tonnes of beef from Australia, down from more than 7,000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014.
Beef imported from Australia is more likely to be higher value steaks, and at the moment, the import price for this Australian beef in the UK is higher than beef from South America and much higher than beef from the EU (see accompanying chart).
Price 
However, part of the reason the EU beef price landed in the UK is much lower is because it includes a wider range of boneless products, including for example mince (which helps to explain why the Irish price is the lowest).
Currently, better markets nearer to home are also preventing significant volumes of Australian beef from coming on the UK market.
Australia can export its steaks and other boneless beef cuts for an average of £6,500 a tonne to markets such as Japan, China, South Korea, Indonesia as well as the United States, rather than try to match the UK average import price of around £5,000 a tonne.
These markets are much more attractive to Australian beef exporters at a time when the Australian beef industry is emerging from a period of extended drought and does not have as much beef to export as it had previously.
This lack of supply has pushed up the price of Australian beef cattle.
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences forecasts beef and veal export volumes to increase by 16% in 2021/2022.
Production
Nevertheless, Australia's relatively large farms tend to have much lower costs of production than those in the EU, making it a relatively competitive beef, sheep, and dairy exporter.
According to the AHDB, it is the Australia trade deal's erosion of value in the premium tier of cuts that concerns the UK beef sector.
This must be a concern also for Irish exporters, the main suppliers to the UK, that Australian imports could drag down the relatively high price of steaks in the UK, and thus the average beef price.
The potential volumes from Australia over the coming decades could act as a price ceiling in the UK market for some cuts.
And that effect will be multiplied if, as expected, more major trade deals are signed by the UK.
Their agreement with Australia is the first genuinely new post-Brexit trade deal, and the United States and New Zealand are probably next in the pipeline, according to the AHDB. 
All such deals will bring UK prices closer to world prices, and could eventually make the UK beef market much less rewarding for Irish exporters.

Lack of supply, markets, and a fair price in Ireland’s organic farming sector"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40327745.html,2021-06-26 15:00:00,Finishing young bulls this summer will require work ,"A combination of a current shortage of grass along with a much-improved beef price has seen a lot of young bulls indoors being finished at present.
Both dairy bred and suckler bred bulls are on intensive finishing diets at present with an aim of slaughter in the coming months.
If you want these cattle to finish at target weight, target age and target grade then they must gain substantial weight every day of their lives.
Setbacks in thrive should be avoided at all costs. 
You must take maximum advantage of the hormonal effect of young bulls to optimise profit through efficient Feed Efficiency. Concentrates have increased significantly in price over the last nine or 10 months, so there is no room for poor performance due to a badly balanced diet, a poor environment, a shortage of water or a health issue.
Outdoor or indoor feeding?
With many farms finding grass hard to manage or in very short supply these days it is likely that for most the option of feeding bulls meal at grass is a difficult one to put into practice.
For many, the easiest option will be to bring them in and start finishing them.
Once you have bulls in the shed You must ensure that young bulls are grown well enough to start finishing.
What is your target market?
Establish the requirements from factories before commencing feeding!
Weight, age, grade Are your facilities suitable for the feeding strategy you hope to implement?
What feeds are available to you and what will they cost?
What is the quality of the forage available like?
It is so important that bulls don’t commence a finishing diet until they have been grown correctly.
If they are not grown properly they are more than likely to begin a growth spurt during the finishing period resulting in delayed slaughter, poor confirmation and kill-out percentage. 
Influencing carcass quality 
It has consistently been seen that increasing the daily live weight gain in the final months of finish will increase the confirmation of the carcass of the bulls and their lean meat yield.
It is possible to move a proportion of O+`s to R`s and R`s to U-`s with a well-implemented feeding strategy suitable for the batch of bulls being fed.
What is the correct diet?
When formulating a diet to achieve target weights in young bulls, ensure the total diet has a high energy density and don’t overfeed protein per kg of Dry Matter.
Continental suckler-bred bulls with higher muscle will require more grammes of protein than dairy-bred bulls would require.
Exact specifications are weight and breed dependent. Ensure that the ration contains sufficient fibre to maintain rumen function and that there is clean fresh feed in front of the Bulls for 22 to 23 hours per day.
Ideally, fresh feed should be provided every day to encourage intake. A quality mineral is also essential in any diet to optimise health and performance.
Forage quality
The source of forage used to finish bulls needs to be top quality. Low-quality forages have no role in getting the final cover on bulls.
However, good quality forage can play a major role in reducing overall finishing costs. They can also provide an essential source of structural fibre.
Good quality maize silage, whole crop cereals, brewers, wet distillers and beet provide excellent forage energy sources for bulls in conjunction with a balanced concentrate.
Ad-lib feeding 
Ad-lib feeding of concentrates may be a more economical option for bull finishers if only poor silages are available.
Many get confused with the term Ad-lib. It is simple - cattle must have access to meal 24-7. They must also have access to good quality clean straw at all times.
Hay is a poor substitute for straw as it does not promote optimum rumen function, depressing intakes and ultimate weight gains in bulls.
Concentrate quality 
The most appropriate concentrates for finishing bulls should include high levels of energy in the form of native barley, oats, rye, wheat and triticale, along with maize meal.
With current straight prices maize may be at lower percentages to control costs.
Digestible fibre sources such as soya hulls and beet pulp are also important to maintain rumen function in these intensively fed animals.
Protein as I mentioned above, while not required in large amounts for finishing bulls, is required to encourage intake and balance the energy provided for optimum weight gain. Filler ingredients should not be high up the label if you want to optimise performance.
Water 
Water is also a critical element to get right when you step up feeding for bulls. It should be clean and in plentiful supply.
If cattle don’t drink they don’t eat and if they don’t eat they don’t thrive.
Environment 
It may be obvious but do your cattle have enough space in the shed to achieve their potential?
Can they all lie down and can they get to their feed without having to walk all over others? 
Make sure ventilation is adequate to avoid stress and disease pressure.

Farmers facing 'tough decisions' on CAP"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40326140.html,2021-06-30 16:00:00,Scarcity and market demand sees base price edge forward ,"It has shaped into an unusual year for beef finishers with the cattle prices at the factories still moving upwards as the season edges into July.
The late spring growing season has added considerable costs to the finishing of cattle this year, but the scarcity of supply coupled with the strength of market demand for beef has combined to ensure that those with factory ready cattle are benefiting.
The base prices have edged forward by around a further 5cents/kg at the processing plants this week as the scramble to get sufficient stock to supply the order books requirements continues to put pressure on the factories.
The competition between processors has intensified and the factory agents are finding that they have to pay over the odds to get extra cattle at the live sales with many finishers now realising that taking the option for live sale has some real benefit.
The quoted base for steers has increased to 415-420 cents/kg with an increasing percentage of the throughput at the factories believed to be achieving the higher end this week and reports of some deals being done for up to 425 cents/kg.
At the same time some of the prices being reported from the mart sales for choice lots of finished cattle indicate that these cattle are costing well above the factory prices.
The heifer trade is covering a wider range with quoted base prices from 420cents/kg to 430cents/kg amid reports that some finishers have secured up to 435cents/kg in hard selling.
The young bulls and cows have also benefited from the buoyancy of the markets.
Young bulls are now close to parity on price with the steers at 420-425cents/kg for R grade with some increase in the intake of young bulls being interpreted as helping to ease the deficiency in other categories.
Demand 
The resumption of more catering as Covid-19 restrictions are gradually eased, is helping to drive the demand for manufacturing beef and consequently the cow trade.
Prices for good R grade cows are hitting a new peak of 385-390 cents/kg this week.
The O grade cows are making up to 360cents/kg and the best of the P grade cows are fetching 345-350cents/kg with the cow prices in a range not experienced for a long time.
The overall intake at the factories is now running at around 6,000 head/week behind the same weeks in 2020 which is mounting the pressure on the processors.
Intake last week was 30,283 head which was probably around 2,500-3,000 head under the comfort zone for the processors.
All categories are down on last year. Steers are heaviest hit at 11,084 head which is 2,500 less than last year while heifers at 8,777 head are down 1,500 head.

The executor sale has attracted plenty of interest locally as well as farther afield and is already under offer, according to the selling agent Catherine Pomeroy of Millstreet-based Dick Pomeroy & Sons Auctioneers.
“It has been let out for some time,” says Catherine, “but it has been very well farmed and looked after.” 
The farm is all in one block and in permanent pasture, with very little waste, apart from a very small portion of it at the southwestern end.
There is good road frontage, with a central roadway leading through the lands to the house and outbuildings.
“It’s surrounded mainly by dairy and sheep farmers,” says Catherine of the locality, “and there would be a bit of beef farming in the area as well.
“But dairying would be the dominant sector.” 
The farm at Kippagh, Millstreet, is all in one block and in permanent pasture.
The collection of outbuildings around the yard includes a cubicle house, silage pit, two slurry pits, stall, hay barn and an obsolete milking parlour. They are all aged but workable buildings.
The house has been unoccupied for some time, appears to be structurally sound and is in need of renovation.
“The house hasn’t been lived in since 2014 and it certainly does require a bit of work,” added Catherine.
“The dwelling is a traditional-style two-storey farmhouse which has been extended.
“Accommodation includes a kitchen, living room, sitting room and separate granny flat (with its own kitchen/dining room and bedroom) on the ground floor.
“On the first floor, there is a storage room, a bathroom and four bedrooms.” 
There is very little possibility that this farm will be divided into lots. 
The layout of the holding simply doesn’t lend itself to being subdivided, with the farmhouse and outbuildings being located more or less in the middle of the property and accessed from the public road by a long lane.
The asking price of €700,000 is in keeping with values for good grassland in the area and with the rarity of the property type and the addition of the house and yard, it’s not surprising that there is good interest and already a “good” opening offer on the table.

Sotheby's said the sale contains ""the most personal objects"" belonging to American poet Plath to ever come to market.
It is comprised of 50 lots which come from the collection of Frieda Hughes, one of the couple's two children.

The Bell Jar author Plath, who took her own life in 1963 aged 30, married British poet Hughes in 1956.
Theirs was one of the most well-known and turbulent unions in 20th-century literature. Hughes died aged 68 in 1998.
The Sotheby's sale features typed letters from Plath written during a brief period of separation immediately after the wedding.

Hughes was in London while his bride was studying at Oxford on a Fulbright Scholarship. In one note, Plath wrote ""My husband is a genius"" after reading his breakthrough poetry collection The Hawk In The Rain.
In another handwritten section, Plath said: ""I love you and perish to be with you and lying in bed with you and kissing you all over ... I love you teddy teddy teddy teddy and how I wish I could be with you ... All my love ever, your own love wife, Sylvia.""

A handmade family photo album put together by Plath, complete with handwritten captions detailing the couple's holidays and other social occasions, is also going under the hammer.
It features a picture of Hughes sipping drinks with TS Eliot.
The album is described as a ""remarkably personal record of Plath and Hughes's married life together"" and demonstrates her ""keen sense of humour"".

Also up for sale are Plath and Hughes's wedding rings, which were ""hurriedly purchased"" by the couple before their June 1956 marriage in London, just four months after they first met.
Writing about the occasion in her diary, Plath recalled: ""We rushed about London, buying dear Ted shoes & trousers, two gold wedding rings (I never wanted an engagement ring) with the last of our money.""
The rings have an estimate of £6,000 - £8,000.

Frieda, a poet and painter, said of her mother's love for cooking: ""She was a fantastic baker and a fanatical cook ... cooking for my father was one of her joys.""
The cards have an estimate of £800 - £1,200. A deck of Tarot cards, originally given to Plath by Hughes, has a guide price of £4,000 -£6,000.

Mam makes the best dinners. When we would come home from school Mam always had a home-cooked dinner on the table. She would have fresh spuds, vegetables and the dinners were always so filling and warming. Mam's beef stew is something that I can just never recreate. She makes the best stew around and memories of me and all my sisters sitting down after school and drowning our dinners in vinegar still make me smile.
What food makes you happy and why?
I love vegetables, fish and lean meats. I find that the healthier the food, the happier I feel. I love the feeling I get when I am on track and I am eating so many wonderful colours, flavours and types of food. The less processed it is, the better I feel.
What meal reminds you of someone special to you?
When I was really young, Nana would boil chicken with whole onions, carrots and potatoes and we would have dinner with a mug of Hotcup soup. I love that memory because it is the main one I have of Nana. I can still picture myself sitting at her kitchen table, which was by the window, and we would be chatting and laughing. I always felt like I was with my friend and that I was safe. So whenever I smell Hotcup soup or see it in the shop it brings me right back to being three or four years old.
What dish reminds you of a favourite holiday?
Anything to do with pasta reminds me of the time we went to Rome in 2019. It was Mam's first time ever leaving Ireland and after rearing nine girls she picked her perfect destination for her two loves: pasta and prayers. My sister Juliette was leaving for Melbourne the following week and we haven't seen her since and my niece Eva was just back from a year of working in Berlin so it was such a special holiday. Whenever I see or hear of carbonara I am right back in Rome, sitting outside a restaurant making memories of the best holiday we ever went on. We spent our days roaming the streets of Rome, stopping for hazelnut gelato every so often, and it really holds a special, happy place in my heart.
You're on death row: what do you request for your last meal?
Oh this one is a game I have played many times and one I hope that never happens! 
To start, I would have a spicy chicken wings with celery and blue cheese dip (extra crispy). For the main course, a sirloin steak with tender stem broccoli, mushrooms, onions, chips, garlic butter and pepper sauce with lots of vinegar (we all love it). My dessert would be vanilla creme brulee with vanilla ice cream, cream, strawberries and shortbread. And a nice Americano to finish the meal.
If you could only eat one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be and why? 
I think it has to be potatoes. They are so yummy and they are so versatile. You can have so many different variations from one product!

Ingredients
1kg aubergines, thinly sliced into rounds with the skin on
salt
black pepper
60ml olive oil, plus extra for cooking
1 red onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, chopped
2 x 400g tins of chopped tomatoes
1 tbsp tomato purée
50ml water
1 tsp caster sugar
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp chilli flakes
1 vegetable stock cube
400g light Mozzarella cheese, grated
100g light Cheddar cheese, grated
fresh basil leaves, to garnish
Method
Draw the excess water from the aubergines by salting them. This time, you need to layer the slices in a shallow dish and sprinkle all over with salt. Pop some kitchen paper on top of the aubergines, then put a heavy-based pot on top to help get the excess water out. This should take about 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, to make the marinara sauce, heat a large saucepan and add some olive oil. Add your red onion and garlic and gently sauté until softened.
Stir in the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée, water, sugar, cayenne, chilli flakes and the vegetable stock cube. Simmer for 30 minutes.
Preheat your oven to 190°C.
Heat a large frying pan. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the aubergine slices with the 60ml of olive oil. Working in batches, gently fry for about 30 seconds on each side to take the edge off the raw texture. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to remove the excess oil.
In a regular baking dish (a lasagne-type dish is too deep for this recipe), start assembling the moussaka by placing a layer of aubergine slices in the bottom of the dish, then spreading over a layer of sauce and sprinkling on a layer of Mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients have been used up, then finish with a layer of Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling on top. Garnish with a few fresh basil leaves and cut into squares to serve.

Members of prime minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet are clashing over whether to discourage people in Spain from consuming so much ham, beef and other forms of animal protein.
Supporters favour messaging on the health and environmental benefits of plant-based diets.
The internal debate ballooned to the point that the primer minister waded in from Lithuania while on an official visit there on Thursday.
“To me, if you give me a rare, ribeye steak,.. that’s unbeatable,” Mr Sanchez said, stating his unequivocal position.
Since coming to power in early 2020, Mr Sanchez’s centre-left Socialists and the ministers representing the coalition’s junior partner, the far-left United We Can, have clashed over how to respond to issues like transgender rights, spiralling rent prices, tax hikes and social benefits for the most vulnerable Spaniards.
I'm worried about the health of our citizens and the health of our planet
Alberto Garzon, consumption minister
Meat joined the areas of disagreement this week.
In a video posted Wednesday on social media, consumption minister Alberto Garzon, a leader of United We Can, called on people to consider putting less meat on their plates.
“I’m worried about the health of our citizens and the health of our planet,” Mr Garzon said.
The minister cited data from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation that showed Spain as the European Union’s top meat consumer: 98 kilograms per person a year compared to an EU average of 76 kilograms.
Mr Garzon said that 70 million cows, pigs, sheep, chickens and other farm animals are slaughtered for food each year in Spain, a country of 47 million, and that beef production, in particular, requires disproportionate amounts of water and releases greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.
“This doesn’t mean that we can’t have a family barbecue once in a while,” he added.
“We just need do it with a bit more restraint and make up for the days when we eat meat by following them with eating more salad, rice, legumes and vegetables.”
Agriculture minister Luis Planas, a fellow Cabinet member, called Mr Garzon’s campaign “unfortunate” and “unfair” for an industry that produces one-fifth of Spain’s exports, a business worth 10 billion euros (11.8 billion US dollars).
“Livestock breeders don’t deserve this,” Mr Planas said during an interview with Cadena SER radio.
“The industry is being subjected to profoundly unfair criticism and deserves respect for the honest work it does for all of us in food and in the economy.”
Our Mediterranean diet has placed us as the world’s third country in terms of longevity
Roman Santalla, farmers' union
A platform representing the six main industry associations published an open letter calling the consumption ministry’s campaign “libellous” and alleging that Mr Garzon had cherry-picked statistics to diminish against an economic sector that employs 2.5 million people.
Anafric, one of the organisations, accused the the minister of “criminalising” an industry that “has adapted to both European and global environmental standards”.
And UPA, a union of small farmers and livestock breeders, said it was outraged.
“We eat well in Spain.
“Our Mediterranean diet has placed us as the world’s third country in terms of longevity,” Roman Santalla, a union spokesman, said."

The lands in this part of the world are generally of high quality and the mixture of agricultural sectors ensures a lively level of demand for good land.
A substantial parcel of land has just come on the market with Limerick auctioneers GVM.
The 86-acre residential farm is in the townland of Kilmoreen, a couple of kilometres south of Kildimo village, 8km north of Adare and 15km from Limerick city centre.
According to the selling agent Tom Crosse, this land isn’t all pure golden pasture and contains a mixture of levels.
“It’s a fine holding,” says Tom. 
“It wouldn’t be the crème de la crème, it’s a mixed holding with some very good quality and some fields of lesser quality.” In the main, he says, the land is reasonably good and ideal for dairying, beef cattle, equestrian or meadowing use.
In the locality, there are representatives of all those sectors. Added to that substantial list, is the person simply looking for a property to live in that comes complete with an investment in land which can then be let out. 
Its location within a short commute of the city makes it a very viable option for the non-farmer/ investor market as well.
There’s a central roadway that leads to the house in the centre of the holding, which is in reasonable condition throughout.
It’s a single-storey traditional dwelling of charm in a private and leafy location, according to the selling agents and it has oil-fired central heating.
There is a new slate roof on the house, as well as upvc windows. The accommodation includes a sitting room, kitchen, bathroom and three bedrooms.
“Its location is good,” says Tom. 
“It’s within 15 minutes of the city, it’s within seven or eight minutes’ drive of both Adare and Kildimo.
“There’s the nice single-storey farmhouse on it with a bit of character. That does need a bit of work but it’s a fine property.” 
So far, the interest seems to be building from a variety of sources. 
The price guide is €700,000 (€8,000/acre), representing a good value purchase for a variety of potential bidders."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40332539.html,2021-07-10 15:00:00,Finishers 'making hay while the sun shines' ,"There is nothing other than positive news on the beef front these last few weeks and the finishers in a position to sell are 'making hay while the sun shines'.
Overall the prices at the factories have strengthened by a further 5-10cents/kg this week with demand for cattle at the processors driving the trade as the supply continues in the deficit zone relative to the need to meet the market requirements.
The intake at the plants continues in the range of 3,000-4,000 head/week under what would have the factory bosses feeling comfortable and in a position to tighten their rein on the upward movement in the returns to the producers.
It is now the season of the year when the beef prices are more likely to be in the latter mode than the former and the output from the farms building up, while the demand usually weakens as the main holiday season approaches.
Definitely not so this year as proof that rarely are any two seasons the same in the cattle business.
The base quote for steers has increased to 425cents/kg with a good percentage of the intake understood to be moving on a base of 430cents/kg.
When the bonuses for quality and in the case of Angus and Hereford the breed bonus are added, the finishers are now getting a decent cheque, which is deserved in a late season for the first of the grass-finished stock.
The heifers are moving on a premium of 10cents/kg over the steers on a base of 435-440cents/kg with all bonus payments as applicable to be added.
The word is that the factories are scouring the country for supplies and offering a variety of sweeteners to get producers to agree to accept the deals and part with the stock.
The rising prices are being reflected in all categories with both the young bulls and cows also stronger this week.
The R grade young bulls are now on par with the steers, which is unusual, and at prices ranging 425-430cents/kg.
The cow trade is strong after gains of at least 5cents/kg. 
The good R grade cows are on 375-380cents/kg in general and in some deals up to 385 cents/kg is reported to be paid to get supplies.
The intake of cattle for last week was very similar to the previous week at 31,113 head compared to 37,329 head for the same week last year.
All categories of stock are currently lower than in 2020.
Last week's intake of steers was 11,816 head down from 13,670 in 2020, with heifers at 8,798 head back from 10,869 head last year, while the cow supply was down to 7,559 head from 9,163 head last year.

“We had a very big sale for the time of the year with over 900 head on offer,” Geraldine Walsh of Ennis Mart reported after last Thursday’s cattle sale.
“The trade was strong, with beef cattle not as plentiful as they were over the past few weeks.
“As a result beef cattle were much sought after, with quite a lot of stock going north. Some very fancy prices were achieved for nice quality stores.
“A large entry of aged bulls on offer today and these averaged €1.86/kg. A Charolais bull of 1140kgs made €2,200 and a Limousin of 950kgs hit €1,950.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40337621.html,2021-07-15 12:00:00,Increased beef cattle prices will be supported by reduced supplies in 2021,"Strong calf exports in 2019, and a reduction in young bull finishing, have left the number of Irish cattle slaughtered up to June (706,900 head), down 6% compared to the same period last year, according to the Central Statistics Office.
More recent slaughter data from Bord Bia indicates that the prime cattle kill is down 7% for the year to mid-June), compared to last year. 
This is mainly due to lower heifer slaughtering figures.
The cow kill is up by about 3% year-on-year, but this is not enough to offset the lower prime cattle throughput.
Production is expected to recover in 2022, based on this year’s increased figures for dairy males, beef males and beef females aged 12-30 months. The increase is largely attributed to higher numbers of 12-18-month-old cattle, unlikely to come to market before 2022.
Meanwhile, overall supplies of prime cattle in 2021 have been running 7.8% (49,099 head) lower than 12 months ago.
A total of 778,066 head of cattle were processed in the first 25 weeks of 2021. This figure represents a decline of 53,626 head from the corresponding period in 2020 (down 6.45%).
EU
At EU level, beef production is expected to decrease by 1.3% or 92,000 tonnes in 2021, due to lower demand from food services. However, exports to high-value markets such as Canada and Japan should continue to increase, thanks to recent trade agreements.
With strong demand in Ireland’s main export markets, and the reduced Irish supply of beef cattle, prices quoted for finished cattle have remained strong, with export meat plants actively seeking out quality in-spec cattle.
Base prices for prime cattle continued to climb.
The average prices paid for prime cattle for the week ending June 26, as recorded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, were €4.22/kg for R3 steers, and €4.24/kg for R3 heifers (these prices exclude VAT but would include all bonuses such as for breed-based producer groups).
The average price paid for steers and heifers in 2021 is 9% higher than prices paid in 2020. The average 2021 price for R3 steers is €3.94/kg, whilst R3 heifers averaged €3.98/kg, up to July.
The Irish R3 steer price at the end of June was 52c/kg (14%) higher than for the same week two years ago, and some 61c/kg (17%) higher than 12 months ago.

Meanwhile, live cattle exports for the first 23 weeks of the year reached 181,274 head, 7% ahead of the corresponding period in 2020.
The trade of calves to EU member states, at 131,305 head, was 2.5% ahead of the same period last year but remained significantly behind the 184,351 calves exported in the same period in 2019.
Calf exports in 2021 to Spain, Italy, and Northern Ireland all increased during 2021, but calf exports to the Netherlands (over 46,000 head) fell back by 4% compared to 2020.
Cattle exported to Northern Ireland up to mid-June totalled 38,933 head, compared to 22,753 cattle in the same period last year.
Approximately two-thirds of cattle exported to Northern Ireland are destined for further breeding or production, with the balance for direct slaughter.

Mart Report: The British, the great supporters of Irish beef"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40337630.html,2021-07-15 18:00:00,Producers benefit as beef prices continue to strengthen,"The beef prices are continuing to harden at the factories at a pace that has rarely ever before happened as the season approaches mid-July.
Prices across most categories have improved by up to 5cents/kg at the factories for this week in a demand-led market for tight supplies of finished cattle.
It is usual for the trade for beef to be tricky around this time of the year in trying to decide whether to sell or hold on as more cattle become ready and producers begin to fear that more weight gain by holding on could pay less if the price actually falls in the meantime.
Wise indeed would have been the man, who'd have predicted, the strengthening in price for June and July that producers are benefiting from this year.
It is one of those very unusual situations where a number of positive factors have all come into play simultaneously.
It is a late finishing season for the first of the cattle off grass for 2021 caused by the late spring and poor grass growth in May.
At the same time, the overall numbers of finished cattle available to the factories is slipping back.
Favourable conditions
Factored into a strong market for beef it completes the perfect scenario to favour producers.
Steers are being quoted this week at 425cents/kg in general, while most of the intake is believed to be making 430cents/kg as the processors scramble to get cattle.
There are some reports from around the country that up to 435cents/kg has been achieved.
The heifer trade has also strengthened with quotes for base grade at 430cents/kg and a sizeable percentage of the intake priced at 435cents/kg and reports of some suppliers doing deals with the factories for 440cents/kg.
Adding in the bonus payments for quality, and in the case of both Angus and Hereford the breed bonus and returns are a good improvement on 2020.
The quotes for the R grade young bulls are in general 425cents/kg with supplies appearing to aid the bridging of the shortage in the other categories.
Prices for the cows have also strengthened with the good R grade cows now making 390cents/kg, and the O's on 370-375cents/kg.
The intake at the factories for last week was marginally higher at 32,026 head, but the underlying vital statistic showing that it was 5,100 head less than the same week in 2020 goes a long way to explaining the pressure on processors to get cattle.
All categories are down on this time last year.
The supply last week included 12,857 steers, 8,861 heifers, 2,368 young bulls and 7,335 cows.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40338008.html,2021-07-16 13:00:00,Beef producers should look at grain options this harvest,"Combines will start rolling very soon in the south and east of the country.
It looks like the harvest will kick off without the threat of rain and conditions will be ideal for the start to the 2021 cereal harvest.
All going well we can look forward to good quality winter barley and golden straw to kick off the season. 
Winter wheat, Oats and Rye also look very promising.
Forage and concentrate planning 
Thankfully, most livestock farms have plenty of silage saved already this year and second cuts are just underway too.
Although some have had to feed some forage due to poor growth last month, it shouldn’t dig too far into next winter's feed.
2021 silages may not be top quality so higher energy cost-effective concentrates will be required to complement these silages to achieve optimum animal performance.
While speaking to customers about their forage requirements, I have reminded them to not forget about the concentrate fraction of future diets.
Everyone understands that concentrates will be more expensive over the next 12 months or so.
Most have noted that cereal prices off the combine and imported feeds continue to rise and accept that it's about time the tillage sector got a break.
Many are however looking at the price rise as a negative for feeding livestock.
I would look at this as an opportunity. Higher prices off the combine will mean higher concentrate prices over the coming year, even more reason to put a plan in place and buy locally off the combine.
This model must be encouraged and can mean a better margin for those growing the grain and also reduce costs for the end users feeding the grain.
With regard to cash flow, a stocking loan to buy grain off the combine will be an excellent way to secure good value feed without tying up cash.
Irish Feed for Irish cattle 
Native Irish cereals are the most versatile high-energy feeds that farmers can grow or buy.
Traditionally grain was dried or stored on air at moistures of 18% or less.
Over the last decade, additive type, processing methods, and storage options have left locally produced native cereals as the most cost-competitive concentrate feed source available for all livestock.
This is as relevant this year as any other year with projected green grain prices heading for €200/tonne.
Dairy and beef farmers that store their own grain or purchase grain in whatever form from neighbouring cereal farmers can make significant savings (€70/€80/T) in their winter concentrate costs.
Looking at the options for grain off the combine
Many treatment and storage options are available to the producer and end user this harvest.
Every process has its merits. The process you choose should be based on your animal’s requirements in relation to grain, the volume to be fed, protein requirement, other available feeds and required performance.
Moist Grain 28%-35% Moisture Crimped grain (Wheat, Barley, Rye, Triticale, & Oats) 
Harvest window – Narrow during good weather conditions:
Mature Grain with a moisture range of 25% to 35%;
Grain crimped and additive applied to aid fermentation;
Prompt ensiling within 24hrs of harvest, proper rolling, compacting and covering/sealing is essential;
Create a narrow pit face as proper pit face management is critical;
When fermented crop stabilises at ph 4 – 4.5 it is ready for feeding after approx. 30 days;
Can’t be included dry in meal premixes due to high moisture content;
Highly Susceptible to attack from birds and vermin;
Storage losses can be to 2-3%;
Storage Period of four to six months;
Feed Rates: Dairy up to 4 Kg, beef up to 8Kg;
A popular method 10 to 15 years ago but now represents a smaller proportion of on-farm stored grain
Mature Grain 16%-20% Moisture but flexibility is built into the process
Alkaline Treatment (Wheat, Barley, Rye, Triticale & Oats) 
Harvest window – all through the harvest as moisture can be adjusted by the addition of water;
Grain moisture at treatment – 16% - 20% Additive increases the Protein content of grain by 4%+ and stabilises for storage for a single cost;
Grain cracked and the appropriate amount of additive applied;
Grain is covered and sealed using silage polythene to aid stabalisation;
Can also be stored outdoors once moisture excluded undercover; 
Depending on the additive used you can feed the treated grain after two to six weeks;
Can be included in meal mixes due to its lower moisture and stability in storage Alkaline pH (8 to 9.5) provides a buffer to improve Rumen function of the entire diet Less likely to be attacked by birds or vermin due to Alkaline nature Minimal storage loss; 
Storage Period – 12 Months plus (longer-term storage option compared to crimped);
Feed Rates: Dairy up to 10 Kg, Beef-Can be fed ad-lib.
Mature Grain 16%-25% Moisture 
Acid Treatment (Wheat, Barley, Rye, Triticale & Oats) 
Treat grain using acids (eg propionic acid etc) at moistures ranging from 17% to 25%;
Application rates vary according to grain moisture content and product used;
Acids may have a negative effect on grain protein utilisation;
May not complement diets high in acidic silages;
Ensure even and adequate application rates;
Acid is applied to whole or rolled grains prior to storage;
Monitor grain temperature and ventilate if necessary if storing long term;
Storage Period: Up to 6+ months;
Can’t be included in meal mixes at the higher end of moisture range;
Feed Rates: Dairy up to 4 Kg, Beef-6Kg (depending on pH of silage); Acid treatment, while quite popular, does not enhance the feed value of the grain and in some situations where the main forage is wet and has a low pH; digestive upsets may occur when using high levels of the acid treated grain.; Propionic acid is also in short supply at present and may not be available.
Dry Grain 14% - 17% Moisture (Wheat, Barley, Rye, Triticale & Oats) 
It is necessary to lower the grain moisture to between 14 and 17% to prevent heating during storage if no additive is to be added;
High diesel costs will make drying expensive in 2021;
May be necessary to aerate during storage;
Can be more difficult to roll when dry, depending on equipment available;
Too fine particle size when rolled/ground may induce digestive upsets and acidosis in cattle when fed at higher rates;
Caution should be taken when rolling due to dust;
The addition of water to reduce dust may cause the grain to heat before it can be fed;
Storage weight loss can be high at 3 to 4% due to moisture loss;
Once rolled must be fed within 4 weeks ideally;
Can be included in meal mixes;
Feed Rates: Wheat dairy up to 3 Kg, beef-4Kg; Barley dairy up to 4 Kg, Beef-6Kg; storage Period up to 9+ months; must be stored in dry clean conditions (insects must be controlled).
With all grain processing options seek expert advice when considering which one is best for you and your livestock this winter.
This applies to feed value, ease of storage, operator safety, and reliability of the process.
The beef trade is buoyant at the moment and whether you are producing weanlings, stores, or finishing cattle, feeding a top quality Irish cereal as part of your diet will improve performance and help to control production costs this coming year.

Increased beef cattle prices will be supported by reduced supplies in 2021"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40338545.html,2021-07-17 13:00:00,Study reveals only Ireland gets close to adequate wages for dairy farming,"Milk costs from 2015 to 2019 were analysed in key milk-producing EU countries for the EMB by German agricultural sociologist Dr Karin Juergens. The minimum milk price farmers needed for a decent family income was calculated.
General operating costs (based on official EU data) included seeds, fertilisers, feed, buildings, machinery, pesticides, and energy. Droughts were found to have caused a significant cost increase for feed in some countries.
When beef sales were deducted from general operating costs, paid milk production costs were found to range from 21.54c/kg in Ireland to 38.68c in Denmark.
Adequate income was calculated, based mainly on national wage agreements. This ranged from €8.76 per hour in Lithuania to €30.06 in Denmark (€22.66 in Ireland).
But in most countries, not even paid costs were covered, not to mind adequate income (CAP payments were included as income). Only Ireland came close, with ""real"" income of €22.23 per hour not too far short of the estimated adequate income of €22.66.
The EU average outcome was found to be ""real"" income of €3.25 per hour compared to estimated adequate income of €19.85.
Economic sense 
According to the study by Dr Jürgens, this outcome is being reflected in dairy farm closures across the EU, because it makes little economic sense for a young farmer to stay in dairying.
In the study, net investment from 2009 to 2018 was found to be generally low, and negative in France, implying running down of assets.
According to the study, the milk production cost (including adequate income of 12.07c/kg, based on an hourly wage of €22.66) in Ireland increased to 34.21c/kg in 2019, mainly because of drought (in 2018) making feed more expensive. 
But the milk price was only 31.26c.
The average Irish outcome in the study from 2015 to 2019 was a ""cost"" of 21.54c, compared to a 33.38c milk price.
In 2019, the average milk cost (including adequate income) across the EU was calculated at 45.35 cents/kg. With EU prices for milk averaging 34.52 cents/kg, there was a significant shortfall. 
“This clearly shows a problematic imbalance throughout the EU,” said EMB President Sieta van Keimpema, from the Netherlands.
Production costs 
The EMB said Ireland had the lowest production costs in 2019 by a long shot, at 34.21 cents/kg. However, even with Ireland’s extremely favourable conditions for milk production, costs in the study were not covered in three of the five years looked at.
At the other end of the scale, Lithuania, with many small farms, had the highest 2019 production costs at 58.63c/kg, and a low milk price of 28.79c, leaving a shortfall of 51%.
Production “costs” in the eight EU countries were found to range from about 34 to 59c/kg, but prices for milk only ranged from about 29 to 34c/kg.
The EMB said the study showed that in the Netherlands and Denmark, farm managers and family labour were left with nothing in hand, and thus no income. 
“We have to bear in mind that we are talking about the Netherlands and Denmark, countries with very modern farms that continue to take on new technical developments,” says Ms van Keimpema.
Dr Jürgens, the author of the study, said: “Dairy farms are not just missing the earnings needed for stable and future-proof operations. 
""They are not even making enough for an appropriate income or even an adequate living.” In the study, she calculated costs including income targets appropriate for the level of training and qualifications and based on national minimum wages.
EMB Vice-President Kjartan Poulsen, an organic dairy farmer in Denmark, said: “How can it be acceptable for someone to earn nothing or close to nothing? We are a well-trained workforce with long-standing experience, and we work hard every day. That includes weekends and holidays.
“Furthermore, we also undertake major risks and shoulder significant responsibility for our animals, for food security and for the environment.” 
Insights
Dr Jürgens said the study provides important insights for successful implementation of current environmental policies like the EU’s Green Deal. 
“Farms will only be in a position to contribute to the implementation of environmental, climate and animal welfare goals that imply higher costs if there are lasting improvements to their economic situation.” 
She found that 2019 milk production costs, including appropriate remuneration, were lower than paid milk prices in all eight countries and in the EU on average. 
The calculated cost shortfall averaged 24% in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, which together produce 60% of the EU-27's milk.
High general operating costs were attributed in Denmark to wages, depreciation, and contractor charges; in France to depreciation, and contract work; and in Lithuania and Luxembourg, depreciation was almost half of the costs.
Denmark has only 35% family labour, compared to nearly 70% in other member states.
Per kg of milk, adequate income is low in Denmark because of high milk yield and less non-remunerated family labour.
It is high in Lithuania, due to more family labour, and low milk yield.
The study included a separate analysis of organic milk production in Germany in 2019, based on data from the federal ministry. 
The cost was estimated at 64.63c/kg (including adequate income of 24.53c for labour), compared to a milk price of 47.17. Real earnings per kg to repay the estimated 24.53c for labour were therefore only 7c.
The European Milk Board (see europeanmilkboard.org) is made up of 21 dairy farmer associations and farmers' lobbies in 16 countries, including the ICMSA in Ireland.

Brexit is disrupting the trade of alcohol and dairy"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40340792.html,2021-07-19 17:20:00,Teagasc National Farm Survey reveals increase in average farm income,"Production costs were lower as key farm input prices fell last year in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic and incomes across the various farm systems in Ireland either held, or improved in 2020, the Teagasc National Farm Survey 2020 has revealed.
It had been initially feared that Covid-19 would significantly damage food demand, particularly for beef, due to foodservice closure and lockdown measures in Ireland and in overseas markets.
However, this was effectively off-set by growth in the consumption of food at home.
A Brexit trade deal was eventually agreed upon, but the protracted negotiations created additional uncertainty, impacting beef prices in particular.
Beef
In the Spring of 2020 there was some significant, but ultimately short-term, disruption to the beef supply chain which saw Irish finished cattle prices decline sharply.
As a result, supplementary support was provided by the national exchequer under the Covid-19 State Aid Temporary Framework to beef farmers who delivered cattle for slaughter between February 1 and June 12 2020.
In spite of these challenges, farm output prices held firm overall in 2020 and a feared fall in farm incomes did not materialise, although some farm systems fared better than others.
Weather conditions in Ireland were generally favourable for grass production in 2020, but difficult planting conditions had a negative impact on Irish cereal crop production, leading to a decline in yields.
Covid-19 led to a significant reduction in global economic activity in 2020.
This had a major negative impact on crude oil and other energy prices, with knock-on consequences for fertiliser prices.
Feed
Feed prices were also lower in 2020.
The fall in input prices benefitted farmers through a reduction in their production costs. These cost reductions were sufficient to boost the average income in Irish agriculture in 2020.
Across the key output categories, lamb prices performed best, recording a 13% increase in 2020 compared with 2019.
Beef and Dairy farmers benefited from marginally higher cattle and milk prices in 2020. 
Cereal prices were up significantly in 2020, reflecting market supply and demand conditions.
Lower Dairy system production costs, coupled with a further increase in milk output volume and slightly higher milk prices, resulted in an average dairy farm income of €74,236 in 2020, an increase of 13% on the 2019 level.
The Cattle Rearing system, which comprises farms that are mainly specialised in suckler beef production, benefitted from marginally lower production costs in 2020.
However, the value of output and support payments was also down slightly in 2020.
Income
Overall, the average Cattle Rearing income of €9,037 in 2020, was unchanged on the 2019 level.
In the ‘Cattle Other’ system, which comprises mainly beef finishing farms, but also includes farms selling store cattle, production costs fell in 2020.
While support payments were also lower, the value of farm output increased.
In combination this resulted in an average income of €14,813 in 2020 for the Cattle Other System, an increase of 8% on the 2019 level.
The Sheep system also benefited from lower production costs in 2020 and also experienced a strong increase in the value of farm output, which was driven by higher lamb prices.
In common with other drystock systems, on average the level of direct payments for Sheep farm was down slightly.
The average income on Sheep farms increased by 24% in 2020 relative to the 2019 level to €18,383 in 2020.
Tillage
The Tillage system experienced poor production conditions in 2020, which led to lower crop yields. In line with other sectors, input prices for tillage farms decreased in 2020.
However, there was also a significant increase in cereal prices in 2020, partially offsetting the impact of the drop in crop yields.
The average income on tillage farms fell by 1% in 2020 to €32,525.
Taking account of the income developments across the various farm systems, the average family farm income rose by 9% in Ireland in 2020 to €25,662.

Legal advice: Can my 15-year-old drive a quad bike?"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsandculture/arid-40340477.html,2021-07-20 08:30:00,Laura Fitzgerald: Why being an artist is similar to being a farmer,"In her wry and sometimes satirical take on the art world, Laura Fitzgerald's Crawford exhibition, entitled I Have Made a Place, draws attention to the difficult and insecure profession of the artist. The Kerry artist, who has returned to live and work in her native Inch, having spent years in Dublin, has created large-scale scroll drawings, videos with her own voiceovers, and striking bale forms with sound installations that keep the viewer engaged. The cylindrical bales, green cotton ones as well as pink ones, are a nod to her agricultural background. She draws comparisons between farming and the work of an artist.
Fitzgerald recalls annual visits to the mart with her father, a former beef cattle farmer, who is now retired. ""Dad would be selling the weanlings. His whole earning structure was based on a certain date in October or November. If it wasn't a good day at the mart and if the beef price had gone down, there was disappointment and real concern about staying alive and bringing up the family in Ireland in the 90s.""
""Art,"" says Fitzgerald, ""is very similar. Each year, my peers and myself go to the Arts Council looking for a bursary. If we get it, it means we can live comfortably, but not extravagantly, for twelve months. We can pay for our materials and our basic living costs.""
The small green bales in Fitzgerald's exhibition ""are supposed to be the artist at the beginning of the art career path and then the stack of large pink bales are like a more established artist's status.""
There are speakers in and around the bales and among the musings emanating from them is the notion of the different stages of an artist's career, inspired by recent Arts Council categories for funding. ""These days, for the annual bursary application, you self-declare whether you're an emerging, mid-career or established artist. I was really struck by this when I put in my application for the 2020 bursary. I was going - 'am I emerging? No way am I mid-career.' A colleague, Aideen Barry, referred to me as being mid-career. I was scoffing at this, going 'no way José'. I'm barely able to scrape from one year to the next. There are no guarantees. I want to use this show as a vehicle to examine some of that. Like when do you find that you're stable?""
Laura Fitzgerald's exhibition 'I Have Made a Place' at Crawford Art Gallery. Picture: Jed Niezgoda
Fitzgerald points out that in early seascape or landscape painting, there is always a horizon line in the distance. ""It's the idea of a future. With the invention of perspective in art, you always have an idea of a future trajectory. In the last few years, before Covid struck, there has been a lot of discussion that we're living in a neo-liberal society. It's like a post-human society where computers and technology are the main labour forces. There's no idea of a future because of climate change. Or the future looks bleak.""
But Fitzgerald wants to offer ""a kind of resistance to this nihilistic approach. For me, if I see farmers out in the fields making bales of hay, it means there'll be another spring. The bales in the exhibition are meant to be hopeful.""
In an amusing satirical voiceover accompanying Fitzgerald's videos of metaphorical nature scenes, there is much angst about time and not having enough of it in the busy life of an artist. Fitzgerald announces that she is going to phone her mother. She meant to do so - three years ago. Wading into seaweed, there is a sense of the artist submerging herself and experiencing social isolation. ""I'd love to see people but you have to prioritise,"" she states.
Fitzgerald was tutored by performance artist, Nigel Rolfe, when she was doing her masters at the Royal College of Art, London. For one of her videos, she has co-opted Rolfe's piece, Into the Mire, where he walks into the Bog of Allen in response to the collapse of the Celtic Tiger.
Wearing a mask of a man's face, Fitzgerald sinks into and rises up out of a bog. ""Sometimes you have to fall down to rise up again. So that video is a kind of hopeful gesture. It's fighting back against the message that you have to work flat out all the time to be a successful and upright member of society.""
Fitzgerald is slowly renovating ""an old cow house which was my dad's milking parlour when he was a dairy farmer in the 80s."" It will be a studio for this innovative artist who has come back to her roots. The future may be uncertain but Fitzgerald feels grounded.
I Have Made a Place is at the Crawford Art Gallery until September 19.

Cork In 50 Artworks, No 13: How Terry O’Neill’s photograph of The Beatles ended up in Cork"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40342844.html,2021-07-22 10:00:00,'Underlying vulnerability' of farm incomes highlighted in Teagasc National Farm Survey ,"“The overall increase in farm incomes is positive but does not take from the ongoing vulnerability of the majority of Irish farmers.” 
This is according to the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) which was responding to the Teagasc National Farm Survey published on Monday.
It revealed an increase in average farm income from €23,600 in 2019 to €25,663 in 2020 - a rise of 9% - and highlighted how, in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, incomes across the various farm systems in Ireland either held, or improved in 2020.
The survey said that in the spring of 2020 there was some significant, but ultimately short-term, disruption to the beef supply chain which saw Irish finished cattle prices decline sharply.
As a result, it added, supplementary support was provided by the national exchequer under the Covid-19 State Aid Temporary Framework to beef farmers who delivered cattle for slaughter between February 1 and June 12 2020.
“In spite of these challenges, farm output prices held firm overall in 2020 and a feared fall in farm incomes did not materialise, although some farm systems fared better than others,” a spokesperson said.
“Weather conditions in Ireland were generally favourable for grass production in 2020, but difficult planting conditions had a negative impact on Irish cereal crop production, leading to a decline in yields.” 
Incomes
IFA president, Tim Cullinan, meanwhile, pointed to the sectoral level of income, and added, “average farm incomes remained static or decreased for many sectors in 2020”.
“Tillage incomes fell by 1%, while cattle rearing remained unchanged,” he continued.
“Sheep income grew by 24%, cattle other grew by 8%, and dairy experienced growth of 13%.
“It’s important to remember that the average income of suckler farmers, for instance, remains at just over €9,000 while average annual earnings per employee across the entire economy is closer to €40,000, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).”
“Only 34% of the sample farms in the survey remain economically viable - 33% are sustainable, and the final 33% are financially vulnerable.
“52% of farms are relying on off-farm employment as an income stream, and the reality is, without this income, there would be no farming taking place on most of those farms.
“Direct payments account for 157%, 115%, 103% and 79% of average farm incomes in the cattle rearing, cattle other, sheep and tillage systems, respectively.
“This emphasises the importance of the ongoing CAP discussions for all of the sectors. 
""The sheep system also benefited from lower production costs in 2020 and also experienced a strong increase in the value of farm output, which was driven by higher lamb prices.
In common with other drystock systems, on average the level of direct payments for sheep farm was down slightly.
The Survey highlighted how the average income on sheep farms increased by 24% to €18,383 while the average income on tillage farms fell by 1% to €32,525.

‘Resilient’ land prices in Munster expected to rise by 5% in 2021"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40343846.html,2021-07-25 13:00:00,‘Ireland can be the most sustainable food producer on earth’,"Ireland can be the most resource-efficient, carbon-neutral, sustainable food producer on Earth, said economist, author and university lecturer David McWilliams during the recently held Alltech ONE Ideas Conference.
However, there are large stumbling blocks scattered along Ireland’s path to energy-efficient and sustainable food production.
One is the commonly encountered misconception that the solution to reducing carbon emissions is to reduce food production - something that McWilliams said the European Union is pushing, but that he believes is a mistake.
“In order for the European Union to get an aggregate reduction in carbon emissions,” said McWilliams, “it would seem to me much more logical to favour those countries that have had an evolutionary or ecological or environmental gift, in order to actually produce more, not less, in places like this, because your input-output ratio is so much lower here [in Ireland] than it is either in the parched Mediterranean or in the frozen tundra of the North.” 
McWilliams believes that in order for Irish agriculture to modernise and grow, it needs to take a leaf out of the book of one of Ireland’s leading sectors, technology, which generates over $25 billion in exports.
He said embracing innovation could cultivate new agricultural breakthroughs, making Ireland the best food producer on Earth, and in turn, producing a new export, in the form of incredibly valuable ag-tech.
Conference
In an Alltech ONE Ideas Conference keynote discussion, Alltech president and CEO Dr Mark Lyons joined McWilliams to talk about countries that significantly influence global agriculture.
“What the [COVID-19] pandemic has told us is that none of us is alone, none of us can isolate ourselves, and the world is kind of smaller than we thought, and more interrelated,” said McWilliams.
Looking at the United States, McWilliams said its agriculture output tripled between 1948 and 2015, with enormous gains in efficiency. 
Around 90% of farmers cannot make a living from their land alone.
Agriculture only contributes to 7.5% of total US greenhouse gases, far below the 30% attributed to cars.
“I think American culture is changing, at least when you see it from the outside,” said McWilliams, when asked about the Biden administration.
“He's saying, ‘There's no point being wealthy if the wealth is only in the hands of a small minority. The wealth has to trickle down to everybody else.’”
Environment and inequality
What President Biden understands, according to McWilliams, is that the environment and inequality are the important issues and that they need to be addressed in order for the world to move forward, even if that goes against previously held beliefs.
“We cannot have an immediate gratification mindset, which is ‘me, mine, my balance sheet, my profit margin, etc.,’” he said.
“We have to have a legacy mindset that we are, as I said at the top of the animation, we're just custodians. We're only passing through, right?”
McWilliams said the Biden administration understands that the farming community is key to addressing these issues, especially regarding the country’s environmental impact.
He said the president realises that agriculture is the solution to meeting carbon-neutral targets in the future.
McWilliams said US agriculture is about to go through an enormous change, reinstating confidence and self-belief in the industry that has been missing for a long time.
The keynote discussion also looked at Brazil, the largest exporter of beef and chicken meat globally, the world’s pigmeat producer, the largest exporter of soybeans and coffee, the biggest global producer of sugar and ethanol, and the exporter of orange juice to over half of the global market.

According to Lyons and McWilliams, Brazil has often failed to spread the good news stories of its agri-food industry. We only ever hear nightmarish stories of them forcing cattle ranchers off their land and allowing the rainforest to be destroyed.
They suggested it is time for Brazil to reassess its legacy and to show how, rather than being part of the problem, its agricultural industry is integral to the global solution.
McWilliams said Brazil can be at the forefront of agricultural and environmental change.
“It seemed to me that if Brazil gets its agriculture right, the world gets its agriculture right...and what happens in Brazil will happen elsewhere around the developing world.” He suggested that Brazil has to focus on aggressively positive messaging, revealing to people how much of what they eat comes from Brazil and how efficiently it is produced.
“The question is: Can it go from strength to strength in terms of people's perceptions of whether Brazil is a good environmental citizen?” 
China
In the keynote discussion, it was suggested that for China to succeed in becoming the world’s largest economy and military power, it must secure a sufficient food supply for its people, and ensure that they are not subjected to inflated food prices.
However, this is complicated by China’s limited natural resources, particularly water.
The outcome has been a transformation and modernisation of Chinese agriculture, which utilises cutting-edge technology like no other country, allowing China to stake its claim as the world’s most sustainable food producer.
Meanwhile, the trend in China and Asia towards a more Western diet of beef and dairy instead of traditional tofu and rice is another indicator of how the continent will influence food and agriculture production and the supply chain as we move forward, said McWilliams.
“The future is one whereby China will try and do whatever it can to make sure that its agricultural production remains high and/or that it can buy in food,” McWilliams said.
The annual Alltech ONE Ideas Conference invites thought-leaders and change-makers to explore the power of science, technology and human ingenuity.
Normally an in-person experience in Lexington, Kentucky, where the Alltech company is headquartered, the Conference has been a virtual event in 2020 and 2021.

Protecting Ireland’s past by raising awareness"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40347197.html,2021-07-28 08:47:00,Marts Report: Angus selling better than Charolais,"The Angus is selling better than the Charolais in the marts at the moment. Just to give an example, in Skibbereen mart on Friday, two Aberdeen Angus steers weighing 640kg made €1,510. Another two lighter lads weighing 462kg made €1,230.
And while the Certified Angus Scheme, whereby a seller gets a bonus payment at the factory is a factor, you have to wonder does it really warrant the high prices being paid for Angus cattle at the marts.
A Belgian Blue cow weighing 850kg sold for €1,800 at last Tuesday's Kanturk Mart.
Whatever the reason, Angus cattle are in demand and are flying higher than Jeff Bezos was in his new Shepard rocket. The only difference being, the Angus doesn't look like it's in any hurry to come back down to earth any time soon. The Angus is pricy at the moment and difficult to purchase.
In Skibbereen on Friday dry cows sold from €105 to €875 with the kilo. Weanling bulls made from €340 to €695 with their weight.
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus bullocks sold from €305 to €870 with the kilo.
Heifers in Skibbereen made from €315 to €890 with their weight. While continental bullocks sold from €350 to €895 with the kilo.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40348145.html,2021-07-29 16:00:00,Steady trading as cattle prices are maintained at the factories,"The positive for beef finishers is that the prices at the factories have been maintained across all categories.
The increase in the supply, which has lifted by up to 4,000 head/week, coupled with the approach of August, had created fears of a possible tightening in the prices on offer from the processors.
On the processor side, while the upward movement in the prices has been stalled, there is strong demand for cattle to supply the beef markets.
The factory bosses are aware that any easing of the prices could be counterproductive if it resulted in a drop in the intake and resulted in increased pressure on getting sufficient supply to the orders on hand.
This HEX Cow born in May 2018 with LMX calf born in June 2021 sold for €1,840 at Roscrea Mart on Friday last. Picture: James Treacy.
So for the moment, it is steady trading on the quoted prices which are unchanged for this week.
The steers continue on a base of 425cents/kg.
It has become more difficult to get above that, although there are some reports of a few deals being secured at a base of 430cents/kg, while by and large, the view of the factories appears to be that they don't have to pay the extra to get sufficient cattle this week.
Heifer prices are following the same pattern of trade. They are on a base of 430cents/kg which is being tightly adhered to for the majority of the supply and deals on a base of 435cents/kg are more the exception than the rule.
The overall supply of finished cattle for the year is forecast to be well down on recent years, but the general movement towards slaughtering at earlier ages is also bringing forward future supplies.
The year-to-date intake at the factories is running at 70,000 head less than in 2020.
The intake for last week was 32,994 head, which was 2,400 head lower than for the same week in 2020.
With the exception of the young bulls the lower supply is showing across all of the main categories.
There were 14,115 steers supplied last week, which is back 1,000 head on 2020, while the heifer intake at 8,650 head was lower by 300 head and the cows at 7,381 head back by 1,200 head.
The exception was the young bulls, which at 2,147 head was nearly 300 head higher than in 2020.
The prices for the R grade young bulls are on par with the steers at 425cents/kg.
The cow prices are also holding steady, having slipped back a few cents in recent weeks. 
There is strong demand for cows as the catering trade opens up more both at home and overseas.
The quality R grade cows are making up to 390cents/kg with the O grade ranging 360-375cents/kg in general and up to 380cents/kg for the better quality animals.

Factory demand is seasonally low in the past week with no massive appetite for additional numbers.
Last week’s throughput at 69,025 is a reflection of this sluggish demand, with weekly kill numbers exceeding 70,000 most weeks this year to date.
Karro in particular in Cookstown NI have put back pigs from their regular ROI suppliers.
All processors of pigs and pigmeat report that pigmeat is slower to move in the warm weather with other meats, beef, in particular, gaining most from BBQ season.
The situation across Europe remains difficult with a sluggish return to tourism and very poor expert demand from China.
Ireland’s percentage of the EU price has improved and is currently 107% of the EU average price as reported to the EU Commission for the week commencing July 17.
Factory pig throughput in the Republic of Ireland export plants for the week ending July 25, 2021 was 71,161 head which was 2,912 more than the previous week and 3,786 more than in the corresponding week in 2020.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40351244.html,2021-08-03 07:30:00,"Farmers 'unfairly' blamed for climate change, says Agriculture Minister","Farmers have been unfairly singled out and blamed for climate change and consumers will have to take greater responsibility for emissions, the Agriculture Minister has said.
Charlie McConalogue said the debate around our agricultural sector, which accounts for one-third of carbon emissions, has been ""one-sided"" and ""misinformed"".
It comes as Mr McConalogue is due to bring legislation forward to establish a food ombudsman, which would look at the margins farmers get for their produce compared to those further up the chain, including distributors and supermarkets.
Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue during his visit to Cahir Mart. Picture: Denis Minihane
Farming organisations have criticised the Government's ""deafening silence"" when it comes to admitting climate change measures will mean a return to food price inflation.
“We keep waiting for anyone in a senior position in the Irish Government to inform the Irish public that an absolutely certain consequence of the transition to low emissions farming and primary food production is an increase in price to the consumers,"" said Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA) president, Pat McCormack.
Asked about this, Mr McConalogue said consumers must recognise the ""real cost"" of producing food and farmers must have a sustainable income, but he stopped short of saying the price of milk, meat and other products would rise significantly.
""The consumer has a massive role to play in this and is very much leading the change here too.
""But there's also the reality that we're a food exporting nation and we export 90% of what we produce. We're exporting into international markets, over 100 countries right around the world, so you don't get to control the prices that are available in those markets.""
Ireland has committed to cut emissions by 51% by 2030, which has placed a focus on the carbon produced by the dairy and beef sector, with some calling for a reduction in the national herd.
Unfair narrative
However, Mr McConalogue strongly hit out at the unfair narrative being pushed by some that farmers are major polluters who must pay.
""In relation to farmers, and the point about feeling under pressure and feeling that they're very much singled out, I think we do see that. I think it is unfair and I think it's doesn't reflect the approach that farmers have taken, the very significant work that they do on behalf of the environment,"" he said.
Charlie McConalogue speaks to an IFA delegation during his visit to Cahir Mart, Co Tipperary. Picture: Denis Minihane
In an interview with the Irish Examiner, the Donegal TD said: ""I think we will see a rebalancing of the public narrative – I certainly hope – in relation to this. I think a lot of the debate around so far has been one-sided and misinformed.""
Mr McConalogue said more transparency was needed around the pricing structure in the agri-food sector and this is why he is committed to setting up a Food Ombudsman.
It will be about assessing what's happening in the market, looking at the value chain, looking at where the margins are going within that.
""I'm trying to bring clear transparency as to how the prices that we're getting for food primarily in international markets, which is where 90% of the prices are set, how that translates back to what farmers are getting on the ground.""
What's your view on this issue?
You can tell us here
The minister hopes the work of the ombudsman will put pressure on the industry to maximise the return for farmers.
""My target is to have the legislation in at the end of this year to bring it through the Oireachtas, and then to get the office up and running next year and to have it operational next year.""
It comes as a major new decade-long strategy for Ireland’s food and drinks sector is launched.
Food Vision 2030 aims to increase agri-food exports from €14bn to €21bn before the end of the decade, while further enhancing Ireland’s reputation as a sustainable producer.
Launching the policy, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said: ""We accept the challenge put to Government, to work with the sector in ensuring its future sustainability, economic, environmental and social, and in realising the inherent opportunities that presents.""

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40351697.html,2021-08-03 14:00:00,Favourable conditions and tight supplies means beef farmers should 'bargain hard’,"Market conditions for beef should be favourable for the remainder of the year as markets and buying patterns return to normal, according to the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA).
The organisation also pointed to the strong performance of the live export trade to Northern Ireland for store and finished cattle, which is expected to continue into the back end of the year.
This will add strong competition for farmers and ensure numbers of finished cattle will be tight up to year-end.
IFA’s Livestock chairman, Brendan Golden said supplies of finished cattle would be tight for the rest of the year.
He also highlighted how numbers are back to date by over 67,000 head, with the annual kill predicted to be back a further 50,000 head by year-end.
A total of 110,000-120,000 fewer slaughter cattle are available compared to the same period in 2020.
“42,655 cattle have been exported to NI this year, increasing from 13,896 in 2020,” he continued.
“In the UK market, production is predicted to be back at least 4% for the year by combining reduced numbers and lighter carcase weights at slaughter.
“Import demand is expected to strengthen over the coming months as the foodservice sector returns to normal trading conditions. Irish beef has a strong foothold in this sector.” 
EU market 
Meanwhile, EU prices have strengthened over the past week, and overall production for the year is predicted to be down, providing further opportunity for Irish beef exports.
The Chinese demand for protein, redirecting South American beef exports from the EU market, ensures the market is functioning strongly for Irish beef when not undermined by these imports.
“The favourable market conditions in our main export markets are expected to continue for the year,” said Mr Goulden.
“This must be reflected in prices paid to farmers; while beef prices have increased over the year - the Prime Irish Composite price of €4.22/kg is running 30c/kg ahead of the Prime Export Benchmark price of €3.92/kg - production costs have also increased.
“Market conditions are favourable, supplies are tight, and farmers should continue to bargain hard.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40353002.html,2021-08-05 17:00:00,Supply and demand of cattle out of kilter but trade remains steady ,"While there has been an increase in the weekly intake of cattle at the factories over recent weeks, there are no signs of an upward surge being immediate.
The increase in supply over the past two weeks has eased some of the pressure on the factories as the intake came closer to their requirements for the market demand.
In reality, the processors probably require 33,000-34,000 head/week to bring the supply-demand into balance. The shorter working week, with the August Bank Holiday on Monday excluded, is likely to reduce intake for this week by 1,000-1,500 head, but the upward trend is likely to return next week.
While some of the processors are believed to be trying their hand at reducing the price for steers in particular by 5cents/kg this week, for the most part, the trade is steady at the previous week's prices.
Factories in general are on a base of 425cents/kg for the steers. Those trying to buy at less are not having a lot of success, while producers holding out for 430cents/kg are equally finding it more difficult to achieve this week.
The heifers are on a base of 430 cents/kg with some deals at 435cents/kg being reported.
Numbers game
The general vibe is that the processors will move to ease back on the price as soon as they believe the numbers will continue to flow at a sufficient level to avoid any pressure to get enough to meet their needs.
This is where the numbers game, the hazard of prediction comes into play. 
All of the predictions are that the supply for the year will be down by 100,000 to 130,000 head on 2020 with the statistics and general belief that there are fewer cattle approaching finishing on farms this year.
Year to date the intake at the factories is down by 70,000 head on 2020. The supply of heifers is back by 30,000 head, with 15,000 fewer steers killed and 14,000 less young bulls compared to last year.
However, the average age at slaughtering is dropping for the prime beef categories with fewer animals going over 30 months because of the bonus incentive for the younger animals. This trend has to be factored into any determination on predicting throughput.
The price for the young bulls is also holding steady on 420-425cents/kg for R grade with throughput running slightly higher than this time last year as they may have been compensating for some of the decline in the steers.
Best of the R grade cows continue to make 385-390 cents/kg with O's from 360-365 cents/kg.
There was a slight increase in the supply last week, which reached 34,089 head with all categories except the young bulls up. The steer kill was up to 16,327 head with heifers at 8,617 head and young bulls at 1,738 head. The kill included 6,660 cows.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/food/arid-40351982.html,2021-08-07 06:00:00,Menu: Fresh fish and chips and homemade icecream at the beach in Lahinch,"Taste of Dublin
The Menu promised to make further mention of Taste of Dublin (September 1-5) and though the ever-popular assembly of some of Ireland’s top chefs does not commence until September, it’s time to plan that trip to the Big Smoke. It’s a great chance to let your hair down and experience the myriad pleasures of sharing fine food with people other than your fellow lockdown lifers. Despite the addition of a further two days to the usual programme, tickets are being snapped up, particularly with numbers reduced in accordance with Covid guidelines.
The Taste Theatre stage, always at the centre of proceedings, this year features more than 25 of Ireland’s top chefs, including Jordan Bailey of Michelin two-starred Aimsir; Jess Murphy (Kai, Galway); JP McMahon; Rachel Allen; Kevin Dundon; Aoife Noonan; Eric Matthews, and Trisha Lewis.
Taste partners with Culture Vultures, The Laughter Lounge, and The Gaiety School of Acting to provide an entertainment programme of performances, comedy, and theatre shows — all staged in the wonderful surroundings of the beautiful Iveagh Gardens. And the Food for Thought stage, features chefs, food writers and producers, discussing everything from Ireland’s hidden food gems to top chefs and their favourite cookbooks. 
But, all this fodder for hearts and minds ultimately pales in the pursuit of finest fare for the belly and the festival has it in spades with upmarket street food offerings including Pickle; Hang Dai; The Salty Buoy by Niall Sabongi; The Chop House; Bites by Kwanghi; The Port House; Jackrabbit; King Sitric and Three Twenty Ice Cream — each restaurant offering signature dishes and a selected menu of iconic dishes.
Top producers are also to be found — including Hot Chip Dublin; The Cupcake Bloke; Ballymaloe Foods, and Glowberry.
Once you’ve made your initial sweep and compiled your own personal ‘menu’, kick back with a cocktail and have the Just Eat waiter service procure your dishes of choice from various restaurants.
For those perhaps still seeking their post-Covid-courage when it comes to diving back into the crowds, albeit greatly reduced on previous years, the Fercullen Irish Whiskey VIP Garden offers a chance to upgrade your ticket to skip queues with fast-track entry to the event and grab a comfortable base camp for the day.
Tickets are priced from €20 (excl booking fee).

Fish and chips at Lahinch
Newly opened in Lahinch, Co Clare, Spooney’s and Vaughan’s at the Prom, offer fine fare for feasting at the seaside
There are few memories from The Menu’s childhood to trump seaside visits of yore, of the smells and flavours of fine fresh fish and chips and, best of all, the race to devour an ice cream cone before it melts away entirely in the summer sun. Newly-opened Spooney’s and Vaughan’s on The Prom, in Lahinch, in Co Clare, offer the chance to create some fine summer memories of your own if travelling in the West. 
Chef-proprietor, Denis Vaughan, serves up freshly-made ice cream in Spooney’s using milk collected every morning from Lacey’s Farm in Liscannor before pasteurising it in Vaughan’s Anchor Inn, the renowned seafood restaurant founded by his parents in 1979. Flavours include Bronte pistachios from Sicily and Madagascan vanilla, served in cones, wafer baskets, along with sorbets, milkshakes and a super sundae, while Spooney’s fish and chip bar, serves takeaway locally landed fish, battered using Denis’s 19-year-old starter as part of the secret recipe and fried with chips, peeled and cooked in house, using potatoes from nearby Killimer.
Alongside Spooney’s is Vaughan’s on The Prom, a brand new 80-seater restaurant with outdoor terrace overlooking Lahinch Beach, where Denis grills prime Irish seafood, including whole Clare lobsters, Galway Bay langoustines, and John Stone beef.

Today’s special
Colin Whooley, managing director of the family-run Roaring Water Bay Mussels, in West Cork
The Menu has been putting up his feet in glorious west Cork, including that splendidly sunny spell where this little part of paradise morphed into a country on the Aegean Sea, all blistering sunshine and warm turquoise seas. And while his west Cork diet always includes plenty of fine local seafood, his consumption increased to Olympian standards, as if he were back in beautiful Greece.
The fine weather also meant adopting Mediterranean practices in the kitchen — that is, spending as little time as possible sweating over a hot stove, allowing fine produce to do all the heavy lifting, and as much time as possible relishing repasts outdoors as the evening sun set. The Menu found himself returning over and over again to the joyous simplicity of a pot of plump and succulent Roaring Water Bay mussels. Mussels are immensely sustainable fare from the sea — a consideration that should be essential for every right-thinking consumer when purchasing seafood for the table.
With the cork pulled on a nicely chilled, crisp white wine, it’s a matter of minutes to steam the mussels with more of the same wine, onions, garlic, and herbs, creating a simple yet truly splendid feast, with juices mopped up with some crusty sourdough bread and a refreshing green salad on the side.
As has often been the case over the last few months, The Menu’s charcoal barbecue has been glowing and ever ready for action. On occasion, he takes the freshly steamed mussels, plops them into a wire basket and finishes them over the coals, adding delicious smokey tones to the marine umami of this true superfood. 
And the ultimate seasoning comes from that blessed feeling of putting away these magical molluscs while gazing down on the same waters in which they were produced, just a mile or two away in Roaring Water Bay. You won’t find The Menu moaning or whinging any time soon for he truly is a very lucky man.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40353284.html,2021-08-07 13:00:00,Food Vision 2030: Where will your farm be in ten years? ,"The strategic aim for Irish agriculture has changed somewhat over the past decade. The 2030 version of where agriculture is going was released on Tuesday.
As a backdrop, many of you will recall Food Harvest 2020 as being a plan immersed in optimism.
To parlance the document, farmers were tasked with becoming more productive, reducing costs and producing higher value outputs while the food industry was tasked with better target R&D and responding better to market demands.
The opportunity for farmers was increased returns, less exposure to volatility and greater economies of scale with less fragmentation.
The opportunities for the food industry included increased value-added output, higher profitability with consumers' preferences satisfied, improved consumer health and an increase in consumer loyalty.
It’s hard to criticise such an aspirational document, after all, it points to a win-win for all. That document highlighted where agriculture was aiming to be in the decade that was to follow to 2020.
As a reference point the average farm income in 2010 across all sectors was €17,771, for 2020 the story looks a lot better with average farm income across all sectors rising to €25,663.
Income
However, looking in more detail, the reality on the ground is enterprises other than dairying had modest increases in profits if any, with sheep farmers fairing best with an average increase in profits of €6,114 per holding, some of this increase in profitability across the sector reflects the transition of basic payments due to convergence.
The modest increases in average farm profit have not resulted in a transformation for Irish farmers. The big winner, however, over the past ten years has been dairy farming enterprises with family farm income increasing by a chunky €29,804 over 2010 levels.
The abolition of quotas gave dairy farmers the opportunity to expand their business and ultimately farm profits with dairy farms having an average of 56 cows in 2010 versus 82 cows in 2020.
Looking at the 2030 document, the aspirations within are equally noble.
The keyword that permeates throughout the document is sustainability, with this being further divided into economic sustainability, social sustainability and environmental sustainability.
There are four overarching missions: 
The creation of a climate-smart, environmentally sustainable agri-food sector; 
Creating viable and resilient primary producers with enhanced well-being; 
The provision of a sector that produces food that is safe, nutritious, and appealing, trusted and valued at home and abroad; 
Becoming an innovative, competitive and resilient agri-food sector, driven by technology and talent.
Much like the 2020 Food harvest strategy, there is little within the 2030 mission statement one could find fault with.
Challenge
The challenge for all will be the translation of these aspirations into a more meaningful increase in profitability at farm level than has been achieved in the preceding decade.
While there are some notable good news stories of start-ups and successful product positioning at producer level, the reality on the ground is that the vast majority of farmers in Ireland continue to derive their income from farming which is predominately commodity based.
Rebranding product and targeting premium markets is outside of the scope of farmers, and farmers are in a weak position vis a vis claiming a fair share of the margins from producing a premium product.
To my mind this is perhaps best expressed in the relatively low differential in pricing between U grade and P grade beef cattle for farmers.
Farmers will be interested to note within the document the target of creating “a climate-neutral food system by 2050, with verifiable progress achieved by 2030, encompassing emissions, biodiversity and water quality”.
Undoubtedly the biggest challenge for farmers for the coming decade will be the ability to adapt to environmental restrictions and challenges imposed at processor level by those seeking to differentiate and at a base level as a result of EU changes.
The dairy sector which has benefited the most over the last decade in terms of financial performance will find itself facing the biggest challenges over the coming decade in terms of the perceived environmental impact of intensive farming.
Issues already on stream include the introduction of selective dry cow therapy, and by extension default mandatory milk recording, low emission spreading technology, restrictions to the availability of prescriptive therapies and potential restrictions in stocking rates due to potential changes to the nitrates derogation.

Share farming provides opportunity but it also requires trust"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40353257.html,2021-08-08 11:00:00,Measures in place to protect Irish farmers' interests in Mercosur Trade Agreement ,"A marginal reduction of around €50m, compared to an annual €2.3bn value of Irish beef output, would result from ratification of the EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement, according to an assessment of the EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement commissioned by the Government.
Additional beef supply could be expected from Mercosur countries, but the amount will be limited, and phased in over six years, according to the assessment prepared by the EU-based Implement Economics consulting group, with inputs from stakeholders representing agriculture, business and industry, NGOs, government departments and enterprise and environmental agencies, and from a steering group of representatives from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine, and from Teagasc.
The fairly modest increase in imports would, however, be concentrated on high-quality cuts, and will displace some Irish beef in the EU market, if no mitigating actions were undertaken.
Irish beef sector
For the Irish beef sector, an upper-end estimate of the impact is a 0.08% volume reduction in output, but the value of Irish beef output could fall by slightly over 2%.
In the assessment, it was noted that several EU-level measures are in place (or planned) to protect the interests of Irish farmers and consumers.
These include a support package of up to €1bn to assist EU farmers, including Irish beef farmers, in the event of significant market disturbance.
The trade agreement includes a safeguard clause, which can be used if the EU agri-food sector is, or is at threat of being, seriously disturbed by increased imports.
All beef and other food products imported would have to comply fully with the EU’s food safety standards.
The EU
The EU is currently importing around 200,000 tons of beef from the Mercosur countries, of which 75,000 tons is out-of-quota imports paying a high tariff of 40-45%. In the trade agreement, the EU would maintain existing beef import quotas, and high out-of-quota tariffs. But the EU would commit to a controlled and gradual opening of a new quota (with a 7.5% in-quota tariff), and to reducing the in-quota tariff on existing quotas to zero.
The expected additional imports of around 50,000 tons of beef to the EU, when the trade agreement would be fully phased-in, after six years, is only half of the new quota of 99,000 tons, because existing out-of-quota quantities will make use of the new quota, and the lower in-quota tariffs will increase the use of existing quotas.
The expected import increase corresponds to around 0.7% of total EU beef production.
This is an upper-end estimate, based on Mercosur exchange rates remaining competitive, and the EU market being attractive relative to other Mercosur export beef importers (such as China).
The assessment prepared for the Irish government envisages that an increase (of up to 1.1%) in Mercosur agri-food exports to the EU after the trade agreement would not involve increased use of land, nor illegal deforestation. Extra production would instead come from more intense use of the existing agricultural land.
An expected increase in beef exports from Brazil to the EU, of around 20,000 tons, would correspond to a 0.2% increase in Brazil’s beef production. No increase in agricultural land use for beef production in Brazil is envisaged.
According to the assessment, only 7-10% of agricultural land in Brazil and Argentina is for beef, with grains, vegetables, and fruits accounting for 85-90%.
Negotiations
However, more than 340 civil society organisations have urged the EU to halt trade negotiations with the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) on grounds of deteriorating human rights and environmental conditions in Brazil.
According to the new assessment, a co-operative approach to bring about sufficient policy changes in Mercosur countries and the EU to offset negative impacts of trade on biodiversity and forests, the climate, and the environment, is part of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement. And without the trade agreement, it might be harder for the EU to exercise any influence with Mercosur trading partners.
A key responsibility of the EU’s recently appointed Chief Trade Enforcement Officer would be to ensure Mercosur beef production meets EU rules and regulations, and that commitments to sustainability and the environment required of EU farmers are also observed by Mercosur producers.
Liberalised trade with Mercosur would slightly increase the reduction requirements needed to meet the Paris climate commitments in Ireland, by 0.06%. 
However, measures in the Irish Climate Act Bill could neutralise this impact.
On the plus side, it is pointed out that the EU is bidding to be the first major trading bloc to conclude a trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc. Failure to ratify the agreement would risk damaging the credibility of the EU in future trade negotiations. 
There could be a first-mover advantage, giving the EU a competitive edge in the Mercosur market of more than 260 million consumers.
Challenges
However, Mercosur is a challenging market, difficult to enter, with low consumer purchasing power, and low prices would make it difficult for Irish firms to be competitive.
Overall, the EU-Mercosur Agreement is forecast to increase Ireland’s exports to Mercosur by 17% and imports by 12%, and to add €0.5 bn to Ireland’s GDP in 2035 (a 0.13% increase).
At the recent Council of EU Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Martin Heydon said the EU-Mercosur Agreement is a prime example of the need for a level playing field: “We support the Commission’s efforts to have additional, robust, and legally enforceable commitments on environmental and climate action added to this agreement. 
""These commitments should include a sanction regime for non-compliance including the potential removal of preferential tariff rate quotas.”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40353287.html,2021-08-08 13:00:00,Feeding Cattle for slaughter this autumn,"Beef finishers are encouraged by the current factory prices and as a result, forward stores are a good trade in marts all around the country.
It has also had a positive knock-on effect on lighter cattle too. Whether you rear your own cattle or purchase them for finishing, one thing that is absolutely critical to the success of your business is how well you finish them for slaughter.
Cattle for slaughter shouldn’t be put on to their finishing diet until they are ready to be pushed. This has nothing to do with their age and everything to do with how well their frame has been grown.
It is too late for producers to be disappointed with carcase and fat scores post slaughter because the cattle were fed too early and slaughtered due to their age or perceived optimum duration of the finishing period.
Having accurate data and information on your stock is important before you put them on a finishing diet.
Their start weight, breed and sex will determine their intake and dictate what type of ingredients should be included in the finishing diet to complement your grazed grass and homegrown feeds.
Cattle grazing to a finish 
The best of autumn grass will only be capable of giving in the region of 0.75kg live weight gain per day on advanced cattle, whereas the target is a gain of at least 1kg per day.
Cattle have shown a good response at grass when supplemented with 2.5/3kg meal per day. This is provided that excellent quality grass is available at all times.
However, if excellent quality is not available, as is, unfortunately, the case currently, it will be necessary to feed higher levels of meal to heavy heifers or steers that are close to finishing.
The volume of meal needed will depend on the breed and sex of the animals being fed. At this time of year finishing cattle off grass quickly has many advantages, in terms of stocking rate, profitability and workload.
Concentrates to complement grass 
Any concentrates fed at grass will need to be high in energy and low in protein in order to get the final cover of fat on cattle quickly.
Even with the strong price of cereals off the combine, concentrates high in native cereals will be high energy and low protein and ideal to balance grass and achieve desired animal performance. 
If you buy cheaper filler-based rations, you won't get the gain per day from cattle.
Final finish indoors or outdoors 
For sure, if animals continue to perform it is ideal to keep them on grass.
However, if grass quality is not good or if weather or ground conditions deteriorate you are much better off to house finishers sooner rather than later to maintain daily weight gains.
Thankfully ground conditions are excellent at present.
Autumn grassland management 
There are two main objectives for grassland management once you get into August including maintaining animal performance from good quality grass; and preparing grazing for later autumn grazing.
As we move further into August, grass quality will begin to deteriorate due to a drop off in dry matter and sugars.
Priority must be to make the best use of existing grass between now and housing. To get the best use of autumn grass it is essential to avoid poaching during any wet weather events.
With current moisture deficits, this won’t be an issue right now. If grazing larger fields then using a strip wire and back fence from now on to restrict the grazing of re-growths will allow covers to recover for subsequent grazing before closing for the winter.
Continue to apply fertiliser right up to the closing date as there will be a response while conditions allow.

Favourable conditions and tight supplies means beef farmers should 'bargain hard’"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40357133.html,2021-08-11 17:00:00,"Farm to Fork measures could trigger price increase for beef, pork and poultry ","An EU agency says Europe’s meat supply could fall by about 14%, and the milk supply by 10%, if the Farm to Fork plan for sustainable food production is implemented.
This could significantly strengthen the market, generating a 24% price increase for beef, triggering a 126% increase in total income for beef production, according to the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which is the European Commission’s research agency providing independent scientific advice and support to EU policy.
The JRC examined the likely effects of four Farm to Fork strategies including reducing overall use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50%, and the use of more hazardous pesticides by 50%, by 2030; reducing nutrient losses by at least 50%, while ensuring that there is no deterioration in soil fertility - this will reduce the use of fertilisers by at least 20%, by 2030; having at least 25% of the EU’s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030, and a significant increase in organic aquaculture; and having at least 10% of agricultural area under high-diversity landscape features.
Reducing use of fertilisers by at least 20% is predicted to have a major impact on the livestock sector because herds would have to be reduced. Hence the predicted meat supply decrease by about 14% and milk supply by 10%.
Farm to Fork 
Meanwhile, Farm to Fork measures could result in a 43% increase in pork meat prices, and the 18% increase in poultry meat prices would lead to higher total income for the relevant production sectors (increases of 129% and 83%, respectively).
Livestock for meat across the board is predicted to be worth an extra 17% to 38% more, significantly boosting incomes for beef, pig meat and poultry meat producers, and lifting the income of the average sheep and goat meat farmer by about 6%.
Researchers admitted that, in the real world (rather than the economic models they used), such dramatic domestic price shocks leading to large price differentials would cause imports to increase.
Scenarios they looked at didn’t include imports increasing enough to counterbalance the drop in EU supply, but they said further research is needed to get a better idea on how such a dramatic shock would affect world trade flows of beef and pork.
In sharp contrast, the income of the EU cereals sector is expected to decrease substantially (by 26%). That would be due to an 11% drop in yields and a 4% reduction in acreage predicted by the JRC, with rising grain prices (by 8.2%) and declining production costs (by 1.6%) insufficient to compensate for falling income.
Cereals
Some farmers would increase cereal acreage to compensate for lower yields, due to the shift to organic farming, and the lower pesticide use, required in Farm to Fork strategies. 
But this would not compensate fully for a 9% reduction of the EU cereal acreage due to the Farm to Fork requirement to have at least 10% of agricultural area under high-diversity landscape features, and arable land switching to set aside (or other non-productive use).
It is envisaged the EU would remain a net exporter of cereals, although imports would grow 39%. EU oilseed imports would increase significantly, probably mainly from Canada and Ukraine.
Smaller impacts were predicted for vegetables and permanent crops (such as fruit trees, vineyards, olives), with a price increase of 15% nearly offsetting a yield decrease, but increased costs still leaving overall incomes reduced by 5%.
Although the areas for vegetables and permanent crops are predicted to remain stable, supply falls 12% due to a drop in yields, mostly due to lower organic yields.
Meat
EU pork meat exports are predicted to decrease by 77%, driven by the drop in EU supply and the drastic increase in prices leaving the EU less competitive on global pig meat markets. Poultry meat imports are predicted to increase by a factor of three from countries such as Brazil and Thailand.
The only sector where JRC researchers predict an improved food net trade position is dairy products. A 5% improved net trade position is attributed to increased exports of whey powder.
However, researchers did not take into account the EU’s 50% food waste reduction target. Nor did they include the shift to diets with more plant-based products (which the EU targets) in their calculations. 
That would reduce the impacts on livestock production, leaving more EU meat available for export, and less need for imports.
Pollution
The JRC scenarios envisage environmental benefits, particularly reduction of nitrogen pollution due to using less fertiliser. Reductions in nitrogen surplus, nitrogen leaching, and ammonia emissions, are predicted across all of the EU countries, except for a few regions with increased pig and cattle herds, or intensive cereal and oilseed production. 
Non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would also decrease in many member states.
The four Farm to Fork targets examined by the JRC can help to deliver a 20.1% reduction in agricultural sector GHGs by 2030, therefore bringing to a halt the increasing trend in agri-emissions seen since 2014.
However, a predicted reduction of 14.8% in methane and nitrous oxide emissions would be nearly 66% cancelled by ‘leakage’ due to emission increases in non-EU regions, unless there are additional mitigation actions in the rest of the world (it was largely assumed in JRC models that the EU acts alone on climate mitigation).
Nearly a 30% reduction in agricultural sector GHGs by 2030 is envisaged if a reformed CAP includes multiple interventions for climate mitigation, and limits carbon leakage.
Cover cropping to increase the carbon content in soils is expected to be the most beneficial Farm to Fork agronomic practice, followed by precision farming and variable rate technology, which would together make fertiliser application more efficient.
Yields 
Better organic yields would also result in better scenarios; the researchers assumed a worst-case yield gap between organic and conventional agriculture.
“The agri-food sector will have to go through a challenging transition and this study, with all its limitations, shows the magnitude of the challenge,” said researchers.
“In particular, there is a need for global action to avoid leakage of pollution to other world areas. 
""There is also a need for productivity gains with respect to organic farming and nutrient management which can be achieved with precision farming, new digital technologies and other innovative techniques, all part of the growth dimension of the Green Deal.
“The significant price impacts indicate the crucial role of changes in consumer behaviour in order to reduce the environmental footprint of food consumption.”
Researchers also highlighted how special care will be needed to ensure just transition towards sustainable and climate-friendly agriculture, including a comprehensive impact assessment of legislation for sustainable food systems.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-40357151.html,2021-08-11 20:20:00,Ursula von der Leyen: How the Green Deal and climate change will affect Ireland,"When the Irish Examiner was invited to engage with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on the climate crisis and the EU's response, reporter Pádraig Hoare enlisted the help of a range of climate, energy, and biodiversity experts to frame probing questions.
They included University College Cork lecturer and researcher in energy/economy/environment/engineering, Dr Hannah Daly; research fellow at the MaREI Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy and the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) at UCC, Dr Paul Deane; and the Irish Wildlife Trust campaign officer Padraic Fogarty.
What's your view on this issue?
You can tell us here
The commission president spoke about the Green Deal, what it means for Ireland and its people, the ravages of climate change, and biodiversity issues, following the stark report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that humans have been the main driver of exacerbating the crisis in recent decades.
-------------
Question: The majority of Ireland’s heating and transport is fuelled by oil, and the Green Deal is proposing to bring these sectors into an emissions trading scheme, which will increase the cost to households. How will the Green Deal ensure that people who can’t afford an electric vehicle (EV) or to retrofit their home not be unfairly penalised, risking more energy poverty?
Answer: The principle behind the European Green Deal is to stop global warming and develop a new growth strategy, based on a decarbonised circular economy that provides jobs and opportunities for all, while reducing emissions and preserving nature. Our utmost priority is to bring the benefits of this green transition to all, as quickly and fairly as possible.
Let’s not forget why we have to act now. We simply cannot afford the rising costs of climate change. Extreme weather events are happening all over the globe, more and more often.

This year we have seen a deadly tornado in Czechia that destroyed 2,000 houses, devastating floods in Belgium and Germany, costing hundreds of lives, and dreadful fires in Cyprus and other countries. Poorer citizens, who cannot afford to just move or rebuild, are always hit the hardest.
Therefore, the green transition has to be fair and socially just. That’s why we propose to provide compensation and support to more vulnerable citizens. Our €72bn Social Climate Fund will support people on low incomes and will facilitate investments in clean technologies. The goal is precisely to cut bills for vulnerable households and small businesses. The fund will support citizens in Ireland to finance zero-emission heating or cooling systems, to install solar panels on their houses or to buy a cleaner car. Transport and energy must be affordable for all.
-------------
Q: Along the same lines, what does the Green Deal mean for jobs? Will people lose their jobs as we move away from fossil fuels? We have seen the dire political fallout across the Atlantic as populist candidates make promises that traditional industries like coalmining will remain in situ or even recover, seducing voters with these platforms. Is there a real chance of medium-to-long-term political upheaval, threatening the bloc's future, if the Just Transition is not carried out correctly and fairly?
A: The European Green Deal is about creating jobs and opportunities for all - it is projected to generate one million green jobs in the EU by 2030 and two million green jobs by 2050. It is about enabling citizens, businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive in the economy of the future. 
The aim is to create new markets, new jobs, new products and to grow, innovate and unleash creativity so that everyone can seize the opportunities made available by the shift towards a low-carbon economy. We want a just transition - our whole European Green Deal package aims at a fair distribution of efforts and of support between Member States, to leave no country and no region behind.

EU's Green Deal heaps pressure on Ireland's offshore wind targets     
The EU budget will help. Ireland is set to receive €13bn over the coming years, from various programmes, including NextGenerationEU. This will provide significant investment for the greening and decarbonisation of the economy. 
For example, it will support the Midlands, the region most affected by Ireland’s transition from peat, as well as the large-scale energy renovation of buildings throughout the country, and the electrification of the commuter railway network in Cork.
NextGenerationEU will also boost climate innovation in Ireland, by investing in research and skills. This, of course, will benefit of Irish businesses. It will promote emission-reducing technologies and help create the jobs of the future.
-------------
Q: Is it fair that we in the EU are asked to do so much when countries like China will continue polluting?
A: First, I believe that the rest of the world is also waking up to the facts: the cost of not acting against global warming is rising dramatically everywhere. We have recently seen heavy rain and flooding in China, but also deadly temperatures in Canada and melting permafrost in Siberia, to name a few examples. 
China is also vulnerable to climate change and knows it needs to tackle it. The fight against climate change is now a truly global effort.
With the European Green Deal, Europe is leading the way. If others follow our lead, the world will be able to keep warming below 1.5C. We are encouraging all other countries that have ambitious climate goals to prepare with a clear roadmap on how to achieve them. That is how we will approach the UN’s COP26 climate conference in Glasgow this autumn.
To encourage the rest of the world to set a price on carbon and to invest in climate-friendly production, we proposed a carbon border adjustment mechanism. Carbon must have a price everywhere. Europe’s industry and businesses are now investing heavily in climate-friendly technologies. 
It would not be fair if companies from third countries undermine these efforts by flooding our EU internal market with cheap but carbon-intensive products. Companies should pay a price for the carbon they bring to Europe. However, when producers from outside the EU come to our market with clean products, they won’t have to pay anything.

Finally, the reality – and the strength of the EU – is that we are the world’s biggest single market. We have to stay competitive and the good news is that our industry is moving forward. 
European enterprises are already driving the green transition. They are developing clean new technologies and products. In doing so, they create sustainable, local and well-paid jobs across Europe. 
The transition brings tremendous opportunities for them to establish markets for sustainable, clean products, worldwide. They have understood that the European Green Deal is their chance to get ahead of their global competitors and get ‘first-mover’ advantage. 
The quicker we move, the bigger the demand will be across the world for pioneering technologies created in Europe. The EU is a global leader in climate action but we know that a global effort is needed to tackle climate change and build more resilient, sustainable economies: that is why we are working to mobilise the global effort.
--------------
Q: Ireland has among the most ambitious targets for non-Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) emissions reductions, and has by far the highest share of emissions from agriculture in the EU. (Note: Non-ETS emissions are from homes, small businesses and farms) How does the Green Deal propose to support an equitable transition for farmers, given that a reduction in agricultural exports - beef and dairy products – is likely to be needed to meet the target?
A: As I said, the green transition must be fair to all citizens and businesses. It is for Ireland to determine how it will meet its commitments under the Effort Sharing Regulation. Of course, there are challenges facing agriculture but there is a lot of research and innovation on how to farm in a climate-smart way.
There are ways in which Ireland can cut emissions in its livestock sector, and not just by reducing the number of animals.
It is also important to create opportunities for income diversification for farmers. Across Europe, a shift to a sustainable food system can bring environmental, health and social benefits. It can ultimately make our farms more competitive globally.

How farmers will be paid to capture carbon
That is why the reformed Common Agricultural Policy will align agriculture with the European Green Deal, including by increasing EU support to help farmers achieve the green transition. 
New eco-schemes will reward farmers for climate and environmentally-friendly practices and for animal welfare improvements, for example. I am confident that Ireland – and its farmers – can lead the way on this.
--------------
Q: Regarding overfishing across the EU, there was a legal deadline that this should end by 2020. Member states, including Ireland, do not seem to be complying. Is the commission willing to take a harder line with the member states for lack of compliance with EU environmental law? Is it willing to beef up the enforcement arm of the commission to hold the members to account for their broken promises?
A: EU fisheries are moving towards more sustainability. Our aim is to ensure that this transition delivers a healthy and environmentally friendly EU food system while also safeguarding the livelihoods of fishing and coastal communities.
In the North-East Atlantic, we have made good progress through management of stocks under the principle of “maximum sustainable yield”. The idea is simple: fishing crews can only take from the sea the amount of fish that does not compromise the capacity of stocks to regenerate.

In other areas, for instance, in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, more efforts are needed in the coming years to make fishing more sustainable. Later this year, we will propose further measures for fishing opportunities in 2022, to consolidate these efforts. 
With regard to controls, we are indeed working on a revised fisheries control system, which would allow Member States to step up enforcement and compliance. I hope we will find an agreement on this with EU Member States and the European Parliament soon."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40361207.html,2021-08-17 15:52:00,Beef Report: Prices offered this week reduced by a further 5 cents/kg,"As the lift in the supply of cattle to the factories is maintained, easing the pressure for intake, the processors are continuing to claw back some of the increase over recent months in the return to producers.
It is known in the 'trade' as the 'seasonal adjustment' to the price paid for stock coinciding each year with the increase in supply leading up to the peak intake weeks of Autumn as the grass-finished cattle come through.
While there are very few certainties for producers in the beef finishing sector, the downward pressure on prices for the Autumn intake at the factories remains one of the most regular to be delivered.
Across the majority of the factories, the prices being offered this week for the prime cattle have been reduced by a further 5 cents/kg, amounting to an aggregrate reduction of up to 15 cents/kg since the peak of the 2021 trade last month.
This Limousin Bull calf 12 days old sold for €200 at Cashel Mart on Saturday. Picture James Treacy.
Most of the factories are quoting a base of 415 cents/kg for steers this week. Some of the kill for the week was bought forward from last week on a base of 420 cents/kg, but the majority of the kill for the second half of the week is expected to be on 415 cents/kg. The pattern of trade for the heifers is broadly similar with a 5 cents/kg reduction bringing them to a base of 420 cents/kg. Similar to the steers forward bought stock were purchased on 425 cents/kg in most deals.
However, the young bull prices are holding with most processors offering 425 cents/kg for R grade and cow prices are showing little change with R grade making up to 370 cents/kg.
The question that most finishers will be asking themselves is how much further is the erosion of their returns likely to go before bottoming out for the 2021 Autumn season. An obvious challenge for the finishers will be to endeavour to hold the steer base above 400 cents/kg and given the pace of price slide over recent weeks, it is going to be a major challenge.
A lot will depend on the intake figures for the coming weeks and how the pendulum on supply and demand swings. The intake year to date is back around 70,000 head on 2020 level.
It is projected that the supply for the remainder of the year will be down around 50,000 head on the same period last year.
However, that is unlikely to put pressure on the factories to source cattle anytime between now and December, even with the market demand for the later months of this year continuing as it has been year to date."

But at least it's being done now praise the Lord, while we all still have the chance to benefit from it.
Next Saturday Macroom town will benefit from the marts hosting of a Weanling Show and Sale. These popular weanling sales add footfall, or even boot-fall, to a town like Macroom. Badly needed footfall after a year of stagnation due to a year of Covid.
You see a farmer, just like a soldier, will struggle to march on an empty stomach. So expect an increase in food and beverage sales as we come on Saturday to eye up quality weanling stock, stock that pulls in buyers from all corners of the country.
Some of the 540 animals on sale at Kanturk mart on Tuesday.
Macroom mart is the spiritual home of the weanling. Some of the best beef breeders in the country operate in the hinterland that surrounds the town. And proof of this can be viewed next Saturday.
In Macroom mart last Saturday Friesian bullocks made from €1.60/kg to €1.90/kg. Dry cows sold from €65 to €615 with the kilo.
Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks in Macroom on Saturday made from €2/kg to €2.20/kg.
Continental bullocks sold from €2.15/kg to €2.50/kg. Heifers in Macroom on Saturday made from €2.10/kg to €2.70/kg.

After Friday's sale of bullocks at Ennis mart, Geraldine Walsh had this report, ""We had a big sale again on Thursday with over 620 bullocks on offer. A lot of forward cattle on offer, not too many stores under 450kgs about today.
""The trade for the forward cattle might be a shade easier than previous weeks.""
And after Thursday's sale of heifers, dry cows, suckler cows and aged bulls, Geraldine added.
""On Thursday we had a good-sized sale with 450 on offer.
""The trade was on a par to last week. Some great beef cows on offer.
""Just over 30 cull bulls were on offer and these met a cracking trade, but it has to be said that the quality of bulls on offer was exceptional.""

https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-40363811.html,2021-08-21 12:00:00,The Amazon is fast approaching a point of no return,"In April, lawmakers in the Brazilian state of Rondônia gathered for a hasty vote in a squat cube of a building that had sat largely empty for months. 
Few places on Earth had been hit harder by Covid-19 than Porto Velho, the concrete capital city, which, like everything else in the region, has been carved out of the Amazon rainforest. But on that rainy afternoon, while the city was in lockdown, the legislators felt they couldn’t wait any longer.
They needed to pass a bill that would slash the size of a state rainforest reserve known as Jaci-Paraná and another park farther south. 
Once a vast expanse of sinuous streams and soaring stands of mahogany and castanha trees, Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve has been largely transformed into pasture for cattle. 
Roads cut into the bright red mud crisscross the reserve, connecting hundreds of ranches where 120,000 cattle graze. The ranches are illegal. 
The new law would change that. The owners would no longer have to hide the origin of their livestock to sell to big beef producers. More importantly, the land grabbers would have a path to legal title. 
Almost half the state legislators are ranchers or got elected with agribusiness money. They’d long wanted to wipe the slate clean for their rural base, and now they had support all the way up to the presidential palace in Brasilia.
In a few days, President Jair Bolsonaro would appear at a US-sponsored climate summit to defend Brazil’s record on the Amazon. For two years, Donald Trump had been a friend as Bolsonaro dismantled protections for the rainforest. 
President Joe Biden most certainly would not be. The lawmakers’ plan could fall apart if Biden ratcheted up the pressure. 
“Listen well,” Ezequiel Neiva, a rancher and lawmaker, told his colleagues. “This is one of our last chances to vote.” 
The bill passed unanimously. Coronel Marcos Rocha, Rondônia’s governor and one of Bolsonaro’s staunchest allies, signed it into law on May 20. (It’s being challenged in court.)

Jaci-Paraná, formerly large enough to swallow Mexico City, was slashed in size by 89%, leaving only a sliver of terrain along its western edge. The other state reserve mentioned in the bill, Guajará-Mirim, lost 50,000 hectares, or 124,000 acres.
Two days after the Rondônia law passed, Bolsonaro didn’t let down the ranchers. He was defiant when he spoke via video link to Biden and other heads of state at the Leaders Summit on Climate. 
Bolsonaro praised Brazil’s work in protecting the Amazon, while pointing a finger at the developed world’s addiction to fossil fuels as the key culprit in climate change. 
Above all, he lamented the “Amazonian paradox.” 
The rainforest is one of the globe’s greatest natural resources - in both the commodities it holds and its role in producing oxygen and cleaning the world’s air - and yet most of the 24 million people living in and around it are poor.
“The value of the standing forest” must be acknowledged Bolsonaro said. “There must be fair payment for environmental services provided by our biomes to the planet at large.” 
The message to the world was clear: Pay us to leave the Amazon alone, or Brazil will find its own way to extract that value.
There’s ample evidence that the government is already doing that. A review of thousands of public documents and dozens of interviews with prosecutors, forest rangers, and members of Bolsonaro’s inner circle show that Brazil’s government is engaged in an active campaign to open up the Amazon to privatization and development - first by turning a blind eye as public and protected lands are raided and cleared, and then by systematically pardoning the people responsible and granting them legal title to the stolen lands.
Bolsonaro’s government didn’t invent the practice. It’s rooted in the nation’s 1988 constitution, and two presidents before Bolsonaro rammed through changes that essentially amnestied about 25,000 people who’d been squatting on public properties, a review of Brazilian land records shows. 
But Bolsonaro and his team want to accelerate the process like never before by making it easier for big ranchers to get in on the game. 
“All that land that’s been cleared in the Amazon, the law allowed it,” says Luiz Antônio Nabhan Garcia, Bolsonaro’s land-policy czar. 
“That’s how it happened in the United States. It happened in Australia. When colonizers first went out and took that virgin land, all of it came from the state.”
Land grab
During the 1970s, the military government in Brazil viewed turning the wild expanses of the Amazon into cities, farms, and mines as an imperative of national security. 
The dictatorship, which endured until 1985, built military bases, power plants, and a network of roadways throughout the thick jungle. 
Those infrastructure projects fueled what’s known as the “Brazilian Miracle,” a period of 10% annual economic growth that still stands out in many minds as the nation’s golden era. But these were some of the darkest days for the rainforest itself.
Millions of people migrated inland from coastal cities, carving homesteads and huge industrial hubs out of the jungle. In 40 years, the Amazon has lost an area as big as California to deforestation. 
Some scientists suggest the Amazon is now close to a tipping point, at which it will become a savanna rather than a rainforest. It will pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere instead of pulling them down, and so-called flying rivers - bands of moisture in the air that bring rainfall to the continent - will dry up. As many as 10,000 species may be at risk of dying off.
Since taking office in January 2019, Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has revived the 50-year-old worldview that Amazon development and Brazilian prosperity go hand in hand. 
And he’s stacked key land management and environment agencies with farmers and ranchers who share his vision. Jaci-Paraná is the latest example of that vision’s realization, but it’s far from the only one.
Bandeirantes, located east of Jaci-Paraná, is a dusty blip of a farming community, a crosshatch of dirt roads and a few dozen structures surrounded by coffee plantations and cattle pastures. 
A little more than two decades ago, it didn’t exist. No roads. No ranchers. Just rainforest. Today, it’s something of a model for would-be land-grabbers across Rondônia.
For years government ads on TV and radio and in newspapers had promised plots and prosperity for anyone willing to make the journey. The Amazon was “a land without men for men without land,” the ads declared. 
Millions answered the call to conquer the “green hell,” and the population of Rondônia swelled from about 115,000 people in 1970 to more than 1.1 million in 1990. 
Behind the boom was the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform, or Incra, a government agency the military regime created to speed Brazil’s industrial revolution.
After the military dictatorship gave way to a democracy, Incra was given a new mission. Instead of colonizing the Amazon with industrial farms and factories, the agency was told to reclaim whatever hadn’t yet been developed, dice it up into tiny lots, and hand those out to Brazil’s poor for subsistence farming. 
It was one of the largest social welfare giveaways of all time. But the execution was bungled.
No longer backed by the power of the military, Incra couldn’t enforce its rules when conflicts over land broke out. People rushed to claim whatever plots appeared to be free. 
Wealthy owners stripped of their properties fought in court to save their stakes, tying the land up for decades. Documents were easily forged or altered to make bogus titles look legitimate. A resale black market for the dubious claims proliferated. Some falsified documents have now changed hands so many times that it’s impossible to determine the real owners of some parcels.
The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, the federal regulator known as Ibama, knows all about the deforestation, but doesn’t do much to stop it. 
A study by the independent news site InfoAmazonia found that between 1980 and 2019, Ibama issued 75 billion reais ($14 billion) of fines, adjusted for inflation, but collected only 3.3% of the total. 
Poverty
Meanwhile, politicians, from local council members all the way up to the president, encourage the destruction. A cross-check of political databases and Ibama fines shows almost 1,000 elected officials and political appointees are on government blacklists for environmental crimes.

It’s poverty that truly drives the calls to develop the rainforest, from both the left and the right. Thirty percent of Brazilians live in poverty, including 13% who survive on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank. 
In the country’s north, where the rainforest is, poverty is especially dire: Clean water, sanitation, and electricity are luxuries. Almost one-third of the population is functionally illiterate, unable to meet day-to-day reading or writing needs. 
The Covid pandemic became just one more item on a long list of scourges that includes malaria, dengue, and Zika.
The commodities boom in the mid-2000s brought a wave of prosperity that few Brazilians had experienced. The crash a few years later dragged down everyone. 
Today, prices are again surging, and with them, schemes to grab even more land. Only now the schemes are more daring, more organized, and a lot more violent.
Brazil’s deforestation machine is complex, and it’s impossible to know exactly who’s directing its movements. 
A large part is certainly driven by the everyday Brazilian who longs for land, but that alone can’t explain the sheer scale of the destruction or the recent sophistication in the attacks. 
A few decades ago, when undesignated government land was bountiful, it was easy for a lone farmer to drive some stakes in the ground and claim it as his own. 
But those plots are gone; what’s left in Rondônia are protected parks and territories. Environmental-crime prosecutors now describe a fraud that turns poor Brazilians into foot soldiers for criminal gangs, logging companies, and industrial farming operations. 
It’s the stuff of novels, the type of book Carlos Rangel dreams of writing if only he could retire. 
“The people on the ground don’t have the financial wherewithal to pay for the kind of operations you see,” says former state prosecutor Aidee Maria Moser Torquato Luiz, who tried for two decades to stop the land grabs in Jaci-Paraná before finally giving up and moving away from the Amazon. 
“Someone is bankrolling them.” 
At the core of the scams is the byzantine land-management system Incra left standing in the chaotic transition from dictatorship to democracy. 
“There’s a huge discrepancy between reality of fact and the reality in our documentation,” says Tatiana de Noronha Versiani Ribeiro, the lead federal prosecutor on the Queiroz case. 
“Criminal gangs figured out how to mine the documentation and exploit the confusion.” 
First, the gangs comb through public records, looking for loopholes such as Queiroz’s 100-year-old rubber-tapping permits. Then, with phony paperwork in hand, they recruit desperate families and convince them the land is up for grabs. 
They bus them out to remote reserves, promising to pay for supplies and food. The claims are always challenged in court, but they sit in legal limbo for years. 
By that time, the camps have grown into villages, and it gets more politically complicated to evict hundreds of families with children. All the while, the masterminds are raiding the forest of its hardwood. When they’re done, they move on to their next target.
Many of the families can’t make it on their own and end up abandoning the land they fought so hard for, or selling it cheap to big farmers amassing soybean and ranching empires.
Nabhan Garcia, Bolsonaro’s land-policy czar at the Ministry of Agriculture, is a stout fast-talker with a bushy mustache and a penchant for khaki hunting vests. 
On a June day, he walks into a barbecue for ranchers at the Ji-Paraná fairgrounds in Rondônia, and the crowd gathered under a long ramada whoops and cheers. 
The dirt car park is brimming with four-wheel-drive Toyota Hiluxes and Ford Rangers and, next to it, a row of 10 forequarters of beef slowly roast over a bed of coal. 
In the crowd are politicians, mining executives, and ranchers who’ve expanded into solar power and construction. 
In one of the world’s most unequal societies, these are the guys who’ve made it big, who’ve built empires - who, as Nabhan Garcia tells them, “carry Brazil on your backs and sustain it with your sweat.” 
Some boast of properties in the tens of thousands of hectares, which is possible only if they were granted during the dictatorship or pieced together from failed smaller farms, or are untitled land grabs. These are the guys Bolsonaro wants to boost.
Under legislation the president introduced in 2019 that’s now making its way through congress, industrial-scale farmers may for the first time be able to get in on the legal land laundering and win clean titles to public tracts that were originally intended for settlements or reserves.

The proposal opens the door to more farmers sitting on properties between about 300 hectares and 2,500 hectares. All combined, that’s an extra 16 million hectares of Amazon land that could soon be titled, including properties that were deforested as recently as 2012. 
The most dangerous change, however, according to Raoni Rajão, a land-management and environmental policy expert at the Federal University in Minas Gerais, is that the government wants to make it a no-check process, meaning Incra officials will no longer be required to go out into the field and inspect the properties before issuing titles. They’ll rely only on satellite images. 
“It works for the land-grabbers to not have Incra doing its job,” Rajão says. 
“It becomes an incentive to keep stealing land.”
As special secretary of land affairs, Nabhan Garcia is leading the charge to rally support for the bill. With no previous political experience other than a failed congressional run in 2006, he’s managed to amass an almost cultlike following among his fellow ranchers and an impressive level of influence with the president. 
The two bonded during Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign over a shared love of guns and disdain for foreign governments they say are threatened by Brazil’s agricultural prowess. 
“Behind it all - all the lies about the Amazon - is a dirty war fueled by geopolitics and hypocrisy,” Nabhan Garcia says. 
“No other country in the world has the potential to boost production the way Brazil does, and that scares people.” 
About 167,000 claims for titles are awaiting an Incra decision. As many as 12% of them involve farms not currently allowed by law, making up 60% of the area being claimed. 
Almost 30% of the land shows no signs of use before 2018, meaning the law change isn’t about giving security to families who’ve been on the properties for decades, Rajão says. It’s about amnestying more recent and bigger invasions. 
Once Incra approves the title, the owner essentially buys it from the federal government. In a municipality in Para state, for example, a hectare from Incra costs as little as 46 reais. It’s worth more than 100 times that in the open market.
The analysis of title claims is far from complete, mainly because data on properties is so hard to come by. Bolsonaro’s government has used the pandemic as cover to clamp down on access to public information related to land grabs, and Rondônia state has been among the most aggressive in locking away its documents.
What is sure is that the destruction is accelerating. In recent years, Bolsonaro put the Ministry of Agriculture in charge of the environmental regulator, cut firefighting and management budgets, reversed plans to protect large swaths of indigenous lands, and proposed opening up indigenous lands to mining.
Roughly 10,500 square kilometers of rainforest were destroyed in the first six months of 2021, on course to eclipse 2020’s 11-year high. 
A study released in July by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research shows that parts of the Amazon where the burns are the worst have flipped into net carbon emitters, contributing to climate change rather than helping to limit it. 
Many of the land grabs go far beyond what even Bolsonaro’s administration has proposed pardoning. The thinking is that even though greenwashed titles for, say, a national park may not be in the pipeline now, it’s only a matter of time before they are. With no real consequence or enforcement, why not stake the claims now? 
“What’s astonishing is that these are self-confessed crimes,” Rajão says. “People go in and say, ‘I’m seizing this land,’ and they’re rewarded for it, because the lawmakers keep moving the line forward.”

Brazil's Amazon railway plan would cause global climate chaos"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40364756.html,2021-08-23 09:44:00,What the IFA is proposing in its Budget 2022 submission,"The IFA has published its 2022 Pre-Budget submission this past week. The organisation notes that Irish agriculture is in a perilous position with Irish farmers facing an increasingly uncertain future. 
The document makes a number of asks including ‘full funding for existing farm schemes in the CAP Transition Period which continues through 2022’ along with putting in place ‘appropriate agri-taxation measures to support the sustainable growth and efficient restructuring of the sector’.
The document also highlights previous Government commitments in their Programme for Government Our Shared Future to ringfence €1.5bn of carbon tax receipts, over the next ten years for an agri-environment scheme referred to as ‘REPS-2’, with the IFA looking for confirmation that his funding will be given in addition to co-financing. 
On the tax side, the IFA suggest that accelerated capital allowances, giving a faster write off against income tax would assist in creating an incentive for emission-efficient investment. The IFA cleverly responds to the Government's ten-year strategy by making proposals that will aid farmers mirroring the three pillars of economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and social sustainability which formed the backbone of the Government's vision for Irish Agriculture in their document Food Vision 2030 published just a short few weeks ago. 
On the economic front, farmers can, it is suggested, be supported in a number of ways. The document includes for example the request for an appropriately drafted and funded grant aid scheme (TAMS), with access to low-cost loans, the introduction of a national food ombudsman, an expansion of environmental schemes, financial support for farmers to set up Producer Organisation and a Walks Scheme. 
On scheme funding the budget submission recognises new pilot schemes introduced in 2021 including the Dairy Beef Calf Pilot Scheme, Straw Incorporation Measure and the Results-Based Environment Agri Pilot Project, the IFA make a call for increased funding from 35m to 92.5m for 2022 to support a broadening of pilot schemes in advance of formal scheme introductions.
On the tax side, the IFA is requesting that stamp duty on farmland is brought back to residential rates of 1% on purchases up to €1m and 2% thereafter. The submission also calls for an extension of the young trained farmer stamp duty relief, and an extension of young trained farmer stock relief both of which are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. 
On the Succession Tax Credit worth up to €5,000 per annum, which is available to farmers and their successors who sign up to a farm partnership layered up with a succession plan, the IFA note that just 175 and 290 farmers availed of the relief in years 2017 and 2018 with the IFA requesting that the scheme should be enhanced with greater capacity to use the credit against off-farm income. A novel suggestion is put forward that Favourite Niece/Favourite nephew relief which works to treat such a successor as having the same position as a child for gift tax purposes should be widened into a Favourite Successor tax relief meaning persons other than direct blood nieces and nephews could receive the gift or inheritance of a farm under a much more favourable regime. 
The triple combination of having the capacity to transfer land at an effective gift tax rate of 3.3% or less where criteria are satisfied, along with the income tax exemption for leases of farmland, and an underlying strong rental market are conspiring to push farmland prices further away from farmers reach. 
The IFA has stepped up to the plate in challenging the overuse of Agricultural Relief as a mechanism for wealthy individuals to pass on assets tax-efficiently to successors. The IFA proposes that the transferor or transferee or a combination of both must pass the active farmer test set out under the current agricultural relief clause for a minimum of 15 years and separately, that land which is bought and subsequently leased to an active farmer, the time covered by such a lease will not count in meeting the 15-year minimum period. 
On a separate matter, the IFA also make a very sound suggestion that Agricultural Relief should be available where a farm is transferred into joint names of a successor and their spouse/civil partner. The IFA makes the point that ‘if the asset is transferred into joint names initially, then there is likely to be a higher active participation by the two spouses in the running of the farm enterprise.’ 
The IFA is also calling for a tax deferral scheme to support farmers who take action to set aside rainy day funds. Such schemes already exist in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand to incentivise farmers to take personal action to address volatility.
The IFA proposes an agricultural Rainy-Day Fund would allow farmers to put aside a small percentage of their gross receipts, whether in their co-op, specially assigned bank account or State Farm Volatility Fund, which could be used by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), the deferred funds could subsequently be drawn down within the next five years and the tax due would be paid on the year of withdrawal. 
All in all the document is comprehensive and well balanced with sound reasoning behind each proposal.

But the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office have confirmed that the year-on-year price rise increased to 10.2% by June.
In the case of feedstuff “straights”, the year-on-year price rise has gone from 8.4% last November to 15.6% in June.
When taken in conjunction with year-on-year price rises for energy and fertilisers of about 17% for both, farmers rightly fear that galloping inflation could eat up any benefit of this year’s improved selling prices for livestock and milk.
Thankfully, that is not yet the case, with the Central Statistics Office’s figures for June indicating that overall, Irish farmers are 4.5% up year-on-year when the trends of prices for their produce and for farm inputs are compared. That's how much the ""terms of trade"" had improved year on year, according to CSO statistics for June (mostly thanks to milk and beef prices rising by 16-17%, and sheep prices by nearly 27%).
And farmers can console themselves somewhat with the thought that the rising price for animal feed is a worldwide trend, and offers a chance for Irish farmers to take advantage of their more competitive grass-based production systems.
In the second half of 2020, the average global price for feed to produce 100 kg of milk rose 50%, from $20 to $30, according to the IFCN Dairy Research Network. The feed price reached levels not seen since early 2014. Before then, only in 2011 and 2012 and a short period in 2008 had dairy farmers around the world averaged more than $30 for feed (based on feeding 70% maize and 30% soya) to produce 100kg of milk, according to 15 years of IFCN records for 65 countries.
The feed price is up 40% in the two years to January 2021. IFCN says global feed prices are high due to tight supply in major grain-producing countries, and increasing demand for feed.
This will cause dairy farmers around the world to change their feeding in ways that can impact milk contents and production negatively. Milk production may fall on farms more dependent on purchased feed.
Similar trends are at work in global production of beef and other meats.
Dairy and meat prices may rise due to falling supply.
As a result, livestock farmers all over the world have difficult production decisions to make.
Many experts believe that markets for animal feeds will remain strong over the next few years. For livestock industries trying to cope with the Covid-19 effects on markets, and with pressure to become carbon neutral, high feed costs are an unwanted extra problem.
In the dairy industry around the world, the usual effect is small and mid-sized operations being forced out of business, and the increasing dominance of “megadairies'' with tens of thousands of cows. They are better positioned to weather the volatilities of the global market they deal in.
The rise of “megadairies'' can explain why the US Department of Agriculture forecasts that milk production in the US will rise by 2.1% in 2021 (despite rising feed costs), due to gains in yield per cow as well as a slight increase in the number of milk cows.
The USDA also predicts the price received by farmers for milk in 2021 will grow by 3.9%; not unexpected, because the global milk price closely follows the price for animal feed.
At the July meeting of EU farming ministers, the Croatian delegation said feed prices in the country have reached their highest levels in seven years. Croatia called on the European Commission for financial support or other effective mechanisms to support the livestock sector and was supported by two-thirds of other member states.
Ministers said high feed prices could affect the post-pandemic recovery of the meat sectors, which are also under constant threat from African swine fever and avian influenza.
Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski tried to reassure the concerned countries, saying that feed prices were likely to go down, and that CAP subsidies kick in during price crises.
Previously, Spain and other member states had complained about price increases of between 25% and 60% in international animal feed prices, in particular for soya bean meal, but also for maize, wheat, and barley.
High feed costs are having a particularly negative impact on the thin profit margins of many EU dairy farms. However, the European Dairy Association said that the biggest source of feed protein in Europe is roughage, almost entirely grown on-farm, and higher feed prices could impact pork and poultry sector more than dairy.
Closer to home, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board in the UK has warned of the risks for farmers around further increases in feed prices in the winter months. AHDB figures indicate that UK dairy farmers feed between 0.166 and 0.348 kg per litre of milk, and that feed is taking a larger share of the milk price this year.
Here in Ireland, IFA says grain prices are rising, leaving current prices paid for pigs barely covering the cost of production.
On the other hand, Ireland’s grain growers will hope to gain from rising prices. It looks like global markets are finally bringing supply and demand into balance. Years of low prices discouraged grain growers while stimulating demand (from expanding livestock industries feeding cheap grains).
Covid-19 disruptions in the global shipping industry have also boosted the prices of globally traded feed ingredients.
With the global supply and demand for feed ingredients roughly in balance, events that impact supply or demand will increase price volatility, but the current cycle of elevated prices will prevail until either record yields or bad weather which cuts yields and drives prices even higher.
And with market speculators waiting to pounce on every signal, volatility is fuelled further.
Earlier this month, poor harvest results in western Europe and Russia helped to push wheat prices up 5% overnight, even as maize rose 2.9%, lifted by sharp cuts in US and Brazilian yields.
Soya bean prices bounced 3% higher due to a sharp cut in yields and stronger export demand.
In contrast, a few weeks earlier, wheat and maize prices fell 2%.
In June, agri-commodity prices dropped 10%. More recently, bad weather in Brazil will further boost maize prices (as well as supporting the 50% price rise for Arabica coffee).
There is no mistaking the overall direction of travel, with global soft commodity prices now at their highest value since 2011, and investment advisers talking of a “commodity supercycle”."

The property is listed with Newmarket-based auctioneer Liam Murphy and located in the townland of Clonfert, just under 2km southwest of Kanturk and close to Clonfert Graveyard.
“This is a holding with good, dry ground,” says Liam. “It’s divided into two parts, totalling 89 acres.
There are 74 acres in the main block, which is where we have the yard and the farmhouse. Then, about half a kilometre away, we have the remainder of the land.” The smaller portion was purchased as an add-on farm and that’s how the previous owner managed it. This isn’t necessarily going to suit the next owner, however, and Liam feels that the holding may very well sell as two separate lots.
“I think that it may be sold in two lots,” he says, “especially the way that dairying is going… people like these places to be attached rather than hunting cows over the public road.” The property is all in grass and the lands have been well farmed and maintained over the years, with some re-seeding work having been carried out in the last year.
“The farm has created quite a lot of interest,” says Liam. “There’s good road frontage there, onto a minor public road leading from Newmarket and it has its own water supply.” While the outbuildings around the yard are useful and in need of repair and renovation, the homestead is in very good condition, according to the selling agents, with floor space that extends to some 1,800ft2. The house is located at the end of a one-hundred-metre private roadway.
Accommodation includes reception/hallway, office/utility room, kitchen, toilet, living room, sitting room, three bedrooms and a bathroom. Its features include oil-fired central heating, a fitted kitchen, pvc windows and doors and fitted wardrobes.
The farm comes with the benefit of entitlements too, details of which can be obtained from the agent.
Viewings have been brisk, according to the selling agent, with interest locally and from farther afield evident over the last couple of weeks. The price expectation is between €10,000 and €12,000 per acre."

Holding their prices at last week's level is being interpreted by producers as the processors testing the reaction to the recent cuts and the impact that the lower prices are having on the flow of cattle.
The intake at the factories is now continuing to hover around 34,000 head which is reckoned to be about what the processors require to meet the demand and leaving no room for the processors to become complacent.
A sharp drop in supply with farmers holding back cattle is one situation that the factories would not welcome at this time of the year. Therefore they tread carefully to measure how much the producers will take on price cuts without having a significant effect on cattle intake.
Good weather is always welcome for producers, particularly coming after a period of heavy rainfall. It is a growth booster for grass and the feel-good factor comes as a bonus as ground conditions on the heavier soil type land improves.

The base for steers remains at 415 cents/kg. While some of the kill for last week had been bought at up to 420 cents/kg the word is that getting extra to the quotes for this week is more difficult.
Heifers are on a base of 420 cents/kg and similar to the steers it is a harder battle to get extra in any deal with the factories.
A factor that plays into the hands of the processors approaching September is the number of animals edging up to 30 months with finishers trying to balance between selling or holding back for more weight gain.
The consequences on the returns of losing out on the quality assurance bonus are significant and the loss of bonus and any further fall in the base price will take a lot to recover on weight gained in the meantime.
The processors are well aware of the situation to their benefit which does put a push on finishers to sell ahead of the 30 month age of animals.
The strange factor about the trade currently is that the difference between steer and young bull prices has almost disappeared. It does appear that the factories are anxious for young bull beef and they are willing to pay the extra to get the stock.
While normally only interested in small supplies, the demand is reported to be greater than intake presently and up to 415 cents/kg, parity with the steer price, is being paid for R grade young bulls.
There is no change in the prices being offered for the cows. The good R grade cows continue to make 370 cents/kg with some finishers reporting a shade more as achievable in deals with the factories. The O grade cows are on 355-360 cents/kg and P grade from 340 cents/kg The supply last week was 33,901 head, which included 17,037 steers, 8,717 heifers, 1,333 young bulls and 6,201 cows."

At the sale, a Charolais owned by Christy Kelleher of Inchigeela took top honours. A super weanling from a farmer who is no stranger to producing high-quality stock.
It was the second time a weanling from the very same cow won at Macroom mart, Christy told me. The first time was eight years ago.
On Saturday his Charolais bull weighing 370kg made €1140.
After the sale, I spoke to Dermot Kelleher, Christy's dad. Dermot is the President of the ICSA, a farm organisation that fights for the under-pressure sheep and suckler farmer.
Never a man to mince his words, Dermot was quick in answering my question on if the fight to get a good deal for suckler farmers from the CAP is still alive.

""Of course it is,"" Dermot said. ""The fight continues.
""There are three things we need to keep in mind with the CAP. The first is that we need to protect the active farmer.
""The person trying to sustain a living from beef, sheep and suckler farming. There is no point in supporting what is called the armchair farmer.
""The second point is that the Basic Farm Payment scheme was originally set up to look after the income of sheep, suckler and tillage farmers. This has been forgotten.""
""And this is clear to be seen right now with dairy farmers in receipt of the highest payment per acre. The dairy farmer is now ahead of all other sectors in farming with regards to the CAP, and this is wrong.""
At Macroom mart on Saturday Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks made from €1.90/kg to €2.25/kg.
Continental bullocks made from €2/kg to €2.55/kg. Heifers in Macroom on Saturday made from €2/kg to €2.30/kg.

And while none of us down here in the south want to talk about that match on Sunday, I guess we simply have to accept the loss and make the best of it.
And that is exactly what happened at Kanturk mart on Tuesday, as Seamus O'Keeffe explains.
""It was a tough day here in Kanturk mart on Tuesday with all our great Limerick customers giving us a slagging over the match on Sunday.
""Colette, our secretary, who is a proud Limerick woman insisted on having “Limerick You’re a Lady” played through our sound system.
""In fairness, Limerick were deserving winners and congratulations to them. Cork hurlers are a team to watch out for in the future.
""But now back to business. We had a great sale again on Tuesday with 420 cattle and calves on offer, and a great demand for all types of cattle. Prices are holding steady.""

Kilmallock mart had an important reminder for those selling calves. From September 1st all calves over 42 days will need to be T.B tested. So, this coming Monday, August 30th is the last day to sell calves that are 120 days or younger without a test. You have been warned!
And so back to last Monday's cattle sale. Numbers were back but prices certainly were not. The trade saw an improvement, if anything, on the previous week.
Bullocks sold for up to €1480 a head or €2.33 per kg. Dry cows made up to €1700 a head or €1.93 per kg. Heifers sold for up to €1390 a head or €2.30 per kg. Dairy stock sold for up to €1420 (paid for a 4-year-old calved cow), and sucklers made up to €1470 (paid for a 4-year-old Hereford and her Hereford bull calf). Factory bulls made up to €1780 a head. In the calf ring runners hit €600 a head (paid for a March born Limousin bull).

With Delta spreading around the globe, stocks sold off last week on fears that the more contagious variant could thwart the global recovery from the pandemic and force governments to reintroduce debilitating lockdown measures.
But Mr Lane was more upbeat, arguing that an advanced vaccination campaign and beefed-up public health measures are making Europe the exception while other countries face fresh strains on their health systems from surging infections.
""The fact that (Delta) has not required more extensive measures and that localised measures have been reasonably effective does indicate that, in terms of the overall economy, the impact is quite limited so far,"" Mr Lane told Reuters in an interview.
This resilience, along with a better-than-expected second quarter, means growth remains broadly on the path seen in June when the ECB last published economic projections, Mr Lane added. Then, the ECB predicted 4.6% growth this year and a 4.7% expansion in 2022. 
""I would say we're broadly not too far away from what we expected in June for the full year,"" Mr Lane said. 
""It's a reasonably well-balanced picture,"" he said. 
But he also warned of growing headwinds that are likely to constrain the expansion after a robust second quarter.
""It looks like bottlenecks are going to be more persistent than expected,"" he said. 
""There is also some moderation in the world economy, which is natural. And the Delta variant, although it has a more limited impact than earlier waves, remains a headwind,"" Mr Lane said.

Many more people on the wage-subsidy scheme than pandemic payments     
With the economy rebounding quickly, some policymakers have made the case for a discussion about how the ECB might end its €1.8 trillion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. 
Mr Lane dismissed those calls, however, saying that with the stimulus scheme set to run until the end of March at the earliest, it was too early to start that discussion now. 
Even if it ends then, inflation is set to remain below the ECB's 2% target, so the bank will have to maintain some asset purchases via another scheme. 
That means markets won't need much notice, Mr Lane said. 
""Regardless of when PEPP might end, that's not the end of the ECB's role in terms of QE. This is why we don't need a huge lead time to think about it,"" Mr Lane said.
""We already know what we're doing until March, which is maintaining favourable financing conditions, so we have time this autumn to work out what comes next,"" he added.
Instead, the main task for the ECB at its September 9 meeting will be to decide the pace of bond purchases during the coming quarter.
""Any adjustment we make within the pandemic period is within the single philosophy: Maintaining favourable financing conditions,"" Mr Lane said. ""It's subordinated to the deeper commitment, which is favourable financing conditions,"" he said.
He said relatively high inflation readings over the past several months have not changed his view that the surge in prices is temporary, as wage growth, a precondition for inflation, remains muted. 
Meanwhile, eurozone government bond yields rose slightly, as another ECB official said the bank could revise up its macroeconomic projections for the eurozone again in September after recent solid activity indicators.
The comments by ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos lifted yields in an otherwise quiet day. The 10-year German yield was 2 basis points higher at -0.46%, while the Irish 10-year bond traded at -0.05%.

Oliver Mangan: Government can borrow at low cost for productive investments
Reuters "
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-40367348.html,2021-08-27 05:00:00,Irish Examiner view: Animal abuse takes many forms,"President Joe Biden’s intervention in America’s beef market might resonate on this side of the Atlantic. The White House hopes to rebalance a market where farmers’ share of the price has, in five years, fallen from 51.5% to 37.3%, though the price of beef has increased. 
That just four processors control more than 80% of that market makes it easy to identify targets but it also suggests a level of power that might not be so easily curbed. That less than 5% of feedlots control 80% of the market strengthens that impression. 
The intervention may be about the redistribution of revenues — socialism, as a principled MAGA rancher might harrumph — but it is unlikely that any review of America’s hyper-industrialised beef production could overlook animal welfare or the environmental impact of mega feedlots. 
Some of those lots have as many as a million animals in their care, almost as many cattle as in all of Cork, a population that stands around 1,125,000, making up 15% of Ireland’s cattle.
If America’s farmers must wait to see how goalposts shift, British farmers are already dealing with change. Earlier this month, the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) confirmed a ban on the export of live animals for slaughter or fattening. 
The Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill will include rules on maximum journey times, extended headroom, and additional welfare measures around the transportation of animals. 
Implications of bill
This may have implications for Irish hauliers who use Britain’s land bridge to reach continental markets. It also renews focus on the sustainability of our live export trade especially as animal welfare issues are one of the frontlines of today’s culture wars.
Another skirmish in that war was seen in recent days when representatives of the greyhound sector sought changes in a schoolbook they described as “misleading and inaccurate” but were seen as “measured” by publisher Folens. 
That industry, and horse racing too, face what may prove to be defining challenges as expectations move away from traditional interpretations of how we use animals.
If America’s feedlots are one extreme then a more intimate, but unfortunately revealing episode played out yesterday. 
Dogs Trust Ireland has reported that there has been a “huge spike” in the number of people trying to surrender dogs as we move out of lockdown. The charity gets around eight requests a day and says that the most common reason is that people struggle with dog behaviour. 
Essentially, the dogs are paying the price for the ignorance of those who bought puppies without having any understanding of the requirements or responsibilities of dog ownership. 
Already this year, the charity has surpassed the number of last year’s surrender requests.
Sadly, those figures probably deal with the luckier animals as those unable, or unwilling, to look after a dog may just dump it. This is exacerbated by a surge in dog breeding by those who imagined that pandemic prices — up to €2,000 for a fashionable breed of pup — might remain the norm. 
This selfish, heedless behaviour underlines that animal abuse takes many forms and that some of those who imagine themselves as animal lovers are all too vulnerable to that charge.

'Huge spike' in people looking to give up dogs as Covid restrictions ease"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40370366.html,2021-08-31 15:56:00,Beef Report: Grass supply has eased any pressure on finishers to sell cattle,"There is slightly more optimism on the side of beef finishers as the vibes from the processors this week carry a hint of hardening on the prices.
The finishers are reporting more interest from the processors on securing cattle which they regard as a good sign adding strengthening to their hand in striking deals on the price and pulling back on the control of the processors to control the day fully.
Good weather, leading to excellent ground conditions on the farms and no pressure on grass supply has eased any pressure on finishers to sell cattle, while they turn to concentrate on other farm tasks and harvesting.
While the intake at the processors remains around 33,000-34,000 head/week there is limited scope for the processors to ease further on the price and suppliers know that they can harden their approach on selling at current prices.
Five Friesian bullocks born January 2020 average weight 491 kilos sold for €850 each at a sale in Bandon Mart. Picture: O'Gorman Photography.
In that environment, the base for steers remains at 415 cents/kg in general. A few processors were reported to have tried their hand at getting steers on a base of 410 cents/kg without much success.
At the same time, suppliers are reporting that 420 cents/kg has been secure by larger finishers this week for the steers, although believed to have been on a limited scale.
The heifers are on a base of 420 cents/kg in general. Similar to the steers any factoring offering less are being turned down and some suppliers are negotiating deals for a few cents/kg extra.
As mentioned intake at its present level is required by the processors to meet their requirements leaving the supply/demand pendulum very much at the centre.
There was little change in the supply last week from previous weeks at 34,097 head. Steers at 16,887 head were on par with the corresponding week last year. Heifers at 8,834 head last week were down 300 head on 2020, while the cows were up 100 head at 6,269 and intake of young bulls was unchanged from the same week last year at 1,444 head.
Year to date intake is now down 74,000 on the same period last year.
The prices for the young bulls have hardened and are now on par with the steer base at 415 cents/kg for R grade. The supply is low leading processors to show more interest in supplies to add to the volume intake each week.
There has also been some recovery in the prices on offer for the cows. The R grade quality cows are now making 380 cents/kg and in some cases up to 385 cents/kg is being paid with most of the price dip in early August being recovered in the current trade."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/companies/arid-40370480.html,2021-08-31 17:45:00,Airline stocks fall on Covid and demand fears,"Airline shares fell sharply on fears of fresh travel restrictions due to the continued spread of the Delta variant, plus the traditional back-to-school period threatening to dent family holiday bookings and wider demand.
Ryanair led the drop in European aviation stocks with a 2.8% fall, while Aer Lingus and British Airways owner IAG – already down around 25% since March – was close behind shedding nearly 2.7%. Both were down by over 3% earlier. EasyJet, Wizz, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM also saw declines.
Carriers - including Ryanair - are keeping prices low to prolong leisure demand through October. The airline is also beefing up winter timetables in a bet that the yearning for a vacation will sustain sales even in what’s normally the quietest period for European travel.
Tour operator TUI said it’s ready to add capacity in Mediterranean resorts if the opportunity arises.
At the same time, a surge in Covid cases, that has led to renewed lockdowns in Asia and a flatter travel market in the US, is threatening to strangle off a European tourism revival that’s seen capacity in the region recover to two-thirds of 2019 levels.
“There’s a risk that the really good late summer traffic we’ve seen could be a bit illusionary,” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners in London. 
“With kids going back to school, and the likelihood that could bring a flare-up in cases, winter is looking much more uncertain for the airlines.”

'Major stimulus needed' for tourism recovery
It remains unclear whether vaccinations will keep case numbers low over the winter, when viral infections generally surge. Any significant outbreaks are likely to trigger a deeper clampdown and put off older travellers and those without children who have the ability to travel year round.
For the moment at least, European airlines are grabbing what they can.
Ryanair has already said it will operate 250 new routes this winter, seeking to capitalise on demand from people who missed out on a summer break overseas. Wizz Air has restored 100% of pre-pandemic seating, becoming one of the few major operators worldwide to do so.
Ryanair has now said it expects to see a strong recovery in the coming three months.
""We're on track to exceed our target of 10.5 million [passengers] in August [2021],” said Ryanair group chief executive Michael O’Leary.
“And, looking out to September, October, we see that very strong recovery continuing and I'd expect to carry about 10.5 million passengers a month in September, October, November. As long as there are no adverse Covid developments, things are fair for a very strong recovery,” he said.
Lufthansa said it will generate positive cash flow this year and should be able to fully unwind a €9bn Covid rescue package next year. But, the German carrier said it is braced for a hard winter as Covid continues to spread and curbs on travel remain in place.
Elsewhere, Norwegian Air – which has emerged from bankruptcy proceedings - said it shouldn’t need to raise any more cash as bookings have lifted, although it hasn’t provided guidance for the current year.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40371776.html,2021-09-01 10:57:00,Reaping the benefits of solar systems on farms,"Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells work on the principle that energy in the sun is converted to electricity.
PV cells are used to convert solar radiation into direct current (DC) electricity.
This DC electricity is then inverted to alternating current (AC) electricity for use in buildings or export to the grid.
When light shines on the PV cell, an electric field is created across the silicon conducting layers, which causes electricity to flow.
Cabling is required to connect the generated electricity to the grid. A generation meter is used to monitor the total electricity output from the panels and where appropriate, an export meter measures electricity exported to the national grid.
Flat rate farmers 
Since January 1, 2012 a flat rate farmer can claim back the VAT incurred on the purchase of a solar PV system.
The system must be named on the Triple E Product Register. This Register is the public database maintained by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) containing a list of products that comply with the energy efficiency criteria of that authority.
It can be accessed at the SEAI website: www.seai.ie 
The claim is made through the Revenue Commissioners VAT 58 form.
Solar PV siting 
The energy available from the sun is measured in kilowatt-hours per square metre per year (kWh/m2/year). The angle and orientation of the solar array is very important.
TAMS provides a 40% grant on a solar PV investment, while young qualified farmers can get up to 60% in grant aid.
Generally, a photovoltaic installation requires a large southerly facing roof or field space. Panels are either pre-constructed encapsulated glass/plastic or in some cases may take the form of roof tiles or semi-transparent PV glazing units.
There are some costly systems that can track the sun over the course of a day throughout the year.
A traditional roof up to a pitch angle of 35⁰ is best for PV output. Trees, chimneys and other buildings should be avoided to minimise any shading effect.
Planning permission 
The installation of solar panels on agricultural structures, or within the curtilage of an agricultural holding; or on or within the curtilage of a house, or any buildings within the curtilage of the house are considered exempted development subject to the conditions set out in Schedule 2, Part 3, Class 18(c) of the Planning and Development Regulations (2001).
Ground-mounted solar shall not exceed 25m2, and the height of the free-standing solar array shall not exceed two metres.
Roof mounted shall not exceed 50m2 or 50% of the total roof area, whichever is the lesser; and the solar panels shall be a minimum of 50cm from the edge of the wall or roof on which they are mounted.
TAMS support 
If eligible, the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) provides a 40% grant on a solar PV investment, while young qualified farmers can get up to 60% in grant aid.
PV installers need to be on the SEAI register of installers or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine approved list.
TAMS support is now available to support up to 11kW solar PV on dairy, beef, tillage and sheep farms.
This complements the 40% support already available to the pig and poultry sector through the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme 40%, which is not limited to 11kW.
Farmers should check their insurances to ensure that they have cover for such work.
They should insist on seeing datasheets of the technology being installed and get written confirmation of place of manufacture and warranties with exclusions.
Another key issue is business reputation and robustness, as some installer companies sail close to the edge financially.
Farmers need to pay deposits to companies that are solid and going to be around for the long term. Farmers need assurances that purchased panels are warranted against ammonia erosion, especially on pig and poultry units. See the TAMS section of the DAFM website for full terms and conditions.
Financial returns
Once you have bought your solar PV panels, the maintenance, and operating costs are small. The panels and inverters will require cleaning approximately every 10 years.
Panel output should be expected to fall at a rate of 1% per year. The financial return is mainly tied up with the value and amount of energy generated.
The main part of this is derived from the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff, which would pay a set amount of money per kWh of electrical energy generated.
The Republic of Ireland does not have any feed-in tariff for solar PV at present.
A feed-in tariff would normally be paid by a registered electricity company of your choice and would be determined at the time of application, according to the technology and the size of the installation you have.
In some countries, you can receive a feed-in tariff regardless of whether you export or use the electricity yourself. These tariffs are generally linked to inflation for periods of 15-20 years.
If, as in most cases, your solar PV panels operate in parallel with your mains supply, they help to displace the energy you would normally have bought from the grid.
For example, if your electricity need at a particular time is 20kW and your PV system was producing 5kW, your net import from the grid would be 15kW.
Each unit of electricity you displace from your imported requirement effectively saves you on the imported price of that unit. If you buy your energy at 18 cents (c) per kWh and you displace 10,000kWh you save €1,800.
If you are generating more energy than you are using and your PV system is connected to the grid, the balance will be exported but you will not receive payment at present, although this is expected to change.
For larger systems where you want to be paid for exporting electricity then metering will be required.
Together with an export meter you will require a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). PPAs are set by contract between the generator and an electrical supply company.
Grid connections 
For systems up to 16 amps (A) per phase (that’s 3.68kW single-phase and 11.04kW three phase), you need no prior permission to connect from the electricity distribution network operator – ESB Networks.
It operates an ‘inform and fit’ policy, ie, you fill in form NC6 (single page) – email or post to ESB Networks and fit after 20 days of having not received any objection.
The commissioning of the system must comply with EN50438 and can be viewed here. For larger systems (over 26A/16A), a pre-approval is required but only if the system is exporting to the grid.
The context here is that if you do not export, ie, auto generator, you use NC6; if you do export then it is the NC5 form that must be submitted.
You can make an application to ESB Networks for a budget estimate when considering larger installations. You can make an application, and if it is a modification for an exporting auto producer, you can get a quote from them. It costs about €1,200 to ask them how much. The contact for ESB Networks is dsogenerators@esb.ie or call 1850 372 757.
Solar PV performance 
Solar PV is generally not stored. Houses or businesses that store electricity during the daytime, ideally peaking in the summer months - eg, ventilation of intensive pig or poultry livestock sheds - are best suited to solar PV output.
Approximately three-quarters of the energy will be produced from April to September.
A large domestic dwelling with an unshaded south-facing roof of approximately 30m2 could install 4kW of PV panels.
Located in Carlow and set at the optimum angle to the sun (35°), it would generate around 3,300kWh of electricity - roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by a small household - throughout the year.
A medium-sized array on a farm roof-top (50kW) would require 350-400m2 of roof space. Installed on a south-facing slope, this could generate 41,500kWh of electricity.
Alternatively, a 50kW system could be ground-mounted on metal frames, requiring approximately a third of one acre of land (0.1ha).
The advantage of this is that this system could be aligned due south and angled at 35⁰ to obtain optimal performance.
The disadvantage is that planning would be required, which adds further time and cost to the project. Ground-mounted projects may also require security fencing and this may be a condition of getting insurance cover.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40369568.html,2021-09-01 11:00:00,Quality 49-acre residential East Cork farm expecting over €13k/acre,"A 49-acre high-quality residential farm close to Kildorrery village in East Cork is currently on offer with Sherry Fitzgerald O’Donovan. 
As Michael O’Donovan of their Fermoy office explains, this is a unique offering that will attract a variety of potential purchasers: “These are top class limestone lands suitable for any type of farming enterprise,” says Michael of the property which the current owner is already putting to mixed-use, with both cows and horses being kept on the land. ""We’ve good interest so far and probably not far away from our first offer.” 
The farm is in the townland of Farrahy, 3km from Kildorrery, approximately 15km from Mitchelstown and 20km from Fermoy. This part of Munster has seen some very strong sales in recent years. Its farming industry spectrum covers a heady mixture of powerful dairy operations, beef cattle, grain growing and some serious players in the equestrian world.
Although this particular holding is set up to be of interest to the latter category, the quality of its land and the convenience of its facilities and layout mean that it will appeal to any farming enterprise.
“The land is all in one block,” says Michael, “and it’s laid out on in eight easily-worked fields which are all relatively level, with frontage onto a shared private passageway.” The dwelling is a three-bedroom bungalow that dates from circa 1985. It’s surrounded by mature gardens and features stables and a small arena to the rear. The house is in excellent condition throughout, according to the selling agents, and comprises approximately 2,365ft2 of living space.
Accommodation includes an entrance hall, dining area, kitchen, utility room, sunroom, sitting room, three bedrooms and a bathroom.
The outbuildings are in reasonably good condition and these include a three-column round roof hay barn (with a lean-to on either side), an outhouse for cattle or stabling, three stables and a tack room.
The asking price of €675,000 (€13,800/acre) is typical of the kinds of prices being achieved for good land in this part of the world and the quality residence on-site will only add to its appeal."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40371767.html,2021-09-02 10:47:00,Solving the puzzle: Integrating renewable energy technologies on the farm,"There is a “jigsaw puzzle” of technologies out there that can be hosted and deployed on farms for individual energy consumption needs, says Barry Caslin, Energy and Rural Development Specialist, Teagasc.
There are opportunities for agricultural supply chains, for farmers to sell renewable heat and for biomass trade centres that will create a relationship between the grower and the consumer.
Agriculture feedstocks could be used — whether it’s pulpwood from forestry, straw, purpose-grown energy crops, or grass silage which is one of Ireland’s biggest resources and can be utilised for bio grass and anaerobic digestion.
And with over 80,000 beef farmers in Ireland now —most of whom are not making money in the sector at the moment — renewable energy technologies are paving the way for new income stream opportunities and land use alternatives that could become an attractive measure for them.
But as Mr Caslin adds, “there is no silver bullet” to solve decarbonisation, however the range of technologies available means that through integration in an efficient way, Irish farmers can become leaders in the provision of suitable technologies that will help Ireland to reach its 2030 targets.
“Energy efficiency must be deployed on all farms and this means using more energy-efficient technologies,” said Mr Caslin.
“If you take a dairy farm you are looking at energy monitoring and it’s an area that we need to start taking more seriously because energy prices are going to increase due to carbon taxes and benchmarking energy monitoring in the future will be important as well.
'Irish farmers can become leaders in the provision of suitable technologies that will help Ireland to reach its 2030 targets.'
“Farmers could start comparing - through discussion groups — what their energy use is for various things like milk cooling or water heating on dairy farms or poultry units.
“Other energy-intensive areas include the pig sector and really what this is all about is getting the right energy system for the farm.”
Meanwhile, over 30% of energy costs on a dairy farm are from the milk cooling process.
Basic improvements in water heating systems can help with this; renewable technologies like solar PV for heating water and lighting system improvements — LED lights and high-efficiency motors — could be relevant.
These changes, says Mr Caslin, can reduce energy consumption in the milking process by as much as 50%.
“It’s the same for pig farms; the variants on those farms are anything between 36kWh per pig produced to the more efficient farms 16kWh per pig produced.
“Moving onto poultry farms, building energy management systems could be deployed leading to more technically efficient and monitoring equipment.
“It’s important too, to regularly service boilers; many farmers use gas boilers while others use kerosene boilers and these boilers can become very inefficient if they are not serviced regularly.
Renewable energy
Over the next few years the demand for electricity will increase and agriculture is going to play a key role in the transition.
There will also be external opportunities for farmers in that they can deploy large-scale renewable electricity through wind farms and solar PV farms.
From a heating perspective biomass boilers can be installed - these are most relevant to the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors.
And, there are supports available to farmers that deploy this technology on their farms. In fact, there is a demand for biomass boilers in hospitals and hotels as well.
“Biomass is cheaper than oil - oil and gas prices are going to increase as we go forward,” added Mr Caslin.
“So now is the time for farmers to look at where they are at and where they see energy prices for their business in the future.
“It’s about reducing energy costs and reducing the carbon footprint as well.
“I believe there are going to be carbon challenges within agriculture but if there are mechanisms in place to allow for the trading of carbon at farm level, that will help farmers with the process of reducing the carbon footprint on their individual farms.
“Now is a good time to reflect on energy usage on farmers and explore the options that are there to make savings where possible.
“It will also allow farmers to offset current fossil fuels technologies with renewable technologies.”
Meanwhile, the electricity Ireland consumes is produced by peat, coal, oil and gas; there is a certain amount from wind and that will increase which is positive but there is going to be a massive demand for renewable electricity in the future.
“There is an expectation that by 2030 there will be close to one million electric vehicles operating in Ireland — that is going to lead to an increase in energy consumption across the country,” said Mr Caslin.
“There will also be a greater emphasis on heating homes with renewable technologies.
“There is a focus at the moment on heat pumps which require a lot of electricity to run the compressors.
“There is a support scheme for renewable heat which the Government introduced in 2019 the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH).
“We have missed our targets on renewable heat for 2020 and so we now have to focus on the 2030 targets.
“So how are we going to ramp up on the energy transition that is going to be required by Ireland to meet its decarbonisation targets?
“This scheme is part of that transition and encourages the deployment of biomass boilers for non-domestic installations.”
And farmers could not only be hosting these technologies on their farms, but they could also supply the fuel.
Forestry farmers, for example, could potentially supply pulpwood into these boilers.
Straw can also be supplied and we could also look at purpose-grown energy crops like willow or short rotation forestry which will afford farmers the opportunity to supply heat for biomass boilers.
“There is a lack of clarity at the moment in relation to the types of technologies that are suited to individual farms,” Mr Caslin added.
“There are options out there and it can be confusing.
“We run the Energy in Agriculture event at Gurteen College every year and that is a collaborative event between Teagasc, Tipperary County Council, Tipperary Energy Agency, Gurteen College, and IFA that aims to showcase the technologies that are available to farmers and help them to make the best decisions for their farm.
“There are also farmers there who have deployed various technologies on their own farms and that helps to inspire and instill confidence in farmers who attend the event.”"

""A very strong trade for stores also, as quite a few men out re-stocking after killing cattle.
""It was a 50/50 mix of stores and forward cattle on Friday today.""
And looking back the Thursday's sale of dry cows, bulls and heifers at the same mart, Ann added. ""We had just over 400 cull cows and heifers available and the trade was strong.
""Some very good beef cows, mostly Continentals, on offer. Cows dearer and a large number of these made €2 to €2.40/kg.
""Forward heifers an excellent trade also. A large entry of aged bulls averaged €1.73/kg. Trade for bulls a shade easier.

Current Irish dairy industry situation
The Irish dairy industry has been transformed since the abolition of milk quotas in 2015. Exports of Irish dairy products and ingredients have increased from an average of €1.8 billion for the years from 2007-2009 to over €5.2 billion in 2020. World milk supply is forecast to expand by just 1% in 2021, which is less than previous forecasts and long term historical growth rates. China continues to drive current global trade for dairy products. Higher feed prices are keeping dairy farmers’ margins under pressure in high input systems. Dairy commodity prices are trading at elevated values compared with last year.
Increase in milk production
Milk production in Ireland has increased from an average of 4.93 billion litres (average of 2007-2009) to 8.29 billion litres in 2020. This is equivalent to a 68% increase in milk production or an 87% increase in milk fat and protein production, exceeding the 50% increase forecasted in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy document.
In 2020, dairy cow numbers had increased by 454,267 (43%) compared with the average of 2007 to 2009 (1,057,583). Over this period, milk production per cow has increased by 15%, increasing from 4,666 litres/cow (average of 2007-2009) to 5,485 litres in 2020; the combined yield of milk fat and protein per cow has increased by 27%, increasing from 334 kg to 425 kg/cow. Therefore, over this period 50.5% of the increase in milk fat and protein production came from an increase in cow numbers with the remaining 49.5% coming from increased milk solids production per cow.
Increased dairy farm competitiveness and productivity
Since the abolition of milk quotas the competitiveness of Irish dairy farmers has increased compared with those of our main EU competitors, which includes Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands and UK. Comparing the period 2015 to 2017 (post quota abolition) with the period 2012 to 2014 (pre-quota abolition), farm net income in Ireland has increased by 18% (from €61,808 to €73,092), while average farm net income in the EU has reduced by 14% (from €63,594 to €54,459). Post-quota abolition, Irish dairy farmers had the lowest total costs (€3.78) and total cash costs per kg of milk solids (€2.39). In contrast, dairy farmers in Italy and Denmark had the highest total cost (€5.13) and total cash cost (€3.79) in the period. Consequently, in this analysis, Ireland is ranked first as the most competitive country post-quota abolition for both total costs and total cash costs per kg of milk solids.
The Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is a measure of productive efficiency of an industry. TFP takes into account all of the land, labour and intermediate resources utilised in the dairy farm production and compares these with the total output of milk and livestock. If the total quantum of output produced is growing at a faster rate than the total quantum of input used, this is called an improvement in TFP. The TFP of specialist Irish dairy farmers increased by 24% over the period 2010 to 2018. Over this period, total inputs increased by 14%, while total outputs increased by 39%.
Adoption of key technologies
During the eleven-year period from 2010 to 2020, mean calving interval on Irish dairy herds reduced from 401 days to 387 days, six-week calving rate increased from 52% to 65%, and mean calving date has advanced from 9 March to 27 February. The proportion of cows calving in the months of January to April has increased from 79% in 2010 to 84% in 2020. A compact calving pattern is essential to maximise profitability on a grass-based system. It allows the herd feed requirements to match the grass growth curve. Average grass utilisation on Irish dairy farms has increased from 6.7 tonnes DM/ha in 2010 to 8.0 tonnes DM/ha in 2019; this was associated with an increase in the whole farm stocking rate from 1.80 LU/ha to 2.03 LU/ha. The annual rate of gain in EBI (for cows calving) has averaged €11.37 over the past 10 years with no sign of deceleration.
Key environmental challenges facing the Irish Dairy Industry
The Irish dairy industry has been the fastest-growing dairy sector in the EU during the last 10 years, which has contributed greatly to improved economic prosperity in rural Ireland. At the same time, however, the industry is also a major focal point for discontent among both national and international industry commentators who perceive that this expansion is being achieved at the cost of accelerated climate change via growing agricultural emissions, reduced water and air quality (ammonia emissions) and reduction in biodiversity. In the future, Irish dairy farmers must operate farming systems that are financially profitable while at the same time environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable.
Climate change
As part of the new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, Ireland has set a target for a reduction of 51% in GHG emissions by 2030 and being climate neutral by 2050. Sectoral emission reduction targets have not yet been defined, but it’s assumed that agriculture will have to deliver greater than the 10-15% reduction that was proposed in the previous Climate Action Plan in 2019. Agriculture in Ireland accounted for 35.3% of GHG emissions in 2019, which is high compared with the EU27 average of 10.1%. This is due to Ireland’s relatively low population density, little heavy industry and a high share of agriculture in its economic activity. Livestock account for approximately 90% of total agricultural GHG emissions, with methane from enteric fermentation accounting for over 57.9% of these GHG emissions in 2018. Presently, Agriculture is estimated to contribute 21 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. The Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve indicates that a linear uptake of mitigation measures between 2021 and 2030 would result in a mean abatement potential 1.85 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalents per year or 3.06 Mt by 2030.
The current emissions intensity of Irish milk production is slightly less than 1.0 kg CO 2 eq per kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk. This is one of the lowest in the world. Continued improvements in grazing management and EBI of the national herd, use of low emission slurry spreading, use of protected urea plus greater reliance on clover to supply biological fixed N instead of chemical N will continue to improve the emissions intensity of Irish milk production.
The current standard for determining how GHG warms the planet, which is GWP100, does not reflect the differing characteristics of biogenic methane compared with other GHG’s such as CO and NO. Based on new scientific information, biogenic methane is a potent GHG but it has a relatively short life cycle of 12 years, and therefore it is possible that the amounts that are being emitted can be equal to the amount being destroyed. Therefore, the most appropriate metrics will be important to develop strategies to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
Water quality
Water quality is regulated in Ireland by the EU Water Framework Directive, which requires at least ‘good’ water quality in all water bodies (rivers, lakes, groundwater and transitional coastal waters) by 2027. Irish water quality statistics are better than most EU countries; 53% of Irish waters are at good or high status compared with 44% in the EU; and 92% of groundwater is classified as good compared with 80% in the EU. The EU Nitrate Directive has been implemented in Ireland since 2007, and regulates agricultural practices such as stocking rate, fertiliser use, manure storage requirements, and timing of manure and fertiliser application. The current Nitrate Action Programme (4 th ) and associated Nitrate Derogation will expire at the end of this year.
In December 2019, the EU announced the European Green Deal agenda. This was followed by the Farm to Fork Strategy in 2020, which set a requirement to reduce nutrient losses by 50% and fertiliser inputs by 20% by 2030. Subsequently, the DAFM published “Ag Climatise – A Roadmap towards Climate Neutrality”. This set a target to reduce chemical nitrogen from a peak of 408,000 tonnes in 2018, to 350,000 tonnes in 2025 and 325,000 tonnes in 2030, representing a 14% and 20% reduction, respectively. The latest EPA Water Quality report in 2020 indicated some improvements in biological quality of rivers; 57% of rivers and 46% of lakes were in either good or high quality status. However, nutrient levels in rivers, groundwater, and estuaries in the south, southeast and east of Ireland are too high and these must be reduced. The EPA has carried out an analysis of the annual nitrogen load reduction required for each catchment to achieve a standard of 2.6 mg/l N in the downstream estuary (EPA, WFD, River Basin Management Plan, and June 2021).
The Teagasc report on ‘The Impact of Nitrogen Management Strategies within Grass Based Dairy Systems’ highlights the importance of adhering to current regulations with regards to observance of the closed period and not exceeding maximum levels of chemical N application to minimise losses to the environment. It also highlights the benefit of precision N application strategies, taking cognizance of meteorological conditions, especially in early spring and periods of poor grass growth during the main grazing season.
Ammonia
The National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) regulates ammonia emissions in the EU and Ireland. Ammonia emissions in Ireland are predominately from agriculture (~99%), and have been exceeding the NECD ceilings of 116 kilotonnes since 2017. Ireland has been set a ceiling of 114.73 kilotonnes over the period 2020-2029, and reducing to 111.85 kilotonnes by 2030. The adoption of mitigation measures outlined in the Teagasc Ammonia Marginal Abatement Cost Curve should meet these targets.
Biodiversity
The EU biodiversity strategy aims to have at least 10% of agriculture area under high-diversity landscape features. A recent survey of intensively managed farms found that the median wildlife habitat area was 5% in tillage farms, 6% in intensive beef farms and 6.6% for intensive dairy farms. The target is that by 2027, 10% of farmland in dairy farms will be under high-diversity landscape features.
Conclusion
Challenges in the future relate to greenhouse gas emissions, water quality, ammonia emissions, and biodiversity. The Irish pasture-based system confers environmental advantages in terms of manure recycling, soil organic matter carbon content, feed self-sufficiency, GHG emissions per kg of product and landscape diversity. There are demanding domestic and international policy and environmental targets, however, which will require the system of farming to adapt. These changes should build on Ireland’s ‘green’ reputation, gain market share in expanding high value international markets and improve the living standards of practicing dairy farmers."

A joint of ham such as a ham hock is terrific value from local butchers, and if we add salad, we get some nutritional balance in our sandwich. Cold roasted vegetable leftovers can be chopped or puréed with olive oil to make a paste for additional flavour.
Cook a joint of beef, pork, and when it comes to the end of slicing, buzz the ends with olive oil or butter, fresh herbs or spices to make a paste for another day, keeping an eye on a healthy variety of foods throughout the week.
For this survey, we looked in supermarkets for the tastiest sliced meats. We noted the amount of protein (to sustain us), fats (to avoid too many of) and salt (watch levels of over 1%, especially for children). Meat delivers protein for long days at school and work. A diet of ham that is preserved with nitrites and stabilisers and various additives is not advisable every day, so best to keep it as an occasional treat.
Pair sandwiches with fresh fruit – there are good, small apples grown in Ireland which are ideal for junior schoolgoers. A few chunks of melon, watermelon, a handful of Irish blueberries make interesting lunchboxes.
Watch this space for more ideas as the year progresses.
Skeaghanore Irish Smoked Chicken Breast.
Skeaghanore Irish Smoked Chicken Breast 200g €4.95
From the farm in West Cork, this chunk is tender and tasty. it makes a delicious sandwich with lettuce, mayo and gherkins. With low salt (0.70%), protein is high at 29.8% and fats moderate at 3.1%. The smoking is mild and most of our junior tasters liked it as much as the adults. Ummera also does an excellent smoked chicken.

Lidl Deluxe Parma Ham.
Lidl Deluxe Parma Ham PDO 90g €2.29
With 5% salt, this is not a choice for children’s lunches. However, as an introduction to air-dried ham for adults, it's reasonably priced. While salty, there are no other additives which is a good trade-off. Each thin slice has 0.64g of salt and delivers lots of meaty flavour to a salad sandwich. Protein is a decent 28% and fats 15% (1.9g per slice). Spanish Serrano is also good in a lunch box with seasonally delicious cantaloupe melon.

Aldi New York Style Pastrami.
Aldi Specially Selected New York Style pastrami 130g €2.49
The best of the pastramis we tasted, the smoked cured Irish brisket beef with a black pepper coating is well balanced and thinly sliced.
Salt is 2.2%, protein 23%, fats a low enough 3%. Lettuce, mayo, tomato, gherkins, chutney, make a super sandwich. A typical NYC Reuben, adds a slice of cheese in rye bread. Additives, including preservative sodium nitrate, make it best as an occasional treat. Nitrites are used for curing bacon products and sausages.

Tesco Finest Mortadella 140g €2.50
Mortadella Bologna PGI is a status given for a quality local product in Italy and this one deserves it. Salt at 2%, protein 16.2% is moderate, and at 27% fats are high. White pepper, mace, dried garlic, flavourings, nutmeg, sodium nitrite, coriander extract are added for flavour and preservation. Lots of flavour which is not overpowering. While fattier than many other foods, a thin slice goes a long way. Tasters loved it.

M&S Truffle Prosciutto Cotto.
Marks & Spencer Truffle Prosciutto Cotto 100g €7.50
Cooked ham with summer truffle was our favourite pork product of this tasting. With 2.13% salt, protein 19.7%, fats at 9.4% are moderate and worth it for the deliciousness. Some of the fat is easily cut off and what is left is substantial and full of flavour. Made in Italy with Italian pork, the truffle scent is luxurious, the taste subtle, with a meaty texture that was not rubbery. Sodium nitrite is added so save for treats.

The beautiful September weather which the country has been continuing to enjoy since the beginning of the month is proving a bonus for the producers in several ways, and their hope is that it will continue in their favour.
Farm conditions are superb and the fresh growth of grass in the higher temperatures coming after the August rain is the perfect balance to keeping producers and their stock in a happy mode.
There is no pressure on moving stock which continues to thrive well in the super September conditions and the absence of any surge of stock has robbed the processors of any opportunity to further reduce their prices.
Intake at 33,000-34,000 head is required by the processors to meet requirements for a positive market.
While supply continues around that level, it will be very difficult for the processors to pull on the price.
And so it is that the base for steers continues unchanged at 415 cents/kg.

There are reports of a sprinkle of 420 cents/kg being paid to large regular suppliers, which is not available to the general run of intake.
The tone of trade for the heifers is similar at an unchanged base of 420 cents/kg and the occasional 425 cents/kg going for large suppliers.
Bord Bia estimates that intake at the factories for the remainder of this year will be down an average of around 2,500 head/week.
That should help to keep the intake and demand in balance, which is vital to ensuring the trade holds steady.
The intake for last week increased by less than 500 head to 34,497 head compared to the previous week, while being around 500 less than for the corresponding week last year.
The supply of steers at 17,603 head was 800 head higher than last year, while the heifers at 9,119 were back 200 head on 2020.
There was very little change in the supply of young bulls at 1,374, while the intake of cows is down on 2020.
The kill of cows last week was 5,779 compared to 6,906 for the same week last year.
Strong demand for the young bulls is continuing and this has resulted in the prices on offer drawing close to, or on par with, the comparable steer grade.
While some of the plants are continuing to offer 410 cents/kg, most of the young bulls are making 415 cents/kg this week, which is on par with the steers.
How the trade shapes over the coming weeks will be very dependent on weather and supply.
Producers will be hoping that the tradition of September being a golden harvest month of good weather will also mark 2021."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40698821.html,2021-09-15 16:45:00,Supply and demand aligns making price cuts difficult for processors,"Beef finishers have become accustomed to the seasonal downward pressure on prices each autumn as the supply of cattle increases to its annual peak intake at the processing plants.
In very simple terms, those who finish cattle for sale to the meat plants are very familiar with the numbers of cattle available for the factories dictating the movement in the price which they are being paid.
Over the years it has been one of the most constant factors that rarely seemed to change. For 2021 it is no different from past decades in that respect, but one aspect which has changed is the requirement for cattle at the factories to meet demand.
Credit to the processors - who don't always get recognition for what they do well - export markets for beef have been developed to a scale rarely ever experienced in the past and as a result, the processors have requirement for higher intake to fill the orders.
It is not many seasons ago that a weekly intake of around 30,000 head was the benchmark at which the processors were comfortable, and could afford to tighten their rein on prices. 
Two Angus bullocks born in March '2020 with an average weight of 465kg sold for €1,020 at the recent sale in Dungarvan Mart. Picture: O'Gorman Photography.
The weekly requirement is now closer to 34,000 head to supply their markets and up to which they find it very difficult to cut price without risking a shortfall in intake at the plants.
This autumn the supply of cattle is very closely balanced with requirement, which is undermining the ability of the processors to follow the usual seasonal pattern of reducing prices week on week.
In line with recent weeks, the intake for last week continued the pattern at 34,251 head, slipping 2,000 head below the same week last year.
Across the categories, the young bulls were the only ones showing an increase on 2020 with 400 head more than last year at 1,631 head.
The steers at 17,277 head were on par with the same week last year, while the heifers were back on 2020 by around 700 head at 9,168 head; the supply of cows was down 1,800 head at 5,534 head.
The prices, having slipped by around 10 cents/kg, are either holding or slightly hardening this week, and continue to return in excess of 50cents/kg more than a year ago to producers who are having an expensive year with higher input costs.
While most of the official quotes for steers are on a base of 415cents/kg there are reports of deals at 420cents/kg this week to keep the supply flowing.
The trade is on a similar pattern for the heifers with reports that the general quote of 420cents/kg is being topped up to 425cents/kg for larger supplies and some regular suppliers.
The good R grade cows are making up to 390cents/kg with O grade on 370-375cents/kg while the R grade young bulls are generally making around 415cents/kg and striking parity with the comparable steer grade.

With the number of people remotely working on a permanent basis having gone up dramatically during the last year and a half, the pressure on rural residential property has never been more acute.
Land prices are on the up in Munster as well as in the rest of the country and they’re not showing any signs of decreasing. Whether it’s grassland, tillage land or equestrian acres, the trends look set to remain in an upward trajectory for the foreseeable future.
“Land in North Cork is making €10,000 to €12,000 per acre,” notes Michael O’Donovan of Sherry Fitzgerald O’Donovan, who have offices across County Cork in Mallow, Fermoy and Midleton, “with the exceptional parcels making up to €15,000 per acre.”
 “Land prices are hitting €14,000 to €16,000 per acre on a regular basis,” says Trevor McCarthy of Cork-based Irish & European, whose area of operation is a little farther south. “Good grassland with buildings is getting €14,000 to €15,000 per acre. 
“We think that there’s a lot of positivity out there in the agri-land market,” he says. “Again, it’s the dairy man or woman who’s driving it… That’s where most of the confidence is. Any farmer who’s in dairying is generating cash for his business every month and it’s a sector that’s looking positive at the moment… And the banks like funding dairying operations because they can see the cash flow it generates.” 
Forestry land is still in demand but the pinch on supply is even more acute in this particular sub-sector. As a result, forestry land prices have seen a hardening during the year, with prices for the best plantations reaching around €5,500/acre.
“Most land around the country is between €10,000 to €14,000 per acre,” says Mike Brady of Cork-based Brady Group, agricultural consultants and land agents. “Then you go to the hot spots and it’s making anything from €14,000 to €20,000: the hot spots being good land in West Cork; land near towns that may have development potential; land that might be an ideal grazing block that two people are interested in; a certain amount of stud farms.”
 South Tipperary has been another hotspot too, with its large grassland holdings and potent blend of agricultural activity – dominated by the dairying sector but represented by some top beef farmers and equestrian businesses.
“In the Tipperary area, you’d be talking between €10,000 and €15,000 per acre,” says Alison De Vere Hunt of Cashel Marts, “with the exceptional properties making in the region of €20,000. But that would be the average – selling holdings of between 10 and 50 acres.” 
The absence of live auctions in the last year may have dampened prices compared to the extraordinary ones that were more commonplace in the years preceding last year. However, Alison feels that the lack of much-sought-after larger holdings may have something to do with how the year has been; solid but not as extraordinary.
When bidding for farm land, you’re not just competing against other farmers; you’re competing against investors too, even for smaller land parcels.
Investors sharpen focus on agri land
The investors are, by now, a well-established component in the agricultural land market and their presence is applying upward pressure on land prices in general.
“It’s not easy to pick up bargains anymore,” is how Alison De Vere Hunt of Cashel Marts puts it, “because you’re not just competing against other farmers; you’re competing against investors too and even those buying smaller parcels just to live on.” 
It’s a fairly accurate description of today’s land investor because, unlike his predecessor back in the days of the Celtic Tiger, today’s investor comes with less inflationary ambition; with the objective of simply putting his/her money in the best, most tax-efficient place – earning a modest return and keeping it safe. Alternatively, today’s investor also comes in the form of someone investing in a rural lifestyle; a family on a smallholding.
“It’s a very buoyant market compared to previous years,” says Éamonn McQuinn of McQuinn Consulting in Tralee. “It’s the best 18 months that I’ve seen in a long time… we’ve had a good few big sales. There’s certainly a healthy appetite for land in Kerry. What’s driving it in anyone’s guess but I’ve seen it with a number of farms where the land is being bought for tax reasons.” 
Prices for top grassland vary in different parts of the county, he says, with good pastures in North Kerry achieving from €12,000 to €13,000/acre upwards.
“I would find that there’s a strengthening of the market in the last 6-12 months,” says Tom Crosse of Limerick-based GVM Auctioneers. “It’s patently obvious that land prices are on the up – I’d suggest by about 15%. 
""There’s a lot of demand there, driven by dairy farmers and by the resurgence of the business community who see land as being a reasonable investment. Beef farmers are doing well also and I think that low or negative interest rates in banks is pushing money out of banks and into land. Hobby farming is also becoming fashionable… All told, it’s all very positive.” There were some strong sales in his area of operation, including one in the Patrickswell area that was expected to make €1 million but is believed to have made close to €1.4 million.
Another phenomenon he finds is that of people from Cork who were underbidders in areas where strong prices have already been established, are moving on land in Limerick instead, thus spreading the boom in land prices, as it were. Kerry farmers are prone to the same behavioural pattern, he adds.
“We’re finding that lands are exceeding the asking price regularly, with active bidding being the norm,” says Waterford auctioneer Brian Gleeson, whose reach includes West Waterford and East Cork. “We’ve sold agricultural land for between €12,000 and €15,000 per acre. We’ve also appraised two land holdings in West Waterford recently and, such is the quality of the soil structure, these farms will be a litmus test for prices in West Waterford in the coming months.” 
David Shee of Shee & Haw in Carrick-on-Suir also has a close eye on the land market in Waterford, having sold a number of farms in the area over the last year: “We sold a 34-acre farm near Kilmeaden for over €10,000 per acre,” he notes, adding that the sale of a smaller holding (circa 14 acres) near Portlaw village was agreed for a price in excess of €13,500 per acre.
Tightening supply adds to competition
 “There wasn’t as much land on the market,” notes Michael O’Donovan of Sherry Fitzgerald O’Donovan, who have offices across County Cork in Mallow, Fermoy and Midleton. Substantial farms that did come on the market tended to go very well, he notes, with one 180-acre holding selling for €2.5 million (over €14,000/acre) in East Cork. 
“We haven’t had as much land for sale in the last year as we’ve had in the last couple of years but anything that’s selling is selling well enough.” “We’ve had very little supply this year,” says Trevor McCarthy of Irish & European’s Cork office. “We just haven’t had a huge amount of land coming in the market in the last year but anything we have had coming up has gone quite well.” “No problem selling land,” says Mike Brady of Cork-based Brady Group, agricultural consultants and land agents, “but the volume of sales is down. There just isn’t enough land coming on the market.” Statistically speaking, there is approximately 40% less land on the market now compared to the situation about three years ago – a strong contributory factor, surely.
The reasons why supply seems to be tightening are multiple, it appears, with different agents offering different views to explain the pattern.
“There’s a bit of uncertainty going forward,” suggest Michael O’Donovan of Sherry Fitzgerald O’Donovan, who says that much of the uncertainty he speaks of is centred in the dairying sector and specifically, in the uncertainty over the future of the price of milk.
“I would say that the first main reason would be long-term leasing,” says Mike Brady of the Brady Group. “People that may have considered selling a farm before will now enter a long-term lease and they’ve a tax-free income. It’s particularly clear when you compare the situation with putting that same money in the bank. Where are you going to put it? 
""If you sold a farm for a couple of million euros, the bank is going to charge you if you put it in there. The best you could do might be to put it into prize bonds with the Post Office but that’s limited to €50,000. On the flip side, then, you have people with money who are considering buying land and letting it out for the very same reason in reverse.
“Another reason is that dairy farmers are motoring along fine and they’re not so inclined to get out of the business… With hobby farmers or part-time farmers, they seem to be less pushed to sell as well.” 
Hobby farmers and part-time farmers tending to stay put could also be a part of the changes brought by the Lockdown. With the number of people remotely working on a permanent basis having gone up dramatically during the last year and a half, the pressure on rural residential property has never been more acute. 
According to multiple anecdotal reports from auctioneers all over the country, the pressure point is on rural houses with a small curtilage of a few acres, with many agents saying that all the stock of such housing has disappeared ‘off the shelves’ over the last year or so.
 This, of itself, puts plenty of pressure on the land market, with active bidding coming thick and fast in the case of residential farms that are broken into lots.
Less farmers retiring
 One of the underlying reasons for the tightening of the supply of land has been the issue of retiring farmers. Since the end of the Early Retirement Scheme (recently criticised by the EU for not having adequately met the needs of older farmers), holdings have been much slower to come to the open market. Many of those who might have retired earlier under the previous scheme are now retaining holdings and leasing them out.
“Traditionally, when you had farmers retiring and if they didn’t have somebody taking over the farm from them, they’d sell the farm,” says Trevor McCarthy of Irish & European. “Whereas now, even before they’ve reached retirement age, the option is there for them to go into a long-term lease. It’s tax-efficient – they can generate tax-free income in a long-term lease.”
 With an increasing number of farmers seeing the benefit of leasing their holdings long-term, an increasing number of young farmers looking to rent land long-term, it’s no wonder that there’s such a scarcity of agricultural land all of a sudden. When one adds to that the resurgence of the investor, land prices look to be heading in only one direction.
The story of slow supply to the agricultural land market is not a new one, but current pressures are being keenly watched by Government authorities.
Land prices heading for ‘perfect storm’?
With pressure on land prices mounting, it begs the question of how long such a situation can last.
Will some Government tax advisor step in and spot the gaping hole and attempt to shore it up? According to Mike Brady of the Brady Group, not only is this next move is inevitable.
“It’s already happening,” says Mike Brady. “They (the Government) are already looking at it… Land is the worst home in the world at the moment for passing on to the next generation. If you let it out on a ten or 15-year lease, you might be only getting 1.5% or 2% return on it but at least it’s 2% tax-free and the land is going to be there at the end of it.” Such a situation, in fact, illustrates the kind of double pressures on land that are contributing to the rise in values.
“As a consequence, because the volume is down on the supply side, prices are being pushed up. The hobby farmer is back on the market again – back in the saddle after Covid, so to speak. To a lesser extent, you have a certain amount of development land and CPO’s starting up again. 
""Those are two more areas, where it’s been dead for ten years but which are starting to kick in again. I would say they you could be heading towards a ‘perfect storm’ with land prices – you’ve a shortage of supply and demand coming from all the different sectors.”
 But when it comes down to it, the story of slow supply to the agricultural land market is not a new one. While certain factors that have produced a pinch in supply over the last year or so will probably be ironed out, Irish land has its own peculiarities that few other countries in Europe experience – a cultural trait, perhaps, related to our own particular history and of the role that land has played in it.
“Traditionally, there has always been a bit of an issue with agricultural land supply in Ireland,” says Trevor McCarthy of Irish & European. “Land in Ireland only trades every three or four generations on average. This is something not seen in most other European countries.”
Residential 48-acre Golden Vale farm likely to fetch €800,000
 An excellent holding consisting of 48.5 acres of Golden Vale land complete with a residence is expected to sell well in the coming weeks, according to the selling agent Richard Ryan of GVM.
The property is in the townland of Brickfield, approximately 5km from Kilmallock and 8km from Charleville.
“It’s being offered in three lots,” says Richard. “Lot 1 is the house – a four-bedroom bungalow-style residence on half an acre, with a guide price of €225,000. Lot 2 is 22.5 acres with a guide price of €275,000 (€12,000/acre). It’s all excellent-quality grazing land which has all been re-seeded within the last couple of years… it’s really good land. Lot 3 is 25 acres and we’re guiding that at €300,000 (€12,000/acre).” 
The house is around 40 years old but has been very well maintained.
Lot 2 comes with an old farmyard, comprising an old milking parlour and a few stables, an old slurry pit and a cubicle shed.
“The outbuildings are well maintained and in good order,” says Richard, “but a bit antiquated by today’s standards…. We’ve a good bit of interest in it and we would expect to be able to conclude a deal on it in the coming weeks.”
End-of-month online auction date for 49-acre farm in North Cork
 There should be keen interest in an upcoming online auction of a 48.6-acre holding in Gortnacross, North Cork.
The residential holding is going under the virtual hammer on Thursday, September 30, at 11am.
“It’s reasonable-quality grazing land,” says selling agent Will Lyons of Cork-based auctioneers ERA Downey McCarthy. “And it’s very well located, in proximity to Mallow.
“The farm is just to the northwest of Mallow and it has extensive road frontage, with a number of access points to the property. It’s entirely in grass, divided into grazing paddocks To attend the online auction, interested parties must first register their interest online at eracork.ie, where they can also download a full legal pack for them or their solicitor to review beforehand. The solicitors with carriage of sale is the Beauchamps firm in Dublin.
The guide price is €430,000. At €8,800 per acre, it is a logical expectation for a good quality farm in this part of Munster. The online route has become popular in recent years and its method has been well tried and tested and will probably remain a strong option for many auctioneers even after Covid restrictions have been lifted.
Hobby farmers interested in charming 44-acre North Cork holding
According to Mary O’Callaghan of Mallow auctioneers Singleton O’Callaghan, there is keen interest in a 44-acre residential equestrian holding new to the market in North Cork – 15km from Charleville and 22km from Mallow.
“It’s set up as a small equestrian holding,” says Mary, “but the interest in it so far is mainly from people who aren’t particularly into farming or equestrian or anything like that – they’re interested in the rural lifestyle, the peace and quiet. They’re very much into growing their own produce… the good life, basically.” 
The property has a modern three-bedroom dormer-style bungalow, along with a hay barn that houses three stables and a number of out-offices. There are ten acres of mature forestry but the remainder of the land consists of pasture.
“The land is good quality land – all grazing ground,” says Mary.
The holding features a man-made lake covering approximately one acre, it’s well fenced and maintained and there is electricity and water supply. The house is in a private position, set well off the main road with a tar-and-chip driveway leading from the public road. The N20 is a few kilometres away.
The agents are seeking offers in excess of €495,000 for the farm.
Rare high-class home on 27 acres in East Cork to generate c.€1m
A top-quality residence on a substantial tract of top-quality land in East Cork is already generating a great amount of interest, according to the selling agent Michael Barry of the Fermoy office of Dick Barry & Sons.
The 27-acre residential property on the edge of Rathcormac village, comes with some form: two years ago, a larger part of the land – a 95-acre non-residential holding located across the road from it – was sold at auction for over €17,000/acre.
“As you’re coming out of Rathcormac village and heading towards Cork city, it’s on the left-hand side,” says Michael, who explains that at the time of the auction, the owners kept the house on 27 acres with a period house, stables and sheds until they found alternative accommodation. Now that they have, the magnificent period house on 27 acres of prime land is on the market.
“It’s a beautiful period house known as Greenhall,” says Michael. “There are 2 acres of woodland, but the rest is top-class land.” Despite the location on the very edge of the development boundary of the satellite town, this is strictly agricultural land, albeit high quality land in a superb location. The price guide is €1,000,000, selling jointly with GVM in Kilmallock.
Brace of farms in East Cork offer varied prospects in rising market 
New to the market with Midleton-based auctioneer David Keane, a pair of residential farms offer different prospects to the vibrant agricultural land market in East Cork.
“The 46-acre farm is in Churchtown South, Cloyne,” says David of the location which is 5km south of Cloyne village and close to the beach. “It’s a unique situation because there’s a high percentage of it within the development boundary in Churchtown South village.” 
While the location wouldn’t allow for large-scale development, it could benefit someone who was looking at building a house on five or six acres. The recently-refurbished house on the land is in good condition.
Most of the land consists of top-quality pasture with extensive road frontage and it will be offered in four or five lots with a price expectation of €17,000 to €20,000/acre.
The second farm is a 92-acre residential holding 10km north of Killeagh and includes c.13 acres of forestry. Extensive road frontage bounds one side, with a stream demarcating the other.
The land is of good quality pasture and the dwelling – a c.4-year-old bungalow in need of modernisation – can be sold separately from the rest of the land. The price expectation is over €12,000/acre."

Excellent car – but stick with the petrol option
Selling a car to your brother – or in my case, selling the idea of a car – is a process filled with potential disaster. Selling it to him in order for him to buy one for his wife is an even more perilous exercise.
When it happens that the end result is entirely successful and satisfactory, all is good; but in the event the car turns out to be a dog for any given reason, it is ironic your head is the one on the block and not the duffer who sold it to them or even the damnable people who made it.
Such was the case three or so years ago when the sister-in-law decided she wanted to trade in her venerable Alfa Romeo Giulietta, but had no clue what she wanted to replace it with. Upon being told that she wanted to go down the SUV route, I had no hesitancy in recommending the – then – new Peugeot 3008. The one with the 1.2 litre petrol engine.
Being the sensible lady she is, she went and tried all the competition as well, but eventually came back and declared that the 3008 was the one for her. And so off she went and bought one and has been delighted with it ever since. Phew.
I first tested the second generation 3008 back in 2017 (the car was then the holder of the prestigious European Car Of The Year award) and professed it to be the best thing Peugeot had done since the heyday of the original 205 and the 205 GTi back in the ‘80’s.
I said at the time it was a portent of what was coming down the road from Peugeot and I think that sentiment has been rubberstamped by models such as the 5008, the new 208, the new 508 (in both fastback and SW formats), the new 308 and the new 2008, which have come along since then.
The 3008 then – the second generation one, it is important to emphasise, because the first generation one was an ugly dog – kick-started a period of design redemption chez Peugeot. 
However, as the nature of the automotive beast is focused on constant evolution, the trick for the French company was repeating it.
Much like the band who score a hit first off with their debut record, industry legend makes the next one “the difficult second album.” So it can be too with cars; just because you get one right doesn’t mean the next one will be great too.
The GT-trim version we tried came as standard with a new 10” infotainment screen which is now much more driver-friendly because it is brighter, clearer and more high definition than previously
And, despite the little matter of the in-house distraction of a massive merger with Fiat/Chrysler, the Peugeot people kept their eye on the ball here and the facelifted version of the 3008 which arrived in this country earlier this year was immediately lauded as being an ever sharper looker than its predecessor and a better drive too.
Times being what they are and with electrification being at the front of every designer and engineer, Peugeot also had to get to the point where the 3008 could be plugged in. Instead of going down the pure electric route – like it had done so successfully with the e-208 – it went down the plug-in hybrid road instead. And it is this new model that we test here this week.
The last 3008 was a big car and about as svelte as Giant Haystacks, but an emphasis on sharp design detailing – inside and out – made the car a winner in the looks department alone. This time around Peugeot has given it a new frameless grille and the by now brand trademark ‘sabre tooth’ LED daytime running lights and new LED headlight clusters add further sophistication to proceedings.
At the rear there are also new light clusters which mirror the elegance of the front end look and the combination of these changes make the car look more premium than before.
On the inside the décor has been beefed up what with ambient lighting, new upholstery choices and decorative trims, but the essential classiness of the design – exemplified by the fantastic ‘piano key’ switchgear, the digital instrumentation binnacle and the unique ‘i-cockpit’ with its tiny steering wheel, stand the 3008 out by comparison with any opposition.
The GT-trim version we tried came as standard with a new 10” infotainment screen which is now much more driver-friendly because it is brighter, clearer and more high definition than previously. Initially it appears to be much more intricate to use, but as the major functions are accessible via those piano keys, it is a lot more simple than you might have feared.
Under the hood is a standard 1,598cc four pot engine producing 180 bhp and it is mated with an 11.6 kWh electric motor (driving the front wheels only) with 100 bhp. The combination of the two gives a total system output of 225 bhp, a 0-100 km/h time of 8.8 seconds and a top speed of 140 km/h. The latter is achievable in Sport mode, while top speed in electric-only drive is 84 km/h.
Peugeot quote a consumption rate of 1.4 l/100 km (a staggering 200 mpg) and a total electric range of between 50 and 60 km. You will have to work very hard to get anywhere near achieving either.
At the rear there are also new light clusters which mirror the elegance of the front end look and the combination of these changes make the car look more premium than before.
People convinced by the PHEV schtick will give themselves a laudatory clap on the back when they see such figures, but the sad reality of these vehicles will soon dawn on them as they try and make them real.
Sure, if you keep the batteries topped up constantly and stick to very short journeys and you might never hear the petrol engine in action, but that’s not the reality of modern life for many people. The fact you can charge the batteries via the engine is a bonus, but does impact on fuel consumption.
In any event, if you get to see an average consumption rate of 5.6 l/100 km (50 mpg) you will be doing well. That’s not an impossible target and does stand this 3008 in reasonably good stead.
On the road, I didn’t feel the handling was as sharp as I remembered in the 1.2 petrol version and perhaps the additional weight of the batteries contributed to that. But it is worth remembering anyway that the 3008 is a purveyor of comfortable motoring rather than a sports car.
Having added all that up. I came to the conclusion that – especially on the basis of cost – that if you want a 3008, you be far better off looking further down the range, even as far as that entry level 1.2 petrol turbo (with 130 bhp), which has very decent consumption levels and you won’t get flahed on tax either.
A lady who is looking to change her elderly Qashqai and who spotted the 3008 outside my front door, called to ask my opinion of it and to see if she could take a closer look. She could and she did and was quite enthralled with it. She wanted to know if I thought the hybrid was a decent option.
Nora – the lady in question – might have been taken aback by my assertion of the dubious value of PHEVs and the recommendation of the 1.2 petrol instead – “Is that not too small for a car this size?” – but was assuaged by my assurance it would do a great job for her. I think she may even buy one.
In hindsight, I should simply have given Nora my sister-in-law’s number and let her do the sales pitch.

Mini Cooper S: The motoring icon can still put a smile on your face"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-40701359.html,2021-09-20 12:31:00,John Whelan: As workers return to offices supply chain risks pile up,"As workers head back to offices, shops and factories today and 'Freedom Day' nears, retailers and manufacturers alike fear their recovery from the effects of the pandemic will be hampered by freight rate rises, shipping delays, and stock shortages.
Costs are rising on goods imported from Asia, Africa, and America, with port congestion and container shortages disrupting the normal flow of goods; nearer to home, Brexit regulations blowing hot and cold, have hit food exporters to the UK. 
Last week’s joint briefing for the industry by Irish Revenue customs division and the Department of Agriculture on handling health certificates for each shipment of everything from pork pies, pizzas, beef, and plants, did not make for easy listening, despite the welcome news of the push back to January next, particularly the remarkable advice to open a facility in the UK to overcome the supply chain problems for UK customers.
Global supply chain bottlenecks have made scheduling predictability abysmal.
Long-distance shipping used to be more than 80% predictable, now there is only a one-third chance of your ship arriving on time. 
Sea freight transit times tripled
Fashion retailers in particular will feel the impact as they mainly import from China, where sea freight transit times have tripled from 20 days to 60 days over the past year. 
Shortages have cropped up also across the wider manufacturing industry; Wavin in Balbriggan have been forced to limit production due to PVC shortages; IKEA reported shortages of range of products; and Brown Foreman, the owner of Cooley Irish whiskey, is reporting glass bottle shortages.
Sea freight rates have skyrocketed on popular routes, with rates rising consecutively for the past 22 weeks, according to Drewry the global shipping consultancy, who report that in August the average shipping rate for a 40-foot container was now 323% higher than the same week last year.
Labour shortages are also part of the problem. 
The haulage industry reports extreme difficulty in getting drivers following the return of many eastern Europeans to their home countries because of Covid lockdowns and Brexit transit problems.
KPMG in its most recent Global Manufacturing Output report states ""the greatest threat to manufacturers growth over the next three years, apart from the pandemic, is the risk to the supply chain"". 
The report goes on to state that 60% of chief executives report that they will have to re-think their approach to supply chains in order to become more agile, as well as bringing production closer to home and making their supply chain more robust.
Supply chain pressures
One of the fundamental ways that companies are now examining their supply chain is looking beyond their immediate suppliers, to check the sources these so-called 'first tier' suppliers are using. 
Previously, some manufacturers knew very little of the location of their suppliers below this first level.
Adding urgency to the matter, the European Parliament has increased the pressure on manufacturers to get more active in building better supply chains that ensure the absence of child and forced labour as well as environmentally friendly material supplies. 
This all adds up to the not-so-rosy picture of further disruption to traditional supply chains, and potentially continued cost inflation for some time to come.
Already we are seeing strong evidence of the impact of supply chain cost increases on the wider economy, with Eurozone data rising more than expected recently and hitting a 10-year high of 3% in August.
But some European central bank chiefs believe that the fears of rampant inflation are misplaced including Gabriel Makhlouf, Ireland’s central bank governor, who stated last week that fears of excessive eurozone inflation are 'overstated' at the moment and that notwithstanding the considerable uncertainty about the persistence of price pressure, the current pick up is transitory.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40704284.html,2021-09-22 23:08:00,Marts Report: Strong sales with high clearances,"These are important months for Irish beef farmers with regards to farm payments.
September is the month those of us lucky enough to be in a disadvantaged area, get our Disadvantaged Payment.
I realise in today's ever confusing world, the Disadvantaged Payment is no longer known as the Disadvantaged Payment. I don't know why they had to change it. I guess someone got offended.
In any case, whether it's called the Disadvantaged Payment or the ANC (Areas of Natural Constraints) payment, the logic and reason behind the scheme remain the same.
Three Limousin bullocks born in March 2020 average weight 545kg sold for €1,260 at a sale in Corrin Mart, Fermoy. Picture: O'Gorman Photography.
It's designed to give a helping hand for those of us farming in an area that needs such a lift.
And then next month, for those of us lucky enough to be farming long ago and still in business, we receive our Basic Farm Payment.
Again the name of the scheme has changed down through the years, but the story remains the same.
This payment is based on historical data. On action and work we undertook in beef farming years ago. In the days when we all had a lot more hair.
It's a payment that reminds us of a time long ago when suckler farmers could afford a new jeep, a time when we all felt better off.
The Basic Farm Payment is a much-debated about payment, with many believing that it should be spread out more evenly amongst farmers (dead right).
But none the less, it's still a vital payment for farmers. A payment that ensures the heartbeat of Irish farming remains someway stable.
An example of how vital it is can be experienced by the palpations in ones own heart when your payment is late or delayed.
These payments in September and October keep many farms afloat. They are used to pay agricultural contractors, Co-op bills, vets fees, accountancy charges, even school expenses. All in all they are payments that keep rural Ireland from going under.
It's a pity we cannot survive in farming without such subsidies, but it's a relief that we do have them.
And so to the marts we go, where I suspect a bit of ANC money was floating around this week as farmers spend on cattle with the aim of keeping their own show on the road.
We go first to Macroom where on Saturday Friesian bullocks made from €1.60/kg to €1.90/kg. Dry cow sold from €160 to €1040 with the kilo.
Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bullocks in Macroom on Saturday made from €2.10/kg to €2.35/kg.
Continental bullocks made from €2.20/kg to €2.60/kg. Heifers in Macroom on Saturday made from €2.10/kg to €2.73/kg.
Weanling bulls made from €2.50/kg to €3.40/kg. Weanling heifers in Macroom on Saturday made from €2.30/kg to €2.60/kg.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40708493.html,2021-09-28 15:24:00,Beef Report: Finishers and processors maintain their ground,"The balance between supply and demand in the beef sector continues to hang at centre point as both the finishers and the processors each maintain their ground on conceding any movement in the prices.
Finishers know that the processors have a requirement for what intake of cattle they are getting and therein is the key to underpinning the success of their stance to resist any threat to reduce the returns.
The markets for beef are strong and the processors continue to have a requirement for 33,000-34,000 head weekly intake to fill the orders which have been forcing their hand to maintain prices over the past month.
Once again the finishers were being fed the threat of a pending reduction of around 5 cents/kg in prime beef prices for this week's intake during the later days up to the weekend, which helped to strengthen the booking for the early days of this week.
Once again the threat has failed to materialise on the ground and suppliers for this week are strongly resisting any reduction with some reports of deals with factory agents being secured for a slight increase in the price.
While the general base being quoted for steers has continued at 415 cents/kg, a reasonable percentage of steers are understood to be making up to 420 cents/kg while getting above that continues difficult.
The heifers are on a general base of 420 cents/kg and making up to 425 cents/kg with reports of 430 cents/kg being achieved but they are few and far between.
The ground conditions on farms continue to be excellent relieving any pressure on finishers to lighten stocking levels by moving out the heavier cattle which are continuing to thrive on the good grass supply.
On the finisher side, there is an awareness that more of the finishing animals are now coming up to 30 months, but the tight balance in intake versus requirement at the processors is leaving scope for special deals negate any reduction for over age quality animals.
The R grade young bulls are generally making 410 cents/kg with some lots up to 415 cents/kg.
The cow trade is quite strong, having recovered from some of the downward pressure of recent weeks with the quality R grade cows making 385-390 cents/kg this week and O grade at 375-380 cents/kg.
The intake last week remained stable at 35,967 head which is running at nearly 2,500 head higher than in 2020 with all categories, except cows higher than a year ago. The steers were up 1,000 at 17,214 head, while heifers were higher by 1,500 head at 10,250 head."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40712399.html,2021-10-04 15:58:00,Drastic action needed in forestry if we are to meet our climate targets,"We need to take drastic action on forestry if we are to meet our climate targets, said Environment, Climate and Communications Minister Eamon Ryan in the Dáil last week.
In his statement on Climate Action last Thursday, he said we often see land use as a sink or as a store for carbon, but 2018 measurements showed land was a source of emissions.
""Some 4.8 million tonnes is the estimate for 2018. Far from that improving, because of the changing nature of our forest cover system, we expect that by the end of this decade, we will have a bigger challenge in turning that land use from being a source into a sink. We can expect 7 million to 9 million tonnes of resources from land use due to the changes that are taking place in forestry, deforestation, and the lack of new forestry being planted.""
""A lot of the emissions we will save from forest sinks will only accrue in the next decade or in the next lifetime of that forest. We need to start planting now and manage the accounting and organisation of this in a real way, however.
""We have done great work on forestry. We have gone from a country of 1% afforestation up to 11%. The next leap will be through a different form of forestry, however, coming down off those peaty upland marginal lands, where we need to store carbon in those peaty soils rather than through continued afforestation. It will mean using all sorts of agroforestry, riparian forestry, closed continuous cover, and close-to-nature forestry models.
""In the mid-1990s, we were achieving some of the sorts of afforestation levels we will now need. That is what we need to go back to, it is not impossible.""
Minister Ryan said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has given stark warnings that our water quality is falling sharply, driven primarily by lack of good wastewater treatment capacity and by agricultural run-off.
He said the agricultural contribution to water quality continues to decline, and quoted Director General Laura Burke's statement that ""all trends are going in the wrong direction"".
""For water quality reasons, we will need to cut drastically the use of nitrogen on our agricultural land,"" said Minister Ryan.
""Several of the research farms, including Lyons Farm, which is stationed at UCD, are showing that drastic cuts in nitrogen can be achieved when we move to a new multi-species sward grass pasture system. This shift away from nitrogen-hungry ryegrass cuts costs, increases soil carbon, improves water quality, reduces greenhouse emissions and protects us against the flooding and drought conditions we can expect as climate change hits home.""
He said the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are working on these issues, including a nitrates action plan, and ammonia reduction.
Ammonia is rising, and mixes with other gases to create particulates that enter our bloodstream and contribute to asthma, strokes and heart attacks, said Minister Ryan.
""When we improve productivity on farms from multi-species swards, lower methane levels, breeding and shorter animal life cycles, we must reinvest this productivity in nature and pay farmers better through the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and other new payment systems to which we will need to turn to pay for this restoration of nature and reward the farmers and foresters who will deliver it.
""If we reinvest this dividend in growth, all our targets will be shot and our green reputation, which is already under pressure, will be damaged. ""
In his statement on Climate Action, Limerick City Green Party TD Brian Leddin, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, said: ""There is considerable income inequality among farmers. Some dairy farms are very profitable, in contrast to farmers in beef and other sectors, many of whom are running their farms at a loss due to low prices. A shift to rewarding farming practices that are less intensive and provide high nature value offers the opportunity to introduce more fairness in the sector.""
Deputy Leddin added: ""The export-led economic model for agriculture, in which we compete on volumes, must be changed. The argument, that if we do not export beef and dairy, other countries will, is reductive and simplistic and neither recognises market dynamics nor our moral obligations to poorer countries.""
Tipperary Fianna Fáil TD Jackie Cahill said the Climate Bill is hugely important but needs public buy-in to be successful, and his constituents resent the blame they are getting.
“If anything has shaken public confidence in our ability to deal with climate change fairly, it is the mess we have made of peat and peat harvesting.
“Forestry is another example of where lack of initiatives and an inability to deal with the Department's bureaucracy has resulted in us wildly missing the targets for afforestation.
“The volume of carbon sequestration lost as a result will be difficult to replace.
Deputy Cahill said carbon sequestered by grasslands is not measured in the reduction in emissions, but methane produced when the grass is digested by farm animals is measured, and sequestration of carbon in farm ditches is not measured. He said energy from slurry, and solar panels, are missed opportunities.
Cavan-Monaghan Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy said farmers can play a positive role in climate action, but every action of this Government appears to be aimed at preventing them from doing so.
“The Green Party is suggesting we eat less meat. Farmers who switched from beef to horticulture such as mushroom growing are rewarded with scenes of ships containing 4,000 tonnes of peat, having travelled a 3,000 km journey, arriving into Ireland where up to 200 trucks unload the peat that could be sourced here in a much more environmentally sustainable manner.” 
Dublin South-West People Before Profit-Solidarity TD Paul Murphy said Irish agriculture should be based on food sovereignty, diversification, and incentives to farm sustainably, guaranteeing an income.
Roscommon-Galway Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice said he drove 112 miles to the Dail with trees on both sides of the road which are not counted in Ireland’s carbon assessments."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40713815.html,2021-10-05 14:11:00,Beef Report: Difficult for finishers to get much above 420c per kg for steers,"There is an overall steady tone to the beef trade at the factories this week with both the finishers and the processors continuing to hold their ground.
While the officially quoted prices are unchanged there is a feeling that the processors are moving to tighten their rein on paying above their quoted prices to the same degree as over the recent weeks.
There was heavy rainfall in some areas of the country over the past week which has resulted in some deterioration in ground conditions and more farmers are expected to proceed with lightening their stocking levels.
In the background, the processors are continuing to closely monitor the balance between their requirements for cattle and the weekly inflow which is a crucial factor in regulating the price on their side.
As of this week, the base for steers has continued to be quoted at 415 cents/kg with some deals being made at up to 420 cents/kg. It is more difficult for finishers to get much above that right now.
The heifers are on a base of 420 cents/kg with up to 425 cents/kg being paid in some deals.
The young bulls continue to trade at par with the similar grade steers with R grade at 415 cents/kg in general.
The cows are also stable retaining the recovery over recent weeks with the quality R grade cows making up to 390 cents/kg.
The intake has remained very stable over recent weeks at just shy of 36,000 head which is leaving some comfort zone to the processors and easing pressure on sourcing stock to meet their requirements.
The supply last week was 35,751 head which was slightly lower than the prior two weeks while being around 2,000 head more than for the same week last year.
The supply of steers remains strong at 17,872 head compared to 16,300 head for the same week last year. The heifers are also higher than last year at 9,735 head compared to 9,156 head in 2020. The cows are 350 head less than 2020 at 6,082 head and the intake of young bulls is slightly up on 2020 at 1,524 head.
So where does the supply currently sit in comparison to last year at the beginning of October?
Year to date total intake is at 1,251,243 head compared to 1,322,018 head for the first nine months of last year showing a drop of almost 81,000 head.
The expectation is that intake for the year could be down by the order of around 120,000 head.
Given that expectation, it is reasonable to expect supply to remain tight for the balance of the year with the weekly intake back by an average of 2,500-3,000 head per week on the 2020 level."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40715306.html,2021-10-07 10:56:00,‘The Irish grass-fed dairy sector is the envy of the world’,"“We have a great industry — one that is the envy of the world. We have a climate and land that is suitable for milk production, educated farmers, excellent research and advice, and we have a Government that is backing the industry. That is the perfect scenario.” 
These were the sentiments expressed by Mike Brady about the dairy sector in Ireland and the strides it has taken to become a world leader over the last 30 or so years.
Mr Brady says that dairy farmers are “absolutely flying at the moment” and everything is going really well.
Milk price is always a contentious issue but the last few years have seen a good market and this it seems is down to the fact that there has been five years of consistently good prices.
Other than that, he adds, there are very few negative factors affecting the sector at the moment ... and that includes the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mike Brady of Brady Group, the Cork-based agricultural consultant and land agents.
“The last year, where there was a bad price for milk was 2016 and then we had good milk price in 2017, ‘18, ‘19, ‘20 and ‘21 — so that’s five years in a row of respectable, above-average milk prices,” added Mr Brady.
“There was a drought in 2018 which did affect things a little bit but other than that it’s all good.
“Lots of lads have expanded and they are making money. The Covid-19 pandemic had zero effect on farming; when the pandemic actually hit in March 2020, dairy farmers were in the middle of calving season and their lives went on as normal.
“In fact, they didn’t really know there was a pandemic until June of 2020 because they were so busy on the farm.
“It just didn’t impact the business side of things.” 
Meanwhile, 25% of the cows in Ireland are in Cork followed closely by Tipperary. There are also a substantial number of cows in Limerick and Kerry.
And, Munster it appears is at the top of its game in terms of dairying.
Mr Brady says that the “positives” in relation to the sector include good weather — which means the grass is growing — good milk price and no market disruption or disease outbreaks.
He added, however, that there are concerns around the uncertainty of the environmental agenda, ie, greenhouse gasses, water quality, biodiversity, and animal welfare; and with regard to the lack of labour.
“Farmers are finding it very difficult to get labour on their farms at the moment, it’s a particular nightmare on dairy farms, to be honest about it,” he continued.
“I actually looked at EU unemployment stats; there is youth unemployment of 17% most of which is in Greece, Italy, Spain, Croatia and you never see southern Europeans working on Irish farms.
“It’s nearly always those from northern European countries.
“I don’t know why that is; maybe northern Europe is where we need to go searching for labour now.” Mr Brady went on to say that he is not worried about the environment because as far as he is concerned farmers in Ireland are “doing everything right” when it comes to this.
He also says that science will “win out” in the end and stocking rates will more than likely reduce here.
“Personally I’m not concerned about the environment and Irish farming because science will win out at the finish line on this and we have a great system here,” he added.
“Teagasc — in general — is doing a lot of research in the whole area at the moment.
“When I’m talking to my clients now we are factoring in that stocking rates are going to have to be reduced.
“We are going to be using less Nitrogen and that is going to have a knock-on effect.  But we will be exploring other elements like clover, multi-species swards, and better ways of utilisation of Nitrogen to grow grass.
“I am hopeful that the greenhouse gas matter will get sorted too. At the moment a vaccine is being developed in New Zealand; there is research being undertaken on seaweed extract and I think that there will be a combination of solutions to all of this.” 
“One way to solve the greenhouse gas problem here would be to provide an attractive scheme for suckler farmers to get out altogether and then cap the number of dairy cows,” suggests Mike Brady. “There is the problem solved overnight! Politically that would be a hot potato, of course…” 
With regard to the national herd, Mr Brady says the dairy sector is being blamed for the difficulties there, but added, “Everyone is blaming dairying because of its expansion but the numbers in the sector have only come back up in recent times to what they were in 1984.
“At that time, Ireland had about 1.4 million dairy cows and we have just surpassed that figure in 2021.
“Suckler cows went the opposite way; in 1984 there were 750,000 suckler cows then it went up to over one million and now it's back down under one million again.” Mr Brady went on to say that suckler farmers are very “touchy” about the situation at the moment.
He highlighted Professor Gerry Boyle of Teagasc’s comments last week when he said that they should consider dairy beef instead of suckler beef.
In rugby terms, Mr Brady pointed out that the request was a bit like asking a Munster supporter to start supporting Leinster.
“Beef farmers are very emotional about things but at the end of the day, if you take the emotion out of it, Professor Boyle is talking facts. At the same time, comparing beef farming to dairying is not good either because they are two different beasts altogether.
“Most beef farmers are at it part-time and while they don’t like to hear this: effectively it is a hobby, whereas the dairy farmer is full-time at the job.
“On the beef front, the contribution to the economy is huge but the contribution to the individual farmers is poor.  However, it's not all about economics either.” 
 Meanwhile, the basic goals of sustainable agriculture include environmental health, economic profitability, and social and economic equity.
Mr Brady highlighted the importance of this when it comes to assessing the overall situation here in Ireland.
“We are getting a lot of disdain over greenhouses gasses because 35% of emissions are from agriculture,” he continued.
“There are reasons for that; if we had a lot of heavy industry we would be down at 10% or 11% like our British counterparts and there wouldn’t be half the pressure on us then.
“But it’s there and we have to deal with it; we have to look at all of this on a global scale first and I think that is where a lot of the environmentalists are going wrong.
“There is no point in us being the best in the class and cutting our national herd if it means that the USA, for example, is going to expand by putting more 3,000 cow units with animals indoors and supply world demand.
“That will lead to carbon leakage and that is not right at all.” 
He also pointed out how the situation needs to be examined from a global perspective first, then on a country basis, followed by farm basis and lastly from a sectoral perspective.
“One way to solve the greenhouse gas problem here would be to provide an attractive scheme for suckler farmers to get out altogether and then cap the number of dairy cows,” added Mr Brady. “There is the problem solved overnight! Politically that would be a hot potato, of course…” 
Markets 
According to Mr Brady, there is very little happening in terms of land sales at the moment. Even letting land has slowed and the agri expert says this is because of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform and the uncertainty that is there around the allocation of entitlements.
“There isn’t a lot going on land wise at the moment - the volume of land coming for sale over the last two years has significantly decreased,” he continued.
“There just isn’t a lot of land coming onto the market and one of the reasons for that is because a lot of farmers that are thinking of retiring and letting out their land are holding off until they get their allocation of entitlement under the new CAP which is starting in 2023.

“I would expect a lot of land to come onto the market for letting then.
“If you are a dairy farmer that is thinking of getting out and you are going to lease your land for seven or 10 years, at the moment the Government is out on ‘armchair farmers’ who are letting out their entitlements.
“So fellas are afraid that if they let out their land this year with their entitlements, they will lose those entitlements by not getting a new allocation in 2023.
“Lads are hanging in there, waiting until they get their allocation and then they will let the land.
“If the CAP reform was decided there would definitely be more land for letting.” 
Concerns 
Meanwhile, some farmers have raised concerns about the need for additional ground as a result of measures being implemented under the Nitrates Action Programme (NAP).
Mr Brady says they should seek advice from their agricultural consultant so that they are aware of their options and other measures that can be taken if the need arises.
One such measure is to reduce cow numbers but there are other factors to consider before doing that.
“They could contract rear replacement heifers - get another farmer to rear the heifers and keep the same amount of land. With this method cow numbers don’t need to be cut,” he continued.
“Options vary from farm to farm; if a guy is contract rearing his heifers and is already very highly stocked and can’t get any extra land, then he has a problem for sure.
But it's not all about getting extra land; while it is a solution, it’s not the only solution.”
 Sector 
The dairy sector processes approximately seven billion litres of milk per annum, supplied by 18,000 family farms, many of whom are owners of the primary business.
Since the abolition of quotas, Ireland is on the road to becoming a global leader in the development of a high value, environmentally sustainable dairy industry based on our extensive grass-based dairy system.
Irish dairy companies have invested hundreds of millions towards this goal, resulting in over €4 billion worth of exports in dairy products, ingredients and nutritional products per annum.
Irish dairy is exported to 155+ markets world wide with international markets beyond the EU becoming increasingly important.
Irish primary dairies continue to be 100% Irish owned entities, and the quality of the country’s produce is reflected in the fact that three of the world's major specialised nutrition companies have chosen to base key secondary processing sites in Ireland.

Dr David Styles, lecturer, School of Engineering, UL.
Efficient milk production 
Irish dairy farmers, and their cows, do a fantastic job of converting water (rain) into milk, via lush green grass, with the help of various inputs including fertilisers and supplementary feeds. 
Most of this milk is processed into cheese and milk powder for international export, allowing the seasonal pattern of grass growth to be exploited through spring calving.
 Consequently, Ireland’s dairy sector is booming as a comparatively low-cost and low-carbon global supplier of dairy commodities. Origin Green has been highly successful in documenting and marketing the internationally competitive (comparatively small) carbon footprint of Irish milk production. 
Meanwhile, Teagasc’s Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) has identified a further 9-15% of reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture that could be realised over the next decade, and Ireland’s permanent pastures and hedgerows maintain huge stores of carbon in mineral soils. 
Furthermore, improved scientific understanding of methane’s contribution to long-term climate warming mean that emissions of this gas (60% of agricultural GHG emissions) need “only” be reduced by around 50% globally to stabilise the climate. 
So, in terms of relative GHG efficiency, Irish milk production scores well, and this fact has been used to justify plans for continued expansion of the sector. But how does this rosy perspective fare when looking ahead to the target for a climate-neutral economy by 2050 — or indeed to the more immediate target of a 51% reduction in national GHG emissions by 2030 contained within the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill?
A question of balance 
The first thing to note is that both the 51% national target for 2030 and the climate neutrality target for 2050 relate to absolute emissions. Whilst the average carbon footprint of Irish milk production has decreased by approximately 10% over the past decade, national milk output has risen by almost 50%, and overall agricultural emissions have increased by 12% to 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually (33% of Ireland’s overall emissions). 
A visualisation of the SeQUEsTER project, identifying pathways towards carbon neutrality in Ireland’s agriculture and land use sector. As well as his role in UL, Dr David Styles also leads the SeQUEsTER project.
Whilst past climate action has focused on reducing carbon footprints through efficiency measures, the climate emergency has focused governments, companies and investors on the need for dramatic cuts in absolute GHG emissions at corporate and national level, necessitating a focus on activity levels as well as carbon footprints. 
So, what could this mean for Irish dairy farmers? In essence, it comes down to a shift away from a sole focus on efficiency, to consideration of balance across the wider agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector….
Ambitious land management Achieving climate neutrality by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement will require the AFOLU sector to be a net sink of CO2. Despite huge carbon storage within Ireland’s soils, forestry and land use together actually emit over 3 million tonnes CO2 net annually because of low forest cover (11% of land), exploited peat bogs and drainage of around 350 kha of organic soils under grassland. Climate neutrality in Ireland will therefore necessitate huge action in the AFOLU sector. 
Between 0.6 and 1.1 million hectares of grassland will need to be either rewetted (to tackle 9 million tonnes CO2 emitted annually from exploited bogs and organic soils) or planted with trees (to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere). Some of these activities may need to occur on dairy grassland, in particular to deliver biodiversity and water quality co-benefits. 
And the success of these activities in reducing and offsetting emissions will determine the sustainable ceiling for future dairy activity. For example, each kg of nitrous oxide emitted (from fertiliser use, manure management & grazing animals) incurs 260-300 times more warming than one kg of CO2. 
Even under an ambitious scenario for 2050 where emissions of nitrous oxide are reduced by 50%, and over 250 kha of drained organic soils are rewetted, over half a million hectares of new forest would need to be planted to ensure that AFOLU emissions of nitrous oxide and CO2 are offset.
 Despite some uncertainty around the magnitude of emissions from land use, it is clear that sustainable dairy expansion is contingent on: 
(i) a substantial reduction in the suckler-beef herd (partially replaced by fattening the one-third of dairy calves currently exported); 
(ii) dramatically improving farm nitrogen balances, driving down nitrous oxide emissions by 50% or more; 
(iii) rewetting at least 250 kha of organic soils by 2050; (iv) initiation of an ambitious forest planting programme within the next 5 years, with planting rates of at least 20 kha per year sustained through to 2050. 
Thinking ahead to climate neutrality, therefore, requires much higher levels of ambition than currently outlined in the Agricultural MACC or AgClimatise, but also presents opportunities for diversification. 
For example, renewable energy generation with anaerobic digesters, and provision of ecosystem services (including carbon offsetting), biomaterials and bioenergy from a mix of forestry and perennial crops. 
Opportunities will manifest as CO2 credit prices rise, but orderly transitions delivering multifunctional outcomes will require coherent and proactive national land use planning.
A fair share of methane 
The aforementioned land use GHG balance excludes methane on the assumption that separate targets will be set for emissions of this gas in future, in recognition of its short lifetime in the atmosphere. 
Global methane budgets compatible with climate stabilisation require cuts of 24-47% relative to 2010 emissions (in Ireland, emissions have increased by 14% since 2010).
 A recent study has explored how the global methane budget could be downscaled to national “quotas” for four example countries (Brazil, France, India and Ireland) based on alternative approaches: equal percentage reductions across countries; equal per capita emissions; emission reductions proportionate to GDP; emissions proportionate to animal protein production in 2010. 
Ireland’s “fair share” of methane emissions in 2050 implied cuts of between 30% and 79% relative to 2010 emissions. Whilst reductions in livestock production were necessary to comply with quotas, planting trees on land spared from livestock production could ensure that Ireland and Brazil remain significant milk and beef exporters whilst achieving territorial climate neutrality — helping to feed countries such as India that cannot simultaneously achieve food security and climate neutrality (based on current diets).
An urgent need for balanced and coherent guidance
 In conclusion, Ireland’s dairy sector is comparatively efficient, and there’s no doubt that Irish dairy farmers will contribute to global food security for decades to come. 
However, there are inherent limits to the scale of this contribution. Sustainable dairy production will require coordinated action across the AFOLU sector to ensure that GHG emissions and removals are in balance nationally by 2050. 
National and corporate climate neutrality targets mean that “green” marketing of Ireland’s agri-food products will need to incorporate a comprehensive plan for climate neutrality in order to retain credibility. 
A coherent and balanced AFOLU policy is urgently needed to augment dairy farmers’ admirable efficiency drive, steering the sector towards sustainable outcomes and reducing the risk of disorderly contraction in the future.

The auction will take place at GVM’s city-centre offices on 25/26 Glentworth Street in Limerick at 3pm on Thursday, October 21, with an online auction going ahead simultaneously.
According to selling agent Tom Crosse, this holding is “truly exceptional”, located on the main road that links Hospital with Limerick City. It is between the N20 and N24, approximately 20km southeast of the city centre.
The residence is a three-bedroom bungalow in good condition throughout.
“It’s in a good location too,” says Tom. “That would be strong farming country… There’s been a lot of interest in it so far – land is going very well.” The land quality, in the main, is good according to the selling agents. It is well laid out in easily managed divisions. It’s well watered and fenced and is ideal for beef, dairying or equestrian use – all of which sectors are well represented locally.
There is a good range of outbuildings with the farm. These include a three-column hay barn with lean-to, a cattle crush, a machinery shed and numerous additional ancillary out-offices.
The residence is a three-bedroom bungalow in good condition throughout. Accommodation includes a hall, sitting room, living room, kitchen, bathroom and three bedrooms. It features oil-fired central heating and double-glazed UPVC windows.
“The bungalow is about 30 years old,” says Tom. “It needs a bit of renovation work but in sound condition.” Ordinarily, one might expect such a property to be divided into two lots – one with the land and yard and the other with the house but the layout isn’t conducive to such subdivision. The house will add value to the holding, however, as an asset that one could rent out or live in.
Those wishing to attend the auction in person must pre-register with the agents. Anyone wishing to make online bids, meanwhile (at the online auction on lslauctions.com), will have to register at least three days before the auction date and pay a bidding deposit.
The price expectation is in the region of €650,000. At €10,300 per acre, it would certainly appear to represent strong value for money. But, as always with an auction, the real value of the property will be revealed on the day."

Ray Ryan, journalist.
Most dictionaries define resilience as the ability to withstand adversity and bounce back from difficult life events and challenges.
Dairy farmers in Ireland are the classic examples of being able to recover quickly from setbacks and adapt new ways to tackle problems.
It is a characteristic inherited from their ancestor Stone Age farmers who began to till the soil with primitive tools at the Ceide Fields on the boggy coast of north Mayo some 5,000 years ago. 
The most recent evidence of that resilience was seen during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic when they ensured an unbroken supply of milk and dairy products to supermarkets, shops, and the foodservice sector.
It was the same resilience that helped dairy farmers over the centuries to survive the vagaries of the weather, the impact of wars and revolutions, land agitation and economic upheaval.
They have coped with changing methods of farming, membership of the European Union, market volatility, and the growth and development of their industry including the merger of local creameries into agri-business companies with a global reach.

Farmers adapted to the introduction of the mowing machine, the arrival of the tractor and the milking parlour, the transition to livestock marts from street fairs and in more recent times the use of space-age technology, robotic milking, and internet tools.
They have used knowledge and education to negotiate through their lobby groups with co-ops, Government agencies, and the EU on the changing directions in agricultural policy including the abolition of milk quotas and their re-introduction 31 years later.
Dairy farmers have especially faced the impact of fluctuating global markets, many of them arising from geo-political developments, cyclical milk prices, and periodic surges in animal diseases such as BSE and foot and mouth.
And now they and the rest of the world are confronted with the greatest and most challenging of all issues, climate change, which threatens civilisation itself with intense drought, storms, heatwaves, rising sea levels, wildfires, melting glaciers, and warming oceans.
A global response is underway to tackle the crisis, with plans and targets set for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Ireland is now on a legally binding path to net-Zero emissions no later than 2050, and to a 51% reduction in emissions by the end of this decade.
Agriculture and transport are highest emitters in Ireland. But all sectors of the economy have a role to play on the journey to carbon neutrality.
Farmers, who are already taking many positive steps to make their farms more sustainable, maintain they are being unfairly singled out in the debate on how to achieve the reduction targets for their sector.
A farmer delivers the milk to Barryroe Creamery in 1961. 
Environmental, climate and other interests believe that Ireland needs to reduce the size of its national cattle herd to lower methane emissions if it wants to meet its obligations on tackling global warming.
But the agri-sector insists that changed methods of farming, science and new technologies can reduce emissions while maintaining the national herd.
The dairy industry increased milk output by 60% since 2015, supports up to 60,000 people directly and indirectly and exported dairy products valued €5.1 billion to some 143 countries, underpinning the national economy and rural communities.
But the expansion of the sector has created many challenges, not least in terms of Ireland’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve water quality and increase biodiversity.
The rise in milk output was associated with an increase in the number of dairy cows in an industry that processes in the region of eight billion litres of milk from some 1.5 million cows, across 30 sites.
It aims to be a global leader in the development of a high-value, environmentally sustainable dairy industry based on extensive grass-based dairy system.
The debate on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is taking place against a background of Brexit, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the ongoing threat of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Teagasc says the Irish dairy industry has been the fastest-growing dairy sector in the EU over the last 10-years, but these achievements have occurred alongside growing environmental pressures concerning agricultural emissions, reduced water quality and biodiversity loss.
“Given the ambitious national environmental targets that have been adopted, the dairy industry needs to operate farming systems that are sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms.
“There is, therefore, an urgent requirement for dairy farmers to adopt new technologies and manage their farming system to minimise its impact on climate change, water and air quality and biodiversity,” it said.

Jerry Long, president of the co-ops national umbrella body, ICOS, agreed the sector is faced with significant and ongoing challenges in how to ensure it can deliver on its shared responsibilities to the environment, while continuing to feed tens of millions of people with safe, affordable, nutrient-dense foods.
“I’m fearful of the current narrative around clamping down on agriculture and food production in Ireland. Whilst this might seem like a simple and attractive notion to some in Government circles, it would be disastrous for rural Ireland, and would do nothing for the environment.
“Simply offshoring food production to South America or similar territory would result in significantly greater total emissions, whilst killing the one true indigenous industry.
“We all accept that we can’t have limitless expansion in the dairy sector; but we need to develop a model that provides for steady organic growth for existing units, with the capacity to allow for a healthy influx of new entrants,” he said.
Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue recently stressed that agriculture has a critically important social, economic, and environmental value to Ireland.
“As an industry, farming has a history of embracing change and a shared desire to leave the farmed environment in a better condition for the next generation,” he said.
His predecessor Michael Creed is also on record as saying that Ireland’s food producers and farmers have a tremendous reputation internationally in terms of the sustainability of the food and drink that they produce.
“It is a reputation we can be justifiable proud of. With a growing global demand for food and a rapidly evolving marketplace seeking confirmation of our sustainability credential, farmers have engaged proactively in recent years in improving the carbon footprint of our produce,” he said.
Mr Creed said the Government plan set an ambitious target for agriculture that is challenging. It requires the industry to innovate and increase the delivery of solutions to both enhancing productivity and reducing emissions.
“I have no doubt that the sector once again will rise to this challenge and reduce emissions so that Ireland remains a world leader in sustainable climate-smart food production.
“Irish farmers are innovative, resilient, and committed to working together to find solutions in the face of this enormous challenge.
“As custodians of the land they are already committed to sustainability, and this commitment will ensure a vibrant rural economy for generations to come,” he said.
Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association president Pat McCormack said recently that farmers are going to struggle to see the point of curtailing production of dairy and beef — “in which we certainly are amongst the most sustainable in the world — only to see that slack picked up and transferred to other producers that are notably behind us already.”.
However, the 2020 Climate Action Advisory Council report warned that with the policies and measures envisaged under the Climate Action Plan, the projections for the sector to 2040 show limited progress towards emissions reduction.
It recommended that the role of farmers in the management of carbon stocks be acknowledged and that they should be incentivised to adopt measurable and verifiable practices that sequester carbon.
In a statement last May, five key stakeholder organisations in the dairy sector came together to issue a joint commitment on climate action.
Dairy Industry Ireland, the Irish Cooperative Organisation Society, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA), the Irish Farmers’ Association and Macra na Feirme set out 17 principles in relation to climate action.
They detailed the major contribution of the sector to the economy, its ongoing sustainability, its commitment to climate action, and the various initiatives required to support the sector.

And they also called for “an end to the divisive, unhelpful and damaging public debate on climate change and agriculture”.
“The recent expansion of dairy production has reduced the carbon footprint of Irish milk and through the adoption of the Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) measures, a further sustained reduction in the carbon footprint of the Irish dairy sector will be achieved.
“We emphasise the competitive advantage of Ireland’s grass-based production system and the low carbon footprint of the Irish dairy sector based on international comparisons.
The unique system is based on the sustainable conversion of grazed pasture into high-value dairy products, which attract a premium on world markets due to providence, and sustainability of the production chain.
“We vigorously defend the legitimate rights of farm families to profitably pursue milk production in a sustainable manner and warn against the unintended consequences of actions that will undermine the cost competitiveness of the Irish dairy sector.
“Restricting milk production from Ireland will increase global emissions; the introduction of policies that facilitate this to happen will increase climate change,” the stakeholders stressed.
The statement went on: “Mindful of the existing low carbon footprint of the Irish dairy sector, we support an approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture and dairy sector based on the world-class research and advice provided by Teagasc.
We call for increased levels of funding to support new research and the adoption of technologies to drive mitigation in agriculture. We call for an urgent review into the assessment of biogenic methane emissions and the accounting of carbon sequestration in national inventories.” The stakeholders pointed to the considerable actions undertaken by the dairy sector to demonstrate leadership in environmental sustainability and its commitment to further actions in this regard.
They stated that the dairy industry should be given the opportunity and time to address the climate change challenge and to demonstrate its potential to be climate neutral by 2050.
“This will involve increased understanding and knowledge of the potential of carbon sequestration and its interaction with management as well as the impact of short-lived greenhouse gases (methane).
This combined with the aggressive technology adoption at farm level should lead to an agricultural industry being climate neutral,” the statement added."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40719123.html,2021-10-12 13:25:00,Beef Price Report: Processors feel that they have the scope to tighten prices,"It is another 'steady as she goes' week on the beef front at the processors, at least on the surface, as the flow of cattle shows very little change.
Beneath the surface, however, there are slight signs of a tightening by the processors of their rein on conceding higher prices to get the stock with more of the plants reported to be pulling back on paying above their quoted prices this week.
It is an indication that they are feeling a bit more comfortable with the supply flow and that pulling the prices closer to the actual quotes will not affect the intake, given the time of the year.
While finishers have had an expensive year with rising input costs, current beef prices are well ahead of expectations which is a compensatory factor and the factory bosses feel that they have the scope to tighten a shade.
It means that more of the steers are expected to be bought at the quoted base of 415 cents/kg this week. The evidence on the ground is that the finishers are finding it more difficult to get to 420 cents/kg which had been paid for a percentage of the stock last week.
The same policy appears to apply to the trade for heifers with more of the supply expected to be bought on the quoted base of 420 cents/kg and a harder challenge to get the 425 cents/kg which was available in recent weeks.
The young bulls continue to hold their base of 415 cents/kg for R grade, on par with the steers. Cows are also continuing strong at up to 390 cents/kg for the quality R grade cows, which is unchanged from recent weeks.
There was very little change in the intake at the processors for last week with the supply almost on par with the corresponding week last year.
The kill amounted to 35,968 head compared to 35,627 head in 2020. There was a close comparison with the 2020 supply across all categories. Last week the steers accounted for 17,191 head of the kill, which was slightly up on the 16,889 head in 2020, with heifers also slightly higher at 9,970 head compared to 9,444 for last year.
There were 1,332 young bulls supplied last week and 1,379 for the same week last year. The cow intake last week was slightly lower than last year at 6,919 compared to 7,274.
So where does that leave the overall year to date balance compared to 2020?
Well, year to date the overall supply is down by 70,434 head at a total of 1,287,211 head.
This pattern is expected to continue to the end of the year and with market demand for beef remaining strong it should be adequate to maintain producers in a strong position to expect the firm trade to continue."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40719801.html,2021-10-13 08:00:00,Cattle Advice: Great grazing conditions continue,"Cattle outdoors for a while yet, hopefully
This year has had its ups and downs with regard to grazing conditions, but at least the backend of the year has been kind so far. The ideal grazing conditions of September and October have been a great bonus for livestock producers as it will hopefully reduce winter silage requirements and pressure on slurry stores. Underfoot conditions are generally excellent, with minimal damage to ground and excellent graze outs.
Growth has continued to be good over recent weeks. At this time of year, we start looking at close-off dates, depending on stocking rate, demand and land type. It may be the case that you will get one more grazing from paddocks that you may have planned not to. Undoubtedly growth has been fantastic, but you really must look to next spring at this stage. Are animals performing as you require from Late October grass and what grass will you have left for turnout in the spring?
Thankfully, all have plenty of fodder saved for the winter and there is no need to stretch the grazing season beyond necessary. Grazing too late or damaging ground will not help to achieve optimum animal performance before housing. It will also result in there not being sufficient grass available to get animals out early next spring if weather conditions allowed.
Animal Performance from grass in October and beyond
Weanlings that remain out, unless they are being supplemented with concentrates and/or quality forage are unlikely to be achieving growth targets. This is more of an issue if these are heifers you intend on breeding to calve down next autumn or even spring 2023. These heifers need to be growing well and in a positive energy status in order to reach sexual maturity and begin cycling well in advance of the breeding season. For bulls or bullocks you intend on selling next spring any reduced weight gain now will significantly lower your sale price. Spring calves still with cows are benefiting hugely from a good quality creep feed as the power has gone out of grass and cows milk volume has dropped significantly as they near drying off.
Autumn Calving Sucklers 
Try to keep cows rearing calves on the best quality grass possible as this will help maintain cow milk yield and quality while also improving her ability to return to cycling. Forcing these cows to graze very tight is not ideal at this time of year as grass is low in Dry Matter and energy, keep them on good covers. As nights get colder it is critical that Magnesium supplementation is done right with an ample supply of licks for the number of cows in the group. One bucket per 20 cows.
Grazing heavy covers and setting ground up for 2022 Silage
If your farm is lightly stocked then you can afford to graze on as demand will not be very high in the spring. However, if you are heavily stocked at turn out next spring then you really need to consider housing some stock relatively soon. Obviously, it is better to graze off any heavy covers in order to ensure sward quality next spring. If you are exclusively grazing silage fields then that is a different story as next year’s crop will benefit from being grazed tight in the backend of the year. In fact, it is evident that those who graze silage ground tightly in November without doing damage rather than grazing it in the spring, tend to produce an excellent first cut each year. This is down to being able to take a much earlier cut as the ground will all have been grazed tight before the new year.
Cull Cows 
There are plenty of culls being fed at the moment from both beef and dairy herds.
The key with these is to get them fit for slaughter by early December. Unlike young cattle which are often still growing while being finished, cull cows have fully grown.
This means that once you supply the energy they require for maintenance all extra energy will go towards laying down meat and fat. An intensive feeding period is advised for culls to achieve optimum performance and return. Cull diets do not require a lot of protein but the energy density should be high in order to get a good finish and acceptable fat cover. The big question is, will fleshy culls do better in the factory or the mart these days. Keep an eye on local trends in this regard before deciding which route to go."

With Tom Crosse of GVM Auctioneers holding the gavel, the auction will take place at 3pm on Wednesday the 20th of October at the GVM’s central Limerick offices on Glentworth Street.
This property consists of a mixture of parcels of land – some of excellent quality and some of lesser-grade quality, with most of the interest in the stronger parcels.
Lot 1 consists of 6.1 acres near the village of Robertstown. It is excellent quality pasture laid out in two fields and with frontage onto two public roads. The price guide is €10,000/acre.
Lot 2 is also excellent quality land and also in the vicinity of Robertstown. It consists of 21.5 acres, laid out in easily-managed divisions, well-watered and fenced. It has some ancillary sheds and is well suited for beef, dairying or equestrian use, according to the selling agents. The price guide is €10,000/acre.
Lot 4 at Shanagolden, Co Limerick. Part of a 55-acre holdingup for auction.
Lots 3 comprises a 5.2-acre land holding at Shanagolden Demesne. It’s located on the periphery of Shanagolden village – also a few kilometres south of Foynes and the Shannon Estuary. This may have long-term development potential, being adjacent to the village and its amenities. The price guide is €25,000 (€4,800/acre).
Lot 4 consists of 21.7 acres of mixed-quality land at Monemohill, Shanid. The property includes a derelict farmhouse and some ancillary sheds. The agent describes it as an ideal grazing farm or one which could be used for planting. The price guide is €100,000 (€4,600/acre).
Lot 5 is a two-bedroom bungalow on circa 0.45 acres. Accommodation includes a hall, sitting room, main bathroom and two bedrooms. It has oil-fired central heating and appears to be in good condition throughout. The price guide is €95,000.
All lots are being offered individually and will not be offered collectively, Tom points out. Interested bidders can turn up on the day with their deposit cheque, ensuring to be on time to pre-register.
Alternatively, interested parties can bid online. For this, they need to log on at lslauctions.com and register their interest with GVM (as well as supplying a bidding deposit) at least three days in advance of the auction."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40724751.html,2021-10-19 16:20:00,Beef Trade: Static intake levels means prices remain unchanged from previous weeks,"The beef trade at the factories continues 'steady as she goes' with both the finishers and the processors continuing to hold their ground.
With the intake of cattle at the plants remaining stable, the prices are also continuing in the same mode, unchanged from the level of recent weeks.
The processor continues to quote a base of 415 cents/kg for the steers. The only change in the situation is that the factories are sticking more tightly to their quoted price and making it a hard sell to get extra this week with only the exceptional good customer or large supplier reported to be capable of getting the base to 420 cents/kg.
It is a similar situation for the heifers. They are on a base of 420 cents/kg with the factory agents sticking as close as possible to their quoted price. There is reported to be some slight room for wriggle on the price with larger supplies of quality heifers.
The young bulls continue a stong trade with prices on par with the equivalent grade steer on 415 cents/kg for R's, while the quality R grade cows are making up to 390 cents/kg The improvement in the weather, which delivered Summer-like conditions in many parts of the country during the past week, is proving a valuable asset to the orderly movement of finished cattle to the factories.
There is no pressure on finishers to lighten stocking because of deteriorating ground conditions so far, which is a bonus at this time of the season. With the exceptionally mild weather, a late growth of grass has been reported from many parts of the country.
The close balance between demand for stock at the factories, to supply strong markets, and the steadiness of the intake for several weeks, has been a key factor in holding the price. An intake of 35,000 - 36,000 head/week leaves the processors with nothing more than a slight measure of comfort and no scope to pull on the price and risk stock being held back as a result.
On that front, 2021 has been an unusual year. This is not the first prolonged period of steady pricing this year, a feature which is most unusual in the beef sector. Of course it is highly beneficial for finishers to offer some degree of certainty. Indeed the sector could benefit from more of that pattern of trade.
The intake for last week was the highest year to date at 36,577 head compared to intake slightly shy of 36,000 for the previous week. Overall intake as well as the categories were close to the same week in 2020.
There was 17,007 steers, 10,115 heifers, 1,711 young bulls and 7,258 cows in the supply, which year to date is now running at 71,000 head, less than for the corresponding period in 2020."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40725363.html,2021-10-20 12:15:00,37-acre residential holding in South Tipperary already under offer,"A 37-acre residential holding near the village of Holycross in South Tipperary is another good example of the kind of property that appeals strongly to those in the farming and non-farming sectors.
The farm in question is in the townland of Clohoge, 2.5km east of Holycross, just under 6km from Horse-and-Jockey and 7km south of Thurles.
This part of South Tipperary is renowned for its quality Golden Vale grassland, which is always under strong demand from the strong mixture of dairying, beef cattle and equestrian interests. In this case, the presence of the house – derelict though it is – has opened it up to demand from an even wider variety of interests, as Aidan O’Dwyer of selling agents Sherry Fitzgerald O’Dwyer and Davern explains:
“We’ve had a lot of enquiries from ‘ex-Tipperary’ residents currently living in places like Cork of Dublin who are looking for an opportunity re-locate back home,” says Aidan.
The attractive large traditional-style farmhouse was built possibly towards the end of the 19th century and is in a derelict condition. It is set approximately 100 metres off the public road in an equally attractive location, accessed via a gated entrance.
“The house is essentially a guaranteed planning permission and some people who have come to look at it have been looking at it in that context,” says Aidan.
The land has approximately 600 metres of road frontage and is perfect for any farming activity, according to Aidan. Of the 44 acres, approximately 37 could be described as top quality land, with some of the lower areas away from the road lessening in quality.
“You’ve an exceptional amount of road frontage,” says Aidan, “with the first 150-200 metres of land in from the road being exceptionally good. As you go back from the road, it goes down to a river and gets a bit ‘colder’ as you go inwards but it’s all good summer land.” All things considered, the price guide of €375,000 (€10,100/acre) might seem a little conservative.
It’s no surprise, then, to learn that there is already an offer on the table close around the asking price."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsandculture/arid-40727988.html,2021-10-23 20:00:00,Book review: John Bruton gets to grips with 'highly readable' Albert Reynolds biography,"Albert Reynolds was born in Rooskey Co Roscommon. His father, John Reynolds was a coachbuilder/carpenter and farmer. The family do not appear to have been particularly active in politics.
Albert, the youngest of the family, did not have a taste for farm work and went to boarding school in Summerhill College in Sligo.
His mother, Catherine, would have liked him to become a bank official, and obtained an opportunity for him to sit the bank exam. The exam consisted of two papers with an interval between them. After completing the first paper, Albert looked around among the other examinees, and thought they looked to be already part of a clique of which he had no wish to be part.
So, on the spur of the moment, he got up and left, without sitting the second paper. He had apparently done well in the first paper, so he was turning his back on what could have been a secure career.
He then worked in a variety of clerical jobs, including with CIE, before launching himself on what was to prove to be an outstandingly successful business and political career.
This episode of the bank exam illustrates aspects of Albert Reynolds character which were to be manifest in his later public life.
He was socially sensitive to perceived exclusion from real or imaginary cliques. But he had the courage to back his own instinct and make a quick decision, on a hunch. Some of these decisions turned out badly most turned out well.
Albert Reynolds would not have had the temperament to be a careful banker, working within a strict decision making hierarchy, that was the way Irish banks worked in the 1950’s and 1960’s!
His social sensitivity made him a difficult colleague. This was especially so for his coalition partners, Des O Malley and Dick Spring, both of whom came from a more established political and professional background. This sensitivity, combined with a “take it or leave it” attitude, also led to take court cases against business partners and newspapers that might have been avoided.

On the other hand, his capacity for quick decision making, helped him to success in fields as diverse as newspaper proprietorship and petfood manufacturing, and when he went into politics, in modernizing the Irish telephone network, and establishing the National Treasury Management Agency.
But his over confidence also led to bad decisions. One was the allocation of disproportionate amounts of export credit insurance to one beef exporter, at the expense of the taxpayer, and of other competitors. He made some of these bad decisions at meetings, where no officials were present to record what happened. That was poor administrative practice for which he was to pay a price.
His tolerance of risk taking did, however lead him to back the Hume/ Adams dialogue with the IRA, and simultaneously to reach out personally to the Loyalist paramilitaries. His “take it or leave it” approach helped him secure the agreement with John Major of the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993.
The Downing Street Declaration was, to my mind, the outstanding achievement of Albert Reynolds’ career This Declaration said that there must be a “permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence”. It confirmed that, on that basis, democratically mandated parties, with an established a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods, would be free to participate in talks on the future. The Declaration provided and incentive for the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires.
This peace process was hugely beneficial, and we are enjoying these benefits of it to this day. But it came with downsides, some of which are not often explored.
It gave a measure of retrospective political legitimation to armed republicanism, and to the appalling terror it had imposed, and political respectability to its political off shoots. It blurred the line between constitutional and armed republicanism, to the eventual disadvantage of both Fianna Fail and the SDLP.
Albert Reynolds’ habit of agreeing things orally at meetings, where no record was kept, caused problems for those who had to take up where he left off, when he ceased to be Taoiseach.
This book says that Albert Reynold claimed, afterwards, that he and John Major had agreed that Sinn Fein would be included in talks, after just six months of non violence, and without any move towards putting any of their weaponry beyond use and that he had conveyed this to Sinn Fein. This is doubtful. The author does not test this claim.
Albert Reynolds, Risktaker for Peace by Conor Lenihan
When I took over from Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach, I was provided with no record of any such assurance having been agreed, or given to Sinn Fein.
For a Taoiseach to give such an assurance would , in any event, have been deeply problematic in view of the clear words of our Constitution which say that “no military or armed force, other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas, shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever”.
No head of a sovereign government should connive in the retention of arms by a private army. That would go against a basic principle of democratic government.
A political party that is associated with a private military force is not a normal political party.
Albert Reynolds’ relationship with Charles Haughey is explored, and the various heaves within Fianna Fail are described, with all the attention to colourful detail of a political connoisseur.
The fall of Albert Reynolds’ government over the appointment of Harry Whelehan to the High Court seems to have been the culmination of a series of slights, miscommunications, and misunderstandings. Taking the decision to appoint the President of the High Court at a cabinet meeting, where the Ministers of one of the parties in government had left the room, was a fatal error. The “take it or leave it” approach over reached itself.
Valuable lessons, on how to manage coalitions, were learned from these mistakes by successor governments This is a highly readable biography.
It draws on Conor Lenihan’s personal recollections of working with Albert Reynolds. It uses previously published biographies of Mr Reynolds and others, and interviews with contemporaries (including this writer).
It is difficult to say how much of the material in the book is original, in the sense of not having been published before.
Although it is a sympathetic biography, the author does not seem to have had sought access to Mr Reynolds private papers, or to any other archival material. For example, the various drafts, from different sources, that led to the Downing Street Declaration, and the precise clarifications of it sought by Sinn Fein, are not quoted or analysed.
So the story told is incomplete. It relies on fallible memories rather than written evidence . While many readers will already be familiar with the broad outline of Albert Reynolds career, Conor Lenihan brings it all to life very well.

The intake in recent weeks steadied at a point that was within the comfort zone for the processors to relieve any pressure to source cattle. But the kill of around 36,000 head per week was not secure enough to allow for a price cut and take the risk of producers opting to hold back finished cattle.
Instead, as mentioned a week ago, the safest route to take was a tightening in the margin over officially quoted prices being paid for stock, which was running at up to 5 cents/kg for the good suppliers and larger numbers.
The buzzword on the ground this week is that the factory agents have been told to stick to the quoted prices which the processors feel they can achieve and retain intake around the current level.
The calendar shows that we're into November on Monday which means that the start of the pre-Christmas kill is just around the corner and the plants will be sourcing the first of the cattle for a peak retail season immediately.
Given the current balance between supply and demand, it is a reasonably safe that the base price should be secure to the end of the year. That will achieve a remarkable Autumn season for finishers during which the prices held stronger and steadier than anyone could have predicted.
While there are rarely two seasons, which are similar on pattern and price, both the Summer and Autumn 2021 have been one of the better for finishers to leave some reasonable margin to offset their rising costs.
So it is a steady trade again this week with the steers on a base of 415 cents/kg, but without a top-up to any extent. It is a similar pattern for the heifers which continue on a base of 420 cents/kg.
The young bulls are continuing at, or very close to, the steer price for the equivalent grade with most of the R's being bought at 415 cents/kg for this week.
There appears to be a slight easing in demand for high numbers of cows and the prices for the poorer grading animals have been eased, while prices are maintained for the quality cows.
It is the time of the year when the culls from the dairy sector hit the market and an increase in poorly finished cows has not been welcomed. The good R grade cows continue to hit 390 cents/kg at the top end, with O grade ranging 350-370 cents/kg and plained P grade back to around 335-340 cents/kg.
The intake for last week reached 37,043 head which, although the highest for the Autumn, was about 700 head short of the same week in 2020.
The steers at 16,812 head was lower than last year by 800 head, while the intake of heifers at 10,604 head was up almost 1,000 head on last year. The cows accounted for 6,934 head, compared to 8,155 head last year and there was 2,147 young bulls."

Next to Ann Keane and a report on the sale of bullocks at Ennis mart on Friday.
“We had a smaller sale of bullocks on Friday with just short of 600 cattle on offer.
“Again, large numbers of 550kgs upwards.
“The quality stores and beef type bullocks held a very strong trade but the lighter lots and the slightly lesser quality would be back by about €30 to €40 on the week.
“Demand from the North still holding very positive.”
And looking back to Thursday’s sale of heifers, dry cows and aged bulls at the same mart Ann added,
“We saw a slightly smaller sale on Thursday with just over 500 on offer.
“The trade for fleshed stock still very strong in both cull cows and heifers.
“A smaller entry of aged bulls averaged €1.72/kg with a top call of €1,830 for a 970kg Limousin bull”

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40735275.html,2021-11-02 13:14:00,Beef Market Report: Prices likely to hold steady to the end of the year,"Beef processors and producers are each closely watching each other's movements as the trade edges into the final weeks of a remarkable year.
Most importantly the trade for beef animals continues steadily on both the supply and price fronts with little indication of any pending change to the end of 2021. The intake continues strong and the prices remain steady.
The procurement of animals to supply the pre-Christmas market is now getting underway, most of which will be completed within the next three weeks. It is a crucial point of the year for processors to secure cattle and it has often been an opportune time for suppliers to get some added benefit from the demand.
Right now the processors are reasonably content with the intake at the factories. While there is no sign of any glut, and the peak weekly supply for 2021 is not going to reach the level of previous years, both sides will be reasonably happy for a 'steady as she goes' ending to the year.
The factory bosses have tightened their rein on paying much over the official quotes, but they know that cutting the base price is an option now. On the other side, their suppliers, are having a year ending, which is beyond their expectations and would find it hard to complain on that front this year.
It has been a very expensive year for all farm production. Input costs have rocketed. At least product prices have been the strongest ever to offset the surge in outlay.
Processors entered 2021 with the pending impact of Brexit impossible to predict and fears for weaker market demand. Demand for beef has continued very strong with returns from the export markets much better than had been feared.
The indications are that factory intake will be back by a bit more than 100,000 head year on year. It had been forecast to drop by up to 120,000 head. Returns to producers have had an exceptional year and thoughts are now turning to where the trade will be for the Spring months of 2022 in an environment that is becoming less certain forward.
The intake for last week, a four-day working week with the October Bank Holiday on Monday, continued strong at 33,955 head, showing that the kill per day was increased to compensate.
There were 15,117 steers, 9,149 heifers, 6,839 cows and 1,422 young bulls.
The base for steers remains unchanged at 415 cents/kg with agents under orders to stick to the quoted price. Heifers are generally on a base of 420 cents/kg with an increase this week on the percentage reported to be dealing at a base of 425 cents/kg.
The young bulls are generally on the same base as the steers at 415 cents/kg for R grade, while the cow prices have eased slightly. It is more difficult this week to get 390 cents/kg for R grade cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40735458.html,2021-11-02 16:06:00,€1.9 million sought for South Tipperary farm holding,"A large holding in South Tipperary is always going to get the market to sit up and notice, and so it should be for a 124-acre non-residential farm for sale jointly with two Clonmel-based auctioneers – REA Stokes & Quirke and PF Quirke & Co.
The property is in the townland of Sladagh, 3.5km south of Fethard, 9km north of Clonmel and roughly equidistant (20km) from both Cahir and Cashel. With road frontage on both its northern and western boundaries, the access to the property couldn’t be better and the quality of the land is difficult to match, making this a rare jewel in this part of the world.
“It’s all laid out in one block,” says John Stokes of REA Stokes & Quirke, “with frontage onto two roads in a great location.""
""The land is in very good condition. It would have been in tillage, historically, but some of it is in grass now as well.” Of the 124 acres, there are approximately 85 acres under tillage at the moment, with the remainder in grass. There’s a potent mixture of farming activities in South Tipperary, which will all suit this holding. With strong beef cattle, dairying and tillage sectors adding to the international bloodstock interests locally, there’s something for everyone in this large farm.
“It’s very hard to get a block of land like that all together,” says John. “You’ve some good farmers in the area so, please God, it will sell well. There are a few people enquiring after it already and it’s only just on the market.” 
The property comes with a range of outbuildings that, while old, still have some value to offer to the next owner, according to the selling agent. Gathered around a large concrete traditional-style yard, they include a five-span, open-sided roll-top hay barn with a 5-span lean-to structure attached with concrete floors and cattle pens. There is also a three-span, roll-top, hay barn with stables attached, as well as a range of older stone buildings and the ruins of an old farmhouse.
“The buildings that are on it are old but serviceable,” says John, pointing out that it’s the land which is the real draw. “It’s good dry land,” he says.
The price guide of €1,900,000 (€15,000/acre) seems about right for this exceptional farm."

According to the selling agent Jim O’Brien of CCM’s Mitchelstown office, this is a piece of land in a part of the world where there are a lot of dairy farmers, as well as beef cattle farmers. Added to that is the magnetic draw that West Cork holds. It’s located in Scrahane, 5km from Enniskeane village and 11km west of Bandon.
“It’s very well sheltered land,” says Jim. “There might be a small section of it needing attention on the southern side of the property but other than that, it’s very good quality land.” 
According to Jim, there have been several enquiries, although no offers have arrived yet at the time of writing. The interest, he says, is from local sources as well as from farther afield. This is unsurprising as there would be plenty of local progressive farmers in the area. After that, this part of West Cork is well known for its consistently strong prices over the last number of years so a relatively modest-sized holding such as this one is sure to attract the attention of those looking to buy as an investment.
The asking price of €400,000 (just over €10k/acre) would appear to be quite a modest one, giving the location and the land quality.
“We’re taking into account that there is a small bit of woodland in the corner and a few bits of rock on the southern side,” explains Jim, “but we’d expect it to make more.”"

Leo Varadkar said, however, that the Government cannot argue against the deal in a bid to protect Ireland's beef farmers from competition with Brazilian beef.
Mr Varadkar told RTÉ radio's Morning Ireland that the Climate Action Plan gives ""certainty"" to farmers but said there was ""misinformation"" being spread about the trade deal.
""A lot of misinformation being put out about this, particularly by the main opposition party, that agreement has not been ratified. And this government, and as the Minister of Trade by the way, this government said that we will not sign up to that agreement and we won't ratify it or vote for it, because we're not satisfied with the environmental protections.
""And we're not alone in that - France is with us on that, Austria and other countries. But for me to make that argument credibly in Brussels, and I will make that argument credibly in Brussels and in Geneva and other places that I go, we need to pull our socks up environmentally. 
We can't say that we're against ratifying that agreement, because we want to protect our own farmers - that won't wash.
""We have to say that we're against ratifying that agreement, because the environmental standards in Brazil aren't high enough, but we have to do better to be credible.""
Mr Varadkar said that the Climate Plan published yesterday will take some time to implement.
“Is it going to take a generation to make the changes we need? Yes, but we're going to do the heavy lifting in the next 10 years.”
The planned changes, especially in the area of energy production, made economic sense and would mean a more secure supply at a better price, he said.
“We’re halfway to where we need to be,” he added.

Measures in place to protect Irish farmers' interests in Mercosur Trade Agreement "
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-40738194.html,2021-11-06 02:00:00,Herd mentality: What is the national herd and why does it matter?,"To cut or not to cut — that’s the question that has obsessed politicians and farmers alike in recent months as our carbon emissions come under the spotlight.
In the climate change numbers game, the focus on farming — one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland — has been on the size of the national herd, or the overall numbers of cows in the country.
The maths are simple and crude — cut the numbers, and you cut the emissions. Fewer cows and sheep mean less methane gas — one of the most potent greenhouse gases.
But it’s not that simple. While methane is around 28 times as damaging as CO2, it is a short-lived gas that dissipates after around 12 years, a fraction of the 1,000 years CO2 takes to break down.
The challenge in reducing methane is that it is a natural byproduct of how cattle digest forage, making it is difficult to reduce its production without also reducing agricultural productivity.
Rumen fermentation, the process by which cattle digest their food, accounts for up to 57.5% of Ireland’s methane emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, with 95% this expelled through the mouth in the form of burps — you can guess where the other 5% is emitted from.
Because of its reliance on pasture-based livestock farms, some models have suggested that Irish agriculture would need to cull as many as 1.3m cattle to reach net-zero.
However, it’s also an issue farmers would like to overcome, as methane production is thought to sap up as much as 12% of the nutrient energy a cow eats — energy that would otherwise be used to produce meat and milk.
That means that finding a way to reduce this volume of methane produced by livestock would lower input costs, and therefore, improve the bottom line — if you’ll excuse the pun.
Cop26
The scale of the problem was hammered home at this week’s Cop26 conference, with the Global Methane Pledge calling for a 30% reduction in international methane levels by 2030 compared to 2020 levels.
Methane has a 25 times greater heating impact in our atmosphere than carbon, and concentration levels have increased more than 150% in the last decade. But it is also a “short-lived” gas, meaning any meaningful reduction of methane in the atmosphere will have direct impacts on global warming.
Much like the term “national population”, the term “national herd” simply refers to the total number of cattle in the State (sheep would be considered part of the “national flock”). However, the phrase has not always been used in this way, which may explain some of the confusion.

The term first appears in Dáil Éireann records in 1939, when the then-minister for agriculture responded to a question on the use of unlicenced bulls in privately owned herds. In this context, the term is used to mean all the cattle in Ireland.
“Since the putting into operation of the Live Stock Breeding Act, proceedings were instituted by the department in 336 cases,” said James Ryan. “In 306 cases convictions were obtained, and in nine other cases the defendants were dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act.
“I am satisfied that bulls that would bring about deterioration in the national herds are no longer used; but as the standard can be raised only gradually, some time must necessarily elapse before all the bulls licensed are such as will result in a marked improvement in livestock generally. A definite improvement in this matter has, however, been already secured as a result of the administration of the act.”
In Britain, the term can be traced back in official records as far as 1882, when, in a parliamentary paper, HM Jenkins, one of the assistant commissioners the secretary of the Royal Commission of Agriculture, reports on a mission to France and refers to the “national herd of shorthorns” bred at Haras du Pins in Normandy, a state-owned stud farm.
Racing fans will know the site today is synonymous with thoroughbred horses. However, it is also home to the National Institute for Agricultural Research and its herd of 1,000 cattle.
It appears that, in this context, the “national herd” refers to state-owned cattle.
However, in later references in the 20th century, the term repeatedly acts as a collective for all the cattle in a country, both privately owned and state-owned, and is referred to repeatedly in official documents in England, Scotland, and Ireland.
Discussions surrounding cuts to the number of cows in Ireland have become extremely emotive, as farmers warn that fewer cows will mean less meat or milk. As this is what farmers are paid for, they warn that reducing current sizes will make farms unviable.
However, it’s important to note that farmers are already essentially limited in the number of stock they can keep based on nitrates loading requirements, which means they must have access to enough land to spread their livestock’s slurry on without overloading the soil.
Ireland’s 6.9m cattle are mainly owned by individual family farms — with 111,300 livestock farms in the country, putting the average herd at 62 cattle. You can break that down further by sector, which puts the average beef herd at just 14 animals, while dairy herds tend to be larger, with an average of 80.
The State does own some cattle, mainly those at the State-owned Teagasc sites, which are used for research and education purposes. However, the vast majority of cattle in Ireland are privately owned.
There has been a lot of discussion about changes to cow numbers — the number of dairy cows in Ireland has increased, however, the overall number of cattle has stayed relatively stable.
The national dairy herd grew by 118,500 cattle in the last year, while beef cattle numbers fell by 40,473 over the same period.
Shift from beef to dairy
Many farmers have shifted from beef to dairy in recent years, as it is seen as the most profitable of the livestock sectors, especially during the beef crisis of 2019-2020 when prices crashed below the cost of production.
Cork has the most dairy cows; it’s home to around a quarter of the total herd, or 388,831.
The figure is over 200,000 more than the number of dairy cows in Tipperary, which ranks second highest, and is even higher than the number of dairy cows in the whole of Northern Ireland, where the Department of Agriculture (DAERA) states that 247,000 dairy cows are registered.
Generally, the term “national herd” is used by governments
to compare international agricultural statistics. However, some farmers believe it distances talk of cutting livestock numbers in the country from the effects that would have on the family farms.
Irish Farmers’ Association deputy president Brian Rushe, who runs a dairy farm in North Co Kildare, is among those who object to the term.
Rushe said he feels the term “national herd” has been “weaponised” within the last year.
“When you hear the term ‘national herd’ in the media, it has always got negative connotations,” he said.
There’s this notion of this mythical herd of an even million cattle sweeping across the country like locusts, that’s the connotation that it gives.
“It has become a negative term. To me, there is no such thing as a ‘national herd’. I’m a herd owner.
""I rely on my herd of cows to provide me a living and to cover my costs
of production.
“Each herd of cows belongs to an individual family, and that could be a farmer with 10 cattle or a farmer with 500 cattle on the other end of the extreme.
Farmers march in protest in Roscommon town last month. Picture: Finbarr O’Rourke
“The size of the cattle population in Ireland ebbs and flows, depending on what policy decisions are made and what commodity prices are like.
“When people talk about cutting the national herd, it’s an easy way of sanitising what is a very serious and worrying issue for Irish farmers.
“What they are really saying is taking away a farming family’s ability to make a living from what they are doing.
“There’s a reason there are cattle there — they are not there are pets or as a hobby. We care about our animals, they are our ultimate responsibility; but that’s what it’s used to sanitise — the culling of those animals.”
The Government insists there are other ways of reducing the impact of cows and farms without having to cut herd numbers.
It says that the early calving and early slaughter of livestock will go a long way to reducing carbon emissions by between 22% and 30% in the sector.
To some, the sector has gotten off lightly, with other sectors hit with far more ‘ambitious’ targets. However, farming lobbies claim the sector is being unfairly victimised.
However, with hot air on both sides, it’s a waiting game to see if the numbers eventually stack up.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40741476.html,2021-11-10 17:11:00,Rising to the challenge: How dairy farmers are building more sustainable enterprises,"You’d think the bigwigs in Agriculture House could use a few other letters of the alphabet when coming up with new acronyms.
Farmers have always been expected to wear many hats but now add to the list two “caps” — whatever could be confusing about that?
CAP, referring to the EU’s Common Agriculture Policy, has of course long been a fixture of Irish rural vernacular, but now add to the list the Climate Action Plan, with the same acronym, which is the title given to the Irish Government’s new road map for reducing agri-food emissions by 22%-30% within the next decade.
The plan will require every farmer in Ireland to adopt several practices from a menu of measures designed to bolster carbon sequestration, improve biodiversity and reduce emissions.
Vanessa Kiely O’Connor, who runs a 65-cow dairy herd along with her husband, realises the importance of sustainability more than most; when she’s not in wellies on the farm, she’s been busy studying a diploma in environmental science and social policy at UCC and is already carrying out most of the measures outlined in the plan.
Ms Kiely O’Connor already runs fairly tight block-calving from January through to March, and based out in heavenly West Cork, she has only just brought the cows inside full-time a few days ago, having had them out at grass since January 21.
Water quality and overcoming the challenges of changeable weather is a key concern for dairy farmers. File Pic: Larry Cummins
“I call West Cork the ‘dairy capital of Ireland’ because it’s what we do best — our geography and our grass growing ability here make it very easy for us to have our cows out longer — we can almost get 300 days a year bar weather issues.
“I farm as a business and have to think about what my customers want — what does my processor and the people who market my produce want. What we have is a sustainably marketed product by putting in the effort to have the best image you can have as a farmer.
“I’m a smaller scale farmer, so efficiency has always been a priority and doing the best with what I have.”
Kiely O’Connor said she first became interested in her farm’s carbon footprint and finding ways to lower it in 2016, when her daughter calculated the farm’s efficiency as part of a university project researching the sustainability of Irish dairy herds.
Since then, the family has managed reduce the herd's carbon footprint by 15% in five years by increasing its Economic Breeding Index, a measure of productivity per animal.
“In 2016, we would have had milk solids 401kg per cow, and by 2020 it’s up to 505kg, and that’s mainly by working on our breeding.”
Changes implemented over the last few years have also included improving soil fertility to boost grass growth and ensuring that every blade of grass is used to its full potential.
“I try to keep the farming system I have simple: The cows eat grass and clover, and if I can provide what they need, I have less dependency on ration,” Kiely O’Connor said.
“I’ve learned how to carry out grass measuring and improve grass utilisation. For example, my Bord Bia audit will show that 96% of the diet of my cows here is grass now.”
As a result, she has been to reduce bought-in feed for her stock — a big saving when prices are currently soaring.
Vanessa Kiely O’Connor, who runs a 65-cow dairy herd along with her husband is already carrying out most of the measures outlined in the plan.
“We have also reduced the calving interval,” she said. “I focus on my bulls more and now I almost pick out a bull for each cow to breed the best replacement. I just select my best cows for breeding and all the others, even though they might fill the jar, if they don’t show the quality needed on the milk records and they don’t have the longevity in EBI I breed them to beef instead. And I never pick a bull which is listed as a ‘minus’ for any health traits.
“I look at them like they are family and am always looking at how I can improve things for the next generation. I do the best for my kids and I do the best for my cows.”
Even though she does not finish the calves herself, Kiely O’Connor uses the dairy beef index to breed more efficient beef animals out of cows whose progeny are not destined to join the dairy herd, a practice that has environmental benefits for other parts of the food chain.
Most importantly for the business, embracing better efficiency has also improved the farm’s profitability.
“My cows were producing lots of milk and milk solids but when I looked what I was making in terms of cents per litre, I wasn’t making the same as the top 25% of my co-op,” she said.
“The milk that was going through had all the butterfat and protein there, but there was more water having to go through too — so the cows were producing a lot of milk, and at the end of the year it looked like she was great, but I was getting paid for my butterfat and protein so that was where my focus came in.”
Improving the solids content of milk also has wider environmental benefits as it means less water needs to be skimmed off at the processing plant and also reduces the environmental impact of transportation.
She also feels that limits on the organic output per cow against annual milk yield, which have previously been suggested by the Department, would negatively impact low-output herds which produce high milk solids most.
However, despite her ambitions to make her farm as green as possible, Kiely O’Connor said it had not been without its challenges.
She had to take out a five-year loan with the credit union to fund the purchase of a trailing shoe slurry tanker, once the requirement for Low Emission Spreading Equipment came into force.
“We have been able to cut down on fertiliser use this year, but I haven’t had the same level of growth as what I would have had with it, but I was able to take on extra land, which meant I wasn’t overextended in terms of grass,” she said.
Although she already sows paddocks with clover, said she would like to see more research carried out on mixed-species awards and how they can help reduce chemical fertiliser use, as well as better and more targetted support for some of the changes required.
“The herd is still in progress, but I am doing everything that’s asked of me, and I’m quite confident I’m up to the task,” she added.
Meanwhile, based out in north Co Kildare, Brian Rushe runs a much larger, more intensive dairy enterprise, but still makes three main environmental areas —emissions, water quality and biodiversity loss — a priority for his business.
Rushe is a new entrant to dairy, having made the move from beef and tillage in 2013.
“Our focus is maintaining our level of income by reducing our environmental footprint all the time,” he said.
“...The way we are managing our land has changed; we would have traditionally cut back our hedgerows annually, but now I take a different move; I do around one third a year, so a hedgerow will only get down once every three years. I’m more aware of the impact of that on biodiversity. I’m more aware of the impact of how managing my soils and looking after my soils and my grassland better can help to sequester carbon, but also help to reduce nitrogen fertiliser use.
“We have looked at ways to reduce fertiliser use on the farm through the use of legumes as part of our swards - and that’s not just because input prices are as high as they are at the moment.”
As well as using red and white clover on his farm, Rushe also recently paid to get the carbon content of his soils analysed — something he hopes to monitor and improve over the next few years.
Water quality and overcoming the challenges of changeable weather is a key concern for Mr Rushe too, and as a result, he has started to fence out wider from watercourses and repair riparian margins on his land.
“It has business benefits too, because the higher the organic matter of the soil, the better resilience to drought and better soil fertility.
“We have invested in extra slurry storage above what is legally required - and a lot of other farmers have done this too. It means we have more scope and flexibility around when we spread, in case of inclement weather,” he said.
“We have also purchased Low Emission Slurry Spreading Equipment, which has been quite expensive, but has helped reduce our ammonia emissions, and use protected urea. Then we have also been focusing on the amount of livestock on the farm — by building a more fertile herd, it reduces the amount of livestock we need.”
It’s a sentiment felt across the wider industry. “Three or four years ago, the conversation in a discussion group would all be about how to up production and become more efficient,” he said. “Now the discussion is by and large, the environment and what are we going to do about reducing our impact. Farmers are mad for it. There is a lot at stake. For me it’s really exciting being a farmer at the moment — it’s like relearning a lot of what you know.”"

Cork Airport may have been out of action for the past few months (and fortunately, for just one more week!) but overnight stays at Dublin Airport hotels remain very much a travel mainstay for non-capital dwellers. So what are the current options? As I embarked on my first international flight in almost two years earlier this month, I checked out the newest of them all, the Holiday Inn Dublin Airport, to see if it’s worth the overnight.
First Impressions
Every airport hotel is only as good as its location, and preferably that location is within a jet engine bellow of the terminals (a sound-proofed bellow, that is). The Holiday Inn fares pretty well here in that respect, being located just off the M50/M1 interchange and just across the road from my reigning favourite airport hotel (the Clayton). I arrive here by car, opting to avail of the hotel’s very own long-stay car park plus its handy bus shuttle service to the airport. The hotel actually sits the very same distance from the airport as the official long term blue car park, so a 10-minute scoot should get you door to door.
Ireland’s first purpose-built offering from the chain, Dublin Airport Holiday Inn just opened this summer, and outside it does have that fresh, if almost clinical, new-build look. But once inside, the hotel offers a surprise, funky interior in an explosion of rainbow colour pops. The hotel’s official press brief refers to a design ode to 1950s Americana but it all feels more Scandi than Route 66. But in a good sense. Beyond the minimal reception desk area lies its trademark open lobby with lounges and sofa nooks all spruced with bright furnishing, funky lighting fixtures, and so much texture and candy colour, I imagine kids would have a field day exploring here. 
Elsewhere, gallery collages pepper the walls, all localised with colourful Dublin prints from James Joyce to cheeky 'what’s the craic?' quotes. It’s all highly curated but even as one of the chain’s 1,200 properties worldwide, I still manage to find a guest sense of place here.
Suite Talk
If you expect American chain hotels to have a cookie-cutter look, you’re in for a treat with the property's deceptively staggering 421 rooms. My room is pretty standard in size but it makes novel use of its space, not least with an L-shaped sofa which doubles up as a sleeping bed. Elsewhere there’s a cosy double, a work desk station, flat-screen TV and fridge and views of T2 on the horizon to whet the wanderlust. 
The bathroom is a compact, but attractive subway-tiled affair and as someone who is all too frequently flummoxed by hotel shower operations, I’m won over by the one-button switch! All in all, it’s a great base with no niggles — and with that colourful palette, I’m already in the holiday mood.

Food & Dining
I head downstairs for dinner in the bustling open lobby restaurant: the mood is lively, the lighting is vibrant and with the contemporary décor, the space almost has a luxury university cafeteria vibe. Menu options range from vegan burgers to the house favourite, daube of beef with fondant potatoes. 
And while many airport experiences can feel like fleece central, mains are reasonably priced from €13. Breakfast the next morning features a decent range of buffet and continental fare (if a lack of apparent gluten-free options) and I appreciate how the fruits and yoghurts are served in individual glass mason jars rather than the plastic containers which are so pervasive in these Covid times. 
Uniquely, the hotel also houses the novelty of its own Starbucks outlet — although it was closed until 11am on the morning I was checking out — no pumpkin spice latte for me.
Check-out?
This was my debut visit at the Holiday Inn but after a fantastic overnight stay, I definitely expect us to be travel buddies in future. Most noteworthy for the punter right now is that the hotel appears to be positioning itself among the stiff competition with rates currently from an excellent €89 per night. There are also decent parking and dining deals and it's worth checking out the chain’s Kids Stay & Eat Free policy. All of these aspects could really take the heat off that extra night splurge so maybe allow your holiday to begin a night early?

The Clayton, Dublin Airport
Clayton Hotel, Dublin Airport
It may be the pre-holiday buzz but there’s always something about the atmosphere in The Clayton Dublin Airport that feels a little festive. Even in July. The four-star hotel offers classic but well-kitted rooms as well as having 1,500 car parking spaces — also available to travellers not looking to book accommodation. 
I always find the food, and in particular the service here, first class and the hotel offers three dining options; The Italian Kitchen restaurant, The Playwright Bar and the Red Bean Roastery Coffee Dock.

Maldron Hotel, Dublin Airport
I’ve had a mixed bag of luck with Maldron Hotel stays in Ireland this year. My stay at their Belfast City Centre was excellent while a room I recently booked at their Newlands Cross location was one of their pre-revamp rooms so a little disappointing by comparison. 
All of the rooms at their Dublin Airport hotel have been refurbed with the chain's trademark new grey and yellow look. And if proximity is a top criterion, the hotel bills itself as the closest hotel to Dublin Airport — at just 273m from T2. You can expect to pay a little more for the convenience with rates from €119;

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40745943.html,2021-11-17 07:33:00,Price increases unlikely to exceed grower's higher input costs,"Teagasc has warned some horticultural growers are considering cutting back on production for 2022 to manage their cash flow or minimise exposure to high costs.
It follows a significant rise in production input costs this year, mostly due to external macroeconomic factors.
Analysis by Teagasc Horticulture Development Department suggests input cost increases will, in many cases, exceed grower margins.
It predicted growers will be unable to absorb the rising costs, without an increase in what they are paid for their produce.
Dermot Callaghan, head of the department, said it is likely to lead to a significant reduction or cessation of both early and late season production in glasshouses.
Andy Whelton, Teagasc Horticulture Advisor added: “The horticultural sector is exposed to several input price increases, chief among them labour, packaging, and fertiliser.
“The impact on overall costs of production is very significant, particularly for crops that need to be harvested and graded by hand,” he said.
Irish horticultural producers provide local, fresh, top-quality produce and plant material to the retail market.
The diverse sector, with a farm gate value €477m is the fourth largest sector after dairy, beef and pigs in terms of gross output value.
It covers plant, and food horticulture, which includes mushrooms, potatoes, field vegetables, soft fruit, protected crops, and outdoor fruit.
Teagasc reports that considerable volatility remains as primary producers try to forward plan business for 2022 and manage cash flows.
In an environment where cost planning is difficult, it says the risk is increasing significantly for primary producers.
Across all enterprises, there has been a sharp increase in the cost of labour, packaging materials, fertiliser, energy, peat-based growing media, and a myriad of other inputs.
Total input costs have increased by between 10.5% and 17.7% depending on enterprise type, it added.
Irish Farmers Association president Tim Cullinan recently claimed the difficulty in sourcing peat was the final nail in the coffin for many horticultural operators.
“If action is not taken immediately, this Government will ultimately be responsible for the demise of this sustainable sector,” he said.
Housing, Local Government and Heritage Minister Darragh O’Brien, replying to Dail questions last week, said the final report of the chairman of the Independent Working Group, Dr Munoo Prasad, set up to review the use of peat moss in horticulture, which he received on October 20, is being considered and will be brought to Cabinet in due course.
The IFA has meanwhile welcomed comments by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar that there was no viable alternative to peat for the horticulture sector and that the Government needed to find a solution to the issue.
Horticulture chairman Paul Brophy said the importation of peat will increase the environmental footprint of Irish growers while placing them at a severe competitive disadvantage.
Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue this week voiced his concern on the matter at Monday's Agri-fish Council in Brussels.
Minister McConalogue said: ""I am concerned about the negative developments in the fertiliser market and the rising costs of other inputs.
""Producers are facing significant input price increases in fuel, fertilisers, feed and energy, which will put margins under significant pressure if they are sustained over time. We need to examine all relevant factors, including the issue of anti-dumping duties on fertilisers."""

Kanturk mart next and mart manager, Seamus O’Keeffe
“Kanturk Mart was a hive of activity again on Tuesday with a trade similar to last week. We saw plenty of demand for feeding and finished cattle.
“Last Saturday we held a suckler sale of 5 star Limousin Sucklers. These were top class animals from the Coisceim Herd of Mr. James O’ Connor with lots making €2500 to €3600.”

Next we will look at a sale of interest for dairy farmers, the sale of dairy stock at Kilkenny mart on Monday.
Mart manager George Candler reported “A steady trade for most dairy stock, with the main
sector of the catalogue taken up by in calf animals calving January to mid April 2022.”
Freshly calved Friesian cows made from €1120 to €1700 per head.
Freshly calved Friesian heifers sold from €1100 to €1600 per head.
In calf Friesian heifers sold from €1050 to €1480 per head.
Maiden heifers made from €650 to €720 per head. Kilkenny mart on Monday had 80 dairy stock on offer.
And looking back to last Thursday’s general cattle sale at Kilkenny mart, George reported.
“A smaller sale of cattle today in Kilkenny on Thursday but a much sharper trade
for beef bullocks and forward stores, especially continentals. Quality Friesian bullocks made up to €2.12 per kilo. Heifers peaked at €1690 for a 700 kilo Limousin.
“Cull cows met a good firm trade especially for quality lots.”
The mart had 840 cattle on offer at Kilkenny.

These are crucial weeks for all of the processors to ensure that a steady flow of cattle continues to flow through their gates to meet orders for one of their busiest periods of the year.
The markets for beef are particularly strong this year with good consumer demand from both supermarkets and export markets, while the supply of cattle is back on 2020.
Currently, both the producers and processors are walking a tight line. Neither are keen to concede any ground on price and so it is largely a “steady as she goes” situation continuing at the factories.
The quoted prices are unchanged. Steers continue to be quoted at a base of 415c/kg. In general, very little more is available, except for large supplies or where a particular processing centre is under pressure to get the stock.
Heifers are on a base of 420c/kg. There is some latitude to get a few cents per kilo more for heifers in deals with the factories, but generally the processors are trying to hold fort on the price as much as possible, to guard against any overheating of the trade at a crucial time.
Adding in the quality assurance bonus payment, the return to producers is leaving a better margin than for many years, while those with Angus or Hereford cross animals can qualify for the additional breed bonus, all adding up to a good return this year.
The combination of tighter supply, coupled with strong market demand has moved the balance pendulum in favour of the producers enough to keep pressure on the processor against their usual seasonal price reduction for the autumn months.
The young bulls are continuing on price parity with the steers on a base of 415c/kg for R grade, while R grade cows are maintaining at 385c/kg.
Year-to-date intake at the factories is down by over 72,000 head on the same period in 2020 and currently running at around 2,000 head/week behind last year. It now looks that supply for the year will be back in the region of 82,000-84,000 head which is considerably less than had been predicted.
The supply for last week slipped to 36,870 head, which was 1,800 fewer than in 2020. All categories, with the exception of the young bulls, were down on last year. The young bulls were almost 500 head higher than in 2020 and may be balancing out for the drop in steers.
The year to date figures show a decline in all categories.
The biggest drop has been in the supply of heifers which is down by 29,000 on last year. The steers and young bulls are both lower by 11,000 head each, while intake of bulls has dropped by 6,000 head.
Fewer cows were also supplied for the year, with the intake dropping by 10,000 head reflecting the decline in the suckler sector and fewer cows being culled in the dairy herds than in previous years.
At the same time, it is likely that more steers and heifers were supplied at younger ages to take advantage of the stronger prices over the autumn months of this year, which can have a carry-over effect on supplies in 2022."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/food/arid-40746156.html,2021-11-18 11:50:00,"With spiced beef shortages a possibility, here's how to make your own this Christmas","Tom Durcan has raised the alarm about potential shortages of spiced beef this Christmas, citing availability of product, price rises and lack of staff as indicators that it might be hard for us to get our hands on the prize unless we order early. 
Luckily, Eoin O’Mahony of O’Mahony’s Butchers in the English Market says it's entirely possible to make your own spiced beef just remember to start making it at least one week before December 25.
“You can recreate the flavour aroma of Cork Spiced Beef abroad by using a blend of spices and brown sugar,” Eoin says.
“Spiced beef is traditionally made with cured brisket or topside of beef and the predominant flavour comes from ground pimento, also known as allspice. Brisket has fallen out of favour in recent years and topside has become the norm. If you are feeling very adventurous, you can make spiced ox tongue which is still very popular at our stall in the English Market.
“You will need a piece of corned beef to begin with. A 1kg joint will comfortably feed six people for one sitting. Corned beef is often called salt beef abroad. Try to get this from a butcher if at all possible. Do not make with uncured beef as the end result will lack colour and flavour.
“Many butchers in Cork have their own recipes, mine uses another four spices but these are not strictly necessary when making at home,” Eoin adds.

Angel Delight
The 1970s was the era of tinned fruit cocktail and sugar sandwiches, so when Angel Delight came along it brought a touch of class to midweek desserts. A powder whisked with milk and set in the fridge to form a light mousse, it came in classic flavours like strawberry, banana, butterscotch and chocolate. Some of the more ambitious but less popular flavours were tea, popcorn and bubblegum.
Nothing angelic about those.
Anything Goes
Co-presenter Aonghus McAnally gets more than he bargained for when Mary splatters an egg across his forehead in Anything Goes. Picture: RTÉ archives
Keen to tap into the youth audience, RTÉ launched its first Saturday morning children’s programme in 1980, and it ran for six years. Fronted by Aonghus McAnally, Mary Fitzgerald, Kathy Parke and Dave Heffernan, it was a mix of chat, make and do, pop videos and interviews with the likes of U2 and Thin Lizzy, with a studio full of adorably unpredictable children. The end credits signalled the beginning of wall-to-wall sports coverage — and parents yelling at their kids to stop wasting the day and go out and get some fresh air.
The Beast from the East

On February 22, 2018, Anticyclone Hartmut, originating from an Arctic outbreak, hit Ireland, bringing with it unusually low temperatures and extremely heavy snowfall. Nicknamed the Beast from the East, the storm was so bad that many roads were inaccessible and schools and businesses across the country were forced to close. To make matters worse, wily shoppers stockpiled loaves of bread in anticipation of being snowed in, causing widespread shortages. Where to get a fresh sliced pan was the topic on everyone’s lips.
The Beatbox
The Beatbox
The Beatbox was a revolutionary simulcast — music videos broadcast simultaneously on RTÉ telly and radio from 11.30am to 1.30pm on a Sunday. Running from the late 1980s until 1995, it featured a range of presenters: Barry Lang, Simon Young, Peter Collins and Ian Dempsey. Viewers could call in to log their vote in the Battle of the Bands or send in actual postcards to win the lyrics quiz (with awesome prizes like all-too-cool ghetto blasters). The only dilemma was the timing: you had to dodge mass not to miss the start and get yer ma to put off the Sunday dinner till after 1.30pm (sure the roast beef would be ruined).
Callcards
'B*witched' and senior citizen Frank Flood pictured on a callcard.
First introduced by Telecom Éireann in 1988, Ireland’s phone cards could be used in payphones and came in denominations from 5 to 100 units, for £2–£16. There were 324 different designs issued between 1988 and 2006, featuring everything from the Rock of Cashel to Irish legends, Disney movies to Garth Brooks. Always handy to have one in the wallet when you needed collecting from the bus.
Calor Housewife of the Year
Calor Housewife of the year at the National Concert Hall, Dublin in 1995
This popular competition first went live on TV in 1982, with Gay Byrne as host, and ran until 1995.
Like a Rose of Tralee for the more mature woman, hopeful participants went head-to-head on their cookery, nurturing and basic household management skills, with a gas cooker as the top prize. The competition was eventually abandoned amid complaints that too many finalists were working outside the home. The cheek.
Diving Hero
Jim Warny at Shannon Airport. Pictre: Arthur Ellis.
In June 2018, the world was captivated by the story of the Thai boys’ soccer team caught in a flooded underground cave. When Co Clare man Jim Warny heard the news, he picked up the phone and offered his cave-diving skills to the rescue effort. Within forty-eight hours he was on a plane to Bangkok, and he was the diver that carried the team’s coach to safety on the third and final day of the rescue. What an absolute ledge.
‘Don’t Forget Your Shovel’
Released in 1985, this was Lilywhite Christy Moore’s first solo single after leaving the band Moving Hearts, and it spent seven weeks at No 1. Written by Christie Hennessy, it was a humorous take on the experience of the Irish on building sites in Britain, and the video followed Christy and his mates as they toil away, wearing nothing but jeans and sandals. Builder’s tan, ahoy!
Eurovision
Niamh Kavanagh, Eurovision Song contest winner in Millstreet 1993.
Ireland has won more Eurovision top spots than any other country, but four wins in five years in the 1990s was unbelievable, even for us. Linda Martin’s ‘Why Me?’ kicked off the run of good luck in 1992, followed swiftly by Niamh Kavanagh with ‘In Your Eyes’, then Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan and their ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Kids’, and finally Eimear Quinn’s ‘The Voice’ in 1996. When it comes to putting together a sweet melody, a catchy chorus and — what the hell — another rousing key change, Ireland truly is a world leader.
Féile
Feile ’90 at Semple Stadium. Picture: Eddie O’Hare
Long before Electric Picnic there was The Trip to Tipp. During the 1990s, thousands of teenagers and twentysomethings descended on Semple Stadium to see acts like The Stunning, Hothouse Flowers, The Cranberries and even The Prodigy live on stage. With so many unsupervised youths away from home for the first time, poor Thurles was left looking like the scene of a zombie apocalypse.
Floppy Disks
Young people nowadays, with their ‘clouds’ and their online transfers, look askance at the idea of a 3½ inch square plastic disk for conveying data. Clapping eyes on one of those good old 5¼inch floppies would really raise an eyebrow.
Green Shield Stamps
All the rage in the 1970s, Green Shield stamps were an offshoot of the British scheme, with a distribution centre they called ‘a modern Aladdin’s cave, magically transported to Clondalkin’.
Stamps were earned by spending at local shops and petrol stations, and kids often jostled for position to be the one to lick and stick the stamps — nice and straight, now. Looking through the glossy catalogues, hopes were high of getting enough stamps to bring home a TV (375 books full of 1,280 stamps each) or a washing machine (185 books), but — let’s face it — most of us had to settle for a set of mugs.
Hand of Henry

The blatant handball by French striker Thierry Henry during the second leg of the qualifiers that robbed Ireland of our rightful place in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Fans were so incensed that they even protested outside the French Embassy in Dublin. Never forgive, never forget.
Henri Hippo
Back in the 1980s, Ulster Bank knew the best way to get customers was to catch ’em young. Children who joined their junior savings club were the happy recipients of a Henri Hippo money box, as well as goodies like wallets and calendars. The character was resurrected in 2008, in a bid by Ulster Bank to get nostalgic parents to pass on the saving habit to their own children – but 2008 wasn’t really the best time to start investing anywhere. Least of all the banks.
‘I Useta Lover’
The Saw Doctors’ first hit, this 1990 single shot to No 1 and stayed there for nine weeks, becoming one of the best-selling Irish singles of all time. The folk-rock number captured the nation with its up-tempo beat and catchy lyrics about a crush on a mass-going, Concern-fasting gal a long, long time ago. Sure, we’ve all been there.
Junior Cert
The Junior Cert was first introduced as the successor to the Inter Cert for first years in 1989, with its inaugural exams taking place in 1992. Best test of someone’s age is which of them they sat: if you’re Inter and they’re Junior, they’re just not going to get your jokes.
Just a Minute Quiz
Larry Gogan. Picture: Collins/Dublin
The long-running radio quiz with the much-missed Larry Gogan gave us some comedy gold over the years, with panicked guesses from contestants up against the clock. From ‘F’ being the capital of France, to ‘Heil’ being Hitler’s first name, and the Taj Mahal being located ‘opposite the dental hospital’. Ah, they just didn’t suit you.
Kerrygold Ads
Back in the 1990s, when ads were like soap operas, we were all hooked on the Kerrygold saga. No one was quite sure what was going on, but one plot involved a woman cooking the dinner under the watchful eye of a French fisherman, and another a wistful Irish farmer selling a French woman a horse. But did hunky André put a bit of butter on the spuds? And just who did take the horse to France?
Kim & Kanye Honeymoon
Their marriage may not have stood the test of time, but it sure got off to a great start. Kimye flew into Cork Airport, stayed in a castle and went to the cinema in Portlaoise and Tullamore. Trip of a lifetime.
Line Dancing
A national obsession in 1990s Ireland, community halls and hotel function rooms were packed to the rafters with men and women hitting their heels and cowboy-shuffling across the floor. Even the likes of Colin Farrell got in on the act, with damning photographic evidence to prove it. Scary while it lasted, the moment passed and line dancing grapevined back to Middle America, where it belonged.
Mallow Airport
The Mexican jet plane taking off from Mallow Racecourse.
In 1983, a 15-seater Gulfstream jet was forced to make an unexpected landing at Mallow Racecourse. Captain Ruben Ocaña and his Mexican crew were stranded in the Cork town for 39 days while a makeshift runway was built, but the locals made them very welcome — even roping the captain into judging a local beauty contest. Ocaña returned the following year with his family. No emergency landing required that time.
‘Maniac 2000’

Bernard O'Shea picks 7 Christmas traditions that are uniquely Irish"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40751553.html,2021-11-24 10:01:00,"72-acre North Cork farm offers tempting value at €7,300 an acre","Located just 7km to the southeast of Banteer in North Cork, a 72-acre farm has just gone on the market with Mallow-based O’Connell Auctioneers.
The holding is in the townland of Glen North.
According to the selling agent John O’Connell, this is an attractive holding that contains a number of strong features that will attract a variety of potentially interested clients.
“There are 72 acres there, a three-bedroom bungalow and a slatted shed,” said Mr O’Connell.
“All the services are available and price-wise, we’re expecting something well in excess of €525,000.”
The yard at Glen North, Banteer.
At such a price (€7,300/acre) and considering what is on offer in the overall package, it should prove a very tempting farm.
The holding is an executor sale and it is going to be sold as one unit.
With two public roads running through the lands, there is potential for any future owners to split the property if they so wish, according to their needs.
The substantial amount of road frontage and its proximity to the R579 (immediately to the south of the farm) makes it a very convenient holding for use as an outside farm, for example.
Millstreet and Mallow are both around 18km from the farm, while the busy market town of Kanturk is 12km away and Cork City lies 40km to the southeast.
“There will be a lot of local interest,” added O’Connell. “The existence of the slatted shed is a big plus. You won’t get anything like that built for less than €100,000.”
The outbuildings include the three-column slatted shed and a three-column open shed with a central feed passage.
The property also benefits from entitlements that are currently worth just under €11,000 per annum.
“It’s a farm that has been farmed very well,” he emphasises.
“One that has been limed and manured and kept well over the years... there have been a lot of good cattle produced from it.”
The local farming scene favours grazing lands; being dominated by a mixture of dairy farming and beef cattle.
It’s also an area well known for having a good volume of progressive farming, being close to the cradle of the Irish cooperative movement. For this reason, one could easily see the quoted price expectation being well exceeded.
The future owner will have a number of options open to them, such as developing the dwelling and making use of the natural divisions within the property.
Perhaps even more likely, it will make a good outside holding for an expanding farmer.
Whatever happens, this is a sale that has the potential to be competitive and will be closely watched."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40757277.html,2021-11-25 12:16:00,Prices up 5c/kg as processors stock up for the pre-Christmas trade,"Suppliers of both steers and heifers have seen factory prices increase five cents/kg for this week's kill as the processors stock up for the pre-Christmas trade.
As the popular advertising slogan says ""every little helps"" the increase of €15-€20/head on the prime beef animals will strengthen further the return to suppliers this week, many of whom are describing it as ""hard got"".
Having firmly held the forte on price for the past number of weeks, the fear of further restrictions under Covid-19, with any new variant threatening to impact intake for the final slaughtering days before Christmas, has influenced processors to increase the prices.
The seasonal end of year tightening in the supply has kicked in and the factory bosses are hoping that the lift in price will be enough to keep the cattle supply flowing up to the Christmas break.
The extra five cents/kg has also been influenced by the competition for supply in the upper regions of the country and the widening in difference between prices on offer north and south of the border.
For most of the factories, the base for steers is now at 420 cents/kg with some deals reporting up to 425 cents/kg being achieved.
The pattern is similar for the heifers, which are now on a base price of 425-430 cents/kg.
Those prices generally rein across the southern half of the country. Moving closer to the border, the competition has got tougher for the processors trying to source prime beef animals.
Closer to the border with NI, the suppliers in Donegal are reporting a base of 440 cents/kg being the going rate for steers this week, while heifers are trading on a base of 445 cents/kg.
It now looks that the peak weekly supply for the year has passed, with some 5,000-6,000 head/week less than the top of recent years being recorded for 2021.
The intake for last week showed very little change at 35,534 head, which was 1,300 head less than the same week last year.
The supply of steers was back 1,200 head compared to 2020, at 13,151, while the heifers were down 600 head compared to last year. The intake of young bulls was up by 300 head at 3,019 head with the supply of cows showing a similar increase at 8,655 head.
Year-to-date the supply is back by 77,659 head on last year up to November 27.
The price on offer for the young bulls has increased to 420 cents/kg for R grade this week, but the cow prices are static at up to 385 cents/kg for Rs. The O grade cows are ranging 355-360 cents/kg and P grade are making from 345 cents/kg."

So we are 'off to Latin America' this week. I've played it a little safe with wines from Chile and Argentina but watch for the Garzon range from Uruguay also, their Tannat and Albariño have both appeared here. What inspired this column was a copy of the Latin American Cookbook by Virgilio Martínez (Phaidon €40) — a hugely interesting journey through the cuisines of Latin America.
I visited Brazil a few years ago and both Argentina and Chile in more recent times and I've eaten very well everywhere — so just as we match Touraine Goat's cheese with Sancerre you might find it useful to look to the cooking of Latin America to match its wines.
Mexico figures strongly, as you might expect, but Brazilian, Peruvian and Argentinian chefs have been hugely influential in recent years and you will find lots of classic recipes here from other Latinate countries. Chilean fish stews, Peruvian Ceviche and Ecuadorian Shrimp with Coconut Sauce will all match a Chilean Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc perfectly. At Ballymaloe LitFest a few years ago the Argentinian chef, Francis Mallman, rather wowed the crowds with his slow fired beef and lamb — a recipe for Stake Roasted Lamb sounds like the perfect holiday project if the weather turns milder and a fine match for Malbec or perhaps Bonarda.
Some of the local recipes have ingredients that may be difficult to find: Fried Guinea Pig (Peru), Large Bottomed Ants (Colombia) and Maguey Worm Tacos (Mexico) being some examples. But other recipes involve local twists on things we already know such as the wheat flour Johnny Cakes from Belize and Honduras made with coconut milk — perhaps for Stephen’s Day breakfast with a glass of fizz.
There are deals continuing in most of the online wine shops and larger retailers over the weekend. TheAllotment.ie has 15% off selected wines, O’Briens have a range of wines and spirits on offer including Red Breast Single Malt at an impressive €55. TheCorkscrew.ie has gadgets as well as wines in its sale including a top of the range blue Coravin wine extractor reduced from €349 to €199.
Selections this week are all reds from Chile and Argentina and perfect for matching Empanadas, Brazilian Beef Croquettes, Uruguayan beef and noodle stew or perhaps a Bolivian Steak Schnitzel.

Varietal wines are frequently what draws people to Chile but winemakers often show off their best skills with their blends and I’d like to see more of them. This is a mix of around 43% each of Cabernet and Syrah plus a little Petit Verdot and has big red and black fruit aromas and flavours mixed with touches of anise, eucalyptus and chocolate.

Carménère is a signature grape of Chile and as long as you don’t mind a little leafiness is worth a try as the best versions manage to mix black fruits with freshness. This is reduced from €16.50 in Dunnes for the season and has dark plum and blackcurrant aromas with tomato leaf and tobacco notes — bright and fruity with berry fruits and pleasing acidity and texture.

Catena Malbec 2015, Mendoza, Argentina — €19.95
Stockists: JJ O’Driscolls, O’Donovans, No. 21, Ardkeen, Vintry, NOffLA Independents.
This won the gold in the recent Gold Star Awards for best red under €20. From vineyards of approximately 1000m above sea level Catena are another favourite of mine. Deep dark red colour with lots of mineral tinged bright red and black fruit aromas and flavours with a pleasing spicy kick. Elegant and a restrained at 13.5% ABV.

Trapiche Terroir Series Finca ‘Ambrosia’ 2015, Uco Valley, Argentina — €39.95
Stockists: Martins.ie, Vintry, Redmonds, Independents.
This is one of the best Malbecs I’ve tasted all year and it is good to see a bit of age on a current release. Every year Trapiche picks three vineyards from more than 200 Uco Valley growers for this release and the 2015 has a black centre with aromas of forest floor, leather and mature fruits, inky and rich with dried figs on the finish. Worth seeking out.

Pyros Malbec, Appellation Pedernal Valley, Argentina — €23.99
Stockists: Bradleys, World Wide Wines, Vintry, O’Donovans, Independents.
Pyros is one of Argentina’s most reliable producers and has recently appointed a new young winemaker Paula Gonzáles. The Pedernal Valley is a unique limestone vineyard at 1,400 metres above sea level on poor alluvial soil so vines have to dig deep. Smoky ripe dark plum and blackcurrant aromas with softer blackberry fruits on the palate but with fine grip, finesse and concentration.
Whiskey of the Week
Kinsale Red Earl Irish Whiskey, 40% ABV, 70cl — €40
Kinsale Red Earl Irish Whiskey, 40% ABV, 70cl — €40
Stockists: 1601 Kinsale, Bradleys, SuperValu, Carry-Outs
Kinsale Spirit Company has hit the ground running. Plans for a distillery are afoot and already in their range they have three whiskies and a 21 botanical gin — watch for the Single Grain ‘Great Earl’ aged in Sangiovese Cask and the Single Malt ‘Spanish Earl’ in Stout Cask.
The Red Earl is named for Red Hugh O’Donnell, who fled Ireland after the Battle of Kinsale and is buried near Rioja — so, of course, this is finished in Rioja casks (following ageing in bourbon and sherry casks). Vanilla and light honey aromas with a hint of smoke and spice, more honey on the palate with red fruits coming through and a spicy finish.

Bishop Lucey Park has been transformed into a festive wonderland and the iconic 32-metre Ferris Wheel is back on the Grand Parade. Should it ever leave, we ask!
There's festive lighting and Christmas musical hits in Bishop Lucey Park featuring drummers, dancers, hoola-hoops, golden egg laying geese, splendid swans and … more birds than can probably fit in a pear tree. And the elves are busy working in Santa’s Pop-Up workshop here too.
Community groups, professional artists, actors and street entertainers — including Joan Denise Moriarty School of Dance, Salsa Cubana Cork, Amedie Mexican Dancers, Aatma: Indian Dance Troupe in Cork, and Cork Circus Factory — will bring the story of the Twelve Days of Christmas to life in the park.
Glow at Bishop Lucey Park
The switching on of Cork’s Christmas lights is when you really and truly know Christmas is here. While there couldn’t be a public event to mark the switching on of the lights this year (thanks Covid), Cork City Council has shared a video showcasing the illumination of Cork City Centre in all its sparkling Christmas glory and we have to say, we can’t help but feel the magic.

The start of the festivities is marked every year as the Holly Bough magazine hits news stands across the city. The publication has been a Cork Christmas tradition for over 120 years and features stories, songs, history, puzzles, festive food tips and the infamous Diffney quiz. This year’s cover features a red robin perched in front of South Gate Bridge with St Finbarr’s Cathedral in the background and is designed by local artist Keith Anderson.
3. Spiced beef in the English Market 
Butcher Tom Durcan, cuts some classic spiced beef at The English Market, Cork. Picture: Paul Sherwood
Turkey and ham are Christmas dinner in so many Irish homes, but in the Rebel county there’s a third meat that’s crucial to any festive feast: spiced beef. This Christmas delicacy can be picked up from a range of traders in the English Market or made at home up to two months in advance. Tom Durcan has raised the alarm about potential shortages of spiced beef this Christmas, citing availability of product, price rises and lack of staff as indicators that it might be hard for us to get our hands on the prize unless we order early, but luckily Eoin O’Mahony of O’Mahony’s Butchers has shared a simple recipe with us to make sure you don’t have to go without this Cork tradition this Christmas — just remember to start making it at least one week before December 25.
4. Christmas windows

5. S.H.A.R.E crib in Daunt Square 
The blessing and turning on of the lights of the SHARE Crib is a key moment in the run-up to Christmas on the Leeside. The evening marks the commencement of boys and girls taking to the street with bright yellow jackets and charity buckets to raise money to help elderly people live independently. This year the Cork charity, which was founded by school students in 1970, is asking Corkonians to help combat loneliness and isolation amongst the elderly this year with the simple request to 'Say Hello to Someone You Know'. Stay tuned for details of the construction of this year’s crib.

6. The Panto 
Nanny Nellie's Adventures in Pantoland at Cork Opera House
Oh yes, it is! The panto is a Christmas tradition among many rebel families and after a year without a live panto, we are more excited than ever to scream ‘he’s behind you!’ along with a packed-audience. Cork’s beloved Nanny Nellie will return to the Cork Opera House stage this Christmas for Nanny Nellie’s Adventures in Pantoland from December 10 to January 9. Cork's Everyman Theatre’s classic Christmas Panto will also return to the stage this year with Aladdin set to bring a whole new world of adventure to the festive season. The Everyman’s panto, in association with CADA Performing Arts Academy, will open on December 8 and run until January 15.

Geraldine Walsh of Clare Co-Op marts gave us the following report after the sale of bullocks on Friday at Ennis Mart.
“We had a fine sale of bullocks again on Friday with 450 on offer. The trade could only be described as strong.
“Quite a number of forward cattle available on the day, with some cattle being shown out of the shed also.
“Quite a number of Hereford and Aberdeen Angus bullocks available on Friday.”
And looking back to Thursday’s general sale of cattle at Ennis mart Geraldine added, “Numbers were back a small bit, especially in the heifer ring.
“However, the trade was very strong for heifers, and beef cows were in serious demand.
“Again about 60% of the 300 cows available were continentals and the balance were dairy culls.
“There were only 3 cull cows unsold on Thursday.
“We had a small entry of aged bulls, these averaged €1.80/kg.”

Prices paid for heifers, in particular, have strengthened by at least five cents/kg, while producers of Angus-cross animals are benefiting from an enhanced breed bonus of up to 25 cents/kg from the processors.
Such is the bounce in the markets for beef, that the demand for finished cattle at the factories is showing no signs of easing, although it is now past the point of slaughtering for pre-Christmas orders, with the festive season just two weeks away.
The best efforts of the processors to keep a tight rein on upward movement in prices has come under intense pressure in trying to balance between maintaining the intake without paying the extra to get the stock.

It is widely reported from the marts over the past week that agents for some of the factories have been very active at the ringside of the live sales competing for finished cattle and in many cases paying what appeared to be well above the factory price to get stock.
The base price being quoted for steers this week is 420 cents/kg.
A good percentage of the intake are making a base of 425 cents/kg and there are reports of choice lots and good suppliers of large number making 430 cents/kg.
The heifers are generally on a base of 425 cents/kg with most of the intake believed to be making 430 cents/kg and some deals at 435 cents/kg.
There are also several reports of the factory agents using bonus ‘sweeteners’ of flat pricing, subsidised transport, and easing of weight restrictions to get stock.
The breed bonus on Hereford and Angus cross animals is also strengthening with reports of some processors willing to pay 25 cents/kg breed bonus on Angus, which added to the strong base price plus quality assurance is giving a strong return to the finishers.
The young bulls are generally on prices par with the steers at 420 cents/kg to 425 cents/kg for R grade.
The cow prices have also regained a few cents/kg at some of the factories with R grade prices ranging 385 cents/kg to 390 cents/kg this week.
Supplies appear to be slightly tighter than previous years but remain fairly steady.
Intake for last week was almost on par with the week before at 35,355 head, which was 1,000 less than the corresponding week last year.
There were 11,959 steers, slightly lower than in 2020, while the heifers at 10,228 head were back 1,400 on last year.
The cows at 9,323 head was up 800 on 2020.
There were 3,291 young bulls in the kill. The total kill year to date is now down by 78,768 head on the same period last year.
The Livestock and Meat Commission in Northern Ireland reports that in the last week of November, steers made 403.9p/kg, heifers — 403.9p/kg, and young bulls — 387.9p/kg.
It compares with 422.3p/kg, 421.0p/kg, and 412.4p/kg in Britain, respectively."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40762230.html,2021-12-08 23:49:00,New beef forum cannot be another ‘missed opportunity’ to address core industry issues,"The establishment of a beef forum, as promised by Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue cannot be another “missed opportunity” and must address core issues in the beef sector, as farmers brace themselves for a very difficult 2022.
Almost exactly two years on from the first beef market taskforce meeting, the minister announced that it is to be wound up.
Set up after the beef sector agreement of September 15, 2019, which entered into force following factory protests over beef prices, the taskforce has met its end with 28 of the 38 actions in the agreement completed, two in progress, and the remaining eight ongoing.
Mr McConalogue, however, has said there is a need for the “continuation of stakeholder engagement”, and has outlined his intention to establish a strategic beef forum, a recommendation of the taskforce members.
Sinn Féin agriculture spokesman Matt Carthy said that the taskforce “was, in many ways, a missed opportunity” and a forum where matters affecting the beef sector can be discussed is important.
“I hope another forum will be established that will have a broader remit,” he said.
“I think [the taskforce’s] remit was too narrow in dealing with core issues which are essentially around the prices that farmers receive for their goods.”
The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association (ICSA) said that it appreciates the work that was carried out by the taskforce, which includes the commissioning of market transparency reports; input into the application for PGI status for ‘Irish Grass Fed Beef’; and the establishment of a Suckler Brand Development Oversight Group.
However, “lessons must be learnt” also from what the taskforce failed to achieve, it said. “The beef taskforce did not have the power to make meaningful changes.
“Crucially, it did not have the power to compel processors or retailers to co-operate with any of the independent reports it undertook,” the ICSA said.
ICSA beef chair Edmund Graham told the Irish Examiner that farmers “didn’t really get a fair hearing all along” during the existence of the taskforce.
Mr Graham said there is a need “to go back and address price transparency” and that he hoped to further engage with the minister on the introduction of a dedicated “red meat regulator”, as he remains sceptical of the effectiveness of other measures that are being implemented.
Unfair Trading Practices Regulations were introduced earlier this year in Ireland, in a bid to protect farmers and other weaker suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain against stronger buyers by prohibiting specific trading practices perceived to be unfair.
To oversee compliance with the regulations, the minister has established the Unfair Trading Practices Enforcement Authority which has the power to initiate and conduct investigations on its own initiative or on the basis of a complaint.
This authority has been introduced as an interim measure within the department, while the primary legislation to establish an Office of a National Food Ombudsman or equivalent is being finalised. However, Mr Graham fears this office, once established, will have limited powers.
“We need a strong, robust, independent regulator that will act on farmers’ behalf,” he said.
“We don’t exactly know what powers a red meat regulator would have, but what it should be in my eyes is an independent authority that could oversee all the dealings going on and make sure the primary producer, the farmer, is getting fair play, getting paid for his product, and not being overpowered.”
Mr Carthy echoed this sentiment, and suspects that the Government will be “minimalistic” in its approach to establishing the ombudsman.
“The very fact that we haven’t even yet seen the legislation for the ombudsman is concerning,” he said.
He also criticised the Unfair Trading Practices Directive being transposed into Irish law this year “by statutory instrument rather than primary legislation”.
“We need to have a regulator in place that will defend the position of farmers; they’re the most important element of the chain with regard to beef production, but they are the ones who continually take the hit every time there is volatility,” he said.
“We need to move towards a premiumisation model of prices where people who are producing the best quality foods are getting the best value in terms of the prices they receive and that means our suckler farmers in particular.
“We need a regulator that will ensure any distortions of the market are tackled very strongly, very early.”
Mr Graham said urgent action is needed with 2022 expected to be “a very, very difficult year”.
A new outlook report published this week by Teagasc predicts that even though cattle prices increased in 2021, incomes on most cattle farms are likely to be unchanged on the 2020 level, due to rising input prices and lower direct payments.
“Our input costs are going to cripple us,” Mr Graham said.
“If we don’t get a rise in the price of beef, it’s not financially viable, especially this time of year.
“Working off a grass-based system for the few months in the summer you could maybe achieve good weight gains, but when you have to go to the shed, all the extra costs with that, you would want a big price rise.”
However, Mr McConalogue said the new €150/cow Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme and progress on the PGI standard for Grass Fed Irish Beef were among the reasons for optimism.
“Ensuring there is a long-term, sustainable and viable future for our suckler and beef farmers is a key priority of mine as minister and I think the Beef Taskforce has played a key role.
“We must now build on that work over the time ahead,” he said."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/food/arid-40760796.html,2021-12-10 07:25:00,Wine with Leslie: Get turned on to Sauternes and other sweet wines,"Why do so many of us turn our noses up at sweet wines? You may not want one with your roast beef or pizza, but why not with dessert or cheese, or simply sipped on its own? Dessert wines often represent the best price-quality ratio in the wine world: they can age for decades, at this time of year their prices are lowest, and, remember, the good ones balance sweetness with acidity and freshness.
Almost all the ancient literature that mentions wine comments positively on sweeter styles, and sweet wines such as Sauternes, Hungary’s Tokaji, South Africa’s Constantia, and Vintage Port were once prized by kings and connoisseurs worldwide.
Mrs Jennings in Sense and Sensibility recommends Constantia to mend a broken heart and Tokaji was the world’s most expensive wine for several hundred years until the Communists made a mess of things in the mid-20thcentury by merging vineyards, ripping up old vines and focusing on mass production. I don’t have a Tokaji to recommend this week but if you have the cash and spot a 5 or 6 puttonyos Tokaji from a producer like Oremus, Disznókó, Château Dereszla or Royal Tokaji company, snap it up. [puttonyos is a unit for the level of sugar in Hungarian Tokaji (or tokay) and Slovak Tokaj dessert wine]
Like many of the world’s best wines, Tokaji is often affected by a fungus called Botrytis Cinerea which dries out the grapes and increases honey flavours (sometimes with a hint of smoke and rot). In Sauternes and Barsac the Autumn mists rise from the Rivers Garonne and Ciron and settle on the grapes — ideally the midday sun burns this off and causes ‘noble rot’. In red grapes it’s a disaster and called ‘grey rot’. I do have a Sauternes here from a discount supermarket and it is not half bad, plus one from nearby Saint-Croix-du-Mont. If these whet your appetite do seek out the wines of Châteaux such as Suduiraut, Coutet, Rieussec, Climens and Giraud — all of which should cost more than they do given their tiny production.
When I first got interested in wine in the 1990s a bottle of the best vintage Port cost much the same as a 1st Growth Bordeaux like Château Margaux, now the latter is eight or 10 times the price. Good independent wine shops and the better supermarkets often have Vintage or Single Quinta Vintage port at €40-50 or even less. Sweet sherry can be equally delicious and look too to Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Austria, and even Spain. Take a risk, I promise you won’t regret it.

Longview ‘Epitome’ Late Harvest Riesling 2018, Adelaide Hills, Australia — €12.95
Stockist: O’Briens
Australia produces some excellent dessert wines and they are worth seeking out (e.g. DeBortoli Noble 1 and Rutherglen Muscat). Longview is a family-owned producer in the cool climate Adelaide Hills region and this 375ml bottle is reduced from €17 for December so is a total bargain. Lemon-honey and yellow peach aromas with more peach and honey on the palate but with zingy crisp fresh acidity on the finish.
Chevalier du Drogon, Sauternes, Bordeaux — €14.99
Chevalier du Drogon, Sauternes, Bordeaux — €14.99
Stockist: Lidl
Sauternes is by far the most famed of all dessert wines so it is rare to find a full bottle at such a low price. Yes, this is on the lighter side of what Sauternes usually produce, but the aromas of honey and candied lemon are spot on, as are the creamy sweet lemon and acacia honey flavours with perhaps a lighter zing of acidity on the finish.
Château des Arroucats, Sainte-Croix-du-Mont 2016, SW France — €17.95
Château des Arroucats, Sainte-Croix-du-Mont 2016, SW France — €17.95
Stockists: Independents, Mitchell & Son, mitchellandson.com
Sainte-Croix-du-Mont is Located on the right bank of the Garonne River and affected by the same misty mornings as Sauternes and Barsac on the opposite side. Light gold hue, candied orange and lemon aromas with floral, honey and stone fruit notes, luscious and textured with sweet tropical fruits — but with a clean fresh finish. For lighter fruit desserts or for sipping with a
box of jellies.

Stockist: Celtic Whiskey Shop, celticwhiskeyshop.com
From Malvasia grapes and aged for 10 years in old French oak casks in the traditional Madeira Canteiro Estufagem process which ages the wines oxidatively in warm rooms.

Alves de Sousa Vintage Port 2017, Portugal — €37
Alves de Sousa Vintage Port 2017, Portugal — €37
Stockist: Celtic Whiskey Shop, celticwhiskeyshop.com
Vintage Port still represents good value when compared with other fine wines and this is a very good price given the quality. This is very much still evolving but could, just about, be drunk now  older vintages cost a little more. Inky black-purple colour; violets, bramble and black fruit aromas — textured, layered and intense with textured blackberry essence and elderberry flavours.

I have featured this excellent Austrian’s producer’s Zweigelt and Grüner Veltliner here in the past but not this dessert wine. This grape is better known as Muscat à Petits Grains and is also found on Samos and in the Rhône. This has lively floral-grapey muscat aromas, orange and lime essence, peach and tropical fruit flavours — lingering and complex with balancing clean acidity. Beautifully balanced wine.

It's about time I mentioned this tasty gin made on the Skelligs Coast in Cahersiveen in West Kerry within sight of the islands themselves. Pot-stilled with 10 botanicals including the expected juniper, orris, angelica, and citrus but also four native to the area — yarrow, douglas fir pine needles, birch sap, and dillisk.
On the nose, the juniper, sap and pine needles hit first with herbal notes in the background — creamy and soft on the palate until the spice kicks in followed by the citrus and then the juniper leaving a prickly refreshing finish. Try with tonic and pink grapefruit.

Wine with Leslie: Bollinger in short supply but these red wines will ensure a merry Christmas"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40764909.html,2021-12-13 16:19:00,Farmers block food distribution centre as protest enters second day,"Farmers protesting outside the Musgrave Group distribution centre in Kilcock, Co. Kildare, have said they will not rule out escalating their action to include several other food distribution centres.
The group hopes that by disrupting the food supply chain it will get the attention of Government ministers.
Around 200 people and over 100 vehicles attended the protest, which has now entered its second day, led by the Individual Farmers of Ireland.
The group has organised demonstrations over beef prices in 2019 and 2020.
A spokesman for the group said members had sent a list of their demands to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Charlie McConalogue.
One of the main demands made is for Green Party MEP Ciarán Cuffe to resign, as a result of the letter he wrote to banks in relation to young farmers and lending practices.
“What he did with that letter to the banks would just close down agriculture,” the spokesman said.
“There is no future for young farmers. People don’t understand how serious that letter was.”
The group is also concerned that there will be a cut to food production in this country as a result of climate policy when Ireland is “in the best position in the world to produce food if we’re let produce food”.
“The world population is rising, extra food is needed.
“But the profitability has to rise,"" he said.
A target by the government to reduce the average slaughter age of cattle from 27 to 24 months is also of great concern for the group.
The spokesman said that if the 24-month rule was enforced, the “even flow” of supply of cattle throughout the year would be gone.
“The government are not listening,” the spokesman continued.
“Are we going to have to wait here until we have no farmers because when you have no farmers actually doing the work, you can’t reverse that, you can’t put up an ad saying you want 100 farmers next week - they’re not there,” he said.
“Screw the farmer, we don’t need him. But they’re forgetting one thing - they need a farmer three times a day.
“People are starting to wake up to the seriousness of this.”
Despite blocking deliveries and lorries leaving the Musgrave Group distribution centre, entry and exit points for staff are accessible, with the road open for traffic.
The group spokesman said that there is a “fair chance of an escalation”, as farmers “have to fight on” and would not ""go home without progress”.
“Until somebody comes with some sort of progress, some sort of negotiating, we can’t go home,” the spokesman said.
“We came to do a job: we came to try and wake up the government and try and save farming, because farming is in an awful lot worse a situation than the majority of people realise.”
And that situation will only worsen if certain policies are implemented, according to the spokesman.
“If we can get more people together, we’ll try to go to another distribution centre because maybe one isn’t enough to get the government to listen...maybe if it’s two, three, four, five of them blocked and no food on the shop selves by Wednesday, then they might listen.”
Musgrave has said that the blockade at its distribution centre in Kilcock ""continues to impact the distribution of local and Irish products to retailers in communities across the country"". 
""This is the busiest trading period of the year for our retailers and suppliers. Our Irish suppliers rely on this crucial trading time in the run up to Christmas to sustain their businesses throughout the year. 
""The further delay of any resolution will have a detrimental long term impact on Irish food producers,"" a spokesperson for Musgrave said.
""Musgrave has a long-standing history and commitment of supporting Irish farmers. We are hopeful that this dispute between the protestors and Government is resolved quickly to minimise any further impact on our suppliers and customers.
Meanwhile, there has also been disruption to traffic in Dublin today, where an unrelated 24-hour protest led by the Irish Truckers and Haulage Association Against Fuel Prices has blocked the entrance to Dublin Port.

How to make Neven Maguire's maple-glazed Christmas ham with Cumberland sauce"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40766475.html,2021-12-15 12:38:00,The improved beef prices won’t cover the cost increases farmers face,"What is the future of the Irish beef producer?
As we head towards 2022, it is apparent that input costs will be much higher than in previous years.
Fertiliser will potentially be 250% to 300% higher than last spring and concentrates look like being around 50% higher.
When you add in diesel prices, bale and pit plastic prices and many more increases, then it looks like a tough year ahead.
Beef prices at the factory and live trade in the marts have improved, but these better prices won’t cover the cost increases.
When I look at the dairy sector, at least the increase in fertiliser and feed for 2022 when compared to early 2021 will be offset by the milk price. When the predicted prices for fertiliser and feed are accounted for, it will increase the cost of milk production by approximately 5c per litre.
So many unknowns exist in our industry and it is causing a significant level of frustration for farmers.
One such issue is a reported reduction in the age of slaughter for animals. If the suggested 24-month target is pushed through, it will be very difficult for some to achieve without moving to more intensive finishing systems.
Remember that the vast majority of calves in this country are born from late January to early April and if they are to be killed under 24 months, then they will all need to be killed out of the shed in their second winter.
This would increase the costs for beef producers and also reduce carcass weight, thus revenue will drop per animal. How do we continue to promote grass-fed beef if this is to be forced upon all producers?
Perhaps one solution for the suckler herds producing quality cattle would be to move more towards autumn calving so that they can be finished off grass? I calve the majority of my herd in the autumn and can see big benefits from calf performance in the following spring and summer pre-weaning.
Calves born in the autumn will be well able to consume large volumes of grazed grass in the following spring and summer, require minimal concentrates pre-weaning and present good forward stock at sale. These steers and heifers will then be well grown in the following winter, prepared for finish off grass the following summer. For autumn calves kept as bulls, these would be very suitable for under 16 month systems over the following winter.
Obviously, this would be dependent on the infrastructure and feed available in each yard.
Another benefit of autumn calving in the suckler herd is being able to use A.I. which will improve the quality and consistency of the progeny from the cows.
Changes in silages being fed
Unfortunately, many producers are convinced that their silage is better than the results that they have received back from the lab or through mobile NIR. Funny enough, nothing has changed over the years as no customer has ever asked me to retest a silage when the results are excellent.
December often corresponds with a transition of silages on farm. This year in particular has seen a huge amount of bale silage available and, as a result, many are only just after opening the pit.
Take care when moving over to pit silage as it tends to be lower in dry matter, meaning higher acid loading and it may be more finely chopped which can cause temporary digestive upsets.
As we head into mid-December, it is, unfortunately, becoming more common to hear of spoilage in silages.
This is happening with both pit and bales, but more commonly in pits. Mouldy silage is dangerous to feed to any animals and can have major implications for their performance and health.
If in doubt throw it in the dung heap would be a simple message.
Investing in animal performance through mineral balance
Optimising performance each winter is key to achieving a margin from every animal in your care.
Each detail needs to be reviewed, with silage mineral analysis money well spent.
Doing one every few years will give you an up-to-date mineral profile of your grass on the farm.
This will be of particular benefit where new ground is being harvested for silage or where forages have been bought in. Feeding a cheap mineral might be a total waste of time if it doesn’t balance your forage sources.
Buy a mineral based on what it will deliver to your stock rather than trying to save money by buying any available mineral.
The feed rate guidelines on the bag should be followed carefully. These feed rates are intended to deliver the required mineral elements for the target animals being fed.
Those feeding maize silage, whole crop and beet, in particular, need to make sure that they are supplementing with sufficient phosphorous.
Typically beef minerals are to be fed at 20g per 100kg live weight, so take care to increase the minerals fed as you progress through the winter as stock grow and increase in weight."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40768236.html,2021-12-17 14:34:00,Dairy income to fall 16% in 2022,"Dairy incomes are expected to fall by more than a fifth next year, according a new report by Teagasc economists as soaring fertiliser prices are expected to result in a sharp decline in incomes in grassland and tillage systems. 
Average dairy income is forecast to fall by 16% in 2022, due to sharply higher production costs, with just a 2% increase in milk production forecast.
Dairy, Tillage and Sheep farms have experienced a significant increase in income in 2021. However, even though cattle prices increased in 2021, incomes on most Cattle farms are likely to be unchanged on the 2020 level, due to rising input prices and lower direct payments.
The Teagasc Outlook 2022, Economic Prospects for Agriculture, showed the agricultural sector as a whole has managed to avoid much of the disruption that has been a feature of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
However, the recovery in international economic activity has led to logistical challenges for the wider economy, along with some unexpectedly rapid and large increases in energy prices in 2021, particularly for natural gas. Crude oil prices have also risen considerably in 2021. At the farm level, feed, fertiliser and fuel prices, three of the main items in farm production costs, have all been on the increase in 2021.

Brian Reidy: Tips to make the most from your silage as inputs rise
Irish milk prices in 2021 have increased substantially relative to 2020, as have cattle, sheep and cereal prices. By contrast, pig prices have fallen in 2021 from the high levels recorded in 2020.
Irish milk production increased in 2021 by 6%. Higher yields meant that Irish cereal production increased in 2021, reflecting favourable production conditions. Pig production also increased, while cattle and sheep production remained relatively stable.
The average income on dairy farms is estimated to have increased by 28% in 2021. While milk production costs increased, the sector benefitted from a 16% increase in milk prices and a further increase in milk production in 2021. The average income on tillage farms is estimated to have increased by over 45%, reflecting an increase in cereal prices, cereal yields, straw receipts and the newly introduced Straw Incorporation Measure (SIM) in 2021.
High lamb prices were more than sufficient to cover the increase in production costs in 2021 and sheep farm incomes are estimated to have increased by 15%.
Following two years which had exceptional aid payments to the sector, the level of coupled direct support payments for cattle farms fell in 2021. The average income on cattle rearing (suckler) farms and other cattle (predominantly finisher) farms is estimated to have remained unchanged on the 2020 level. Higher beef cattle prices in 2021, were offset by higher production costs and the lower level of support on many cattle farms. Despite reduced levels of coupled direct support, in 2021 most cattle farms with a specialist cattle finishing enterprise, saw incomes increase.
The decline in pig prices in 2021, combined with a rise in feed prices, led to a fall in margins and pig farm incomes.
Rising costs
Market prospects for 2022 are dominated by cost pressures that have built up over the second half of 2021 and which will impact to a greater extent on incomes in 2022 than they did in 2021. Higher cereal harvest prices in 2021, will likely lead to a further increase in feed costs in 2022. The rise in oil prices in 2021, should be followed by a stabilisation at this higher level in 2022. However, this will mean that fuel prices in 2022 will average substantially higher than in 2021.
However, the greatest concern on the cost side for 2022 is the price of fertiliser. The high price of natural gas, a key ingredient in fertiliser production, has caused disruption to production in the international fertiliser industry this year. This escalation in natural gas prices is unprecedented and has been caused by a reduction in the supply of gas available on the European market, which is increasingly dependent on imports.
These very high natural gas prices, which have pushed up the cost of fertiliser production, are likely to persist into 2022. Fertiliser prices have risen to record levels as a result. Fertiliser prices and availability will therefore represent twin concerns for farmers next year.
Fertiliser prices in 2022 could be more than double their 2021 level and this may cause a reduced level of fertiliser usage. Grassland farmers may review their level of fertiliser usage in an attempt to offset some of the rise in production costs.
If lower fertiliser usage leads to a fall in grass production, farmers will need to carefully monitor silage and fodder stocks for the winter of 2022/23 and seek to avoid having to fill a shortfall of grass for grazing with extra concentrates. Tillage farmers will have less discretion in relation to fertiliser use, given the impact lower usage would have on tillage yields.
Output prices
Significantly, higher production costs are forecast to be a feature across all sectors in 2022. Output prices are unlikely to adjust to fully reflect the increase in production costs and farm incomes in 2022 are therefore forecast to decline.
Irish farm output prices in most sectors were quite high in 2021 and relatively small positive output price adjustments are forecast in 2022 for pigs and tillage, in the range of 2% to 3%. Irish milk prices are not forecast to change in 2022, with only small changes in cattle prices anticipated. Sheep prices are forecast to be down 5% on their recent high level.
As a result, a sharp decline in incomes in grassland and tillage systems in 2022 is forecast. Average dairy income is forecast to fall by 16% in 2022, due to sharply higher production costs, with just a 2% increase in milk production forecast.
The higher cereal yields achieved in 2021 are unlikely to be repeated in 2022, with average tillage incomes forecast to fall by almost 35%. Average incomes on sheep farms are forecast to decline by 14%, reflecting somewhat lower sheep prices and higher production costs. Average incomes are also forecast to fall on cattle farms in 2022, with a decline of 31% in prospect for cattle rearing farms and a decline of 18% for other cattle farms. While pig prices should be higher in 2022, the benefit for farmers will be cancelled out by increased production costs, with margins to decline further.
The average farm income in 2022 is forecast to decline by 19%, but the outlook is extremely uncertain. The end outcome will depend on several factors, most notably, the impact the coming winter has on silage stocks, fertiliser market developments in the spring of 2022, the weather conditions that follow and the strategies farmers adopt in reaction to these external market circumstances."

John Murray of Modern Botany 
John Murray and Dr Simon Jackson, Modern Botany
It's been an exciting time of change for us as a company as we did, like other companies, struggle with the Covid crisis in that the stores of our retail partners were closed. But we turned our negative into a positive to allow our customers a user-friendly way to shop for our products direct to our website. We are now finding an increase in traffic to our website as our online tribe is growing.
I think that since the Covid crisis and also with Brexit consumers are looking closer to home for that perfect Christmas gift. Sustainability is for sure high on the consumer's list when choosing gifts. I think stripped back gifts without unnecessary packaging will be a big deciding factor.
Our signature multi-tasking oil which will be a sell-out again this Christmas, but also we are so excited to announce the launch of our two new high-performance skincare products ready for the Christmas market. I expect that these newbies will be our best sellers this Christmas.
We have 20 products ready to drop in the next two years. We will see more innovative plant-based products coming into line, like a high-performance night cream, day cream and a range of washes and new deodorants to add to the range. We will also be expanding our herb growing in our Modern Botany farm. We are delighted that all our new products feature our Modern Botany home-grown Calendula, Roman and German Chamomile along with our Irish Organic certified wild foraged West Cork seaweed.
Olivia Norman of Naivilo 
Olivia Norman
Naivilo has been in business since March 2020, just as the pandemic took hold of the world. I think that shopping locally and supporting both local and sustainable products will be here to stay. We have gotten used to having less and valuing what we have more which I really hope stays.
I have a lot of customers buying Naivilo giftsets as presents for family and friends as they want to introduce them to a new natural product that they wouldn't normally consider buying for themselves. I feel that once customers find businesses that they like and trust they are happy to buy from them regularly and tell others about them too. As customers, we are becoming a lot fussier about who we do business with.
Naivilo's prebiotic natural deodorant balm in the Trio Deo set will be very popular this Christmas as you get to try all three scents and can change them every day to suit your mood. They will last for six months for one person, or you can share a jar with someone too.
There are a lot of lovely things coming in 2022 as I have begun working with other wellness experts and will be collaborating in detox treatments and education too. I have a very exciting project happening with the Munster Technical University working with other scientists. Naivilo will be more visible in 2022 across social media and print media so I am very excited for this Christmas period as well as 2022.
Sharon Keegan of Peachylean 
Sharon Keegan
Peachylean has been trading since 2019. Lockdowns and remote working saw the sales of activewear and athleisurewear boom over a 16 month period. Covid-19 impacted Peachylean positively, we grew our company by over 300% and scaled across Europe the US and Australia.
Supporting local is certainly something that's here to stay, while sustainability is now becoming a major deciding factor for customers and every day we get more and more questions around this. Online shopping has now come to the forefront with excellent next day delivery services and overall convenience for customers most consumers will buy online this year, which means less impulse buying and more direct purchasing.
Our hero product this Christmas is our Peachylean support wear legging with pockets. We have a fabulous new range just in time for Christmas that includes positive affirmation oversized tees and long oversized hoodies in a gorgeous range of Peachylean branded colours. We have long waiting lists for some of our products so we expect to sell out this year.
In 2022 we will treat our community to events around the country. We want everyone to be together again, we have all missed this too much so we will have a big push on the mental wellness aspect of our business by connecting our people together again with movement fun and all things Peachylean. We will invest and grow our UK & US community and help to support the everyday every body with our new range of products, encouraging them to live life in full colour with Peachylean.
Julie Peelo of PEELO 
PEELO Burgundy & Orange Stripe Leather Tote, €265
PEELO was launched last September and whilst launching in a pandemic wasn't the plan the support and feedback from customers has been incredible. I think there is and will continue to be a push to support Irish design and brands and to support the local economy this Christmas. When creating a brand today, it should be built on a foundation of sustainability, which is the case with PEELO. Fast fashion can have negative impacts on our environment and I strive to create pieces that people will love and cherish.
PEELO is about creating modern pieces that are designed to last. Everything is designed by me and made with top European manufacturers. There are two standout styles for me: my Simple & Stripe leather totes, which are perfect for back to work and carrying laptops in and out of the office as well as my smaller crossbody styles for when you want to be hands-free. They are all available in an array of colours and leathers. Another new addition for me this winter is my new recycled wool beanie for €30, it's perfect for winter walks and school runs and an ideal gift for yourself or for a friend.
Setting up and launching my own label has long been a dream of mine after designing accessories for big brands in Europe and the US. I'm planning to continue building my collection and add some more accessories to the collection, possibly some men's bags and a wallet, so watch this space.
Aimee Connolly of Sculpted

We are in business for four-and-a-half years and have seen amazing growth in that time. Naturally, like all businesses Covid-19 had an impact but we were very fortunate to be in a position where we were set up online so our business was able to keep going when footfall was down in stores. Overall we pivoted massively online and managed to keep up engagement and our customer community.
We definitely find sustainability a big topic in consumers' minds this year more so than others. I think people are always very good to support Irish, we are very lucky with our kind loyal consumer base. We definitely see a slight shift in the style of buying, so for example we see an uplift in the more glamorous products such as lipsticks, liners and eye products for that dressed up look versus last year when things were a little more modest and natural.
We have just launched our Christmas collection that we worked so hard on so we definitely see those taking priority this quarter and I truly believe from the different price points to offering inside the gifts there really is something for everyone.
For 2022 we will have some more amazing products join our line up as well as a focus on new markets and our general international expansion approach. Here's to a hopefully busy next year!
Christine Murphy of Urban Aran 
Urban Aran pullover, €265
I founded Urban Aran three years ago, creating luxury throws and textiles for the hotel and hospitality industry. I pivoted at the start of Covid, making linen face masks and scarves and transitioned into fashion with the launch of my first fashion collection a few weeks ago This is my debut fashion collection and we focus on natural fibres only in our knitwear, in our packaging and in our mailler bags, which are 100% compostable. We make in small batch production and I have seen already the support for local Irish designers among shoppers.
Our design influence has been the Waterford Walls street art programme and urban art in all its forms. My oversized brick design cardigan and my sweater vest have been very popular as you can tuck a tee or shirt underneath them.
Coming in 2022 is a small knitted collection in my urban art theme, containing different and exciting designs using musing free (no harm to the animal) superfine merino wool.

Making Cents: How to budget now for your spending plans at Christmas"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40766586.html,2021-12-18 07:05:00,"56-acre farm on Cork/Kerry border could fetch €500,000","A 56-acre farm located in the northwest corner of Co. Cork in the townland of Knockeenagullane seems to be a good fit for the local market in current conditions.
“It’s a fine farm – well serviced by a central roadway,” said Kanturk-based auctioneer Liam Murphy. “It was a dairy farm formerly and is about 2km from Knocknagree village.”
Knocknagree is a small settlement just a few hundred metres east of the River Blackwater that forms the Cork/Kerry border.
Although the name in Irish refers to the “hill of the horse stud”, the main farming activities in this neck of the woods are dairying and beef cattle.
The vibrant market town of Kanturk is 24km away, Killarney and Kerry International Airport are roughly equidistant (25 minutes’ drive) from the property.
The holding has been let for some time and used for dry stock, according to Mr Murphy.
“There’s been a lot of interest and the size of 56 acres lends itself well for a good extension of an existing holding. Within a 25km radius of the farm, there would be a lot of progressive dairy farmers and we’re finding it very difficult to provide a lot of young dairymen with land going forward. There’s so much land tied up in schemes, and so on, that it’s hard to get the supply needed,"" he said.
The outbuildings surrounding the yard include an old milking parlour, cubicle houses, an open slurry pit and a covered silage pit.
The land, he says, is of very good quality, but still has the potential to be improved.
With a public road running through part of the farm, it would lend itself to division but most interest so far is in the entire holding. The price expectation is €450,000 to €500,000 (€8,000 to €9,000 per acre).

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40768224.html,2021-12-18 09:57:00,Beef trade: Factory demand continues to outstrip supplies,"The demand for finished cattle at the factories is continuing to outstrip the supply as the trade edges into the final days pre-Christmas.
Overall, the prices are continuing steady, with the gains over the recent weeks being maintained, while some of the larger suppliers are securing deals, which are worth up to 5c/kg for loads of quality stock.
Most of the steers are making a base of 425c/kg with a small percentage at up to 430c/kg for larger supplies and regular suppliers.
The heifers are on a base of 435c/kg. Larger suppliers are doing deals at 440c/kg, while getting above that is possible where the factory is under pressure to get the stock, but not regularly available.

The improved beef prices won’t cover the cost increases farmers face
The processors are treading a tight rope in balancing the demand to get stock and holding a rein on the upward movement on the price. As an alternative to conceding further upward movement on price, deals including transport and flat pricing are being reported this week.
The young bulls are running broadly on par with the steer price on a base of 425 cents/kg and the cow trade is holding steady at recent weeks' returns of up to 390 cents/kg for R grade cows.
The intake for last week was 34,784 head which was slightly higher than the same week in 2020. Steers accounted for 11,497 head, with the heifers at 10,475 head, young bulls on 3,349 head and cows at 8,987 head.
The weekly intake at the plants is now running slightly higher than for the corresponding weeks last year, despite an average year-to-date drop of 1,600 head/week in the supply compared to 2020.
The beef trade is one section of farm production that continues to baffle forecasters on the majority of their predictions.
Best Butcher Heifer Animal at Kanturk Mart's Christmas Fat Stock Show and Sale, exhibited by Jeremiah Lehane. Heifers are on a base of 435c/kg.
A year ago, the major concerns were that post Brexit on January 1, 2021, the market for Irish beef in the UK could be severely impacted, because of the heavy reliance on the destination, up to 53% of Irish beef exports.
In hindsight, the predictions on both demand and price have fallen very hollow as 2021 is set to become a record year on both demand for cattle at the factories and the average price paid.
At the same time, the supply has turned out to be much stronger than had been predicted. Estimates were that supply for the year could be down by 110,000-120,000 head, while with only a few weeks left to the end of the year, the supply is showing the decline at 78,412 head.
Heifers are showing the biggest drop at over 32,000 head with in excess of 15,000 fewer steers going through and the young bulls down by nearly 10,000 head to date for the year."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40770792.html,2021-12-21 18:37:00,An exceptional year for producers comes to a positive end,"The prices have steadied at the factories for the beef animals this week as the intake at the plants remains firm.
An exceptional year for producers on beef prices, which has exceeded all expectations, is coming to an end on a positive note, having gone some way to restoring an element of confidence in the depleted sector.
The base prices being quoted this week for the prime beef animals are largely unchanged, but the indications are that a smaller percentage of the intake is securing the 'top-up' at the level on par with recent weeks.
That leaves steers on a base of 420 cents/kg and suppliers are finding it harder to get to 425 cents/kg which had been paid for some of the stock in recent weeks. It is a similar situation for the heifer trade, which are being quoted at 430 cents/kg.
A smaller percentage of the heifers are reported to be making a base of 435 cents/kg than over the recent weeks and above that has become the exception this week.
The young bulls are generally on the same price as the steers and the R grade cow continue to make up to 390 cents/kg.
There was very little change in the level of intake last week from the previous week. The supply of 34,223 head was around 1,500 less than the same week in 2020. Both the steers at 11,290 head and heifers on 10,271 head were each down around 1,000 head on the same week last year.
Bucking the general trend, the intake of young bulls at 3,500 was 500 head higher than a year ago, while the supply of cows at 8,636 head was on par with last year.
The processors are in a stronger position to ease on the pressure to get more stock this week with adequate supply to meet the needs into the early days of the New Year. Consumer demand for beef for the first weeks of January is traditionally down in the post-Christmas trade.
The 2021 supply is going to end at something more than 80,000 head less than 2020. That decline in supply is up to a third lower than what had been predicted as the higher level likely.
Nevertheless, the fewer cattle available to the processors was significant in underpinning the floor price average for the year, particularly because the market demand for beef throughout the year turned out to be much stronger than had been expected.
The combination of lower supply and strong demand because the perfect scenario to deliver stronger returns to producers, which was particularly relevant for the sector in a year of escalating production costs at farm level.
A big contributor was the almost negligible impact of Brexit post-January 1, 2021 on the market for Irish beef in the UK, which ad been feared could have become significant for downward pressure on returns to producers."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40771578.html,2021-12-22 16:58:00,Meet the growers working hard to produce Ireland's Christmas spreads,"It might be known as the most wonderful time of year, but it is most certainly the busiest time of year for many farmers and agri-food suppliers.
Ireland’s farmers commit the hours and labour 365 days a year to ensure the components of our meals are ready and available on the shop shelves, and Christmas Day is no different.
Irish food producers are urging people this year to consider the positive impact that supporting locally-produced food has on the rural economy, along with the environment.
With the value of fruit and vegetable imports to Ireland from January to October of this year worth €1 billion according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office, Dermot Callaghan, head of the Horticulture Development Department at Teagasc said that technically, we can domestically grow a larger proportion of the fresh produce we consume.

Despite Irish producers providing local, fresh and top-quality produce to the retail market, consumers need to be mindful that the availability of cheaper imports from lower-cost economies means that supermarkets ""are happy to source product abroad and keep Irish product prices subdued"".
“Irish fresh produce benefits from being fresher, by days in many cases; it has lower carbon footprint in terms of transport; and it has the added benefit of supporting the local economy in Ireland,"" Mr Callaghan told the Irish Examiner.
He said that recent experiences - such as Brexit or Covid-19 - have shown us that supply chains “are not so linear”.
“When you’re importing a lot of product, there are complexities in the supply chain which can lead to risk in the supply of food. The UK has had particular problems but we too have been affected,” Mr Callaghan continued.
“To mitigate supply chain risks, bringing more production closer to consumption makes sense and would act to underpin our supply of this highly valuable produce.
“When consumers clearly link the environmental benefits of choosing local fresh produce, and really value the inherent health attributes of fresh local produce, they will want more of it.” 
He added that demand for fresh Irish produce “has never been higher, but price has never been lower, relative to cost of production”.
Talamh Beo, a member-led organisation of farmers, growers and land-based workers, is calling for a system that ensures everyone in Ireland has access to high quality and locally-produced food, with farmers earning a fair living from providing food for their communities.
Thomas O'Connor of Manna Organic Farm: 'In supporting local food, you’re supporting local livelihoods.'
Thomas O’Connor, who helped to put together Talamh Beo’s Local Food Policy Framework this year, told the Irish Examiner that environmentally, local food is a “no-brainer”.
“We need new policy because the true price of food isn’t reflected at the counter for the customer,” he said.
“In supporting local food, you’re supporting local livelihoods.
“There is a cheap food policy and we need to support the farmers who are supporting local food.” 
Thomas and his wife Claire have a 25-acre organic farm in Gleann na nGealt, Camp, Co Kerry. Neither of them were farmers before 2007.
“I used to spend three months a year on my grandfather’s farm growing up - he had 14-15 acres and a couple of cows and he grew his own veg. It was the way farming used to be,” Mr O’Connor said.
“You had farmers like that around the country - self-sufficient. They sold milk to the creamery, for example, but the vast majority of what they produced they used to feed themselves with.
“I got that bit of experience with nature but I had no idea of ever getting into farming.” 
Food has always been very important to the couple, and even more so following a stint of travelling.
""In other countries in Europe, the experience of local food is way different to here. In any town, any market, there is so much fresh produce available,"" Mr O'Connor said.
When the couple returned to Ireland, they pursued studies in the Organic College in Co Limerick. This was soon followed by Thomas selling the pub he ran and the couple then bought their 25-acre farm.
""One of the reasons I wanted to become a farmer is because I'm a Kerryman - and I realised that your body is based off of what you consume and to be a proper Kerryman, I needed to be eating from the ground in Kerry!"" Mr O'Connor said.
""If we want to be connected to the space we’re living in, well then we need to be eating the food that’s coming from it.""
On the organic farm at the moment, there is kale, turnips and beetroot, along with two small tunnels where they grow lettuce and scallions, and during the summer some tomatoes and cucumbers.
They supply a portion of their produce to their Tralee-based shop - Manna Organic Store.
The rest of the produce sold there, from fresh chickens to skincare, is supplied by other local and organic producers.
""Consumer demand for organic is growing every single year,"" Mrs O'Connor said.
""In 2020, with the horrible year that was had, a lot of people couldn't go out to eat, a lot of people changed their lifestyle. A lot of people were that bit more cautious too of going into the larger supermarkets so our business really saw an increase.""
Mr O'Connor is passionate about the fact that being a farmer, especially organic, is ""hard work - but it's not a burden, it's a privilege"".
""The problem is because people are economically stretched, it’s really hard for farming to be just a privilege,"" he added.
On the 25-acre farm, the couple has 13 acres of native woodland planted, and four acres of permaculture field, full of native Irish apple trees.
""On our farm, a thing that's a waste product from one of our systems is actually a feed point into one of our next systems; so you keep an awful lot of your nutrients on the farm and things are just rotating,"" Mr O'Connor continued.

""The resilience of mixed farms is amazing.""
Mrs O'Connor urges people to shop local this Christmas, and to read the labels on food items.
""If you're buying something from your local shop, you're helping put kids through college. It's money going into your community. They're your friends, your family. By buying from your local farmer, you're helping those people stay in your community.""
Mr O'Connor added that consumers should shop for their future - ""shop for their children"", and consider the fragility and lack of resilience of long supply chains.
""Look at what you're buying now, and don't buy it just because it's a few cents cheaper. Think about the producer, think about the fact they might be there next year to feed you again when you're hungry,"" he said.
""Unless you support your farmers and your local food producers, then you're totally dependant on stuff coming in from abroad.
""Your local farmer is for life.""
Meanwhile, just outside Mallow, Co Cork, Ned English and his family - wife Mary, and children Edward and Niamh - along with the team at Castlecor Potatoes have been working day and night to supply some key Christmas dinner ingredients.
Mr English estimates that the business will pack close to 1,000 tonnes of potatoes and onions in the run-up to Christmas. The business has come a long way from its humble roots.
Having qualified with an agriculture-related degree in the late 1960s, Mr English had ""all the ideas in the world of working in the advisory service"".
In the years that followed, however, he went teaching and ended up inheriting a family farm in Kilbrin.
""I wanted to have a dairy herd in Kilbrin. But the cattle went against us, we lost a fortune and there was only one way to get it back in my mind, and that was to go into tillage. So that started me into the crops - that was about 1976.""
He decided to then start growing onions for about three years.
""We did well, we did badly, and we got out without making inroads; so we stopped growing them,"" Mr English explained.
""Then I said we’d start to grow potatoes. For the three years before that, while I was growing onions, potatoes had been about £360 a tonne.
""And the first year I grew potatoes, the price fell to £15 a tonne. We persevered and believe it or not, we broke even on potatoes at £15 a tonne.
""We worked away from there and gradually expanded our acreage and our facilities. The first year I grew potatoes, I only grew 13 acres; we now are growing close to 500 acres.""
Mr English and his team are now a major supplier for Lidl, a business relationship that has been built up over approximately 15 years.
The potatoes are planted somewhere around the month of March, Mr English explained.
They're harvested around the third week of September onwards, and they go into onsite cold storage to stop them from sprouting.
""We will be selling this year's potatoes right up to the middle of August [2022],"" he said.
""In between that, there will come other early potatoes like British Queens and other varieties which will be sold as specialties side by side with the main crop varieties, which are sold right through the year.
""For example, Roosters and Golden Wonders are main crop varieties.
""Potatoes like British Queens will be ready from late June onwards, maybe July.
""It's a constant battle with the weather of course, but that's outside of your control.""
In addition to the potatoes, around four years ago, the business decided to try onions again. It now produces around 3,500 tonnes of onions a year, Mr English estimates.
He is most passionate about the effect that local food production has on the rural economy in Munster.
""We've created in the region of 50 jobs, both directly in the onsite pack house and in the farming end of it, and every year, we put a million's quid worth into the local economy - that's really what we're proudest about,"" he said.
""I'm very big on the fact that rural Ireland needs the population, but it needs a population that can get work, be paid properly, and can live and work in their own area in something they enjoy doing.
""We have a very small turnover of staff, I have people working for me who have been working with me for the last 30 years.""
Mr English said the Irish consumer is a ""tough cookie"" and while generally, he thinks they will support Irish and local, his concerns still remain that ""they won't support if it's dearer than what they can buy from somewhere else"".
""We work on a policy of an uncomfortable margin, and I would be very strong on that,"" he explained.
""We don't work on the policy of a comfortable margin, because if you're working on a comfortable margin, then that means there is plenty leeway for people to come in and undercut you.
""It also means that you're not giving the best price to your customer. That also means they can't similarly give the best price to their customers.
""There's a chain of logic to the whole thing and when you're working on that basis, you don't have a problem with your business model.""
He reckons that ""Irishness"" will get you to the door - ""but you've got to be competitive"".
He said that there will always be a certain amount of people who will buy and use fresh produce, but that ""we've got to promote these things in order to keep fresh on the table"".
And very importantly: how will Mr English eat his potatoes as part of his Christmas dinner?
“Boiled, and roasted - with butter,” he said.
Back in Co Kerry on Ballygarron Farm based in the Spa, Tralee, the harvest of another festive favourite was in full swing this week.
In the run-up to Christmas, the Hanafins and their team are packing Brussels sprouts to supply approximately between 135 to 145 tonnes, around 95 tonnes of which will be supplied to Musgrave Group.
According to Bord Bia, the main business of fresh vegetable production revolves around large-scale grading and packing of vegetables for supermarkets and foodservice channels.
Valued at €477 million (farm gate value), horticulture is the fourth largest sector after dairy, beef and pigs in terms of gross agricultural commodity output value. 
The Teagasc Horticulture Development Department has expressed concern that in recent months, growers have seen ""unparalleled increases"" in costs of key inputs to the horticulture sector.
Dermot Callaghan said that given growers' costs have increased substantially, producers are ""potentially facing significant decreases in margins"".
Paudie Hanafin of Ballygarron Farm and his team have been working around the clock to ensure they meet their supply requirements of sprouts, cauliflower, and other vegetables for the Christmas period.
In light of this, Mr Hanafin, who is the third generation to work on the family farm, is calling for an increase in the prices that growers receive. 
""I love what I do and it's all I've ever done,"" he said.
""But we're harvesting 24 hours a day. My father was getting more 40 years ago for cabbage than we are getting today.

If you are sorted for wine but just remembered you forgot to buy someone a present I recommend buying them a wine subscription or an online voucher. Ely Wine Shop and Wine Bars have just introduced a Wine Subscription Service. Each month club members receive three bottles on a specific seasonal theme or focused on a particular region, or on new wines in the shop. Ely are not committing themselves to any rules but do promise that the wines will most likely be organic or biodynamic and you can sign up for one, three or six months or for a full year at a cost of €120 per month - Shop.Elywinebar.ie
Boxofwine.ie offers a similar service and can tailor the subscription to the tastes of the recipient. Boxofwine is aimed more at novices but the indecisive will also find it useful. Another site I recommend is www.stationtostationwine.ie who offer curated boxes and add in a bit of pop culture wit and fun - e.g. “Wiseguys: The Hidden Underbelly of Italian Wine” or “Alt-White” for a mix of unusual white wines. The site is possibly my favourite wine site to browse and Rory has a brilliant selection from some of Ireland’s best importers - I doubt there is a wine on his site that has not appeared on this page.
The other site I cannot recommend highly enough is SIYPS.com - Sommelier in Your Pocket which focuses almost exclusively on organic and biodynamic wines, again from some of our best importers such as Grape Circus, Nomad Wines and WineMason. The old reliable and longer established online sites such as WinesDirect.ie and the granddaddy of them all Wineonline.ie are also worth exploring and don’t forget that many independents have their own online shop and delivery service - try WorldwideWines.ie, LeCaveau.ie, TheCorkscrew.ie and for beer look to CraftCentral.ie and Craftbeersdelivered.com - the latter is owned by CelticWhiskeyShop.ie which has the largest range of whiskey and gins in the country.
One wine I was afraid to feature in case it is already gone is the fruity-spicy Barão de Vilar Douro from SuperValu which is on offer at 6 bottles for €40 - such offers won’t be possible next year due to minimum pricing. Happy Christmas!
Wines Under €15
Château du Bois Chantant Bordeaux Supérieur 2018 - €14.99
Stockist: Spar, Eurospar, Londis and Mace nationwide
If you are loathe to brave the crowds in town today don’t forget that your local Spar-Londis-Mace imports some excellent wines - and thankfully they don’t play the fake half-price game. This family-run estate wine is made from 90% Merlot plus Cab. Sauvignon with chocolate and plums on the nose, solid berry fruits on the palate and crunchy darker fruits on the finish.
Teófilo Reys, Ribera del Duero, Spain - €10.40
Stockist: Dunnes Stores Nationwide
I’m not sure there is another Ribera del Duero worth buying at €15, never mind at a mere €10.40 (usually €13). This spends four months in French oak and has lots of ripe smoky black fruit scents with bramble, pomegranate and cranberry flavours on the palate and nice heft and weight for such a low price. This will work with everything from lamb to beef to turkey to cheese plates and certainly leftovers.
Pouco Comum Alvarinho 2020, Minho, Portugal - €15.99
Stockists: Matson’s Grange, Youghal and Douglas, La Touche, O’Briens, Red Island Wines, Deveneys, Corkscrew, Whelehans Wines.
Just a little over €15 but well worth an extra Euro as this low cropping grape is difficult to grow cheaply. From Northern Portugal, just across the river Minho from Albariño country - Rias Baixas. Aromas of peaches and ripe pears, textured and layered with creamy cooked fruits and citrus with bright zingy apple acidity on the finish. Perfect match for seafood.
Wine Over €15
Casa Belfi Prosecco Colfondo Frizzante, Veneto, Italy - €22.95
Stockists: L’Atitude 51, Bradleys, Green Man Wines, Le Caveau www.lecaveau.ie
This delightful wine oozes character and is so much more interesting than standard Prosecco. This is organic and biodynamic, unfiltered and zero sulphur and is packed with yeasty over-ripe pear and apple pie flavours rather than the usual peaches and cream. Also watch for the Rosso Colfondo version which has a pleasing cranberry flavour - what could be more Christmassy? On pour in L’Attitude today.
Fonseca Quinta do Panascal 2001, Portugal - €44.99
Stockist: O’Donovans, Independents
Fonseca dates from 1815 and are often a little under the radar - these days they are part of the Taylors Port family along with Croft. Quinta do Panascal is Fonseca’s Singe Estate Port which they release in non-Vintage declared years. This has ripe blueberry and blackberry fruit aromas with a lovely concentrated sweetness balanced by freshness and textured dark fruits. O’Donovan’s also stock Taylors White, Tawny and Ruby.
Quinta dos Aciprestes, Douro, Portugal €17.99-18.99
Stockists: Matson’s Grange, Youghal and Douglas, La Touche, O’Briens, Red Island Wines, Deveneys, Corkscrew, Whelehans Wines
The Douro is Port country but also to many of Portugal’s most complex red wines which often combine rich fruit flavours while remaining elegant and supremely drinkable. This is a blend of typical Port grapes Touriga Nacional, Tinta Barocca and Tinta Franca with bright plum and dark cherry aromas which morph into weighty smoky darker fruits followed by a floral elegant finish.
Spirit of the week
Micil Connemara Irish Cream Liqueur, 17% ABV, 70cl - €29.00
Stockists: McCambridges, Celtic Whiskey Shop, www.irishmalts.com. Micil.ie
Micil in Galway has had a busy year. As well as sourcing mature Irish whiskey and giving it their own twist through blending and cask selection, Micil has also launched a new spiced orange gin (€42), and this cream liqueur. The two whiskies - Inverin small batch blend and Earls Island Single Pot Still - have complex and intriguing peaty notes; a pleasing throwback to Galway’s distilling past.
Micil Irish Cream meanwhile is a blend of Irish whiskey, Irish cream and Poitín from the Micil Distillery and I adored it - aromas of homemade fudge and chocolate milk, creamy, spicy butter caramel and whiskey flavours, and a lively clean finish.

Spreading the cheer: The best drinks options for all Christmas occasions"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40770711.html,2021-12-29 07:00:00,Why the non-application of customs has truly saved Irish agriculture,"The words immortalised by John Lennon of the Beatles comes to mind, 'So this is Christmas, and what have you done, another year over, and a new one just begun'. 
Regardless of your religious persuasions or your agnosticism, there is something hugely beneficial in winding up the year.
From a psychological point of view, it allows us to wrap a frame around a period of time which we call a year. As an accountant, most of my clients prepare their accounts to a calendar year-end but regardless of whether your accounts finish in June or December, we typically count our farming seasons as closed from this point of the year. 2021 will perhaps go down on record as being a relatively good year for mainstream farming, with a significant lift in output prices for beef, dairy, tillage and sheep farmers. 
Our brethren in the pig industry have not faired so well this year, and those with poultry flocks are on tenterhooks with avian flu posing a significant threat to their business. The best part of 2021 to my mind was actually something that didn’t happen rather than something that did happen. Rescuing a zero customs arrangement between the UK and Ireland was perhaps the biggest success for 2021, the non-application of customs has truly saved Irish agriculture. For most of us, it’s a case of what we never lost we never missed.
Farmers rightly have trepidations about the year ahead, with wild swings in input prices particularly energy, fertiliser and feed prices, but also steel, concrete and other farm inputs, but thankfully the outlook for sales prices for dairy, beef and tillage remains positive and only time will tell if farmer margins can hold up to the onslaught of input price increases. I am also hopeful that 2021 might also be a turning point in the public perception of farmers. Over recent years it feels like farmers have been beaten down and seen as the scapegoat for seemingly every woe.
As food inflation kicks in significantly for 2022 on the back of higher input prices, the importance of adequate food supply, food security and traceability should propel farmers back into a positive position. Farmers have this year also come to terms with a changing operating environment and major shifts have already occurred at farm level with significantly less road verges being trimmed mid-summer, and thus far little slurry tanker activity on farms this side of Christmas. Most farmers are financially better off at the end of 2021 compared to 2020 and that puts us in a strong position to face the year ahead. It’s a great time to look back on what you’ve achieved for the year gone by and set out your ambitions for the year ahead. Ambitions can come in many forms whether it's seeking to expand, or cut back, have a better work-life balance, diversify, or keep farming into your ripe old age. For me this time of year allows me to clear the head, recharge the batteries, get to jobs that have been put off all year and plan out the year ahead.
2022 will bring its own challenges and the emergence of Omicron brings a new layer of uncertainty but there is much to be thankful for, and resilience is one trait that farmers have in abundance. So for now, I wish you a happy, healthy and prosperous New Year. For all you taxpayers with accounts ending 31 December spare a though for your accountant, take a minute to jot down your livestock numbers, creditors and debtors at year-end it will save you a lot of head-scratching in 2022."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40772400.html,2021-12-29 15:20:00,2021: An exceptional year on all counts - including beef prices,"Into the final days of 2021, the year will be remembered by livestock farmers for the strength of market prices throughout a year, which began with serious concern of a possible downturn in the trade.
January 1, 2021, marked the end of the UK’s transition period from the EU, with serious concerns for the future of a market that accounted for around 52% of Irish beef exports.
Producers were relying on the prediction of a drop of up to 120,000 head in expected supplies for the processors to have some beneficial effect in maintaining prices.
The cattle supply fell by one third less to a deficit of just over 80,000 head compared to 2020, market demand exceeded all expectations, and average prices returned to suppliers banished the predictions of doom.
To mid-December, the drop in heifers supplied to the factories accounted for close to half the total drop for the year. Heifers were down by 33,797 head. Steers were down by 16,261 head. There were 9,260 fewer young bulls supplied and the intake of cows was down by 8,730.
While the average prices were among the strongest ever, it remained of concern to producers that Irish prices continued to trail prices for the comparative cattle in the UK. To mid-December, the average Irish price for an R3 steer was €4.05/kg, slightly better than the EU average of €3.90, while trailing the UK price of €4.66, leaving a difference of more than €200/head in the typical 350kg carcase.
Compared to the 2020 average, the 2021 Irish R3 steer price was up 42c/kg, the EU average was stronger by 37c/kg, and the UK price was improved by 64c/kg.
The current year Irish price for steers is also up by 45c/kg on 2019 prices — the EU is 29c/kg higher and the UK price is 77c/kg higher.
The quoted prices are exclusive of Vat, which is applicable to prices paid to Irish suppliers at a flat rate of 5.6%.
There were a total of 239,847 live cattle exported out of Ireland for the first 47 weeks of 2021, which represents a small decline of seven per cent in the same period in 2020.
With strong cattle prices on the domestic market, it has been more difficult for Irish cattle to compete in key export markets. Over recent weeks, the number of cattle exported has generally trended below year-earlier levels, and these are dominated by movements of store and finished animals to Northern Ireland.
Live exports to the end of November were 239,846 head, a drop of 4.4% on 2020. While exports to Northern Ireland increased by 20.5% to 57,498 head, and sales to Italy were up by 35.4%, exports to the main continental markets were down.
Exports to Belgium dropped by 53.4%, exports to France fell by 17.5%, sales to Spain were back by 8.7%, and post-Brexit, exports to Britain were down by 37%. There was also a sharp decline of 58% in exports to third country markets.
Calf exports were almost on par with 2020 at 140,288 head, a decline of 1.6%. Weanling exports fell by 36.1%, while the live export of finished cattle increased by 6.1%."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40774197.html,2021-12-30 12:47:00,"36-acre South Tipperary farm new to the market for €300,000","There is already strong interest in a 36-acre farm in South Tipperary new to the market.
With two active bidders already involved and given the location of the property, it’s no surprise that offers seem to be quick off the mark.
Situated in a corner of South Tipperary approximately 12km from Fethard, where a powerful dairying scene is accompanied by a vibrant beef cattle sector, the farm may also attract the attention of the many strong players in the international equestrian scene.
“It’s decent quality ground and in a really good location,” said auctioneer Robbie Grace of REA Grace in Callan, Co Kilkenny. “It’s bounding the River Anner and it has very good road frontage, laid out in two large fields.”
The property doesn’t come with any entitlements. It is in permanent pasture and will lend itself well to any number of farming enterprises.
The holding comes with a good collection of outbuildings, which are in a useful condition, if in need of some modernisation. They include a large three-ban hay shed and a number of other buildings. There is also a reliable water supply from the river.
“The interest is good at this time and we are under offer,” confirms Mr Grace. “The land in this area is generally good and there would be a good number of large dairy farmers locally... There’s also a good equestrian element nearby too, with a number of important stud farms in this part of the world. But it’s primarily good dairy farmers in the immediate area.”
The asking price of €300,000 (€8,300/acre) certainly appears to be reasonable and is likely to attract plenty of other offers. The farm is located just out of the most golden parts of the Golden Vale but farm sales in this area have performed well in recent years too."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/food/arid-40775415.html,2021-12-31 08:00:00,Wine With Leslie: Ring in the new year with Champagne that won't break the bank,"I think we need some Champagne. It is the one drink that suits all occasions from births to weddings to funerals - as Napoleon (or Churchill) likely never said, in victory you deserve it and in defeat you need it.
I am always a bit shocked to hear that there are people out there that don’t like Champagne and my personal view is they simply haven’t tried hard enough. 
Besides, Champagne is not just for toasting the new year or new baby, it is also a match for a surprising number of difficult to pair dishes such as sushi, asparagus, warm salads, dim sum and even curry (just go easy on the chilli). Champagne is also a perfect match for shellfish, Smoked Salmon, Caviar and Blinis and virtually all pastry-based quiches and tarts.
We don’t know yet what 2022 will bring, but I think we have learned by now to be prepared for anything, so I recommend that you buy extra bottles of Champagne as at this time of year it is at its very cheapest. I suggest you buy enough to see you through to Valentine’s Day at least.
Now the bad news is that the supply situation has worsened considerably in the last few weeks and a number of shops I rang told me that they were struggling to get stocks of almost all of the Grand Marque Houses, not just Bollinger which ran out in mid-November.
Irish consumers are very brand conscious so one solution is to look for small negociant houses and Grower Champagnes - Independent wine merchants are your best bet. Grower Champagne is made by small producers who grow 95% of the grapes themselves. Sadly not much of the really good stuff makes it out of France as production is small.
Champagne has around 16,000 growers but only around 5,000 of those make their own wine and around half of these simply hand the job over to their local cooperative. Look out for the initials RM in small writing on the back label which means Récoltant-Manipulant (grower-made) as opposed to RC (Récoltant Coopérateur) where the Co-Op makes it for the grower. The big brands (and many smaller ones) will have NM on the label (Negociant-Manipulant) and Co-Op brands ‘CM’.
Below I’ve recommended some Champagnes I like that had reasonable availability at the time of writing. Happy Hunting and Happy New Year.

Beaumont des Crayères Grand Reserve NV Champagne - €29.99 (was €36.99)
Beaumont des Crayères Grand Reserve NV Champagne - €29.99 (was €36.99)
Stockist: O'Briens
From a small quality-focused co-op with around 250 growers, most of whom own less than a hectare. I went through a couple of bottles of this during lockdown this year and was reminded of how good it is. Pear, citrus and fresh baked croissant aromas, textured and rounded on the palate with touches of lemon oil and lime zest. The Rosé (€40) and Vintage (€45) are also recommended.
L. Bénard-Pitois Brut ‘Carte Blanche’ Champagne, France - €34 (was €39)
L. Bénard-Pitois Brut ‘Carte Blanche’ Champagne, France - €34 (was €39)
Stockist: Whelehans Wines Loughlinstown
Founded in 1878 this family owned ‘RM’ Grower Champagne is excellent value and a good find by David Whelehan of Whelehan's Wines. Sourced from Premier Cru vineyards this pours with a faint pink hue and lots of almond, buttery brioche and sweet apple aromas, fruity, creamy and rounded on the palate with soft pear fruits and lingering apple pie flavours. Gorgeous.
Tesco Finest Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Champagne 2015 - €35
Tesco Finest Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Champagne 2015 - €35
Stockist: Tesco
All the supermarkets have deals but Tesco often has the largest range of Grande Marque Champagnes at discount prices. Tesco’s own label should not be dismissed however as they source from one of the best Co-Ops. This is great value for a six year old Blanc de Blancs Vintage Champagne - pear and lemon aromas with toast and smoke notes, apple-fruity and bone dry on the palate with lingering lime and grapefruit flavours.
Fizz Over €40
Pol Roger Brut Reserve NV Champagne - €58.95
Stockists: Castle Tralee, Whelehans, Celtic Whiskey Shop, Vintry, JusdeVine, winesoftheworld.ie
This may be difficult to find as stocks are low this year. Pol Roger white label is one of favourite non vintage Champagnes and one worth ageing. Floral and citrus aromas with nutty biscuit notes, creamy pear and apple with lime essence hints, pleasingly crisp without being sharp and with a long, layered finish.
Piper Heidsieck Champagne NV - France - €54.99
Veuve Clicquot Vintage Champagne 2012 - €90.00
Stockists: Widely available but stocks are limited: Bradleys, Tesco, Deveneys, WorldWideWines, Martins, Baggot St. Wines.
Veuve Clicquot may be the second biggest Champagne House but always performs well in blind tastings and the NV has a high proportion of vintage wines. The 2012 is one of the best Vintage Veuve’s I’ve tasted - biscuity and creamy on the nose with layers of supple fruits, zings of lemon and apple, and a zesty citrus focused finish.
Piper Heidsieck Champagne NV - France - €54.99
Piper Heidsieck Champagne NV - France - €54.99
Stockists: JJ O’Driscolls, O’Donovans, The Wine Centre, Blackrock Cellar, The Vintry, Donnybrook Fair, Fresh, Castle Tralee, O’Briens Nationwide
I rang around prior to filing this column and Piper Heidsieck was the one Champagne which everyone seemed to have in stock (besides Moët). If it is good enough for Marilyn and Villanelle (in Killing Eve) it is good enough for me. Lemon zest & brioche aromas, soft lemon zest and yellow apple flavour with lingering toasted almonds on the finish.

Stockists: Bradleys, CraftCentral.ie, No 21 Off, Baggot Street Wines, Celtic Whiskey Bar, Galvin's, Martin's.
If the above hasn’t convinced you about Champagne I recommend this gorgeous Barleywine from the creative hub that is 8 Degrees brewery in Mitchelstown. The Original Gravity series (to commemorate 10 years) has celebrated five Irish artists this year already and this label is by Coireall Carroll Kent.
This pours a pleasing red-gold colour with roasted almonds and dried fruit aromas - toffee, butterscotch and baked banana on the palate with flashes of red fruits, and lingering salted caramel on the finish. This is best served cool (8 degrees should do it) - try with blue cheese, spiced beef or chocolate."

Market researcher Kantar said Tesco's grocery sales in Britain over the 12 weeks to St Stephen's Day fell by almost 1% versus the same period in 2020, when several areas in Britain faced Covid-19 restrictions that boosted food sales. On a two-year basis, Tesco's sales were up by over 10%.
Its UK grocery market share rose to 27.9%, a four-year high.
Kantar said total British grocery sales were £31.7bn (€37bn) over the 12 weeks, down 3% compared with 2020 but up 8% on 2019. Irish supermarket figures are likely to show the same trends when Kantar release them next week.         
Rivals in Britain, Sainsbury's, Asda, and Morrisons saw their sales fall by 4.4%, 3.9% and 6.5% respectively over the 12-week period compared with 2020, though they were up 5.8%, 3.5% and 5.8% respectively on a two-year basis.
Tesco's increasing dominance reflects the unmatched scale of its store and online operations, the success of its ""Clubcard Prices"" loyalty scheme and its ability to withstand supply chain disruption.

Tesco Ireland opt to buy Galway supermarket chain to boost market share
In October, Tesco raised its full-year earnings forecast. Some analysts believe it may raise that again when it updates on trading on January 13. 
Its shares rose almost 1% on Wednesday, extending year-on-year gains to 25%. That values Tesco at almost £22.75bn.
Shares in Sainsbury's, which updates on trading on January 12, were also up 1%.
""The data suggests that while there weren't formal (Covid-19) rules in place across the UK this year, many people celebrated at home again due to Omicron,"" said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight.
He noted that premium own-label sales broke records this Christmas with shoppers spending £627m on supermarkets' own upmarket lines over the four weeks to December 26, an increase of 6.8% compared with 2020.
Kantar said grocery price inflation reached 3.5% in December, its highest since spring 2020, adding nearly £15 to shoppers' average monthly grocery bills. It said British prices were rising fastest in markets such as fresh beef, savoury snacks, and skincare, while falling in fresh bacon, bath and shower products and spirits.
Last month, the Bank of England revised up its inflation forecast to predict British consumer price inflation would peak at a 30-year high of around 6% in April.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40778784.html,2022-01-05 12:49:00,Beef Markets: No indication of post-Christmas overhang as prices start to tighten,"As the beef factories resumed operations this week, following the festive season break, there was little for the livestock suppliers to cheer about.
On the face of it, the official quotes being given to farmers this week are unchanged from the pre-Christmas trade, but the bottom line is that the returns will be down on the December sales.
There has been a firm tightening in the prices being paid with the 'top-up' on the quoted prices, worth around 5 cents/kg before Christmas, no longer available.
The base for steers is being quoted at 425 cents/kg on a 'take it or leave it' policy by the factory agents, who appear not to be over-concerned at not getting the stock, if they have to cost more.
It is a similar policy for heifers on a base of 430 cents/kg for this week's purchases.
There are some supplies going through the plants this week at higher prices, having been advanced purchased by the factories, but the overall indication is for tighter prices, at least in the short term.
January is normally a quiet month for consumer demand for beef in the aftermath of the festive celebrations and there is not the same pressure on the processors to get large supplies to fill the orders on their books.
The young bull prices have eased by around 5 cents/kg and are now trailing the similar grade steer price by 5 cents/kg, a reversal of the parity of the steer and young bull price pre Christmas.
The R grade young bulls are being quoted at 420 cents/kg this week and O grade at 410 cents/kg.
While any tightening in the price will not be welcome news to finishers, the positive side is that there is reasonable optimism for the trade forward.
There is no indication of any overhang of beef in the factory stores, which is a positive, and as the consumer demand picks up through this month, the factories will require good numbers of prime cattle in particular.
All the focus over the coming weeks will shift to the potential for the spring prices. 
Store cattle purchases over the past three months have been costly and finishers have had to meet higher feed costs.
The cow prices continue to return up to 390 cents/kg for R grade with the prices ranging from 380 cents/kg."

Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue has revealed that the latest Central Statistics Office trade figures for the end of the third quarter showed that 2021 has been a period of value growth for Irish food exports.
With food commodity prices at a relatively high level, and the UK Government postponing new January customs and import requirements, there is a good chance that last quarter food exports will be high enough to continue the annual momentum that has seen exports of food and drink from Ireland increase by 16% in value since 2016.
In the Dáil, Minister McConalogue said the value of agri-food exports was up €711 million or 6.8% in the first three quarters of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. It was up €446m or 4.2% on the same period in 2019.
He said dairy produce, beef and beverages constituted the most valuable commodity categories, accounting for €6.6 billion, or 59% of the value of agri-food exports from January to September in 2021. The nine-month value of €11.18bn compares with last year’s full annual total of €13bn.

Beef Markets: No indication of post-Christmas overhang as prices start to tighten
At €1.7bn, the value of beef exports has been virtually unchanged in the years 2019 to 2021. Dairy exports averaged €3.8bn in the same timeframe.
Irish sheep meat is having another consecutive year of significant growth. According to the CSO, the value was up almost €15m, or 6%, compared to 2020, and nearly €50m, or 20%, 2019, compared to 2019.
Minister McConalogue said there has been an overall trend over the last three years of a gradual shift away from reliance on the UK market for the four main meat species and dairy produce.
Nevertheless, exports of Irish agri-food products to the UK have recovered compared to earlier in the year, and are up for the first three quarters of the year by €421m, or 11.3%. September was a good month for food exports, with CSO statistics indicating that agri-food exports had been only 5.8% up at the end of August.
And the statistics indicate that exports of Irish agri-food products to the UK jumped from 9.5% ahead (of 2020) at the end of August to 11.3% ahead at the end of September.
Examining figures for exports to Britain, Minister McConalogue said, 2021 exports to the end of August were up by €34m or 1.3%, having recovered from being down 20% at the end of March.
Meanwhile, exports to NI have been exceptionally strong, up 39%, or €272m, compared to 2020, by the end of August. Exports to Northern Ireland were up 19% by the end of March.
Also pointing to a lift in Irish exports was data from HM Revenue & Customs showing the UK imported 28,500 tonnes of fresh and frozen beef in September, 34% (or 7,000 tonnes) more than was shipped during August, or during September in 2020.
Volumes increased from all key suppliers, most notably from Ireland (up 5,100 tonnes), according to data, which is collated by the UK Government.

2021: An exceptional year on all counts - including beef prices
The Minister said the 2021 food and drink trade figures demonstrate the remarkable resilience of these Irish sectors, in the face of market disruptions such as Brexit and Covid.
He said his Department and its agencies will continue to remain focused on maximising Irish agri-food exports globally: “I’m extremely proud of the fact that we produce enough food to feed nine times our population. 
""Our agriculture sector employs nearly 165,000 people here. We want to make sure these jobs are secure into the long-term.”
Irish exports will be boosted by Bord Bia’s recent winning of the contract to promote EU beef, lamb, dairy and horticulture across Asia, Europe and the US in three campaigns valued at €13.4 million for the next three years. Since 2016, the value of Irish food and drink exports to Asia has increased 14% to €1.4 billion.

Fadó, fadó, back in the 1990s when Dublin was still a cheap place to live, the area around Portobello near Camden Street suddenly seemed to be filled with Middle Eastern shops selling merguez sausages, doughy filled Murtabak/Paratha flatbread, pomegranates, tahini, fresh coriander and honey-sweet flaky baklava pastries.
I was thrilled, I already had a well-thumbed copy of Claudia Roden’s Book of Middle Eastern Food but had struggled to find some ingredients. Even now it is probably my favourite comfort food, and when I eat hummus, falafel or baked aubergines it brings me back to that time in my life. 
These days thanks to Yotam Ottolenghi the cuisine of Lebanon, Israel, Egypt and Iran is much loved and almost commonplace so I probably don’t need to explain further.
So as you read this you are probably still feeling full from Christmas feasting and you need some excitement in your life. Travelling to Beirut or Tel Aviv probably isn’t an option so I recommend you head to Drumcondra to visit Shouk as we did in early December.
Chicken pitta at Shouk
Begin with the Large Mezze Platter (€35) which includes a mound of nutty rich Falafel and fresh-made Pita bread to put them in along with hummus and mildly bracing Yemeni Zhug chilli sauce. 
The Pita in Shouk is fluffy and lightly doughy and quite different to the dried out anaemic supermarket ones, so you will find yourself digging into the babaganoush with it and gathering clumps of aubergine and carrot salad. 
You may think your mouth isn’t big enough, but it is.
Chicken skewers (€14.50) and grilled chicken thighs will get stuffed into more pita with tomato and cucumber salad and of course you need the Schnitzel crispy breaded chicken pita (€11) and the Kababella Pita (€12) with succulent minced lamb and beef with gherkins, hummus and chimichurri. 
The Za'atar herb flavours on the pita for the chicken skewers will sing through the other flavours nicely, softened by the sweet grilled red onion and cherry tomato, and lifted by the chilli and the bitter notes from the tahini and the citrus tang of the Sumac.
The Cauliflower at Shouk
The Vegan and the Veganuary temporary convert will wonder where Shouk has been all their life because of course you also order The Cauliflower (€12.50). A whole roasted volleyball-sized veggie beast covered with tomato salsa, zhug, grilled cherry tomatoes, and dotted with jewelled pomegranate seeds - it’s spectacular. 
Textured, rich and earthy, you may wonder as I always do why it is so much more interesting than the other members of the brassica family. It’s like a reverse Corrs - the Shouk Cauliflower in fact is Andrea, Sharon and Caroline all rolled into one - who needs Jim broccoli, Jim sprout or Jim turnip?
The draught Spanish lager will wash some of this down but given the complexity of the food you will want to order a bottle of Château Ksara Reserve du Couvent for the bargain price of €34. Ksara was founded by Jesuits and is Lebanon’s oldest winery - its savoury, sweet, baked red fruit flavours and light spice notes rounds out the flavours in Shouk's dishes remarkably well.
For dessert a plate of flaky honeyed pistachio baklava for a mere €8 might need some coffee or mint tea to balance the sweetness. Or opt for the Malabi (€7), the classic Turkish dessert with coconut cream, coconut flakes, pistachios and rosewater - a richly scented fluffy milky mousse with texture from the coconut and floral richness that lingers on the palate thanks to the rosewater.
We filled five cartons with leftovers so you will want to do the same, just remember to order lots of extra Pita for takeout as you know you will need them in the coming days. By the end of the week you will be rooting through your Ottolenghi books hoping to recreate some of the dishes and the dark month of January will seem a whole lot brighter.
The Tab:
Dinner for Four including a large Mezze sharing plate, salads, hummus, extra pitta, mounds of meat and vegetables, dessert, beers, and a bottle of wine cost just €146.00
The Verdict:
Food: 8.5/10
Drinks: 8/10
Service: 9/10
Ambiance: 9/10
Value: 9.5/10
In a Sentence:
Shouk serves generous portions of extra tasty Middle-Eastern food perfect for sharing and exactly the kind of restaurant you want to visit on a cold winter day (or a hot sunny one for that matter).

Restaurant review: An authentic taste of Syria in Shandon at The Four Liars "
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40783242.html,2022-01-12 07:00:00,New Year begins with an increased demand for beef,"Signs of a strengthening in the trade for cows at the factories and the turnaround by one of the major UK supermarkets on the stocking of Irish beef are positive omens for the trade this week.
January is usually a quieter month for prime beef sales, with a normal drop off in consumer demand post-Christmas, but the early days of 2022 have started with increased demand for manufacturing beef to replenish depleted stocks.
As a result, the factories in some areas of the country and keenly anxious to source more cows and stronger demand has resulted in the processors improving their prices by up to 10 cents/kg.
Large numbers of R grade cows are reporting to be fetching up to 400 cents/kg at the top paying factories for this week with a pro-rata improvement in the prices down the line for the lesser quality grades.
There is an old held belief in the beef sector that the cow price is the barometer for the prime beef forward and price movement for the cows is regularly the advance of what's to come for other categories.
The prime beef prices are holding stable at the factories this week, with quotes unchanged from the early post-Christmas days.
The base for steers continues at 425 cents/kg and very little more to be got for trying a hand at hard selling. Post-Christmas demand for beef is not hectic and the plants are happy enough with the current intake, which has relieved them of pressure to deal with producers for stronger supplies.
This means that the base for heifers is also stable at 430 cents/kg for most of the intake. Some suppliers of heifers are reporting up to 435 cents/kg being paid for larger lots from regular suppliers, but not generally on the table.
Prices for the young bulls have eased a shade, falling behind parity with the equivalent grade steer by around 5 cents/kg this week on a base of 420 cents/kg for the R's, indicative that the pressure of requiring the young bulls to make up any deficit in the steer supply has eased.
Meantime the decision of the major UK supermarket group Asda to restock Irish beef on their shelves is a welcome boost to demand for beef animals and confidence forward in the trade with UK.
The intake of stock at the factories for the first week of 2022 was sharply down across all categories adding up to an aggregate decline exceeding 6,000 head overall compared to the start of 2021.
Supply for the week fell back to 26,810 head compared to more than 33,000 head supplied for the corresponding week last year.
There was 8,887 steers, 8,723 heifers, 3,030 young bulls, and 5,217 cows making up last week's kill"

Those are the questions that people have been asking themselves over the last year and the answer is: Yes, we can — and the Good Friday Agreement prepares the way for this.
Some people don’t need to be convinced, others will never be convinced, but more still (North and South) are giving it consideration and have yet to make up their minds.
As a United Ireland within Europe, we will not be doubling up on services, two healthcare systems, two tax systems, two civil services, but we will be able to attract more foreign direct investment to the whole island, increase tourism to the whole island, and benefit from being in the EU.
David McWilliams in his book Renaissance Nation stated: ‘In short, in pure budgetary terms, there is little doubt that the Republic’s economy could absorb the North, even before the commercial dynamism of unification kicks in.’ So, to answer the question, should we? We should of course. Everybody on the island North and South will benefit, and we will benefit for generations.
But this will require planning and preparation. Putting our heads in the sand is not going to work. We need to convene a Citizens’ Assembly and have ordinary people from all walks of life give their views and opinions.

Cows’ milk gives proven nutrition to all of our bodies.
Animal husbandry comes under attack
Cows serve a very important part of all our children’s daily lives. The milk they produce during their lives gives proven nutrition to all of our bodies.
Environmental groups are too busy bashing animal husbandry and should be asked to show a way forward on how to feed people a proven, balanced diet before they get rid of the most proven food sources obtained from animals for generations.
Vegan products fall very far short of what our bodies need. One of the selling points of vegan products is that they taste the same, however, they fall very short when it comes to nutrition. The many mouth-watering nutritional delicious products we get from dairy, beef, poultry, mutton, and pigs that our farmers produce every day — and which sustain life itself — are under attack.

League tables are a bad measure for schools
It is good to see that even amidst uncertain times courtesy of the ongoing pandemic, the media obsession with ranking schools and league tables shows no signs of abating — ‘Munster feeder school rankings reveals dominance of fee-paying schools in Cork’ (Irish Examiner, January 7). The measure of a school is much more than how many of its students ‘progress’ to further education of any kind. Your publication over the years has highlighted what is often described as college ‘drop out’ rates. Therefore, we should educate our post-primary students not with university or further education in mind but rather we must endeavour to instil a desire for lifelong learning, encouraging all students to flourish. A broad holistic education that appeals to our students’ hearts, as well as their minds, can never be adequately captured in a league table.

Will minimum pricing on alcohol deter drinking? Picture: Sasko Lazarov/RollingNews.ie
Price no deterrent for some drinkers
The Government’s introduction of minimum alcohol pricing is a progressive step if it encourages people to drink a little less. It reminds me of one of the many stories my late father told me about the customers of the family pub. The stories were embellished with each telling but we're all the better for it.
John arrived at the pub around 8pm every evening. He drank three pints of Guinness before closing time. He enjoyed the company of his fellow customers discussing Austin Stacks football, greyhounds, horse racing, and the news of the day. He then walked home where he lived alone. John was a typical social drinker — good company and a refreshing pint were a perfect match.
When the price of the pint was increased by 10%, the regular drinkers humorously called down every misfortune on the powers that be above in Dublin, but the porter continued to flow regardless. Making his way to John, who was sitting contentedly by the fire, Dad asked: “Will you still follow the pint at the new price, John?” “My dear man,” replied John. “I’ll follow it to Hell. Drinking the juice of the barley in such pleasant company is priceless.”
John has long since gone to his eternal rest. On the evening of John’s removal, Dad filled a pint glass with draught Guinness, funnelled it into a bottle, corked the bottle and wrapped it in an Austin Stacks GAA black and amber sock. He placed the ‘pint in a bottle’ alongside John’s remains, to quench his thirst on the final journey.

What's your view on this issue?
You can tell us here
Using wind energy to create green hydrogen for energy storage would cut our dependence on foreign gas production.
Hydrogen fuel technology needed
We really need to start looking at how we can store wind energy so we aren’t left reliant on natural gas imports to produce electricity. At low demand times wind turbines are turned off if they are producing too much electricity and I really see that as a horrible waste. Ideally, the government should be getting the ball rolling faster on green hydrogen storage which we can burn at high demand times to produce electricity when the wind isn’t blowing. Natural gas isn’t as ‘clean’ as some government sources and companies like to call it either. Comparing it to coal or peat isn’t a high bar to be setting for ranking something as clean. Not only will the development of green hydrogen technology ensure energy security it allows us to heat houses and power transport which is extremely important if we are to cut emissions and have energy independence.

One way to mark St Brigid’s Day
There are many who will be left wondering about Leo Varadkar’s proposal that St Brigid’s Day be made a new bank holiday.
I will always remember her feast day being marked by the TV news clips of a man being wrestled to the ground by gardaí at a shrine to her because it was deemed he was breaking Covid rules by being there.
He was taken away in a paddy wagon. Come back, St Brigid, if you dare, all is not forgiven for some.

Leave fine dining for charity dinners
There are some differences between what was available in the hotel where Novak Djokovic was staying — the accommodation centre with long term refugees and photos of mouldy bread — and where he might be playing —the Melbourne Tennis centre where a special ‘table’ of 16 costs AUS$12,479 (€7,950) although that meal is created by a top chef and restaurant.
Obviously, people can pay for anything they can afford but what about considering those less fortunate. A donation of this size would feed a large number of people including the option of non-mouldy food. The karma and positive publicity, from such a donation would last much longer than a full stomach.
There are so many people that need food even just the basics. People should consider a charitable donation instead of high priced dining, the tennis will be just as exciting.

Letters to the Editor: Minimum pricing for alcohol is robbery"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40787181.html,2022-01-15 08:00:00,"'Hope value' pushes farm land to €18,000/acre near Cashel","South Tipperary, close to Cashel, and full of rich grass: these are three qualifications to set pulses racing for anyone on the lookout for quality Golden Vale land.
This part of Munster has long been an important touchstone in terms of land prices, and a 33-acre holding that’s brand new to the market with Cashel Marts will be one to watch in the coming weeks.
It's relatively modest size ensuring that it fits the budgets of a wide range of potential buyers.
The farm is in the townland of Knocksaintlour, immediately to the south of Cashel.
“It’s a great piece of ground,” says selling agent Alison De Vere Hunt. 
“I was out walking it only last week, and you could actually put cattle out on it at this time of year – it’s that good.”
The property includes a long stretch of public road frontage and is less than a kilometre from Junction 9 of the M8, giving it unrivalled access for use as an outside farm or indeed, for any agricultural use. 
“It’s suitable for a range of different farming methods,” confirmed De Vere Hunt of the land, which is located on the edge of the town Cashel and which boasts magnificent views of the famous Rock of Cashel and the Galtee Mountains.
“There is a ‘hope value' coming with this property,” said Ms De Vere Hunt. “Because there's so little within the town environs now in terms of development land where you can build a house – everything has been either developed or the pockets are so small. 
""This property is literally a minute off the motorway. It’s a fine safe plot of ground and it’s nicely elevated.
“There are no farm buildings with it, but for somebody, say, with a few horses and were using it to train them, it’s a nice layout for that purpose.”
Aside from the strong agricultural pedigree of South Tipperary, the entire county’s star has risen to new heights in the last couple of months with the listing of Tipperary by influential American publication Condé Nast Traveller as one of the top places to visit in the world in 2022.Cashel itself featured heavily in the report on the Premier County.
All of that adds to the appeal of the holding but the real attraction remains the land itself.
“It’s really top quality,” said Ms De Vere Hunt. “You could go in in the morning and plough it if you wanted to.”
There are no entitlements coming with the farm and the guide price is €600,000. This translates to €18,000 per acre. 
It’s a strong price, but it won’t be surprising to see that figure going higher as the weeks go on. This is a piece of ground with all the advantages in an area where dairy farmers, tillage farmers, beef cattle farmers and strong equestrian operations all vie for the same pieces of quality land when they come on the market.
The farm is so new to the market that it’s still too early to get an accurate picture of the reaction so far. 
However, there’s no doubt that there are punters ready to move on a piece of ground such as this.
“I’d be expecting there to be plenty of interest,” said Ms De Vere Hunt. 
“I’ve spoken to a number of people to let them know that it would be coming up – people who have expressed an interest in this kind of property, so I think that this land will garner a lot of interest; probably from a lot of different sectors too.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40787190.html,2022-01-19 10:10:00,Scenic 21-acre farm hits the market in Waterford,"Brand new to the market is a 20.9-acre farm in a very scenic part of east Co Waterford – a spot where few tracts of land have made their way onto the market in recent years, according to the selling agent.
The property is located in the townland of Kilclooney, about 8km from the village of Kilmacthomas and within a 25-minute drive of Waterford City.
“The farm is in two divisions,” said Margaret Harty of Dungarvan-based Harty and Co Auctioneers.
“They’re roughly the same size and divided by the public road... It’s good quality land – all in permanent pasture.”
The Comeragh Mountains form a dramatic backdrop to the property, and the surrounding area is dominated by a vibrant agricultural community, where a mixture of beef cattle and dairy farming are equally dominant.
“There should be quite a bit of interest in the local area,” said Ms Harty. “Because it’s quite a progressive farming area, there would be a lot of people with dairying interests and there are quite a few involved in cattle and sheep farming too.”
The agent also mentions the outside possibility of planning permission to build a house on it. 
The price reflects a purely agricultural value, but its location suggests the right person may well be able to live on the land – something that would make it somewhat more attractive to someone looking long-term.
There are entitlements with the farm, further details of which can be obtained from the selling agents.
The price guide of €180,000 (€8,600/acre) reflects its quality and its location. However, it will be interesting to see whether this holding will sell in separate lots or as one entire holding. 
Either way, the fact that the public road dissects the farm means it is a highly accessible one.
“Land doesn’t come up in this area very often, and it’s an opportunity to increase an existing holding or to acquire land in the area... there would be quite a number of people in the locality on the lookout for land,"" added Ms Harty."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-40789446.html,2022-01-20 13:33:00,Russia accuses the West of ‘plotting provocations’ over Ukraine,"Russia accused the West on Thursday of plotting “provocations” in Ukraine and disguising its alleged intentions by fomenting concerns about Moscow planning aggressive military action in the neighbouring country.
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, alleged that Ukrainian and Western claims of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine were a “cover for staging large-scale provocations of their own, including those of military character”.
“They may have extremely tragic consequences for the regional and global security,” Zakharova said.
She pointed to the delivery of weapons to Ukraine by British military transport planes in recent days, claiming that Ukraine perceives Western military assistance as a “carte blanche for a military operation in Donbas”.

Donbas, located in eastern Ukraine, is under control of Russia-backed separatists who have fought Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years, a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people.
Ukraine said earlier this week that it has taken the delivery of anti-tank missiles from the UK. It has rejected Moscow’s claims that it plans an offensive to reclaim control of separatist-held areas in the country’s eastern industrial heartland.
Ukraine’s government, the US and its Nato allies have expressed intensifying concerns in recent weeks over a Russian troop build-up near Ukraine.
The concentration of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine has fuelled Western fears that Moscow is poised to attack its neighbour.
US president, Joe Biden, said on Wednesday he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine and warned President Vladimir Putin that his country would pay a “dear price” in lives lost and a possible cut-off from the global banking system if it does.
Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to launch an offensive. But it has sought a set of security guarantees from the West that would exclude NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and the deployment of alliance weapons there.

Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the US threat to cut off Russia from the global banking system could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to use force to reclaim control of the rebel east.
“It may implant false hopes in the hotheads of some representatives of the Ukrainian leadership who may decide to quietly restart a civil war in their country,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.
Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands in security talks last week but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities.
Amid the tensions, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited Ukraine on Wednesday to reassure it of Western support. He travelled to Berlin on Thursday to meet with his British, French and German counterparts to discuss Ukraine and other security matters.
Blinken is set to deliver a speech on the Ukraine crisis later on Thursday in the German capital before flying on to Geneva, where he will meet Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, on Friday.
Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is scheduled to arrive on Thursday in Poland, which has long supported Ukraine’s efforts to integrate more closely into the West.
Our difficulties are not with Russia or with its people. Our difficulties are with the dangerous policies of the Kremlin
Deputy foreign minister, Marcin Przydacz, said in a Thursday morning radio interview that Poland is offering its political and diplomatic support to Ukraine, but he would not say whether military aid would be extended amid the Russian troop build-up.
The head of the European Union’s executive arm, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated on Thursday that the EU “will respond with massive economic and financial sanctions” if Russia invades Ukraine.
She said the EU is by far Russia’s biggest trading partner, as well as the biggest investor in the country.
“We hope an attack won’t happen, but if it does, we are prepared,” Von der Leyen said during an online speech to the Davos business forum.
“Our difficulties are not with Russia or with its people. Our difficulties are with the dangerous policies of the Kremlin.”
In a move that further beefs up forces near Ukraine, Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from the country’s far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games that run through February.
Ukrainian officials have said that Moscow could use Belarusian territory to launch a potential multi-pronged invasion.
On Thursday, Russia also announced sweeping naval drills that would involve 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft.
The Russian defence ministry said that the exercise that will run through February will be conducted in both littoral waters and some more distant areas that are “operationally important,” including the Mediterranean, north-eastern Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean."

The statements on Monday come as concerns abound that Moscow is planning to invade Ukraine.
The Western alliance’s statement summed up moves already announced by individual member countries, but restating them under the Nato banner appeared to be aimed at showing the alliance’s resolve.
It was just one of a series of announcements that signalled the West is ramping up its rhetoric in the information war that has accompanied the Ukraine stand-off.
Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border and is demanding that Nato promise it will never allow Ukraine to join and that other actions, such as stationing alliance troops in former Soviet bloc countries, be curtailed.
Some of these, such as any pledge to permanently bar Ukraine, are non-starters for Nato – creating a seemingly intractable stand-off that many fear can only end in war.
Russia denies it is planning an invasion, and has said the Western accusations are merely a cover for Nato’s own planned provocations.
Recent days have seen high-stakes diplomacy that failed to reach any breakthrough and manoeuvring on both sides.
On Monday, Nato said that it is beefing up its “deterrence” in the Baltic Sea area.
Denmark is sending a frigate and deploying F-16 war planes to Lithuania, Spain is sending four fighter jets to Bulgaria and three ships to the Black Sea to join Nato naval forces, and France stands ready to send troops to Romania.
The Netherlands also plans to send two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria from April.
Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will “take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies”.

He said: “We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed that it was Nato and the US who were behind “tensions escalating” in Europe, not Russia.
“All this is happening not because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is happening because of what Nato, the US are doing,” Mr Peskov said during a conference call with reporters.
He also cited US media reports suggesting that Russia is evacuating its diplomats from Ukraine, something officials in Moscow denied.
The Nato announcement came as European Union foreign ministers sought to put on a fresh display of unity in support of Ukraine, and paper over concerns about divisions on the best way to confront any Russian aggression.
In a statement, the ministers said the EU has stepped up sanction preparations and they warned that “any further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs”.

Separately, the EU also committed to increase financial support for embattled Ukraine, vowing to push through a special package of 1.2 billion euros (£1 billion) in loans and grants as soon as possible.
The West is nervously watching Russian troop movements and war games in Belarus for any signs that a new invasion of Ukraine is imminent.
Russia has already invaded Ukraine once, annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.
Moscow has also supported pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists fighting the Kyiv government in the Donbass region.
Fighting in eastern Ukraine has killed around 14,000 people and still simmers.
Asked whether the EU would follow a US move and order the families of European embassy personnel in Ukraine to leave, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said: “We are not going to do the same thing.”
He said he is keen to hear from US secretary of state Antony Blinken about that decision.

Britain on Monday also announced it is withdrawing some diplomats and dependents from its embassy in Kyiv.
The Foreign Office said the move was “in response to the growing threat from Russia”.
Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said the US decision was “a premature step” and a sign of “excessive caution”.
He said that Russia is sowing panic among Ukrainians and foreigners in order to destabilise Ukraine.
Germany has issued no order but it has announced that the families of embassy staffers may leave if they wish.
Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock stressed that “we must not contribute to unsettling the situation further; we need to continue to support the Ukrainian government very clearly and above all maintain the stability of the country”.
Arriving at the EU meeting, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said he would inform his counterparts that Russia plans to hold war games 240 kilometres (150 miles) off Ireland’s south-west coast – in international waters but within Ireland’s exclusive economic zone.
“This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine,” Mr Coveney said.

“The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome.”
Some of the member countries closest to Russia – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – have confirmed that they plan to send US-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, a move endorsed by the United States.
But questions have been raised about just how unified the EU is.
Diverse political, business and energy interests have long divided the 27-country bloc in its approach to Moscow.
Around 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports come from Russia, much of it via pipelines across Ukraine – and many are skittish about being cut off from that supply in winter, with prices already soaring.
The EU’s two major powers appear most cautious.
French President Emmanuel Macron has renewed previously rejected calls for an EU summit with Mr Putin.

Late on Saturday, the head of the German navy, Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach, resigned after coming under fire for saying that Ukraine would not regain the Crimean Peninsula, and for suggesting that Mr Putin deserves “respect”.
Still, diplomats and officials said hard-hitting sanctions are being drawn up with the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission.
They were reluctant to say what the measures might be or what action by Russia might trigger them, but said they would come within days of any attack.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-40807698.html,2022-02-14 10:33:00,German leader in Ukraine for talks as fears of Russian invasion grow,"German chancellor Olaf Scholz has visited Ukraine as part of a flurry of Western diplomacy aimed at heading off a feared Russian invasion that some warn could be just days away.
Mr Scholz plans to continue on to Moscow, where he will try to persuade Russian president Vladimir Putin to back down.
US officials have warned that Russia could attack Ukraine this week.
Moscow denies it has any such plans, but has massed more than 130,000 troops near Ukraine and, in the view of US officials, has built up enough firepower to launch an invasion on short notice.
With concerns rising that war could be imminent, some airlines cancelled flights to the Ukrainian capital and troops there unloaded fresh shipments of weapons from Nato members on Sunday.
The US, UK and other European nations have told their citizens to leave the country and Washington is also pulling most of its staff from the embassy in Kyiv.

Ukraine’s air traffic safety agency Ukraerorukh issued a statement declaring the airspace over the Black Sea to be a “zone of potential danger” because of Russian naval drills and recommended that planes avoid flying over the sea from February 14-19.
The US and its Nato allies have repeatedly warned that Russia will pay a high price for any invasion – but they have sometimes struggled to present a united front.
Mr Scholz’s government, in particular, has been criticised for refusing to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine or to spell out which sanctions it would support against Russia, raising questions about Berlin’s resolve to stand up to Moscow.

The chancellor’s visits this week will thus be closely watched for a signs of deviating from the message delivered by Washington and other Nato allies.
So far, those warnings appear to have had little effect: Russia has only beefed up troops and weapons in the region and launched massive drills in its ally Belarus, which also neighbours Ukraine.
The West fears that the exercises, which entered their decisive phase last week and will run until Sunday, could be used by Moscow as a cover for an invasion from the north.
Moscow wants guarantees from the West that Nato will not allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join as members, and that the alliance will halt weapon deployments to Ukraine and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe.
The US and Nato have flatly rejected those demands.
Some observers expect Moscow to eventually accept a compromise that would help avoid hostilities and allow all sides to save face.

While Nato refuses to shut the door to Ukraine, the alliance also has no intention of embracing it or any other ex-Soviet nation any time soon.
Some experts have floated ideas such as a moratorium on Nato expansion or a neutral status for Ukraine to defuse the tensions.
After a call on Saturday with Mr Putin, US president Joe Biden said that invading Ukraine would cause “widespread human suffering” and that the West was committed to diplomacy to end the crisis but is “equally prepared for other scenarios”, the White House said.

Mr Biden also spoke to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for about an hour on Sunday, agreeing to keep pushing both deterrence and diplomacy to try to stave off a Russian offensive.
Mr Zelenskyy sought to play down the idea that a conflict was imminent, noting that Kyiv and other cities of Ukraine “are safe and under reliable protection”.
Officials also quoted him suggesting that a quick visit from Mr Biden would help de-escalate the situation – signalling Mr Zelensky’s hope the US leader might actually come to Ukraine.

That possibility was not mentioned in the White House summary of the call.
“I am convinced that your arrival in Kyiv in the coming days, which are crucial for stabilising the situation, will be a powerful signal and contribute to de-escalation,” Mr Zelensky was quoted by his office as telling Mr Biden.
The Biden administration has become increasingly outspoken about its concerns that Russia could create a false pretext for an invasion in the coming days.
Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bitter conflict since 2014, when Ukraine’s Kremlin-friendly leader was driven from office by a popular uprising.
Moscow responded by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and then backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed more than 14,000 people.
A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped halt large-scale battles, but regular skirmishes have continued, and efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled.

US warns more than 130,000 Russian troops amassed outside Ukraine"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-40815504.html,2022-02-24 12:29:00,Russia launches ‘full-scale war’ in Ukraine,"Russia has launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine, hitting cities and bases with air strikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.
Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in what it called a “full-scale war” that could rewrite the geopolitical order and whose fallout has already reverberated around the globe.
In announcing a major military operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin deflected global condemnation and cascading new sanctions – and chillingly referred to his country’s nuclear arsenal as he threatened any foreign country attempting to interfere with “consequences you have never seen”.
Nato’s chief said the “brutal act of war” shattered peace on the European continent, as the US-led alliance mobilised more troops to move towards eastern Europe.
Sirens rang out in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and people massed in train stations and took to roads, as the government said the former Soviet republic was seeing a long-anticipated invasion from the east, north and south and reported more than 40 soldiers had been killed and dozens wounded.
“A full-scale war in Europe has begun,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said.
“Russia is not only attacking Ukraine, but the rules of normal life in the modern world.”
World leaders condemned the attack, which could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government, upend the post-Cold War security order and result in severe economic impact around the world from soaring heating bills to spikes in food prices.
“We woke up in a different world today,” Germany’s foreign minister said, as Nato agreed to beef up air, land and sea forces on its eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia.
Global financial markets plunged and oil prices soared, and governments from the US to Asia and Europe readied new sanctions after weeks of failed efforts for a diplomatic solution.

But global powers have said they will not intervene militarily to defend Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law.
Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault were urged to stay home and not to panic, even as officials said Russian troops were rolling into Ukraine, and big explosions were heard in the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Odesa in the west.
“We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?” 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv.
She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter.
Mr Putin “will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him”, she said.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Mr Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine – a false claim the US had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.
He accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining Nato and for security guarantees.
His spokesman said on Thursday that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to “demilitarise” it.
Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels: “This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion. … Russia is using force to try to rewrite history.”
The attacks came first from the air.
Later Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage on Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea.

US President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the “unprovoked and unjustified attack”.
The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders.
More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced.
Mr Zelensky urged global leaders to provide defence assistance to Ukraine and help protect its airspace, and urged his compatriots to defend the nation.
Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba pleaded: “The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”
In the capital, mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.
The Russian Defence Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that “there is no threat to the civilian population”.
The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia started reverberating throughout the world.
World stock markets plunged and oil prices surged by nearly six dollars per barrel.
Market benchmarks tumbled in Europe and Asia and US futures were sharply lower.
Brent crude oil jumped to more than 100 dollars per barrel on Thursday on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies, while the rouble sank.

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Mr Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle.
In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, he warned that “no-one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor”.
Mr Putin’s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow’s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.
“The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” Mr Zelensky said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens.
“But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves.”
Mr Zelensky said he asked to arrange a call with Mr Putin late on Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Mr Putin’s move to authorise the deployment of the Russian military to “maintain peace” in eastern Ukraine, Mr Zelensky warned that “this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent”.
“Any provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,” he said.
The attack began even as the UN Security Council was holding an emergency meeting to hold off an invasion.
Members still unaware of Mr Putin’s announcement of the operation appealed to him to stand down.
UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling the Russian president: “Give peace a chance.”
European Council president Charles Michel and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen later promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.
“In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,” they said on Twitter."

Politicians across both Government and opposition parties have demanded the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) carry out a full investigation as motorists report massive increases at the pumps.
Despite a Government intervention to reduce excise on petrol by 20c and diesel by 15c per litre, prices are reportedly being hiked multiple times in the same day at some forecourts.
However, the CCPC has said it has no authority to stop fuel retailers from dramatically increasing costs as it ""does not have a role in monitoring price levels across the economy"".
""As businesses in Ireland have the power to decide how much they will charge consumers for products, this means that the CCPC does not have a role in reviewing or approving price increases. In very specific circumstances, where businesses form a cartel and collude to fix prices, the CCPC can investigate and refer a case to the DPP for criminal prosecution,"" the watchdog said.
Even before the war in Ukraine broke out, new figures show  consumer prices surged by 5.6% over the past year, the largest annual increase in almost 21 years.
According to the latest CSO figures, the transport sector saw the largest increase. with prices rising 15.4% while there was a 12.7% hike for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels.
The price of diesel rose 32.5%, petrol was up 30.3% and airfares 42.3%. The figures are to the end of February and do not include the surge in fuel costs caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has forced the Government to cut excise to provide relief for motorists and businesses.

Along with fuel prices, the cost of staple food items like a sliced pan of bread jumped 12.1c over the past year and bananas increased by 10.2c per kg.
Fianna Fáil TD Barry Cowen has written to  the CCPC, urging it to investigate the ""unjustified profiteering"" by some retailers, especially in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
Mr Cowen said he had previously called for the State’s watchdog to be turned into ""guard dogs on inflation"".
""As fuel price increases are showing, the powers of our watchdogs are not effective for gouging during a war. Even though this has been looming on energy prices, nothing has been done to beef up the consumer laws. That needs to happen now as a matter of urgency.
Social partnership also needs to be re-activated now too. The next challenge for the economy will be to tackle the inevitable rising wage demands from this opportunistic price gouging on a helpless public.""
Social Democrat co-leader Catherine Murphy also wrote to the CCPC to say she has “received dozens of emails from persons nationally stating that in their respective localities, forecourt garages are increasing their fuel prices a number of times throughout the day in unison"".
Wicklow TD Jennifer Whitmore said given that the Government's intervention was meant to ease the pressure on families and businesses ""there has to be a robust system, whereby the Government can be sure that that cut is being passed on"".
Speaking as he attended a meeting of leaders in Versailles, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said any price gouging on fuel during the ongoing war was ""exploiting the situation in a morally unacceptable way and that should cease"".

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40833842.html,2022-03-22 07:01:00,Brian Reidy: managing and complementing grazed grass this spring,"As the cost of inputs continue to rise and in some cases become hard to source, it is more important than ever to optimise utilisation of all feeds for both beef and milk production. 
As dairy herds start to look towards grazing both day and night after a difficult February, maintaining animal performance must be maintained by achieving good dry matter and energy intakes. This can be done by targeted buffer feeding of cows with complementary feed ingredients.
Buffer feeding is filling the feed gap between the energy requirements of a cow and the energy consumed by her from grazed grass. If there is a deficit, then the feed you give her is a buffer regardless of whether that is fed in the parlour, from a bale, out of a pit or through a mixer wagon.
As Spring hopefully dries up and there is the prospect of drier weather with cows remaining outside full time, the annual questions around what a dairy cow needs in addition to grass begin to surface. Obviously, it is cheaper and simpler to graze cows with little or no supplementation, but it’s also far less reliable to maintain intakes, milk production, milk solids, return on investment in genetic improvement and cow fertility. So, what is the answer to this annual debate? What is sensible for a 5,000-litre herd certainly is not realistic for one at 7,000 or 8,000 litres. Different genetics require different nutrition management. If you underfeed a cow, then it is not her fault when she has poor solids and doesn’t go back in calf. This does not make her a bad cow. Obviously, it is correct that optimising grass intake in an Irish milk production system must be the number one priority once grazing is possible.
Potential of Grazed Grass 
At its best, grazed grass can be capable of supporting in the region of 25 litres/cow/day plus maintenance. Some would claim more, but it’s not common and requires excellent management and ideal grazing conditions. To support 25 litres, intakes of over 100kg fresh grass per cow per day (17kg DM) are needed. In poor weather the cows graze and eat less, intakes drop, often to 10kg dry matter per cow per day or less, which will support maintenance plus 10 litres per cow at best. However, this is not an exact science, indeed quite the opposite, as breed, body weight, parity, stage of gestation and many other factors will need to be considered.
Having a good buffer feeding strategy
Buffer feeding is used to complement grass(physically and chemically), to maintain intakes, milk production, body condition and fertility. The main difficulty is in judging how much buffer feed should be offered. Some guidelines can be offered depending on target milk production, grass quality and availability.
Some key points 
· Turnout to grass should be gradual starting with three to four hours per day 
· Continuing with winter ration but add 56g cal mag 
· Followed by grazing all day, feeding less supplement, especially less protein.
· At no point should any buffer/complementary feed reduce intakes of grazed grass. It should be designed to improve grazed grass digestion and animal performance.
For higher yield potential cows/herd then, depending on the level of production cows can be offered a fibrous buffer feed via a mixer wagon or straight alternative forage (5kg-7kg dry matter per cow per day) ideally before or after morning milking. Any complementary forage or mix should ideally be fed in the morning so that cows can return to pasture in the evening with a strong appetite to consume the highest dry matter and highest sugar content grass of the day.
Dietary energy and the link to infertility
It is essential to meet the cow’s energy demands for both maintenance and production in early lactation. Invariably these demands are often not met, to compensate the cow begins to milk off her back by mobilising her own energy reserves to make up the deficit. It is the amount of energy that the cow pulls from her reserves that is the key to managing subsequent fertility rates in the herd.
Why worry about the energy status of the herd, simply put it is because as the cow breaks down its energy reserves at or around calving and in early lactation ketone production associated with fat break down in the body increases. This increase in ketone production will depress luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency, which in turn leads to poor or no follicular development and a delay in ovulation.
The earlier the timing of the first ovulation the greater the number of oestrus cycles that will occur prior to breeding.
Cows can indicate their energy status
The most reliable indicators of energy balance in a herd are overall dry matter intakes, milk protein percentage and body condition score (BCS). A herd with a steady milk protein of 3.3% or higher in early lactation is an indication that the energy status of that herd is pretty good. We can use the milk protein test to measure the energy status of the herd and the effectiveness of the ration offered. In general, it is fair to say that if the milk protein percentage is falling the cows are in negative energy balance and the cows will lose weight as they begin to milk of their back. If the milk protein percentage is rising the cows are in positive energy balance and gaining weight.
A rising milk protein even from a low base also indicates that the herd is in a positive energy status. Don’t get confused between milk protein and the protein content of the cow’s diet. As long as a diet is not severely deficient in protein then it will have little influence on the milk protein percentage. An extreme excess of dietary protein can result in using energy to excrete the surplus which has been shown to suppress milk protein in extreme cases. An excess dietary protein will also increase throughput of feed in the digestive system reducing nutrient absorption. Loose dungs carrying valuable feed out undigested is a big cost to a cow.
Intake and the influence it has on milk performance and fertility 
It is well worth taking note of daily dry matter intakes. Good grassland management and measurement strategies are making intake measurements from grazed grass much more achievable. Any sudden drops in dry matter intakes associated with a change in feed quality or quantity offered along with poorer weather conditions must be acted upon immediately. Introduce diet changes slowly, this is particularly important when cows are turned out to grass as the sudden change in diet will cause digestive upsets that lead to reduced overall intakes. Introduce a good quality buffer feeding strategy with sufficient fibre to help reduce any potential digestive upsets.
Low Butter Fat issues 
It is becoming more common to see low butter fats once herds get into the 2nd rotation and beyond. What can be done about this? What are the main causes of this issue? How we manage our grass from April on will have a big influence on milk fat percentages. If grass is very lush, high in protein, low in dry matter and low in fibre then it can tend to pass through cows too fast and induce sub-acute ruminal acidosis resulting in sub-optimal butter fats. The inclusion of quality fibre in diets well in advance of feeding this top-quality grass to prepare the rumen can prove to be a very wise strategy. It is often too late when fats collapse as the damage is already done at that stage. This fibre can be in the form of forages such as straw, maize silage or whole crop along with including digestive fibres in significant proportions through any concentrates being fed. Oily bye products tend to suppress fats when cows are on top quality grass and as such should be avoided.
Obviously, in the current climate, any feeds used in a buffer must be assessed in terms of value for money. Some concentrate ingredients have increased in price significantly, while others are hard to source. Weigh up the cost of buffering grass well against underperformance in yield, solids and fertility."

Apart from the three day working week with the double bank holiday for St Patrick's Day on Thursday and the new national holiday the following day, the intake has been at or above 39,000 head in recent weeks.
That is at the comparable level of a good weekly intake for October. For the month of March, it is a phenomenal first-ever, setting a new record weekly Springtime kill.
Such is the demand for beef animals at the factories that it is now far exceeding the expectations with the post Brexit market having been predicted as a likely challenging period for the sector.
A combination of factors, which could not have been foreseen, have come together to create a level of market demand, which, in any normal time, would be a welcome 'dream' for producers.
In this particular year, the surge in the cost of farm inputs has undermined some of the benefits of the higher prices being returned to producers. But, at least, there is some consolation that the higher returns exist to cushion the effect of the higher feed and fertiliser bills.
The range of base prices on offer for the steers has widened further this week with gains of up to 5 cents/kg in the hardening market. Steers are being quoted at 455-470 cents/kg in general with up to 10 cents/kg more on offer in the northwest.
Three 13-month-old Limousin cross bullocks average weight 400 kilos sold for €1,080 each at a sale in Thurles Mart. Picture: O'Gorman Photography.
Farmers in the south are mostly getting 460-465 cents/kg, with the harder prices upcountry and in particular at factories under the greatest pressure to get the stock.
Across the board, the heifers are ranging at 10 cents/kg premium over the steers on a range of 470-480 cents/kg and up to 485 cents/kg at the top of the market generally with farmers in the north-west reporting that 490 cents/kg is available in their region.
As is usual when competition for stock heats up, there is a growing percentage of producers reporting deals at flat prices, which are being defined by the breed of animals on offer.
The young bulls are in a range of 460-470 cents/kg for R grade and the trade for cows continues very strong also with up to 440 cents/kg being paid for R grade cows, while the prices range from 430 cents/kg.
As was expected the loss of two days on the slaughter line last week impacted heavily on throughput which slipped to 26,409 head.
Because of the additional bank holiday, it is not comparable with the corresponding week in 2021.
However, for a three day week, it averaged over 8,800 per day confirming that both the demand and the supply trend continues very strong.
The intake for the week included 9,140 steers, 7,201 heifers, 1,536 young bulls and 5,617 cows."
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40836869.html,2022-03-26 04:59:00,Brian Reidy: Get bang for buck with your summer forage production,"April is just around the corner and even though spring has only just arrived, silage making is not too far away.
Many will not have finished feeding silage yet this spring but nonetheless, next season’s crop must be planned for.
Air temperatures are on the rise and hopefully, soil temperatures will follow. Growth, while steady, is not after getting going yet and many who turned out early are having to slow down the rotation so that they don’t start the second round too quickly.
Others, who were unable to get to grass early, will not hit target grazing areas by the start of April and may have to mow some off to get back in line.
Making good quality silage 
With the price of all inputs at an all-time high this spring, we must all make wise decisions regarding forage production for next winter. 
Cutting better quality silage earlier will always result in improved animal performance with less dependence on purchased concentrates, which will undoubtedly be critical next winter. This will help to reduce your overall production costs while housed. One way of improving the quality of your silage is to cut it earlier than you traditionally would. 
Take care not to apply too much nitrogen so that you can cut early. Younger swards can use up more nitrogen than older swards, so consider this before spreading. 
Contractors charge by the acre but producing quality rather than bulk must be your goal once you have adequate volume. Your cutting date will of course be down to weather, ground conditions, stocking rate, contractor availability, units of nitrogen applied etc.
Beef producers should learn from the milking herds this spring. Cows that had been unable to get to grass due to the poor weather and fed poor silage are producing very disappointing levels of milk protein. This indicates a large deficit in energy. If beef producers feed similar silage, then animals will not thrive well either.
Fertiliser for silage production 
Do you have an up to date soil test for your silage ground? 
This year more than ever, you must get soil indexes right to, optimise the return on your nitrogen purchases. Have you put slurry out and how much? Make sure to count nutrients supplied from slurry before calculating chemical fertiliser requirements. 
Silage production has a big requirement for Potash in particular. How much nitrogen you spread should be determined by the intended cutting date and the swards ability to grow, based on soil fertility and reseeding history. Early cuts will require less nitrogen as high nitrogen swards are difficult to preserve.

Brian Reidy: Self-sufficiency has never been so crucial
Splitting fertiliser application for first-cut silage is also a good idea. It will allow you to assess growth during early April and enable you to apply more or less fertiliser when applying the second round in mid-April based on uptake. 
Sulphur is also a very important element for silage ground as it boosts the availability of Nitrogen to the plant during peak growth. Fertiliser availability is also an issue right now so getting what you want to spread well in advance is advisable. 
We have seen a huge swing to liquid fertiliser in Tipperary this year as availability is not a problem, fewer units are required and its accuracy of application is really appealing to beef and dairy producers alike.
Silage production costs
To start with, calculate the silage stocks being carried over from last year.
Grass silage production is getting more and more expensive every year. Unfortunately, its quality can be variable depending on weather, cutting date and grassland management/reseeding policy. Too much poor or average silage in the pit may in fact increase overall production costs.
First-cut grass silage of 20-24% Dry Matter will typically cost €35 to €45 per tonne this year depending on yield, or €325-€375 per acre on your own land. When you include land rental, reseeding, liming, Fertiliser, weed control and contractor charges these figures can rise sharply.
With the prices currently being paid for rented land along with fertiliser costs, then silage is getting very expensive.
Remember to build in a 15-20% safety volume to provide for a longer winter due to poor weather, poor growth, etc.
Land and Nitrogen efficiency in crops 
During an online seminar hosted by Goldcrop last week, Dave Barry outlined the cost per UFL of feeds for next winter. 1,000 UFL off a two-cut silage system cost €213, while maize in the open was €190, under plastic was €188 and fodder beet came in at €157.
Barry explained that maize and beet were far more efficient at producing energy than a two-cut silage system. 
1 unit of nitrogen produced only 17 UFL from the two-cut silage system while 1 unit produced 28 UFL in maize in the open, 34 UFL in maize under plastic and 42 UFL in fodder beet.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40840514.html,2022-03-30 20:07:00,Right metrics needed or wrong policy decisions will be made on cutting agriculture emissions,"If the right metrics are not available, wrong policy decisions will be made for reducing emissions in the agriculture sector, an industry expert has warned.
Metrics matter, “once they are the right metrics”, said Desmond Savage, co-founder and chairman of agri-technology firm Moonsyst.
It is his opinion, rather than looking at the size of the national herd, ""better metrics"" are required, he told a meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee on agriculture, food and the marine and the joint committee on environment and climate action.
“Ireland has one of the most natural and best systems for producing bovine milk and meat in the world,” he said, and that if Ireland does not serve increasing global demand, other countries will, where animal welfare and sustainability lags.
""In accordance to the Paris Climate Agreement, Article 2.1 of the Agreement mentions the importance of protecting food production, while reducing emissions, I strongly feel Ireland is best positioned to do this, by being a world leader on sustainable bovine meat and dairy production, through utilising our natural advantages, in particular our grass-fed system. 
This does not equate to reducing cattle numbers in Ireland, but arguably means Ireland should potentially increase its production of bovine dairy and meat, which would have a net benefit on global emissions. 
""For this reason, I think the current metrics under consideration i.e. biogenic methane reduction or national herd size reductions are wrong,"" he said.
Mr Savage told the meeting focus should be placed on improving animal efficiencies in the production of dairy and meat.
“There is a long list of factors that impact these efficiencies, including: genetics; breed; health; feed; seasonality; age; lactation cycle; sward types; use of feed additives; herdsmanship; supply chain; and so forth,"" he said, explaining that Moonsyst is working on providing a cost-effective method of monitoring the rumen of cattle in real-time.
“With this information to hand, farmers can better understand the health of their animals and optimise the feed conversion rates, which in turn will minimise the biogenic emissions, helping the environment,” he added.
“This has the potential to improve protein conversion yields in both meat and milk, which in turn is a further gain for the farmer, without negatively impacting the environment,” he continued.
“With such information to hand, Governments and/or large corporate entities could incentivise progressive farmers to produce more sustainably; by rewarding farmers for investments in genetics, new swards and/or methane blocking feed additives.
Incentives
“At present, there are no direct financial incentives to reward beef and dairy farmers who manage low biogenic emitting herds.
“Incentives should be considered to drive this progressive behaviour; for example, make technologies that are deemed enabling more sustainable farming VAT exempt or classified as a capital expenditure.” 
He said that farmers “want to do the right thing for the environment” – but that they must be incentivised sufficiently.
“Technology, as called out in the draft agri-food strategy 2030, does have a key role to play in the coming years and any incentives that can be put in place to expedite the adoption of these technologies has to be a good thing,” he continued.
“I would be very confident that through technology, through changing feed practices, [emissions] reductions will be achieved.” 
He added that there is a “pyramid of metrics”, and that at the moment, there are “high-level metrics” being pushed down to farm level “and that’s simply not going to work”.
Emission reduction fund
Michael Earls, managing director of Easyfix, told the committees that much of the debate around reducing agriculture-related emissions has “generated more heat than light”.
Like Mr Savage, Mr Earls said there should not be a “simplistic, binary debate"" that centres on the need to cull the national herd in order to meet climate targets. “We are also concerned that there is an urgent need to focus on the here and now,” Mr Earls told the committees.
“Looking at improving genetics or the use of feed additives are great ideas but there are solutions that are tried and tested and are currently available that can cut emissions radically.
“We believe that technology can make an enormous contribution.” 
He asked the Oireachtas committees to support the concept of a “dedicated emission reduction fund” to be put in place for Irish agriculture, that would ringfence funds and link them to emissions reduction targets, he explained.
“We need to act today if we are to make serious inroads to meet our emissions targets,” Mr Earls continued.
“Other countries actively support farmers with capital grants of upwards of 40%.
“It is our view that the Government needs to support farmers and help give them the tools to do the job.”

He recommended that there be a commitment to fund emission reduction technology from now until 2030.
“We estimate that a fund of €30m to €40m per annum would be sufficient to ensure that Irish farms are the most sustainable farms in the world,” he explained.
“Any delay in implementation of a dedicated fund will leave Irish farmers with unachievable targets to reach, whereby decisions taken now can ensure we achieve our targets in a sustained manner.
“It will improve our soil and air quality; it will cut emissions substantially; it will improve animal welfare.
“It will cut the number of farm fatalities and accidents; it will help support our reputation for producing great food in a sustainable and responsible manner.
“We would therefore urge your committees to call on the Government to implement a dedicated emissions reduction fund for Irish agriculture.” He added that the industry is “very innovative”.
“We have shown an ability to adapt, to develop new products and new offerings,” he said.
“We have some of the best farmers in the world and a global reputation for quality.
“We now need to ensure that we are the cutting edge of technology that will make our farms more sustainable and greener.” 
Emissions
Paul R Price, a research assistant at Dublin City University, noted the importance of recognising that GHG and ammonia emissions are accounted by the Environmental Protection Agency in standardised national inventory data reporting to the UN and the EU.
“Therefore, policies and measures are only useful if they can be verifiably accounted in the national inventory, which requires any new technology or emissions measurement update to pass EPA and international peer review, a process that can take years whereas mitigation action is needed now,” he explained.
He also said that there is “danger” that a focus on technical measures may result in a delay that “distracts us from regulating when regulation is needed”.
“We do need to recognise what works and what does not,” he said.
“To limit emissions and pollution, production quotas have been shown to work in Ireland, and international experts recommend nitrogen budgeting to cut emissions and environmental pollution.
“We need to consider these options seriously along with aligned policies on farm supports and consumer pricing to deliver a far more nitrogen-efficient agri-food system for Ireland that can also better support global food security.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/property/residential/arid-40732509.html,2022-03-31 09:08:00,Cold facts and uncomfortable truths about retrofitting our homes,"With topics such as CO2 emissions, rising sea levels and temperatures, other devastating impacts of climate change — and, oh, the future of the planet and humankind — rightly set to swamp discourse over the next three weeks of the 26th UN Conference of the Parties (Cop26) our choices and reaction are (a) despair, and/or (b) action.
Where else can one start to act but at home, and with one's personal behaviour? The days and decades of wanton waste and cheap energy are long gone; we’ve gotten wise to the new consensus, cosy or uncomfortable, that it behoves all — corporations, governments, citizens — to act now.
But, at what cost? In my case, it’s in the region of €65,000, for a modest-sized 108sq m (1,150sq ft) older property. Gulp.
That’s before some paybacks from SEAI grants, worth up to €14,000, to get a 100-year-old, cold, stone-built detached home in the coastal countryside up from its current G BER, to a future-proofed, efficient, cosy, and warm B1 BER, fed by a heat pump.
Thorough analysis by Superhomes 
The cold-light-of-day revelation came after a devastatingly insightful and thorough visit and work-through by energy engineer specialist Shaun Finn of Irish Examiner. The need, costs breakdown, and schedule came courtesy of an 18-page, tailored, home energy report after a rigorous three-hour inspection by the knowledgeable (and, kind in his comments!) Mr Finn, as part of an Electric Ireland Superhomes Property & Homes trial.
We contrasted the retrofit challenge of two very different house types — Old stone, and modern timber frame (see Kya deLongchamps’ report, below), with a 100-year age gap between them.
Superhomes is part of the national retrofit plan 
Formed last year by Electric Ireland, with the 2015-founded Tipperary Energy Agency, which has extensive experience in heat pumps, Superhomes is one of the country’s burgeoning one-stop shops taking on the challenge of doing deep retrofits on older houses.  Government policy is to tackle 35,000 Irish homes by 2030, with Superhomes scaling up itself from 100 homes done so far in 2021 to 650 by 2023.
The scale of the costs so brutally laid bare are salutary, especially given the large gap between what SEAI grants contribute and the costs to private householders.
Whether the Government takes measures in the next short period to help close the gap is as yet a moot point, but Budget 2022 did indicate its priority will be in retrofitting social sector and local authority-controlled homes.
Hitting a higher BER is a costly business
The stark outline of costs to get up to a B1 BER in my case wasn’t entirely unsurprising. After all, the gaff’s over a century old, with a large open fire at its heart, the sort of spot you wouldn’t be too surprised to see Peig Sayers sitting at, puffing on her dúidín, adding to the fug.
That fireplace is in a ‘characterful’ room, in auctioneering-speak, with whitewashed walls, but thankfully is one of the very few uninsulated walls left in the house after slow and steady DIY work over the years, tipping away at insulation and draught-proofing.
Applying today's building practice and standards to an older home is an appealing thought — but the devil is in the detail, and both Tommy and Kya found the Superhomes consultation a revelation. Stock picture
Yes, there’s a way to go. Unfortunately, to go an approved retrofit route for SEAI grants, or to score better in any BER assessment, one has to be able to prove insulation levels, so receipts or such are needed without wholesale opening up of walls.
I wouldn’t have minded ripping the walls, to be honest, seeing as the house’s lousy energy efficiency was otherwise being laid bare. In fact, an assessment like this is a bit being asked how your favourite child did in their Leaving Cert? Sure, don’t we love them anyway (and mind your own business!).
Here, the cost of ripping out the 50mm wall insulation/drylining I’d put in piecemeal in most of the house and doing it right with a better system for stone walls, (100mm Isover Optima to give a min U-value of 0.37 W/m2K) was put at €17,250 plus Vat at 13.5%.
Aargh. It was the standout cost in the overall budget breakdown, with external insulation for a small extension adding a further €2,960 plus Vat; redoing attic and sloping roof insulation added another €6,500 or so... At this stage, everything was starting to fog over. This is cold reality all right.
A proper, low-energy loss front door was put at about €2,000 plus Vat, and other necessary improvements to target overall air-tightness levels of 5m3/(h.m2) at q50 came in at €3,000 plus Vat.
Then, after air tightness came demand controlled ventilation (DCV) at €4,500 plus Vat.
Decommissioning the existing oil central heating, removal of tank, boiler, rads, and pipework (the microbore pipes I have won’t suit a heat pump), and replacement with an efficient electric heat pump came to over €17,000, give or take. It allows for a new 6.5kW to 8.5kW air-to-water heat pump, zoned, full controls, and minimum efficiency 350% for space heating and 200% for hot water, making up c €11,000 plus Vat of that overall €17,000 heating sum.
For older property owners, and owners of older properties, recouping a retrofit investment could take longer than one's own lifetime — but there are future generations to think of, not to mention the planet.
After such big-ticket items, other costs plus some optional items (upgrading 20-year old double glazing for triple glazing, pumped shower instead of instant) entered the expanding ‘I Wishlist’ territory.
Upshot? The total cost to get to a B1 BER was €57,000 before Vat and redecoration, and about €65,000 after Vat. Plus, there’s a Superhomes costs proviso that estimated prices may be plus or minus 15%. Right now, there’s only one direction they are likely to go...
Superhomes says costs typically can range from €25,000 for a smaller home built since 2000 to over €70,000 for older, larger homes, while its average retrofit is €56,000 gross, or €37,000 net of grants.
Currently, quotes such as mine cover work that can be carried out, completed, and certified by a current department deadline March 31, 2022. Despite current construction blockages and shortages — and given that, in my case, most of the work is internal and won’t be overly affected by winter weather — Superhomes energy engineer Shaun Finn reckons I could make it.
Thank you Shaun, but I just might have to get back to you… But you’ve given me masses to think about and to work at in the meantime.
Vat and grants should be reconsidered 
So, is Vat on retrofits an issue for Government to consider? The maximum SEAI grant in my case at present will close off €14,100 + Vat of that, at least.
Will grant levels have to be looked at again? On the evidence and need, and speaking entirely personally, of course, um, yes, they will have to.
Back in the bigger picture, going the one stop shop route where one entity oversees all is absolutely an enormous headache-relief.
Moving any house up from a G BER to a B1 BER or better will add significant value, when and if it is ever put up for sale. Home comfort for occupiers is assured. Heating bills get slashed. But, if there’s a capital outlay of say €50k after grants, it would take decades to recoup in similar older properties.
For older property owners and for owners of older properties, it could be beyond their lifetimes, but, yes, there are future generations (and, the planet) to think of.

  An erstwhile green goddess learns some home truths from Superhomes
by Kya deLongchamps 
I knew that inviting the Electric Ireland Superhomes team into my house would provide a challenge. I was on edge. The house isn’t cold, structurally failing, or impossible to address. Still, it is (as they discreetly described it) an “anomaly” in the expected trope of Irish builds.
As someone who writes extensively on the topic of deep-energy-retrofits, a full house survey at this forensic level was everything I had wanted for some years. We joke that you could heat this house with an LED lightbulb, but I knew that all was not pert or current in Castle deLongchamps.
Retrofit refurbishment is at the heart of a modern holy trinity of comfort, economy, and the environment. Picture: Getty Images
A BER carried out in 2019 as an obligation of my photovoltaic grant aid from the SEAI was skinny. The assessor strode through the door and declared mournfully: “Oh, it’s one of these.” Despite open reservations about the build type, the boiler-plate DEAP software result was a sound C1, not bad for the efforts of a rookie, wide-eyed ganger. The BER report floated to point me towards my future goal of a B2, proved to be a boiler-plate edition for a block-build. Timber-frame cannot take external insulation and cavity fill in one elastic bound. I felt a rejecting chill. The report created more questions than it answered. Happily, the SEAI re-launched a new, more extensive BER report mechanism in September.
“One of these” is a timber frame home by Cygnum Timber Frame in Lissarda, Co Cork. Made to my measure, it is heavily insulated throughout the outer envelope and finished in thick feather-board slow-growing larch. With second-fix in 2000 under my fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants direction after the frame was put up, it was a life-altering, nerve-shredding self-build conducted from a tilted caravan. I threw all the money at the principles of fabric-first, living without carpets, any landscaping, or proper kitchen, and culling aesthetic extras like a soaring fireplace to get in on budget with wide studs, the right wall build out. The result I hoped for was a heavily insulated envelope — floors, walls, and ceilings. 
The house reflects my triumphs and errors, and the emerging environmental sensibilities of 2000. Timber frame, dedicated passive solar gain, generous double-glazed elements to the south aspect, and a suspended insulated floor stuffed with 150mm nets of fibreglass. I was the muscled, green goddess of sustainable building. 
That assured, smug contentment did not last long.
The evolution of the building regulations (Part L) and the sterling efforts of the SEAI’s domestic grants and, more importantly, their pilot deep retrofit schemes, have goaded us into a tighter, carbon-light build ethos. Passive ‘U’ levels are encouraged, with mechanical ventilation and sustainable heat pump presented as standard. I knew the house was leaky in terms of air exchanges. The dirty little secret of my fossil fuel cooking and heating was sitting out in the kitchen in the form of a 80,000 BTU Stanley Brandon. There were sufficient embarrassments to drop-kick a crucial Heat Loss Indicator (HLI) test into touch.
You'll learn a lot from a Superhomes survey 
The survey, carried out by engineer Shaun Finn of Electric Ireland Superhomes, was a very friendly, interactive, positive experience with tons of incidental information throughout. It took a solid three hours (including general nattering), and I was welcome to follow Shaun around. It was the start of an animated, lengthy conversation — not simply a set of figures and results. During this time, I learnt more about the structural character of my highly individual house and its energy performance than I had in 20 years of speculation.
If you remember nothing else from this article, please take away this one point — every time you sink any work into the invisible reaches of your home, have it certified by your contractor and/or a qualified engineer. 
The fabric of the building was thoroughly explored inside and out — every window, door, and visible centimetre, and the current building regulations and SEAI recommendations repeatedly referenced. Getting under the skin of the building was both disappointing and empowering. The BER is a test — this was survey. My tail was wagging despite knowing there was a long way to navigate to a B2, never mind the stellar heights of an A2 as Shaun proposed. The laser focus of these surveys is to get the house “heat pump-ready”. That could be contentious for “anomalous” builds and straitened finances.
Would the survey report just go all-in and ignore lower cost optimal improvements? If I didn’t buy in to the five-figure investment to mountaineer up the BER, would this all be moot? The report and follow-up Zoom meeting, analysing every detail, proved otherwise. The process was through the lens of getting the U values and the HLI suited to the installation of a heat pump. However, there was plenty of highly specific project work outlined, with costings that we felt we could lift and plot going forward to improve our sustainable credits and comfort levels.
Roadmaps to a better BER
I have two roadmaps to an A2. As my house is generally warm and dry, with low heating bills in the area of €700 pa, there’s a commonsense dilemma in signing off on at least €74,000 to tear it up. I’m not 25, and time of life will nuance every homeowner’s decision. Timber-frame houses have their insulation buried on the inside face of the walls. 
Please note — if you remember nothing else of my blathering — every time you sink any work into the invisible reaches of your home, have it certified by your contractor and/or a qualified engineer. I don’t have a BER based on 140mm of insulation in every external wall and under the floor because Shaun could not see it and vouch for it.
Because of the material mystery, the backstop numbers for my survey therefore gave me higher U values — dipping my probable BER of B3 (suggested by Shaun) to the official, published C1. This could prove troubling when securing grant assistance where the U values will count to get to the threshold to secure a heat pump grant or allow a potential buyer to purchase with a low-interest green mortgage. It impacted the report too, as the major plan incorporated ripping off plasterboard to insulate walls that are already fattened.
Launching the Superhomes partnership earlier this year were Stephen O’Connor, managing director, Electric Ireland SuperHomes; Marguerite Sayers, executive director, Electric Ireland; Eamon Ryan TD, Minister for the Environment, and Seamus Hoyne, chairperson, Tipperary Energy Agency. 
I really appreciated Shaun’s patient manner and generous, technical insight. Our insufficient ventilation measures are being addressed immediately, together with beefing up insulation to the floor of the attic and remote reaches of my open plan pitch. He dubbed the wood double-glazed windows as satisfactory, reminding me kindly that they were end-of-life and that “every house after 20 years will need some reno”.
Changing them out for €8,000-€10,000 won’t improve our BER. Rudely inserting a heat pump without improvements would likely launch us into the As (not recommended and quite rightly not grant-aided). 
There’s a curious, but valuable education here.
Kya's retrofit estimates
Figures and estimated costs courtesy of Electric Ireland Superhomes:
Currently, BER C1 / 171.57 (kWh/m2/yr) or could be (undetermined insulation to walls and floors) B3 / 146.71 (kWh/m2/yr) 
Currently Heat Loss Indicator (HLI) 2.88 (W/K/m2) or could be 2.46 (W/K/m2) 
With full measures will reach A2 (29.46 kWh/m2/yr) qualifying for heat pump grant. €73,624 (+/- 15% inc.VAT) ex. all builders’ works. SEAI grant aid: €3,750 
Without insulating walls/floors and no qualifying for SEAI heat pump grant would also reach A2 (42.46 kWh/m2/yr) and the HLI would be 2.43. €38,779. (+/- 15% inc.VAT) ex. all builders’ works.
Superhomes’ fees: Survey & Report (€475), Heat Pump Assessment (€250), Tender and contracting for works (€375).

The processors have conceded a further strengthening of 5-10 cents/kg in the prices being paid for the stock as the competition between the factories for finished cattle force their hand on the price.
All of the impressions are that there is an unprecedented market demand for beef at present and the biggest challenge facing the processors is trying to keep the intake up to a sufficient level to fill the orders on their books.
It is a very good position to be in for both the producers and the processors with the current situation of immense benefit to the finishers in getting return for stock at prices that they never before received and most probably didn't expect was in the immediate horizon.
There was a slight reduction in the kill for last week, although it was still more than 7,000 head higher than for the same week last year. The intake for the year to date is now 462,`64 head compared to 418,580 for the corresponding first thirteen weeks of 2021.
The base for steers has moved this week to 475 cents/kg in general with some deals at 480 cents/kg for most of the country and a few lots reported at 485 cents/kg. In the Northwest, the trade is delivering 5-10 cents/kg more at up to 490 cents/kg.
The general base for heifers is a quote of 480 cents/kg with a good perentage of stock making 485 cents/kg and in the North West 495 cents/kg the going rate.
Moreover, a true confirmation of the 'hunger' at the factories for the stock is the scale of deals being reported at flat prices with no grid result to be worried about for the suppliers. Prices being negotiated are dependent on the breed and quality of cattle on offer as well as the age, which appears, generally at present, to have been pushed into the back seat of the deal conditions.
How strange that many of the qualifying hoops that producers are subjected to in times of supply exceeding demand, can become so much less relevant when the demand exceeds the supply.
The young bulls are a strong trade at around 480 cents/kg for R grade, although the number continues low relative to the other categories.
The cow prices have also advanced this week with the price for good R grade cows moving up to 450 cents/kg at the top of the trade and ranging from 440 cents/kg.
The intake for last week came to 38,346 head, which included 13,600 steers, 10,970 heifers, 2,544 young bulls and 8,764 cows with each of the categories up on the 2021 level for the same week."

As one of Ireland’s most successful businessmen, he now finds himself straddled across the two industries locked in the crosshairs - farming and aviation.
O’Leary might be best known for his airline business, but the well-known businessman has Irish country living in his blood, spending his summer holidays on his mother’s family’s dairy farm in Kanturk, and sharing a keen interest in livestock and bloodstock breeding with his father.
Even with backing as deep as Michael O’Leary’s pockets, Gigginstown House, his 1,800-acre farm in Co Westmeath, is very much run as a commercial enterprise, expected to sustain itself in every way possible, while also fulfilling the family’s passion for quality livestock.
It’s taken him 20 years to get the farm to the point where it is “comfortable” economically - but now his focus is on making both businesses as environmentally sustainable as possible.
“I bought Gigginstown when it was 200 acres in 1993 and it’s now 1,800 acres. We started off with 20 cows and it’s now up to 350 cows and the herd size is around 700 cattle,” he said.
The herd – which includes around 500 pedigree Angus cattle and 200 commercial Angus – are managed by fellow Corkonian Joe O’Mahony.
“We are almost entirely self-sufficient. We still buy in a little fertiliser, but I am trying to get that down to nothing so we just use farmyard manure and slurry as our fertiliser,” O’Leary said.
“We grow our own crops, so all of our cattle feed is home-grown - we are trying to make the whole thing circular and self-sustainable.” Each year, the farm sells around 150-200 head a year into the factories.
Around 80% of the pedigree herd are sold for breeding. Around 20% move into the commercial herd for finishing and the commercial herd are sold into the factories.
“The Certified Angus Beef programme has been a huge success,” he said, explaining that it has helped to boost the marketability of the breed.
The foundation cows for the pedigree herd were bought from Edmonton and Regina Shows in Canada.
“I flew them in – it cost me an absolute fortune, but it gave us something different that no one else in Ireland had at the time,” O’Leary said.
“I started into Angus 20-25 years ago and it’s been very successful for me,” O’Leary said.
“Back then, most of the hobby farmers were all doing Charolais or Blonde d’Aquitaines.” O’Leary said.
“I never really liked Charolais, particularly because I didn’t want to have to get a vet every time they’re calving. I think the Angus are very pretty, and they are easy calvers too.""
The great and good of Ireland appear to have a penchant for the black stuff, with Ireland rugby legend Rory Best also an outspoken advocate for the Angus breed – and yes, they have crossed paths.
“We have sold some stock to the Bests. They’re very good farmers,” he said.
Nowadays, new animals are mainly bought in from herds in the UK and Ireland.
“We try to buy one or two stock bulls every year to bring in fresh genetics,” he said.
“We are running nine stock bulls – we need about seven or eight but you always want to have a spare one for injuries. We also implant embryos into around 20 or 30 heifers a year to bring in Canadian and UK genetics.”

Breeding is focused on producing efficient, productive stock, with 83% of the stock put forward for the sale are four and five star rated.
“At the moment, the madness is that everyone is chasing stars so we are looking for bulls that can afford five stars. If you haven’t got stars at all, people won’t look at them,” O’Leary said.
“They may not always be the best physical specimens, but we have to have bulls, and increasingly cows, that have high star values.
“We try to pick the best of the bulls and a reasonable selection of the heifers. We are selling 20 heifers – 10 would be the best heifers we have over the last 18 months and we have a balance then in with more commercial animals so we appeal to all price points.” But unlike on his flights, punters at the sale will not be expected to chip in for any “extras”.
“Any of the heifers will either be in-calf or if someone wants it covered we will get her in calf before she gets delivered,” O’Leary said.
“If they want the heifer covered by a Gigginstown stock bull that will be included.
“We stand behind everything we sell at the sale. If a bull doesn’t work or is shooting blanks, we will take him back no questions asked. It’s the same if a heifer doesn’t get in calf.
“When I bought Gigginstown in ’93, I was buying cattle in March/April and selling them in September/October.
“So I was buying them when prices were high and selling them when prices were low, which is a way to lose money.
“So gradually, over a number of years, we bred our own. It needed some investment in sheds and pedigrees, but now we’re calving 250-300 cows a year and selling €300,000-400,000 of beef a year.
“As long as you don’t have to worry about the cost of the infrastructure, it pays itself. We have been comfortable for the last three years – but it's taken us 20 years to get there.
“I’m fortunate in that I don’t need to depend on it for an income, so when prices are low we’ll go out and buy more stock and when prices are high for other things – as they are this year for steel and concrete, we don’t do any building.
“You want the farm enterprise to build up slowly over many years and to be sustainable both financially and environmentally.”

O’Leary explained he and Joe are always keen to try new things on the farm. Three years ago, they made the decision to purchase 750 acres for tillage.
“In the winter, we had the cattle in on peat bedding, but peat is being banned so we have needed straw for the last few years. Therefore, we bought more land to grow more tillage,” he said.
“We grow winter and spring barley, winter and spring wheat and around 250 acres of wholecrop as well.
“So we are producing much more of our own feed as well. We are always trying something new. We put 60 acres into oilseed rape two years ago.
“That has been quite successful – we leave some of the bull out of the rapeseed from October through to January,” he said.
“We have also had some of the breeding animals out on stubble as well, and that has been quite successful.” Greener farming O’Leary admits he has considered anaerobic digestion, but opted to go down the route of solar PV panels instead.
“The numbers didn’t stack up for us; we wouldn’t have enough slurry to sustain it,” he said. “And solar was a more affordable way of generating power.
“We are putting solar panels on all of our cattle sheds now that it’s becoming much more affordable.” Within the last three years, he has built three new sheds.
“We started off building 12-bay sheds and now we are building 24-bay sheds, but we’ll be taking a break this year because steel prices and concrete costs have gone through the roof,” he said.
“Now is not a sensible time to be building.” And speaking of rising costs, what approach is Ireland’s shrewdest business taking when it comes to spiralling fertiliser prices?
“We are fortunate that we have a lot of slurry. We have been trying to cut back on chemical fertiliser. The combination of lime and slurry has helped improve soil fertility.
“We’re not organic, but we’re trying to move in that direction – to reduce our chemical fertiliser use.” “Mercifully, we had it bought in already this year,” he said. “We always lock in our fertiliser prices in November. But it was up about 50% compared to the year before so it still felt a lot more expensive.
“Grain prices are high and factory prices are high - so for all of the whingeing farmers are doing on input costs, everyone accepts that farming is doing reasonably well at the moment.
“If I hadn’t have bought when I did, I am fortunate enough that I could still afford to. But I know that I am in a fortunate position that I don’t need to make my income from farming – I found an even more stupid industry like airlines to make a living from.” But if he had to choose one, which would he rather have?
“Farming, of course,” he said. “By a million miles!” 
“There’s a kind of relaxation of walking through the fields; it’s a real release. I love looking at the cattle – more so than the horses. Whereas, my children generally prefer looking at the horses.
“If there’s a field of Angus there, I think they are just gorgeous.” 
O’Leary hopes his eldest daughter will follow in his wellies, with his passion for cattle.
“One of the schools we are looking at sending my daughter to in September has been very big into the Angus Schools programme, so if Tiana goes there, she will have to win it in four or five years – it will be a matter of pride!
“It’s a great programme for young people and it makes me so optimistic about farming that so many young ones are wanting to study ag science at school now,” he said.

As for his other business, Ryanair, O’Leary says environmental criticism is “entirely unjustified”, with the airline claiming to boast the lowest carbon emissions per passenger mile of 27 major airlines in Europe.
Many of the reductions have been made through investing heavily in new technology – this year, the firm will take 65 new Boeing Max aircraft.
“They have 4% more seats and burn 60% less fuel and are 40% quieter,” he explained.
“If you look at EU CO2 emissions, air travel accounts for 2%, shipping accounts for 5%, but nobody ever talks about shipping or slapping environmental taxes on it. Road transport is 26%,” he said.
“We have a major tourism industry here in Ireland, we also have an economy that needs low-cost, affordable air access to Europe - we will end up taxing ourselves out of existence.
“We also have a commitment to be plastic-free [on our planes] within the next three years and are about 80% of the way there.” It does seem somewhat bizarre that while the firm is also investing in reforestation programmes in Portugal and Africa, the 8,000 trees O’Leary has planted on the farm in Westmeath over the last 15 years are not counted in terms of offsetting emissions.
“Irish farmers should get much more credit for the work they do for the environment,” he said.
“Instead of criticising the farmers and agriculture, we should be supporting what they do in terms of maintaining hedgerows, planting trees, fencing along watercourses – we are the custodians of the countryside and get no credit for it among the townies.
“One of the things the tragedy in Ukraine has demonstrated is that we need to focus on food security and that’s where farming comes into its own.”
The Gigginstown House sale takes place on Saturday, April 16 at 11:30am at Fennor Farm (N91 K026) with bids accepted both online and in person on the day.
“We could have done it online again this year, but it’s a much more fun experience to have people on the farm,” O’Leary explained.
“Online is terrific from a sales point of view, but we want to make more of an occasion out of it.
“We have established the sale over the last 10 or 15 years and it’s a good atmosphere over Easter weekend.”"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40845893.html,2022-04-07 10:39:00,Wool research ‘critical’ for ensuring sheep farmers’ viability,"Carrying out research on uses and markets for Irish wool is a “critical issue” in regards to ensuring the viability of sheep farmers, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers’ Association has said.
There are about 35,000 registered flocks in Ireland — and a lot of research will show sheep farming “doesn’t really make much money”, INHFA national vice-president Pheilim Molloy said.
“But there’s no great emphasis placed on a very important product — wool — that originates from the sheep,” Mr Molloy told the Irish Examiner.
“From a climate point of view, and from the green agenda point of view, we see wool as offering huge benefits.
“If we replaced the synthetic fibres with natural fibres to the largest possible extent, there can be a knock-on benefit from there from an environmental point of view as well.”
Mr Molloy said the INHFA had been examining the problems surrounding the wool industry in Ireland, the significant one being the drop in demand for the product.
At the moment, there is “effectively very little return to the farmers for the wool”, he said.
“It’s very low, if you look at the cost of sheering sheep, there’s no way the cost of the sheering is actually being met by the return from the fleece.”
Despite its versatility in many industries, wool prices remain low, with industry sources indicating that prices for 2021 are similar to those in 2020 at about 20c/kg for lowland wool.
Prices depend on the wool grade and time of year sold, however, with prices having ranged from 10c/kg to 50c/kg in recent years, sheep farmers shear at a “considerable loss”.
Mr Molloy said farmers selling wool over the past few years are “well aware” of the continued fall in price — which is a big difference compared to the 1980s, when the sale of wool was an important part of farmers’ incomes.
While getting the industry back to the way it was back then may be “overly optimistic”, according to Mr Molloy, there is great potential in the years ahead for wool to displace the use of synthetic fibres, which have caused the global wool trade to suffer.
Uses of wool
Mr Molloy explained that wool has beneficial components in its make-up, including keratin and suint making up the “vast majority” of the wool’s weight.
Based on keratin consisting of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen along with suint’s qualities, the INHFA has looked at “various options for wool”.
One such use option is for insulation.
“Wool is an ideal material for insulation, it’s a softer type of wool needed for that — wool with a bounce — and that would be from Texel, Suffolk sheep, that sort of one,” Mr Molloy explained.
“Bed clothing is another use — there is a company actually producing duvets and that at the moment and I’ve been speaking to them recently and there’s a huge demand for bed clothing from wool.
“Air filtration is another one and so far as that, wool will actually naturally absorb toxins out of the air and it doesn’t need any forced air systems so that’s a major benefit.”
Along with these potential uses, the INHFA sees an opportunity to develop wool as a natural fertiliser.
“Because of the chemical composition of wool, it can deliver N, P and K, and we have done some research into the pelleting of wool, but there’s still a lot of work to be done on it,” Mr Molloy said.
“And of course, compost — there are some studies being carried out on compost at the moment, everybody would be aware of the difficulties around the use of peat in horticulture, whereas compost wool can actually deliver the same properties — it’s a slow-release nutrient source and it also retains moisture.”
A recent study carried out by University College Dublin researchers shows results that suggest up to 15.8% of the nitrogen required to produce Ireland’s cereal crops “can be met annually using hydrolysed sheep wool in an economically feasible manner along with considerable amounts of sulphur, zinc, and copper”.
“Hydrolysis is a potential processing technology for value addition to sheep wool by producing nutrients and soil amendments,” the report reads.
“This study found that utilising hydrolysis could potentially produce 1,788,790kg of nitrogen, 1,065,676kg of sulphur, 236kg of copper, and 51,960kg zinc annually, which could replace fossil-based fertilisers.
“Results indicate that hydrolysis of sheep wool could aid with the development of a circular bio-economy in Ireland.”
The use of hydrolysed wool as a soil amendment “would allow tillage farmers in the east and south of the country to import nutrients from lower-income sheep enterprises in the west of the country”, the report notes, based on information from the Teagasc farm income survey, it said.
“If these sheep were grazed on mountainous areas of the west of the country, it would allow for the economic return of the wool to be even greater as there would be very little inputs into the grazing system.”
The report notes there has been “very limited work from an Irish perspective on the amount, type, quality or chemical composition of sheep wool”.
Wool study
Mr Molloy agrees with this and is calling for a substantial project to be set up within one of the third-level institutions in Ireland to take on research on wool.
Most of the wool produced in Ireland goes to the wool market in Bradford, Mr Molloy said, and there’s “very little of the wool actually being produced in the country that’s processed here”.
He added:
Unfortunately the lack of demand from China for wool has resulted in a huge drop-off in prices, and as things stand at the moment, it’s actually costing farmers to sheer sheep.” 
A major review of the potential demand for wool-based products is due to be published in the next two weeks.
The wool feasibility study, which is being led by the Agile Executive (a consortium of experts from Munster Technological University and Donegal Yarns) is expected to assist in the formulation of a strong policy framework for the Irish wool industry.
Government funding of €100,000 was allocated in Budget 2021 to conduct the review of the potential demand in domestic and international markets for wool-based products such as insulation and fertilisers.
A public consultation process was also initiated whereby interested stakeholders were invited to submit their proposals on the potential market opportunities for wool products on the domestic and international markets, to which more than 45 submissions were received, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said.
In July 2021, via a competitive public procurement procedure, a request for tenders seeking service providers to carry out the wool review was published.
The successful tenderer — The Agile Executive — was appointed in November 2021 to carry out the review and include the submissions received under the public consultation process.
It is understood the report due to be published by the consortium will place emphasis on how wool can support the principles of a circular bio-economy and suggest ways to convert what is currently a category 3 waste by-product of lamb meat production into value-added products.
One of the challenges is finding a high-value end product that could be brought to the market at scale.
Suggestions expected to be reflected in the report include opportunities in Ireland around fertiliser and growing media for horticulture that have the potential to generate modest new value streams from some of the lower grade/quality wool clip.
Mr Molloy said the INHFA was looking forward to seeing the feasibility report.
“We would be looking forward to maybe having even more input going forward [in this area] because it is something that’s going to take a bit of time to get it to the stage where we need to be, but at least it’s being progressed — I think that’s the important point.”

‘Indigenous supply’ of bio-fertiliser needed to tackle shortage and climate change"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-40847582.html,2022-04-10 07:06:00,Mick Clifford: Weathering a lot of hot air on climate,"In January 2019, then-taoiseach Leo Varadkar made a personal admission that was met with no little outrage. 
He said he was trying to reduce the amount of meat he ate in order to cut down on his carbon footprint.  This was, in a relatively minor way, offering some leadership. The science says we need to cut down on meat consumption in order to tackle emissions. 
Instead of being commended, Varadkar was attacked. The then-president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association, Patrick Kent, described the comment as “reckless in the extreme”.
“As one of the most important beef exporters in the northern hemisphere it is very unfortunate that our Taoiseach should be calling into question the sustainability of Irish beef production,” he said. “Surely the onus is on Mr Varadkar to protect such a vital industry; his cavalier comments, however, will do nothing but undermine it.”
Then Fianna Fáil agriculture spokesperson, and current minister of the same portfolio, Charlie McConalogue, said Varadkar should be giving leadership to the beef sector, not making such comments. And on it went. 
The most colourful criticism came from Danny Healy-Rae. “It’s ridiculous to think that people should stop eating meat to change or protect the weather,” he said. Healy-Rae, one of the few TDs to have been completely honest and consistent on the climate, had previously noted that “God above decides the weather”. He doesn’t believe the science.
Varadkar repented within 24 hours. “I was specifically asked what I was doing on climate change and I said that I was trying to eat less red meat — not giving it up,” he said. “I had a very nice Hereford steak last night.”
So it went back in the mists of pre-pandemic times. The smart money says that similar comments on meat-eating from a political leader today would receive much the same reaction. Or, to put it bluntly, save the burning planet by all means if you have to, but don’t be interfering with us.
Political reaction to IPCC report
Last Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its latest report. The window is closing. Greenhouse-gas emissions need to peak by 2025 or the planet could be facing into irreversible decline in which large tracts will be inhabitable and much of the remainder of the planet subject to constant hostile weather. 
The political response has largely been to observe that said decline will only occur sometime after the next two or three general elections and is therefore irrelevant.
There is a lot going on right now, so on one level it is forgivable that the startling parameters set out by the IPCC report have not caused alarm. Fair enough, but what was spoken about regarding the climate during the week? 
Last Sunday, the Transport Minister and Green party leader Eamon Ryan raised the issue of lifestyle changes to accommodate the new reality. He mentioned shorter showers and less driving. The reaction, for the greater part, has been a form of derision.
Read More
Scientists have told us how to solve the climate crisis — will the world listen? 
In the Dáil, People Before Profit’s Mick Barry accused Ryan of “patronising” people. Really? Ask yourself. Have you consciously spent less time showering in deference to the need to conserve energy? Certainly, until this week, I haven’t. 
As for driving, Ryan was merely echoing suggestions advertised by the International Energy Agency. The stock response to that is that the agency doesn’t live in rural Ireland so that should be the end of the matter.
Elsewhere, reports from the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday suggest it would be the perfect home for Healy-Rae’s creationist philosophy.
Brendan Griffin, who was once a junior minister for something or other, reportedly told the meeting the Green Party may soon want people to turn off the light when having sex. Michael Ring’s contribution was to say that the Greens will want people to have one shower a week. Michael Creed worried there could be a huge price to pay for Fine Gael supporting Green Party ideology. Get that.
The climate crisis is not an existential threat to the planet. It’s apparently an ideology pursued by a shower who have a problem with showers and are interfering with the rest of us getting on with our lives. 
Griffin, Ring, and Creed all served in government, represented the country, purported to subscribe to the widely accepted scientific verdict that transformative change is urgently required. As my friend Danny might put it, God above, where in the wide earthly world would you get them?
Carbon tax
The other climate-related issue to rear its head this week was a row over the carbon tax. The tax is not a panacea. One of its two designated features is to change behaviour away from using fossil fuels and there are some problems with alternatives, particularly in rural Ireland. 
But it is also a tiny gesture in attempting to move in the direction required if our children and their children are to have any hope of a half-decent existence. Instead, it was used as a political football during the week. There were cries that the scheduled increase due in May — which works out on average at about a cost of €1.50 a month per household — should be delayed. 
Any hike in the cost of living right now will affect those on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, but instead of specifically addressing that conundrum, the issue is viewed as one on which to hunt down cheap votes.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald described the tax as “crazy”. She lectured Taoiseach Micheál Martin on the madness of insisting the increase go ahead. “It’s the wrong decision at the wrong time,” she said. “Your position is wrong and you have to listen.”
Those comments were made on the day after the IPCC report was published. In terms of leadership, McDonald’s positioning on climate change is probably the most cynical. Not only does she rigidly refrain from issuing hard truths, but she milks the issue shamelessly. 
What's your view on this issue?
You can tell us here
She knows that the public is not yet ready to face up to the reality of what is upon us and therein she sees the possibility of hoovering up a few more votes on the road to power.
Right now, not just here but across the world, climate change is the outstanding issue on which leaders are obliged to act as persuaders for great swathes of the population.
Many among the public are not yet willing to face up to what is at issue. Some are understandably wary that a just transition is not receiving the prominence it should. And more again are simply fearful.
In such a milieu, leadership is desperately needed. And with a few obvious exceptions, it is sorely lacking. History will not be kind to those who have, on this existential issue, abrogated their responsibility.

Next three years critical to avoid 'unprecedented heatwaves, storms, and water shortages'"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/food/arid-40844780.html,2022-04-10 08:00:00,Restaurant review: Rush to Cush in Ballycotton and you won't want to leave,"Night has truly fallen as we head down the vertiginous little hill in Ballycotton, in East Cork, that leads to the harbour and along which Cush is located. Cush is divided into two eating spaces: dining room and more casual ‘pub’. The dining room is smart yet understated: wooden floors, exposed brick walls, low beamed ceiling; bold canvases featuring lobsters rendered in a pop-art style add colour, while large windows to the front frame the harbour’s twinkling lights and Ballycotton Lighthouse.
We mull over the menu while nibbling good breads, especially a nutty, seeded brown, but I knew my choice of starter even before arrival: potato velouté with smoked haddock and ‘crispy’ hen’s egg.
Fresh haddock is wood smoked each week for Cush by nearby Ballycotton Seafood. Warmed fish flakes bathe in a silky rendition of a classic potato velouté, infused with smoked notes from the fish skin. Sitting proud in the centre is a soft boiled hen’s egg, coated in panko breadcrumbs and finished to a crisp. Gentle prod of fork and it falls asunder, spilling viscous golden yolk into the bowl. Imperial Heritage Caviar is an optional extra but should be compulsory; sweet, briny roe flavours skim blithely over and through the deeply comforting troika of fish, sauce and egg.
Cush: veloute
It is the most popular item on the Cush menu, more than 5,000 sold each year, and chef Dan Guerin reckons it will be there long after he is gone. If it were scientifically possible, so will I, still eating this immaculate conception.
Current Wife has mackerel, slow-pickled in a Nordic fashion, over 48 hours, breaking down and dissolving pin bones to leave toothsome textural ‘bite’; the sweet tang of citric chardonnay vinegar and an array of aromatics make for spritely, bright flavours. The supporting cast comprises creamy saline taramasalata, picked crab bound with mayo and chives, refreshing anise of pickled fennel and tarragon and sweet blood orange and elderflower dressing. It is another good dish — though I’d prefer larger portions of mackerel to assert true authority over the interplaying elements.
Next, Norwegian hand-dived scallops, with no Irish counterpart available, and quality is evident. Guerin grills them medium rare, tops them with compound butter (spicy Nduja sausage and roast garlic), then flashes it under grill flame, a bolshie carmelised cap bestriding demurely succulent meat like a gleeful sinner leading the innocent astray.
Cush: halibut
We are in one of the country’s most renowned fishing villages, so fish main courses for both are a given, despite alternatives, including beef and Anjou squab pigeon. CW has Grilled Wild Irish Halibut, skin crisped to a golden ochre, pearlescent flesh, plush and meaty. It is served with almost carnally voluptuous spears of white asparagus, a stonking Grenobloise sauce of browned butter, capers, parsley, lemon, crisp croutons and foamy langoustine bisque fizzing with the tropical heat of Vadouvan spice blend, the classical French nod to Indian cuisine.
Cush: John Dory
My grilled fillet of Wild Irish John Dory is better again, sublime fish in dilisk-flecked seaweed butter sauce, flavours resonating like subsonic bass in the lower register, served with velvet salt-baked celeriac puree, baby leeks with a milk tooth bite and more of that Imperial Heritage caviar because… well, why not?
A side of decadently buttered mash potato ensures desserts are ordered out of professional rigour rather than genuine hunger.
Cush: salted caramel
Salted Caramel Tart is well executed, topped with Grué de Cacao tuille and a quenelle of good vanilla ice cream. Velvet Cloud sheep’s yoghurt is a superb Irish ingredient so panna cotta of same is a no-brainer, especially when served with tender young rhubarb, rhubarb jelly and commendably under-sweetened meringue wafers.
Troupers that we are, we finish both. If you weren’t of a mind for a large dessert, then I recommend a golf-ball-sized choux pastry filled with chocolate and coffee ganache and Chantilly cream for the perfect short, sweet mouthful. We finish that too.
Cush: choux
Though Dan Guerin began as a kitchen porter in Sage Midleton looking to make a few extra bucks for gallivanting: within three months he had found his life’s career. He arrived at the height of chef-proprietor Kevin Ahern’s 12-Mile Menu, sourcing only from within 12 miles of the restaurant — an enforced restriction that fostered innovation and ingrained primary technique but limited Guerin’s access to the traditional staples and recipes of classical cooking, further exacerbated by his decision to forgo culinary college.
His next move, to Garrett Byrne’s Michelin-starred Campagne, in Kilkenny, rectified that, rounding out Guerin’s kitchen education and broadening his knowledge of the wider world of food. Though you can discern the Sage years on his plates and in his selection of superb local produce, it is the influence of the latter restaurant that is more apparent in Guerin’s cooking in Cush, fluidly blending that local produce with premium imports.
His consummate technical skills are very evident, yet yielded with a direct and elemental simplicity of approach that eschews pretension and cheffy showboating, divining the essence of each ingredient, aiming for the heart of each dish.
That he should have earned a Michelin Bib Gourmand so early in his solo career is not that surprising after all, and the three-course set menu at just €36 must currently rank as one of the very best value food offerings in Ireland.
Cush dining room
Next time, however, I’ll be heading for the ‘pub’ side of the house. On the Friday night we visit, all the action is there: same food, same prices but the energy coming out of that room is nuclear in comparison to the more sedate dining room. But that’s another story, for another night. Right now, let’s just celebrate Cush, the latest jewel in Cork’s increasingly lustrous culinary crown.

An Irish staycationer’s guide to eating well on the road"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40850270.html,2022-04-13 10:46:00,Factory prices: Spring lamb trade lift falls short of hoped-for sparkle,"Trade for beef continues to be steady at the factories this week, where the prices are unchanged, with intake at over 39,000 head for last week.
While there continues to be strong demand for stock at the processors, there is a hint that the edge of the appetite in recent weeks to get the extra stock may have eased back a shade.
The intake in the year to date has been very strong and some tightening in the supply is to be expected as the numbers left in the yards deplete over the coming weeks.
Can it be that the slight easing in the tone from the processors this week is simply a marker that they are in the mood to stall against further heating of the prices as the sector moves into the usual peak price period of May-June?
It should be an odds-on bet that they will have to pay more to source sufficient cattle over the next couple of months unless the numbers left in the yards are higher than expected or there is a downturn in the market demand.
Predicting the trade in beef has always been hazardous, and the spring and early summer of 2022 will most likely be no different from the past in the measure of uncertainty for finishers.
The base for steers this week ranges from 475-480 cents/kg, with most of the intake at the higher end and reports of a few cents per kilo more being secured in some direct deals.
The base for heifers is running at 5c per kilo premium over the steers at a range of 480-485 cents/kg and up to 490 cents/kg for larger numbers.
The hunger for cattle at the factories over the past few months has also fuelled the opportunity for suppliers to deal for flat prices, inclusive of quality and breed bonuses, which has pushed the return for some Angus heifers to 520-530c/kg.
While the price for young bulls is running close to that of the equivalent grade steer at 480-485c/kg for Rs, the cow trade is marginally stronger. The quality R grade cows are making up to 460c/kg, while up to 440c/kg is being paid for O grade.
As mentioned the intake for last week at 39,062 head continues very strong. Although it was over 10,000 head higher than the same week last year, it is not a true comparison due to 2021 being a shorter working week.
Last week's supply included 15,281 steers, 10,891 heifers, 8,535 cows, and 2,252 young bulls.
Intake for the first quarter has topped half a million, setting a new record supply for the first three months of the year at 501,226 head. Over the same period in 2021, intake reached 448,072 head.
Lamb trade lift falls short
There has been a slight improvement in the lamb prices at the factories this week, but falling short of the sparkle the new-season lamb producers would have hoped for to supply the Easter trade.
At best, the spring lamb producers are struggling to get €1/kg above the hogget price, which does not compensate for the additional cost, normally associated with the production of new-season lamb for Easter and most certainly does not add up for the higher input costs in 2022.
There have been a few more of the new season lambs available to the processors this week. The factories are quoting a base of 790 cents/kg and suppliers are reporting that they are securing deals at 820-835 cents/kg.
There is disappointment among breeders at the premium available for the spring lamb, which will probably lead to even fewer being available in future years.
The hoggets continue to make up most of the intake at the factories, where they are being quoted at 705-720c/kg, with the general run of intake making 730-740c/kg.
There was a much larger entry at Kilkenny Mart on Monday, where there was 780 head on offer.
The spring lambs sold for up to €124 over recording a top price of €176 for a pen of 10 weighing 52kg, while the hoggets old for up to €122 over, with a leading price of €174 for a pen of eight weighing 52kg. Up to €110 over was paid for the factory type hoggets.
Spring lambs: pen of 14 weighing 48kg — €168; pen of 10 weighing 45kg — €162. Hoggets: Pen of 12 weighing 58kg — €173; pen of 16 weighing 62kg — €170; pen of 18 weighing 56kg — €167.

Farm Finance: Four inflation-busting tips for your farm"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40850867.html,2022-04-13 16:52:00,Ireland needs to ‘grow up’ over stigma towards hemp industry,"The emerging hemp industry in Ireland is in a “catch-22”, according to Robert Johnson of Hemp Cooperative Ireland.
Speaking to the Irish Examiner at the recent Irish Hemp Event held at Teagasc’s Ashtown Food Research Centre in Dublin 15, Mr Johnson said that unless more hemp is grown, there won’t be the processing facilities put in place on a scale, but that farmers interested in growing it also need the stability of facilities and a market.
He said that the co-op has found young farmers and entrepreneurs to be “really engaged” with the crop, and can see potential uses for it.
“They’re incredibly dynamic, they’re thoughtful and they ask the right questions and they take risks; they haven’t been beaten down the years, they’ve got the youthful vigour,” Mr Johnson said.
Younger people don’t seem to get the stigma. Hemp is doing good things, it’s helping and healing people.
“It’s unusual that we’re so far behind our European neighbours.”
He said some of the problems lie with educating people and then allowing for the removal of “the stigma, and then moving to more regenerative farming” in Ireland.
“Farming is at risk and I’m sure all the farmers know that,” he said.
“It’s a viable crop, it can add value to your farm, that’s the biggest thing. People are fixated on the THC [tetrahydrocannabinol] content and the next thing needs to obviously be removing it from the Misuse of Drugs Act.
“Hemp is a crop, there is a safe limit of THC in food. There’s a zero-tolerance policy here and that can’t continue.”
Learning curve
Wicklow hemp farmer Ed Hanbidge told the event that he grew his first crop of hemp in 2015, having looked for “something different” to do alongside his beef and sheep enterprise.
He grew an “absolutely great” crop, despite having known “nothing about it”, but that “the only way to do anything is to just go and do it, learn by doing”.
He said that farming is one side of it, but “it’s not so simple to sell”, because markets are “only emerging and only developing”.
He started to look at the food side of things, and researched the Finola hemp variety, a “dwarf variety, easy to combine, to grow for seed” for hemp oil production, and that’s what he went for.
“We now have our own combine, we have a drying trailer to dry it, we have our own cleaners so we’re able to clean the seed, and we have our own presses, so we’re able to press the seed and we make the hemp seed oil, and we’re also looking now at balms and various different hemp products,” Mr Hanbidge said.
“My biggest problem is being a farmer — because I’m too involved in the farm as such, that I’m not a business person, I’m more of a farmer, I like to be stuck in the lambing shed, elbow deep, but I need to be out selling and it’s harder for me because I’m not a salesperson.”
The start-up, Keadeen Mountain Farms, has been a “learning curve”.
Part of that, first and foremost, was learning how to grow hemp, then how to process it, and the “steepest curve” was learning how to sell it, and market it.
'A bit of a problem'
With hemp, he has encountered barriers in accessing finance and insurance for his business endeavour.
“There’s a bit of a problem there,” he said.
“Why is it such a problem? Why can we not get money for hemp food, and it is safe food? Food that is healthy, very healthy.
“I thought we had moved away from the stigma but there still seems to be that stigma there.
“There still seems to be a barrier, but for no reason; I don’t know what that reason is.
“THC is what the fear is about. We’re afraid of THC. Maybe it’s time we grew up a little bit.
“To me, it’s ridiculous — because I’m immersed in the industry and I know hemp has so little THC.”
He said hemp is “just a plant”, and “we should embrace it”.
“THC is stifling the industry. It’s really holding the whole thing back.
“There [are] safe levels and there’s education.
“There’s a lot of money to be made. There’s nothing wrong with profit, and there’s a lot of profit to be made in the hemp industry.
“Once we get a market and we get people to realise the potential, what hemp can do and what hemp products can be made.”
Speaking at the event, Teagasc energy and rural development specialist Barry Caslin said that there are a lot of opportunities in hemp, with the development of markets in Ireland to be one of the most interesting areas in the future.
“There have been challenges in this area in the last number of years, and a lot of it is getting critical mass, getting the required volume of product to justify creating markets,” Mr Caslin said.
He said farmers “need stability” and “structure”, especially when they’re deciding to grow a crop like this.
“If you bring your milk to the dairy co-op you get your price per litre, you bring your grain to the co-op you get a price per tonne, or you bring your cattle to the factory you get a price per kg.
“Those structures are there for most commodities.
“Around hemp, those structures are not really there and in terms of the processing of the hemp, the decortication, there’s been a lot of stop-starts in hemp over the last years.
“We’ve seen a lot of emphasis in more recent times on CBD [cannabidiol], on the food side, there have been challenges there in terms of legislation.”
He noted that the programme for government has an “emphasis on industrial hemp”, with a consultation recently being held on how markets can be developed for this.
“It is a very interesting crop in terms of what can be developed from it, what can be produced from the crop,” Mr Caslin said.
“In terms of industrial fibre crop, there’s no issue in getting licensing for that, farmers can legally grow industrial hemp and get a licence to do that.
“It’s about getting the critical mass of crop in the ground that justifies building a decortication plant and process all of that and that requires coordination, it requires pulling the right people together, and having that critical mass.”
Only cultivars with less than 0.2% THC — the narcotic component of the plant — may be grown for fibre and seed oil production in the EU, according to information compiled by Mr Caslin.

New forum tasked with growing and developing organic sector in Ireland
CBD is not a controlled drug following separation and extraction. While it is psychoactive, it is not psychotropic. However, if CBD-containing products or preparations also contain THC, in any quantities, these are considered controlled drugs.
There is currently no legal exemption in Ireland under the Misuse of Drugs legislative framework for any amount of THC, causing a barrier for the processing of hemp in Ireland, as the main two cannabinoids in industrial hemp are CBD and THC, Mr Caslin said.
Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, cannabis means any part of the plant of the genus cannabis, but excludes the following after separation from the rest of the plant: the mature stalk and fibre produced from it; and the seeds.
Under current legislation, hemp farmers must destroy the hemp flower, and as cannabinoids are produced in the flower head, there is a further regulatory barrier to the development of an Irish hemp-derived food and cannabinoid market.
The sale of the flower could be permitted between farmer and processor to allow for the extraction of cannabinoids. Once the cannabinoids are separated from the plant the waste can be destroyed, per An Garda Síochána requirement.
Project will explore hemp’s carbon sequestration potential
At the Irish Hemp Event, a one-year project involving hemp focused on improving the quality of soil and local biodiversity has been launched.
Loop Head Together, a community-based, local development and farming forum based on the Loop Head Peninsula launched its Hemp4Soil project, a European Innovation Partnership project at the Irish Hemp Event 2022 held recently at Teagasc's Ashtown Food Research Centre in Dublin 15, organised by Hemp Cooperative Ireland.
The first of its kind in Europe, the project will explore how growing hemp on the land of local farmers on the Loop Head Peninsula could help create sustainable income streams for farmers in the future, as well as provide a product.
The project will use regenerative farming techniques to improve life in the soil in three ways - soil remediation, microbial life, and carbon storage. 
The main objectives of the project are to reduce the presence of chemical fertilisers, improve soil microbial activity, and increase carbon content of the soil.
Speaking at the launch, project lead Laura J Foley and researchers involved with the project pointed to a potential for a follow-up 'phase 2' project, which could look at a regulated rollout of hemp cultivation as a farming initiative’
""Hemp has the potential to solve many of our environmental challenges in a way that is economically beneficial to farming communities,"" Ms Foley said. 
""Incorporating hemp cultivation and regenerative farming techniques into our traditional farming system has the potential to reduce costly inputs while creating additional revenue streams for farms.""
Speaking at the event, Glyn Mitchell of The Carbon Farm in Jersey said with the world being in “dangerous territory” with CO2 levels, Governments are ""starting to look at farming and agriculture in a very different light because there is only one sink for carbon that we have agency over - and that's the soil"".
""We need farmers in order to actually make that happen,"" Mr Mitchell said.
The Carbon Farm has been working with Jersey Hemp, a licensed British hemp farm, to improve and track soil health and carbon sequestration through industrial hemp cultivation. The Carbon Farm provides biologically complete compost to aid the nutrient demands of hemp.
Mr Mitchell's role with Jersey Hemp is to work with farmers to ""increase the amount of carbon in their soils which they need in order to actually grow the crop without synthetics"".
According to The Carbon Farm and Jersey Hemp, the crop regenerates soils for other crops and trees."

“I’m not from a massive foodie family,” he admits. “We had good, home-cooked food, but by no means was it MasterChef – it was spag bol, cottage pie, roast dinners – the classics.” Baber has fond memories of food, particularly going to his granddad’s house on the weekends. He recalls being in the kitchen with him – “and I guarantee there’d be music, he’d be having a good time cooking, dancing, enjoying it. I could see he enjoyed the process, and I loved being part of that. I could see how much satisfaction he got from serving us as a family,” Baber adds.
But his food education didn’t come from his family. As Baber explains: “I was self-taught, through what I was gathering on TV – I’d come in from school and watch stuff like Ready Steady Cook, I was obsessed with cookery shows. I’d see things and after watching, go in the kitchen and experiment” – and this “naturally evolved” into Baber learning how to cook.
A long-time fan of cooking shows, Baber soon found himself on one – BBC One’s Yes Chef, which he won in 2016. He calls it a “surreal” experience – and one that was very far from his life back in Hexham, Northumberland – but adds that “once I got started, it was like I finally found what it is I love to do”.
 Chris Baber, author of Easy (Ebury Press, £16.99).
This is when his life completely changed. His food hero, Atul Kochhar, was a judge on the show, and invited Baber to come to London and work in the kitchen of his Michelin-starred restaurant, Benares. Looking back now, he says it was “absolutely bonkers, but the most incredible experience”.
And as a home cook, it was a real trial by fire. “I’ve probably never worked so hard, but I’ve also probably never learned so much in such a short space of time,” Baber admits.
His future wasn’t to be in professional kitchens, however. Instead, Baber wanted to translate what he learned into simple tips and tricks for people at home – and that’s what he’s done in his debut cookbook, Easy.
Throughout the book, you’ll find the odd recipe from the northeast of England, such as singing hinnies (pan-fried scones), or panacalty (a type of corned beef pie).
“It was really important to me – first of all, because it tastes delicious and it’s easy to make,” Baber explains. “There’s so much food out there, and we’re lucky enough to have access to the most amazing ingredients from around the world, which is fantastic. But I also think there are some recipes like panacalty – it’s a northeast delicacy – if people aren’t making it, I feel like some of these recipes can eventually die out.
“It’s something I grew up with and I’ve got great memories eating it,” he adds. “And I’ve got an opportunity here to share it with people who aren’t just in the northeast, and shed new light on it as a dish.” Baber muses that outsiders might think food from the northeast is “cheap and basic – but actually, I would say it’s wholesome, hearty food that is designed to fill people up and satisfy you, but with tonnes of flavour and not much fuss”.
Many of these delicacies have been passed down in working-class families, and they “deliver on taste – but also ease and cost as well”, he notes.
And Baber certainly seems to be onto something – celebrities including Tom Daley, Alan Carr and Gordon Ramsay are fans, his YouTube videos have been viewed over 4.5 million times, and he has some 161k Instagram followers.
“When I was younger, I thought food’s a passion – I’ll never work in it, or maybe I’ll lose the passion for it. But I was so wrong – I just grew to love it even more as I began to work in it.” And whether it’s cooking a roast for his family or taking the time to make porridge for himself in the morning: “I just love food,” says Baber. “It’s one of the greatest joys in life.”

They fully agree something has to be done to cut down on the number of fatalities on the Cork–Limerick road. However, they also maintain the upgrade being planned is going to seriously impact livelihoods, health and the environment and many of them see a better way of solving the problem.
One of those who will suffer most is Liam Mackessy, who runs a 98-acre beef suckler farm on the western side of Charleville.
His land is long and narrow and earmarked for the new road. A 500m-wide corridor is being set aside by the road project team for the whole 80km stretch between the two cities, which will include a segregated walkway/cycleway.
A 500m wide corridor running through Liam’s land will make his farm inoperable. His property bounds the main Charvleville–Newtownshandrum road. A flyover will have to be built over it.
This means massive earth embankments will have to be constructed on his farm to raise the road enough to connect with the flyover. They're estimated to be 5m high and will be extremely close to the gable end of his house.
The road will also necessitate the demolition of four sheds and a grain silo. A well for the cattle will also have to go.
Generations
The Mackessy’s have farmed there for three generations and his late mother, Mary, spent years before her death in 2019 battling to stop the road coming through there. The family said she spent a small fortune on experts to prevent it.
Liam’s sister, Breda, said they were upset to recently get letters about the proposed project from its designers which were addressed to their late mother.
Breda’s also has a letter in her possession, from the same sources, directed to their brother, Michael. He died in a farming accident in 2013.
Breda said they've pointed this out to the senders and hope it will never happen again. “It’s not very pleasant,” she said. 
The brother and sister are in favour of a bypass of the town, noting it would make it safer. They also feel the road is in the wrong place. They say it should be to the eastern side of the town as that’s where all the big industry is, and where the vast majority of the HGV which will travel specifically into Charleville go.
Liam said:
I could lose up to 50 acres. To lose so much land would make it impossible to run what’s left of the farm.
He’s now awaiting the CPO (Compulsory Purchase Order) process, and not looking forward to it.
Liam also thinks it somewhat ironic that a greenway will form part of the corridor, right next to the new highway with the pollution coming from passing cars and trucks hitting its users first. “To me that doesn’t make sense, it’s hardly green then, is it?” he said.
“I wonder do you even need motorways now. There are more people working from home since Covid. People are also making fewer trips because of the rising price of petrol and diesel,” Breda said.
They're also concerned that, as yet, not one of the project team has called to them in person to explain the situation on the ground.
“We have had to log onto zoom calls to see what’s happening. The wifi is scandalous here. There will be a lot of older people impacted who don’t even know how to operate a computer. They have to make appointments to go and meet the (project team) people in Cork or Limerick. I want to know why they can’t come here and meet us,” Breda said.

Resistance
Brian Hyde, chairman of the Cork-Limerick Alliance, which was set up to fight the motorway plan, points out that 700 property owners will be impacted by the road up-grade and many will be farmers like Liam.
He and a lot of his members think the best and cheaper option is to run a link to Limerick off the M8 (Cork-Dublin motorway) at Cahir or Mitchelstown and build bypasses around Buttevant and Charleville.
Mr Hyde said just 3,000 vehicles a day make a complete journey between Cork and Limerick. The rest, of which there are a lot more, make smaller commutes between adjoining towns and villages to both cities.
He believes it doesn’t make economic sense to build a massive new road for such small numbers. He also doesn't believe the road will be built for €1.5bn being quoted.
I think it'll cost double that. Land and construction prices have gone through the roof. 
""Even if they build the road we'll still have safety issues with the current road. People will still use that and as we know the Ballybeg bends, south of Buttevant, are very dangerous. Why not bypass them now?""
Johnny Hannan, a retired civil engineer with 33 years’ experience, agrees with Mr Hyde.
“A northern relief road for Mallow is planned. A flyover could be built over the two roundabouts in Mallow (on the Cork-Dublin road).
It wouldn’t cost very much. The flyover, the relief road and the bypasses in Buttevant and Charleville would suffice.
He also questions why steel cables couldn’t be inserted on sections of the road, as they are in the Rathduff and Grenagh areas, which prevent overtaking in dangerous places.
The cables make these some of the safest sections along the entire current route.
The proposed bypass of Mallow will run to the eastern side of the town and through a picturesque valley in the Rahan area, which is about halfway between the town and the village of Killavullen.
It’s in Rahan that Mr Hannan’s son, Colin, runs the Glen Aire horse-riding stables. His business is going to be badly affected as part of his land will be swallowed up by the new highway.
He provides riding lessons for around 200 people a week. Importantly, he and his team specialises in providing horse riding therapy services for children and adults with autism and sensory issues.
Some of these clients travel long distances to attend the riding school because of the knowledge and experience Glen Aire has.
Groups also regularly attend from St Joseph’s Foundation in Charleville, HOPE Montessori in Cork City, along with the early intervention schools in Mallow and its surrounding towns.
“We know from the reports of the health professionals our clients attend, how important riding and interaction with the horses and ponies is for them. It leads to significant improvements in their development, behaviour and overall wellbeing,” Colin said.
Aisling Crowley says Glen Aire has been a ""game-changer"" for her young son, Joshua.
“His diagnosis of ASD means he requires several therapies every week. Time on horse-back for the purpose of regulation is essential for him. 
""The thought of possibly losing such a niche and critical service on a permanent basis fills me with anxiety. I have no shame in saying I honestly couldn’t cope with the long-term effect it would have on Joshua and our household,” she said.
Construction machinery
Colin is concerned the sound of heavy construction machinery will impact on both the horses and these children.
He understands up to 22 acres of his property will be taken by the road and this will cut down significantly on the horse trails he has.
“The trails business will be severely impacted. We stable about 40 horses here permanently for their owners and I could see damage being done to that part of the business as well. The land that will be taken up generates a lot of hay for the horses during the winters and so I’d have to then buy it in,” he said.
Colin is also worried about air and noise pollution and ‘liquid run-off’ from the new highway, which will be elevated (on stilts) above his land.
""We have a large stream here which is a tributary of the River Blackwater. There will be a huge run-off from the motorway which could enter it. 
""Air pollution is a factor, because the wind predominantly blows from east to west across the valley. There will also be noise during construction and from traffic when it’s opened.""
Biodiversity blow
Eileen Forde runs a cattle and sheep farm across the other side of the valley at Knockpogue. She's operated it for the past nine years, after being left the land by her late uncle.
Almost immediately she set about reducing her stock and planting new trees. She said she was following the advice of the Government on biodiversity, but this is about to backfire.
She has around 60 acres and planted approximately 10 acres of that nine years ago with oak trees, which are maturing nicely.
Unfortunately, they look to be right in the path of the planned highway, or at least that’s what the road designers’ are telling her is likely.
“This is a terrible shame. They will have to go. We were told to grow trees and cut down on our stock for biodiversity reasons and now this is what happens,” she said.
If the highway goes ahead as currently planned, it will be as close as 250m to Rahan National School, which many parents of children attending believe is far too close, especially as it will be elevated.
The amount of noise and air pollution during the construction period and when it's open is going to be extremely disruptive for the children and the school community, according to Rahan National School Parents’ Association.

The school is in a beautiful rural location overlooking the valley — a tranquil view which parents say will be torn apart by the new road.
“We are disappointed and very concerned about the proposed new road location cutting right through the valley next to the school,” Leona O’Regan of Rahan National School Parents' Association said.
""Preserving and appreciating our beautiful countryside is central to our school community. We are extremely concerned about the noise and air pollution that the proposed new road will bring to the area, particularly being so close to the schoolyard where the children will be playing,” she said.
The school community has just raised €30,000 to develop a badly needed new play area.
In March, the community got together over a weekend to plant nearly 1,500 native Irish trees in the school grounds to develop a new 1.5 acres bio-diversity trail for the pupils to enjoy and learn more about nature.
Ms O’Regan said the parents’ association members are devastated to think that it will all have been in vain if the new road goes ahead.
Lisa Geary, who has two children attending the national school, is a committed environmentalist seriously concerned about the impact of the new road on the fauna and flora of the area.
I dread to think of the widescale environmental damage that is going to be done to the Blackwater River, the beautiful valley and the local national school if this road is allowed to go ahead as planned.
“I strongly support the aim to improve travel times on the existing N20 and to make it safer, but I'm absolutely appalled by the approach the planners are taking. There has been next to no consideration for the environment in this entire plan. It was the same 12 years ago. It’s just hard to believe that nothing has changed — more than a decade on — at a time when the climate crisis is raging,” Ms Geary said.
She pointed out there are many protected species in the area, with six of them in the Blackwater River alone.
The river has been designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under EU Law.
“Building the proposed new bridge over the Blackwater is going to release an incredible amount of silt and no amount of so-called mitigation is going to prevent that. It will kill or severely harm those species,” Ms Geary claimed.

https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40859165.html,2022-04-27 14:58:00,Full access for sheepmeat exports to US,"Full access for Irish sheepmeat to the US market has been gained following an agreement on a bilateral health certificate, agriculture minister Charlie McConalogue has confirmed.
Mr McConalogue made the announcement this week while leading an agri-food trade mission to the US.
An agreement was reached with the US Department of Agriculture on a veterinary health certificate for the export of Irish sheepmeat to the US, which allows Irish sheepmeat plants to formally apply for approval to export to the US.
This follows the publication last December of a US Department of Agriculture rule which removed restrictions on exports of most sheep and goat products from the EU.
“The speedy agreement on certification conditions comes after many years of preparatory work; in particular, USDA recognition in 2019 of the equivalence [of] Ireland’s sheepmeat inspection system with US domestic standards,” Mr McConalogue said.
“It is, therefore, very much a testament to the high standards and reputation of Irish sheep farming.""
Bord Bia's chief executive Tara McCarthy said that there has “never been a better time” for Irish companies to export lamb to the US. She said that Bord Bia’s research shows that lamb consumption is growing amongst consumers, particularly in the younger age categories in North America.
According to Bord Bia’s market insights, import volumes of sheepmeat to the US have increased from 103,527 tonnes in 2015 to 166,165 tonnes in 2021.

Ms McCarthy added that the announcement will allow Bord Bia and the Irish sheepmeat industry to “build on the already positive image” of Ireland within the US and allow for an expansion of the product range under consideration by US importers, wholesalers, and ultimately consumers.
However, sheep farmers are concerned that there is “little prospect” they will benefit financially from the gaining of access to the US market.
According to Sean McNamara, sheep chairman of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ Association, farmers have become “increasingly sceptical” as to whether the opening of new markets has “any real benefit” for them.
“In the past, such announcements have not been followed by any strengthening of prices,” Mr McNamara argued.
With the cost of inputs “through the roof”, Mr McNamara said that sheep farmers should be able to command €10/kg for spring lamb this year to cover their costs.
“But that is simply not how it works unfortunately and getting a fair price for the primary producer - one that covers the cost of production – remains as problematic as ever,” Mr McNamara added.
“The opportunity to export to US will no doubt be great news for the processors and for all others who make money off the backs of farmers. 
""But, the fanfare associated with opening new markets is only for those who are going to reap the rewards. It is reprehensible that primary producers continually get forgotten with all the hype.”

I love to batch cook at the weekends because it sets me up for the week ahead and takes all the speculation out of our meals and snacks. It also saves my wallet from trips to the supermarket to pick up ‘messages’. The messages are like a magical charm that start off with a curt list of bread and milk for example and multiply into cushions, pots for the garden, a scented candle, and the loud sound of my bank balance hitting the wall.
Batch cooking can seem very intimidating if you’ve never tried it before. It may sound incredibly time-consuming but actually, you’re giving yourself the gift of time back on another day. There are three main ways of batch cooking and I definitely prefer the third option as it takes so much less time and it’s easy to slot into at least one meal a week.
Firstly, there is dedicated batch cooking (as I did) where you set aside time to cook or prepare several meals in advance. Secondly, there is item cooking where you focus on a single ingredient, such as rice, and swiftly make at least one set for use on another day.
Finally, there is the easiest method where you simply make double quantities of your meal, serve half, and then store half. So if you’re making a roast chicken dinner, buy a large chicken instead of a medium chicken (the larger size chicken is better value), peel twice as many spuds, and prepare twice as many vegetables. Making beef bolognese for dinner? Make twice as much of the sauce or you can try my recipe below.
When it comes to storing all of this wonderfully prepared food I don’t recommend any particular brand of box; the most important thing is that the tubs you use have a tight seal and that you leave about 20% of the air in the top of the container so that you allow for expansion in the freezer. Freezer bags are also fine but don’t throw them away after one use. Wash the bags, dry them and use them again.
Remember
One meal of leftovers in the freezer is one less meal you have to cook another day. Plus, it’s easily reheated so you won’t get caught out looking at takeaway menus. There is nothing wrong with eating leftovers the following day either so you don’t need to freeze your food. Simply allow your meal to cool to room temperature before covering and placing it into the fridge. We don’t put warm food into the fridge because it can mess with the internal temperature of all the food in the fridge and becomes a health risk.
Supermarket deals
This week Dunnes Stores is top of the basket leader board once again. In even better news for Dunnes Stores customers, some of their prices have dipped a little more thanks to the reintroduction of own brand digestive biscuits and the cost of their free-range eggs reducing to €1.60.
The Bank Holiday weekend signals the start of barbecue season in the supermarkets and hopefully at home. 
Lidl has two skinny burgers for €1.99 and pork loin chops for €3.39, not forgetting vacuum-packed corn on the cob for 49c. I love barbecuing corn on the cob and this is a great price so it'll be worth stocking up on. 
Dunnes Stores have a 3-for-€10 on a wide range of meat, poultry, and seafood suitable for the barbecue this weekend. My top pick there would be the packs of free-range, boneless chicken thigh fillets. I'll be buying as many as my budget allows and filling my freezer at that price.
Aldi has a small Irish chicken for just €2.69 which is very price friendly. If you were planning on getting a large chicken in Aldi it may be more cost-effective to buy 2 small ones instead.
Free-range eggs are on their way back to shelves.
Finally, it looks like those 'barn eggs' stickers on free-range eggs may be a thing of the past very soon. With the risk of avian flu having subsided a bit it looks like free-range farmers will be allowed to release their poultry to roam free. Good news all around.
Here's how the Irish Examiner shopping basket shaped up this week:
My perfect rice

Ingredients
75g of rice per person
½ teaspoon of salt
Method
Rinse the rice well in cold water. Place the washed rice into a medium saucepan with a lid. Add the salt and top up with cold water until the water covers the rice. Continue to pour in water until the water line is about 2.5cm above the level of the rice.
Put the lid on top and bring the heat to medium-high. When the water begins to simmer turn down the heat on the hob until it’s a very slow bubble. Keep an eye on the saucepan and when the water level dips below the rice turn the heat off altogether. Cover the saucepan and leave to stand for 10 minutes before serving.
To freeze the rice bring it to room temperature rapidly. I do this by pouring out the contents of the saucepan onto a large baking tray and spreading it out. Some people like to rinse the rice in cold water but this interferes with the starch content and texture so I’m not a fan, although it does cool the rice quickly.
As soon as the rice is at room temperature place it into a freezer-friendly container and straight into the freezer. When reheating from frozen make sure the rice is piping hot. You can either steam it with a little bit of water in a saucepan or add it to sauces or stir-fries straight from the freezer.
Rhubarb crumble

3 large stalks of rhubarb, chopped into small chunks
50g caster sugar
100g oat flour
50g butter, cut into small cubes

50g jumbo oats
25g sunflower seeds
25g pumpkin seeds
Method
Preheat your (fan assisted) oven to 170°C.
Put the chopped rhubarb and the first 50g of sugar into the baking dish. Stir so that the sugar coats the rhubarb pieces.
Into a large mixing bowl put the oat flour and butter. Making sure your hands are clean, use the tips of your fingers to rub the butter and flour together until you get a breadcrumb like texture. *note you might find that the ratio of butter and flour makes it a bit 'chunky', that's fine it will balance out in the end. Add the sugar and rub the mixture together again. Finally, add the jumbo oats and seeds, then stir well so that all the crumble ingredients are combined.
Loosely sprinkle the crumble on top of the rhubarb in the dish. Never, ever press a crumble mixture down, it depends on the air you introduce to make it light and crisp! If you're not a fan of thick crumble then only sprinkle half the mixture on top of the fruit and put the rest in the freezer for another day. Crumble mixture freezes extremely well and this mixture is suitable for any fruit crumble, not just rhubarb.
Bake the crumble in the oven for 25-45 minutes, removing when the top of the crumble turns golden brown.

Are we there yet? I think we just might be — the Covid cobwebs are dusted away and dining out now seems as natural and fun as it did 36 months ago. There have been several new openings all over the country and getting a booking is as difficult as I can remember. So there was proper excitement when the artful Engineer scored a lunch booking in Orwell Road Restaurant in Rathgar a couple of Saturdays ago.
Orwell Road is a former coffee shop (Howard’s Way) and rather compact but the space has been nicely transformed — it feels modern, airy and comfortable. At the helm is über talented Dan Hannigan, last written about here when he was perfecting the art of barbecue in Mister S on Camden Street. Dan is working with Marc and Conor Bereen who own Charlotte Quay Restaurant and were forced to close their much loved Coppinger Row restaurant recently due to the building being redeveloped — if they can find a suitable space expect a revival.
We began with snacks and you should too. Free-range Andarl Pork Croquettes (€6.50) were ping-pong-ball sized crispy globes of happiness filled with sweet meaty pulled pork in a crispy breadcrumb case topped with apple. A mini Mackerel tart (€6.50) with ceviche mackerel cubes flavoured with ponzu and chilli flavours was a nigh-on perfect palate awakener, while Buttermilk fried lions mane mushroom (€5) with a tarragon emulsion caused the Physicist to declare that all mushrooms should be deep fried thus — he was not wrong.
Cáis na Tíre tortellini and burnt onion broth
As I write this and reflect on the several dozen flavours we experienced my mind keeps dwelling on our starters — they were so good I think we could happily have ordered them twice. Dry aged Beef Short Rib (€14) came with a bonus fluffy beef fat brioche perfect for mopping up the meaty juices. The ribs had been slow-cooked long enough that you felt you could almost crunch the bones — the intense beefy flavours lightened a little by wild garlic and shimeji style mushrooms. Chicken & Scallops (€16) involved plump juicy caramelised scallops topped with crispy chicken skin, while a herb stuffed Chicken wing added extra substance and layers. Cáis Na Tíre tortellini (€13) meanwhile arrived in an umami rich ‘burnt onion broth’ a dish that almost caused a row it was so good — definitely order two of those.
Monkfish from Orwell Road
Tender BBQ Monkfish on the Bone with smoked mussels and trout caviar sauce (€34), and luscious meaty Lamb rump (€34) cooked rare and served with asparagus and a roasted cos lettuce with Caesar dressing, need far more space than I can give them, as do the sides. Ballymakenny farm potatoes (€5) were roasted until golden and Courgettes had a subtle but lively preserved lemon dressing — mere vegetables have no right to taste this good.
The wine list is a pleasing mix of classic and modern styles and I am told it will change with the seasons. At the upper end you will find Róisín Curley Burgundies and Rausan-Ségla Margaux but there are also left field choices such as Ch. Ksara white from Lebanon and a Txacoli from the Spanish Basque Country. Prices start at €30 for supremely juicy and drinkable Rafael Cambra Garnacha from Valencia and smoky ripe ‘Crazy Grapes’ Monastrell from Jumilla in Eastern Spain (€36).
Salted Caramel, Chocolate and Blood Orange (€9) offered delightful contrasts between subtle toffee cream, rich chocolate and punchy blood oranges — in both whole and sorbet form. Orange and chocolate is always a killer combination but this went further. My feather-light vanilla parfait meanwhile was given heft with some rhubarb and sweet crunch with a light meringue.
So please put Orwell Road on the ever-expanding list of places you need to visit, there are flavours and complexities here I'd need twice the space to evoke. There is no trickery here, just a bullish full-on focus on flavour — you'll be wowed.
The Tab:
A substantial lunch for three including five glasses of wine, three snacks, three starters, two mains and two desserts cost €198
The Verdict:
Food: 9.5/10
Wine: 9/10
Service: 9/10
Ambiance: 9/10
Value: 9/10
In a Sentence:
Orwell Road is one of the most exciting restaurant openings of the last 12 months with creative precise cooking in a comfortable modern space — good luck getting a booking!

https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-40863152.html,2022-05-01 19:57:00,Global shortage of affordable fertilisers will leave no household unscathed,"For the first time ever, farmers the world over — all at the same time — are testing the limits of how little chemical fertiliser they can apply without devastating their yields come harvest time. Early predictions are bleak.
In Brazil, the world’s biggest soybean producer, a 20% cut in potash use could bring a 14% drop in yields, according to MB Agro. In Costa Rica, a coffee co-operative representing 1,200 small producers sees output falling as much as 15% next year if the farmers miss even one-third of normal application.
In West Africa, falling fertiliser use will shrink this year’s rice and corn harvest by a third, according to the International Fertilizer Development Center, a food security non-profit group.
Patrice Annequin, a fertiliser market expert at IFDC based in Ivory Coast, comments: 
Probably farmers will grow enough to feed themselves. But the question is what they will have to feed the cities.
When you add increased hunger across West Africa on top of existing risks like terrorism, “this is absolutely dangerous for many governments in our region”.
For the billions of people who don’t work in agriculture, the global shortage of affordable fertiliser likely reads like a distant problem. 
In truth, it will leave no household unscathed. In even the least-disruptive scenario, soaring prices for synthetic nutrients will result in lower yields and higher grocery prices for everything from milk to beef to packaged foods across the developed world.
Lower fertiliser use risks engendering malnutrition, political unrest and, ultimately, hunger. 
“I’m reducing the use of fertiliser in this crop cycle. I can’t afford such stratospheric prices,” Marcelo Cudia, 61, a farmer in the Philippines’ rice-producing region of Central Luzon, said outside the patch of land he’s been cultivating for the last 13 years.
About 12,000 miles away, Brazilian soybean farmer Napoleão Rutilli is facing the same tough choices.
“If fertilisers are expensive, we’ll use less fertilisers. If we’ll use less, we’ll produce less,” said the second-generation farmer, 33. “Food prices will increase and everyone will suffer”.

Precision fertiliser: Delivering the right rate in the right place will be the key to 2022"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40863527.html,2022-05-03 07:30:00,"Up to €1,000 each for farmers to grow silage amid grain shortage","Farmers are to be given up to €1,000 each to help them increase silage output as part of a €55 million scheme to offset the grain shortage caused by the war in Ukraine.
The Cabinet is today set to approve a major new silage scheme, the Irish Examiner has learned. With the cost of silage likely to rise by up to 30% this year because of the war and the wider cost-of-living crisis, farming groups have been demanding urgent action.
Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue will bring a memo to Cabinet where he will outline plans for a €55m package to support farmers to grow crops to ensure sufficient feed for cattle this winter.
According to the memorandum, the package being developed will reward farmers with a €100/ha payment for all silage cut up to 10ha.
This means farmers will be eligible to receive up to €1,000 each with the payment to be made later in the year. While a budget is not yet finalised, it is understood that up to €55m could be earmarked for it.
The Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association (INHFA) has said a silage and hay subsidy must be introduced to offset the massive increase in fertilizer, plastic and diesel prices this year. A payment of at least €5 a bale will be required for farmers, the body said.
What's your view on this issue?
You can tell us here
It is demanding that Mr McConalogue push for support as a matter of urgency. It is estimated that the cost of making baled silage this summer will increase by close to 30%. INFHA president Vincent Roddy estimated that the price could hit €30 a bale this year.
The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) have welcomed the support but said more will be needed.
“Sky rocketing input costs are putting huge pressure on farmers and we are already behind time in encouraging farmers to maximise grass growth,” said IFA President Tim Cullinan.
“The Minister must move quickly to announce the details and get the scheme up and running. The way input costs are going, more support will be needed. There are real food security concerns emerging from global agencies and it’s important that Irish farmers are helped and supported to produce food.” 
This is the latest financial package Mr McConalogue has secured for farmers who are facing spiralling costs as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Mr McConalogue previously delivered a €12m Tillage Incentive Scheme to help farmers to grow tillage crops, as well as clover and multi-species swards, to help offset the country's dependency on imported grains and artificial fertilisers.
Two packages worth a total of €20m have been delivered for pig farmers, while €3m has been delivered for the horticulture sector.
The minister established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee to provide advice and assistance to farmers throughout this period and he also established an Emergency Response Team in his own department to manage the impact.
Mr McConalogue said he would seek to bring forward a support package for beef and sheep farmers in particular who are most impacted by the rise in fertiliser prices, as well as protecting food security and staving off potential fodder shortages next winter.

Spiralling costs keeping Irish farmers up at night"
https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-40864616.html,2022-05-04 10:54:00,Farm View: Red vs white clover - let's weigh up your options,"Red clover swards sound like the perfect solution, as the rising price of fertiliser adds huge costs to Ireland's grass-based farming.
In Teagasc trials, red clover and perennial ryegrass sward without nitrogen fertiliser yielded 13 to 16 tonnes per hectare of dry matter, which is about the same yield as perennial ryegrass getting 600 kg per hectare of nitrogen.
With these figures, red clover may be nearly as good a feed crop as maize for intensive dairy or beef. However, there isn't much experience growing it in Ireland. According to Teagasc, it may be out of favour here because of farmers' fear of the unknown.
In contrast, it is often used on mixed arable and grassland farms in England and Belgium. Now, the changed situation with fertiliser may force farmers to switch to red clover for silage.
Teagasc recommends a red clover sward for a first cut silage cut in mid-May, and then at six or seven-week intervals. The advice is to cut silage at 5-6 cm, and carry out a 48-hour wilt or use an effective preservative. The sward must be zero-grazed or grazed with lighter stock such as heifers, in October or November.

Scheme to support planting of up to 12,000 hectares of multi-species swards
According to Nicky Byrne, Research Officer in Teagasc Grange, paddocks at Grange should yield 15-16 tonnes of dry matter per hectare in three cuts of silage, from slurry and P & K compound, without applying chemical nitrogen, because red clover is nitrogen-fixing.
However, red clover silage's productivity depends on the longevity of the sward, which can be improved by not using any nitrogen fertiliser, applying enough K fertiliser and lime, avoiding damage by machinery and grazing cattle, and post-emergence dock control after reseeding.
A per acre reseed pack should have 3-4kg of red clover, 6-9 kg of ryegrass, and 1 kg of white clover.
White clover is more persistent and can be over-sowed to maintain a 10-year productive sward after red clover dies out of the sward three or four years after reseeding. This approach has the inbuilt four-year rotation break needed for disease control. Otherwise, sclerotinia and stem eelworm can damage the sward. 
In fact, these diseases caused a widespread clover crop ""sickness"" in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s, which coincided with a large-scale transition to chemical fertiliser nitrogen use, leading to red clover going somewhat out of fashion. There were also problems with stem eelworm on dairy farms in Denmark in the late 2000s.
But the risk of stem eelworm and sclerotinia crop diseases is low for the time being in Ireland, according to Teagasc, if there is a four-year break between red clover crops, and disease-resistant cultivars are sown.
Farmers may also fear the risk of bloat caused by grazing red clover, but that is not a risk with red clover silage, according to Teagasc. It also has a high oestrogen content, which may be linked with lower conception rates in breeding ewes.
High-K silage (more than 2.5% K) increases the risk of milk fever, but inadequate K shortens the longevity of red clover swards. Something else to watch out for is the greater challenge in making high-quality silage from a red clover sward.
Much lower water-soluble carbohydrates (81 versus 213) and higher buffering capacity (472 versus 415) make clover silage more difficult to ensile, compared to ryegrass. Therefore, wilting or an effective preservative is needed. In Teagasc trials, 48-hour wilting worked well. But the verdict was that a third cut can be risky, and there is no hope of ensiling a fourth cut.

Signpost: Breeding for high-value milk rather than just volume
Compared to ryegrass silage, when red clover is included, digestibility was lower (74 versus 81) in Teagasc trials. Crude protein was similar. Higher dry matter intake compensates for the lower digestibility; cows perform very well on red clover silage, once allowances are not restricted.
Red clover can suit intensive dairy farms with higher stocking rates on the grazing platform, and greater reliance on silage production from out-blocks. The 10% nitrogen cut for derogation farmers, and the trend to 20% lower fertiliser use in the new CAP also bring red clover into the picture.
For red clover, you must apply enough lime to bring soil pH to over 6.5, and there is also a very high requirement for potash (K). A good red clover silage crop takes out 375 kg/ha (300 units/acre) of K. Apply P and K compounds in accordance with soil test results. Index 1 soils need 25kg of K and 3kg of P for every tonne of dry matter per hectare expected, applied as organic manure or mineral fertiliser.
There are obvious challenges with clover, but strong possibilities also, in view of the rising cost of fertiliser."

This time, it’s a substantial 87.5-acre farm at Tullabracky on the outskirts of Bruff, with road frontage onto the main Limerick Road and a secondary road.
The holding offers some excellent land and is described by selling agents GVM as a “truly outstanding roadside farm”.
“This is a really nice piece of ground,” says selling agent Tom Crosse of GVM Auctioneers in Limerick City. 
“With its extensive road frontage onto two public roads, it’s a nice valuable piece of land in the heart of the Golden Vale.”
There are no outbuildings going with the property, although there is a cattle crush. The real value here is in the limestone soil, with its renowned cattle-fattening qualities — ideal for a good range of farming activities, including dairying, beef, equestrian and hobby farming.
Limerick City is only a 20-minute drive away from this farm — something which may trigger a certain amount of interest from the non-farming or hobby-farming sector.
With a price guide of over €1,000,000 (€11,400/acre), it will be an interesting auction to observe on Thursday, May 19 at 3pm — online and at GVM’s offices on Glentworth Street, Limerick.

The lambs are being quoted at 790-800 cents/kg with the usual bonus payments for quality to be added. Suppliers are reporting that the going return from the factories is ranging between 810 and 820 cents/kg, which it is being claimed they are finding that they have to pay to get sufficient.
The balance between hoggets and spring lamb is changing each week. Some centres are reporting much stronger numbers of new season lamb coming out and a tightening in the intake of hoggets.
The processors are quoting 680-710 for the hoggets this week, which is largely unchanged from last week.
The live trade at Corrin Mart on Monday was largely similar to last week. Spring lambs sold for up to €122 over with a top price of €170 being paid and strong demand for all lots on offer.
There was 400 head on offer at Kilkenny Mart on Monday. The trade was a shade livelier than last week with butcher's lambs selling for up to €127 over.
There was a top price of €184 paid for a pen of three weighing 54 kgs. A pen of three weighing 49 kgs sold for €176 and a pen of five weighing 46 kgs made €174, while a pen of fifteen weighing 45 kgs sold for €169.
The factory lots were also in strong demand at up to €114 over.

Despite repeated calls from farmers and representative organisations for a ban to be restored as they struggle with input costs, Mr McConalogue said a prohibition will not be introduced as part of the legislation he is due to publish shortly and to bring through the Dáil in advance of the summer.
Mr McConalogue has assured that the new office that will be established will ""bring greater transparency all along the agricultural and food supply chain"".
“It will engage with retailers, processors, wholesalers, farmers, fishers, and others on matters affecting fairness and transparency in the supply chain,"" he said.
“The office will also, as the state’s designated Unfair Trading Practices Enforcement Authority, ensure that buyers in the agri-food supply chain do not implement unfair practices in their business-to-business relationships with their suppliers.” 
The UTP Regulations were signed into Irish law on April 28, 2021, and give effect to the provisions of the EU Directive on unfair trading practices.
Under these regulations, weaker suppliers are protected from unfair trading practices of stronger buyers and provide that complaints can be made within certain categories according to the annual turnover of a supplier compared to a buyer.
Mr McConalogue told a seminar held on the UTP Regulations in recent days that a ban on below-cost selling that was in place until the mid-2000s was removed at that stage “because it was felt not to be effective in actually achieving its objective”.
“The objective behind it initially was to protect primary producers but the reality of how it was actually working was found not necessarily to be doing that,” he said.
“The price that something is being sold for on the shelf does not necessarily change the relationship between the retailer and those who they were buying it off.
“It could actually only have the impact, for example, of improving the margins that are available for the actual retailer or potentially the processor, but not necessarily improve the margin that is there for the primary producer, because you’re still going to have very significant competitive pressures whereby they will seek to get the lowest price possible potentially from the primary producer.” 
He said that the experience in Ireland of having such a ban was that it “added more red tape and more cost ultimately to the consumer”.
This was because it was “costly to administer, difficult to administer as well, but didn’t actually result in the primary producer getting a better margin”.
“I have seen no one come forward or explain to me a process as to how [the ban] would impact in relation to primary producers getting a better margin,” Mr McConalogue said.
“Ultimately, anything I want to do here is about ensuring that primary producers are protected.
“90% of food [produced here] is sold abroad, we’re an exporting nation; that’s why our sector is so fantastic and why it creates so much employment but ultimately it means the milk, the beef, the lamb, etc, that we are selling is sold abroad in international markets and it’s those international markets which determine the end price on international restaurants, or international supermarkets.
“Even if we had price-setting potential within the country, you’re still talking only 10% of the overall produce.
“What we're aiming to do is ensure that the relationship and the respect that’s there for the primary producer is key to those relationships and that’s what I think the new office needs to focus on and try and achieve.” 
Nigel Sweetnam, the poultry chairman of the Irish Farmers’ Association who had queried Mr McConalogue at the event on below-cost selling, told the Irish Examiner that in engagement following the meeting, the agriculture minister said he is committed to taking steps that create a situation “where the producer would be guaranteed a margin”.
Mr Sweetnam said the IFA will come forward with a contribution toward the legislation, and speaking about the establishment of the new office for fairness and transparency, he said ""bring it on, the sooner the better"" as ""costs are going up the whole time"".
Findings of surveys commissioned by the interim UTP enforcement authority that is currently in place were presented at the seminar, with Mr McConalogue describing some of them as “striking”.
The survey found that producers have concerns about coming forward to make complaints about unfair trading practices due to the ""fear factor"" of larger buyers.
The survey showed that half of producer respondents claimed to have heard of the UTP Regulations.
One in four primary producers said they have been subjected to an unfair trading practice.
Three in 10 raised the issue with the buyer while one in five contacted member associations. 
The main reasons cited for not raising the issue are that it is ‘common practice’ in the sector, along with the fear of some retaliation from the buyer, and that they were not sure what the right authority was.
Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture Martin Heydon said at the Fine Gael special conference on agriculture and rural development in Tullamore on Saturday that the new office is “very much geared towards shining a light into areas where particularly farmers are frustrated with the lack of transparency”.
“This is a meaningful body with serious teeth,” Mr Heydon told the Irish Examiner.
“We look forward to having that in place in these coming months."""

You could have a higher than average earnings but creche fees, a car loan, and high rent which would result in a low disposable income. The more that we feel the price increases across energy, fuel for our cars, rent (or mortgage), the less money families will have to pay for groceries. Or that families will be faced with having to make decisions about which bill is more important.

That’s €6.35 extra we have to find every week to buy the same groceries we bought last year and that’s before the additional money we need to find from an ever diminishing pot to pay for utility increases etc.
I’m combatting these price increases at home by making my meals ‘stretchy’ and adding extra ingredients to sauces to make them go further. A tin of chickpeas in the beef cheek ragout featured this week makes the meal stretch from feeding a family of four for dinner to feeding them twice (makes enough for another day). A tin of some form of beans is my fallback when I’m cooking sauces and I’m always trying to figure out where I can fit them in to make the most of my cooking time and effort.
Likewise, I’m plumping up my dried fruit with a little tea or orange juice before baking and adding either some ripe bananas or grated apples to my granola bars. Not only does the added fruit make the granola bars go further but it also increases the fruit and fibre intake for those who eat them.
Bargain Spotting
Always checking the label is a good motto to stick by and SuperValu this week is a great example of this. 750g of beef mince is only €3. However, a double mince pack is €6 and each package weighs 500g, making it more economical to buy two €3 packets of mince to get 50% extra meat.
The price of butter is rising while milk is staying the same.
Butter price on the up
Lidl remains the cheapest shop to buy your butter at €1.49 per half a pound. All the other supermarkets cost at least €1.65 per half pound and Tesco prices just rose in the past week to €1.79 per half pound and a whopping €2.99 for a pound of butter. Unfortunately, this price increase is going to be mirrored across the supermarkets in the coming weeks due to pressure on dairy prices. Thankfully the cost of a litre of milk is still fixed at 85c for now.
Spilling the tea
I am well aware that there are deep-rooted loyalties when it comes to your chosen brand of tea. So, without getting into a debate about whether Lyons or Barry's is better, I have looked into both options. 160 Lyons teabags are reduced to €4 in Dunnes Stores this week while the original green box Barry's is reduced to €6 for 160 teabags. Both of which are the cheapest prices to be found for the respective teas, whatever your preference is.
Slow cooker beef cheek ragout
recipe by:
Caitriona Redmond 
This recipe is perfectly suited to long slow cooking or a blast in the pressure cooker. Either way, the beef cheek needs a steady amount of heat and a decent stretch to tenderise

Ingredients
1 trimmed beef cheek
1 large onion, chopped
2 peppers, chopped
2 sticks of celery, chopped
1 tin of chopped tomatoes
4-5 cloves  garlic, crushed (more or less if you prefer)
1 tsp each salt, white pepper, paprika, sugar, and dried oregano
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
Method
Combine all the ingredients in the slow cooker pot and stir well. Cook on high for 8 hours or until the beef cheek is fall-apart tender. If cooking in a pressure cooker this dish will take about 2 hours.

Ingredients
75g coconut oil
75g soft brown sugar
50g maple syrup
50g raisins (chopped dried apriocots or figs are fine too)
250g rolled oats (make sure these are gluten free if you are catering for a gluten free diet)
2 black bananas (if you have a banana allergy or none in the house you can use 2 eating apples)
Method
Preheat a (fan) oven to 170℃.
Put the oil, maple syrup, and sugar in a large saucepan & heat until the ingredients are melted together. Stir in the raisins and oats then stir well so that everything is coated in the mixture. 
Skin and mash the 2 bananas (or roughly grate 2 eating apples including the skin), then add the fruit to the oat mixture. Stir again so that it’s well combined.  Press the mixture into a 15cm square brownie tin. I line mine with baking parchment to stop things getting too messy and for easy serving.
Put the tin in the oven for 15-20 minutes. Once they start to turn golden brown on top, remove and allow to cool for 30 minutes before using a knife to impress the flapjack shapes on top of the mixture.  Wait until fully cool before breaking into the pieces you’ve impressed using the knife.

Recipe Notes
Try soaking the raisins in about 200ml of orange juice or steep in a cup of tea for an hour or two before making these granola bars. It stops the raisins from drying out when baking and adds a little extra flavour.
This recipe is plant based and allergy friendly. To make it gluten free make sure you buy certified gluten free oats and be careful of cross contamination in the kitchen.
If you’re concerned about the sugar content remove the maple syrup and use both bananas and grated apples instead.

The question of what we should eat to combat climate change and environmental degradation has never been more urgent. However, the term sustainable has become quite a buzzword, bandied around and abused in many different contexts — all very confusing.
Having a better understanding of what makes food sustainable could help us all to make more informed food choices. Sustainable food is not just about the food itself, it’s a combination of factors. How it’s produced, distributed, packaged and consumed (or wasted). Sustainable farming practices, environmental impact, animal welfare, biodiversity, working conditions and a living wage are all factors.
Intensive agricultural food production systems are responsible for 11-20% of all greenhouse gases depending on which research one references. Sustainable agriculture on the other hand supports organic, regenerative farming and low carbon food production methods including crop rotation and avoids the use of artificial fertilisers, pesticides as well as GM organisms.
A lot to think about in our busy lives.
As we navigate the aisles of the supermarket, our decisions are usually based on price, convenience, maybe taste. But in the words of Margaret Visser, ‘much depends on dinner’. Our food choices and every bite we put in our mouths has consequences on our health and the health of our planet, awareness is growing but time is fast running out.
I’m convinced that each of us genuinely wants to make a difference so we can pass on a liveable planet to the generations who follow us. Here are a few tips to help us source more mindfully and live more sustainably.
1. Choose foods that are in season — less air miles, no need for artificial ripening.
2. Seek out meat, dairy and eggs from less intensive production systems.
3. Spend a little more and pay a fair price to support local farmers and food producers who farm sustainably and trade fairly.
4. Support your local Farmers Market, a NeighbourFood branch neighbourfood.ie and/or join a vegetable box scheme then the money goes directly to the producer to enable them to continue. The greatest threat to food security is the low and often below-cost price of food at the farm gate.
5. Grow some of your own food: herbs, vegetables, fruit. If you have the space, plant a few currant and berry bushes, a couple of apple trees which go on giving year after year and create habitats for birds and pollinating insects. Plant a bee-friendly garden.
6. Reduce the amount of plastic packaging and continue to lobby for less. Packaging is so energy-intensive to make and recycle.
7. Learn to use up leftovers so you can work towards Zero Waste. Think nose-to-tail eating and use every scrap of each vegetable.
8. Get a few hens. Three or four in a movable chicken coup in your garden will eat up your food scraps, provide you with enough eggs for all your needs and chicken manure for your compost heap to make your soil more fertile.
9. Make stock from meat, fish bones and vegetables as a basis for soups, stews and tagines.
10. Use every scrap of each vegetable, cauliflower — roast the leaves as well as the curds. Use the fresh radish leaves in salads and soups, really delicious. The stalks and leaves of beets as well as the roots themselves.

Ingredients
72 mussels or 700g (1 1/2lbs) monkfish in neat collops
A 2.5cm (1 inch) piece of fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
8 cloves of peeled garlic
110ml (4fl oz) of water
4 tablespoons of vegetable oil
200g (7oz) onion, peeled and chopped
1-2 fresh chilies, sliced into fine rounds
1/2 teaspoon of turmeric
2 teaspoons of ground cumin
1 1/2 tins (600ml/1 pint) of coconut milk
Salt
Fresh coriander leaves
Method
Wash the mussels, removing any loose beards. Put the ginger, garlic and water into a blender and blend to a smooth purée.
Heat the oil in a large pot and add the onions. Cook until translucent.
Add the ginger and garlic purée, chillies, turmeric and cumin. Stir and cook for a minute.
Add the coconut milk and a pinch of salt and bring to a boil. This broth can now be put aside for later.
When you want to serve the dish, put the mussels into the pan with the broth. Cover and place on a moderate heat and allow to come to the boil. Shake the pan occasionally and cook for approx. 6 minutes.
Check to see that all the mussels have popped open. Serve immediately with lots of fresh coriander leaves.
If using monkfish, bring the broth to the boil and add the collops of monkfish. If using any of the other suggested fish, cut into 5cm (2 inch) pieces.
Cover and simmer gently for approximately 5 minutes or until the fish is just cooked. It will no longer look opaque but will have a white and creamy appearance.
Serve in deep bowls garnished with coriander leaves.
